Chris McNaghten and Jon Swan were married at a wedding venue in Larne, County Antrim, on Saturday, by Pastor Steve Ames. It followslegislation introduced by the Northern Ireland Office in July. ""For most people, your wedding day is known as being the best day of your life - for us, it's a dream come true that growing up we thought we would never have,"" said Mr McNaughten. He said his ""praise goes out to all those involved in this battle for equality over the years"". The couple had been forced to cancel their previous wedding plans twice due to coronavirus restrictions. On Saturday they were joined by their close friends and family aftera relaxation of restrictions. Same-sex marriagehas been legally recognised in Northern Ireland since Januarybut did not extend to ceremonies in churches or to religious bodies. The new law will protect religious freedom and churches will not be ""compelled nor prevented"" from offering same-sex ceremonies. Mr McNaghten said: ""Jon and I wouldn't see ourselves as having strong religious beliefs. ""However, our family minister is someone with whom we are close and trust, and some of our family take comfort from a religious ceremony."" Civil partnership conversion for landmark gay couple First same-sex marriage in NI Director of Amnesty International in Northern Ireland, Patrick Corrigan, said it has been a ""momentous week"" for equal marriage.

Five-day Christmas relaxation period 'a mistake',"Professor of Public Health Linda Bauld said the UK loosening rules over Christmas is a mistake Loosening Covid restrictions across the UK over Christmas is a ""mistake,"" a public health expert has said. Edinburgh University's Prof Linda Bauld said there was concern about people travelling from ""high to low prevalence areas"" to see their loved ones. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said changes would cause ""huge issues about trust"", but could happen if case rates stayed high. The UK has recorded another 519 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Thelatest government figures,externalalso include 21,502 new positive cases in the UK, taking the total number in the past seven days to 124,988. On Saturday, the number ofpositive Covid tests in Wales surpassed 100,000, one day after the country reportedits highest case rates since the pandemic began. How many cases in my area? Have we become bored of following the rules? Post-Christmas lockdown warning for Wales Up to three households can stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, as agreed by all four UK nations. Prof Bauld told BBC Breakfast that ""from a public health perspective, I have to be perfectly honest, I think this is a mistake and I think people, even though we're permitted to do this, I think people have to think very carefully whether they can see loved ones outside or do it in a very, very modest way"". She added there was ""nothing to stop"" governments reversing the rules, ""but the problem is they've made that commitment to people across the UK, and that may affect trust in government if they roll back on that"". Mr Gething said ""of course we could"" change the rules around Christmas, but ""much of what we have done during the course of the pandemic is because people have trusted the government - when we said things we kept our word"". He said was concerned a change in rules now would have people ""completely ignoring the rules"", and was worried that may be the case even with the current five-day relaxation agreement in place. ""That's why we are anticipating an increase after Christmas, we expect there'll be an increase after New Year's Eve as well,"" he added. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, earlier this week warned people to be ""very, very sensible"" and not go ""too far"" over Christmas, which he called a ""very risky period"". According the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which feeds into UK government decision-making - just because people can meet up, it does not mean they should. This video can not be played This map shows how cases per 100,000 people across the 22 council areas in Wales have changed by day over the last two months Mr Gething said he would not rule out another lockdown if cases continued to rise,echoing a warning made by First Minister Mark Drakefordon Friday. He added: ""But the agreement around the Christmas period isn't just a political settlement. It really is because we understand that sort of shape to that period of time, we might see many people make up their own rules with the real potential of even greater harm. ""So it isn't as simple as saying 'this is just a political choice, and you could make it safer' because actually a lot of people invest lots of time, energy and effort in Christmas in travelling around the UK to see family when they don't do that in the rest of the year. ""Now we have to take account of the reality of the position as well and what would like to happen, how we want people to behave."" A UK government spokesperson said this year won't be ""a 'normal' Christmas"", but people would want to be with loved ones. ""Meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgement, and we must be mindful of the risks, particularly to vulnerable individuals,"" the spokesperson said. ""Everyone has a role to play by remembering hands, face, space and keeping indoor spaces well ventilated to limit the spread of the virus and protect our loved ones.""

Hundreds missing after Nigeria school attack,"This video can not be played Bint'a Ismail: ""I have a child and younger brother who've been taken"" Hundreds of students are feared missing after gunmen raided a secondary school in north-western Nigeria. The attackers arrived on motorbikes and started shooting into the air, causing people to flee, witnesses said. They targeted the Government Science Secondary School - where more than 800 students are said to reside - in Katsina state on Friday evening. On Saturday, the military said it had located the gunmen's hideout in a forest and exchanged gunfire with them. The outcome was unclear but officials said there were no reports of students being injured. Meanwhile, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attack and ordered the school to carry out a full audit of students to find out how many are missing. Parents who dashed to the school to take their children home were also asked to notify the school authorities. Residents living near the all-boys boarding school in the Kankara area told the BBC they heard gunfire at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and that the attack lasted for more than an hour. Security personnel at the school managed to repel some of the attackers before police reinforcements arrived, officials said. In a statement on Saturday, police said that during an exchange of fire, some of the gunmen were forced to retreat. Students were able to scale the fence of the school and run to safety, they said. About 200 students who had fled - and were initially deemed missing - later returned. However, witnesses said they saw a number of students being taken away by the gunmen. The Nigerian town that lost its girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings Chibok girl's life with Boko Haram in Nigeria This video can not be played Inside abducted Chibok girls' school in Nigeria One police officer was taken to hospital after being shot and wounded, police said. Several local residents on Saturday said they had joined the police in searching for the students who remained missing, while many parents said they had withdrawn their children from the school. ""The school is deserted, all the students have vacated,"" one witness, Nura Abdullahi, told AFP news agency. ""Some of the students who escaped returned to the town this morning, but others took a bus home,"" he added. The governor of Katsina, Aminu Bello Massari, has ordered the immediate closure of all boarding schools in the state. Katsina is the home state of President Buhari, who is currently there for a week-long private visit. ""I strongly condemn the cowardly bandits' attack on innocent children at the Science School, Kankara,"" he said in a statement. ""Our prayers are with the families of the students, the school authorities and the injured."" The attack on Friday came two days after the kidnapping of a village leader and 20 others in another part of the state. In 2014, more than 270 girls were kidnapped by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram from a school in the north-eastern Nigerian town of Chibok. No group has yet said it carried out the raid on the school in Katsina, which is far from Boko Haram's usual area of operation in the north-east.

Merlin's beard! Harry Potter book sells for Â£68kThe first editions of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone initially sold for Â£10.99 in 1997.,"The first editions initially sold for Â£10.99 when printed in 1997 A first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has fetched a magical Â£68,000 at auction. The issue was among 500 hardback copies printed in 1997, before JK Rowling's fantasy saga soared to global success. Another first edition,which nearly sold for 50pin a car boot sale, drew Â£50,000 in an online auction at Hansons Auctioneers in Staffordshire on Friday. A library copy featuring date stamps sold for Â£19,000, while a fourth sold for Â£17,500. The issues were among the first 500 hardback copies printed, of which 300 were sent to schools and libraries. At the time those copies were selling for Â£10.99. Charlotte Rumsey initially put a copy found in her mother's box of unwanted things in a 50p box for a car boot sale in July. But after watching Antiques Roadshow, she asked her mother, from Blackpool, to check the copy with Hansons Auctioneers. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe appeared in the films between 2001 and 2011 On finding out the book was a first edition, a ""delighted"" Ms Rumsey said she ""couldn't stop hopping about"". The copy was one of the rarer 200 that went to shops and sold for Â£50,000. The bride-to-be has previously said she plans to split the money between her wedding and her mother's new home.

More tier 3 areas to get mass testing from Monday,"The rapid tests have already been used by universities before students head home for Christmas Mass testing programmes like the one trialled in Liverpool are to be rolled out in 67 tier three areas of England, with the first starting on Monday. More than 1.6 million of the rapid lateral flow tests will be delivered for community testing this month, the government said. The programme will last six weeks. But concerns have previously been raised about the lateral flow tests, with experts warning they can give false negative results. More areas will be involved in the rollout of testing in the new year. Those involved in this first wave will receive government support for at least six weeks, the Department for Health and Social Care said. It is hoped the testing initiative, along with existing measures, could help lead to an easing of restrictions in tier three areas. The community testing is in addition to schemes run by local directors of public health. They have been able to request a set number of lateral flow tests to be used in their area, regardless of tier, since early November. Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? NHS rapid test use defended amid accuracy concerns Health Secretary Matt Hancock said theenhanced testing programmesfollow the mass testing pilot in Liverpool and were a ""vital additional tool"" in finding asymptomatic cases. It is thought as many as one in three cases of coronavirus could be in people who have no symptoms. However, preliminary data released on Friday by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested the rapid coronavirus tests rolled out in Liverpool missed about 51% of all Covid-19 cases. Aseparate mass testing schemefor secondary school-aged pupils in London, Essex and Kent was announced earlier this week. Liverpool has taken part in a mass testing programme Earlier this month, Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, said the tests were a ""game changer"" and had helped find Covid-19 infections in people that would otherwise have been missed, because they had no symptoms. An evaluation by Oxford University and Public Health England workers at Porton Down previously concluded the test has an overall sensitivity of 76.8%. It detects almost all cases where patients have a high viral load, however. Among the 67 areas taking part in the testing programme isOldham, Greater Manchester, where the increased access to testing will initially focus on schools and colleges, along with those in higher-risk supported living accommodation, and health and social care staff. InKirklees, West Yorkshire, high-risk workplaces will be among those focused on first. And inLancashire, large manufacturing sites and workplaces with staff of more than 200 will be prioritised. Local authorities inKent- said to be seeing a ""worrying"" rise in cases - are also in the first wave of areas taking part in the testing. A full list of the areas involved in this first rollout can be foundhere,external. Mr Hancock said: ""Community testing will be very important in helping the areas where levels of the virus are highest to drive down infection rates and, ultimately, will help areas ease tougher restrictions. ""This is just the start, and we are working quickly to roll out community testing more widely as soon as more local teams are ready. I urge all those living in areas where community testing is offered to come forward and get tested.""

US Covid vaccinations to begin on Monday,"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The US public will start receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine from Monday after it was authorised for emergency use, officials say. The first three million doses of the vaccine would be shipped ""across all states"" this weekend, said Gen Gustave Perna, who is overseeing distribution. The vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 and was deemed safe by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On Saturday, the US recorded a daily toll of 3,309 Covid-related deaths. The figure,reported on the Johns Hopkins University website,external, is the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world. This video can not be played Gen Gustave Perna: ""I am absolutely 100 per cent confident that we are going to distribute safely this precious commodity"" Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US. Authorising the emergency use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Friday, the FDA - which had come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to do so - said the move was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic. Amass inoculation driveusing doses of the same vaccine has already begun in the UK. Can people with allergies have the Covid vaccine? US faces bleak winter amid worst virus wave yet Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US During a news conference on Saturday, Gen Perna - speaking for the US government's vaccination campaign Operation Warp Speed - said doses of the vaccine would be packed into shipping containers for transportation ""within the next 24 hours"". ""Expect 145 sites across the states to receive the vaccine on Monday, another 425 sites on Tuesday, and the final 66 sites on Wednesday,"" he said, adding that next week's distribution would complete the initial delivery of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and cover about three million people. Gen Perna told reporters he was ""100% confident"" that the doses ""needed to defeat the enemy Covid"" would be transported safely. He warned, however, that while it had been a week of progress, ""we are not done until every American has access to a vaccine"". The Pfizer vaccine has already received regulatory approval in the UK, Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Like those countries, US health authorities are expected to prioritise health workers and care home residents for the first doses. More Americans outside the highest-priority groups are likely to be able to get the vaccine in January, with general availability expected by April. ""The FDA's authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,"" the head of the agency, Stephen Hahn, said. He said the authorisation came after ""an open and transparent review process"" that ensured the vaccine met the ""FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality"". The FDA's Stephen Hahn said he was ready to be vaccinated (file photo) On Thursday, medical experts advising the FDA recommended the emergency-use authorisation. A 23-member panel concluded the vaccine's benefits outweighed its risks. Emergency use, the FDA said, was not the same as full approval, which would require Pfizer to file a separate application to secure. US media reported that Mr Hahn had earlier been told to approve the vaccine for emergency use by Friday or quit. Mr Hahn, however, said the reports were ""untrue"" and stressed that the agency had not compromised safety in its testing. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. The vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures, which makes distribution difficult. Special shipping containers that use dry ice will be used to transport frozen vials direct to the point of vaccination, Pfizer says. The pharmaceutical company has agreed a deal to supply the US with 100 million doses of the vaccine by March. An additional 200 million doses of a second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, will be provided by June. However this vaccine is still seeking approval in the US.

"Relaxing Covid rules 'could trigger third wave'NHS bosses urge ""extreme caution"" over moving areas to lower tiers when England's measures are reviewed.Health","People must think ""really carefully"" about the risk of more social contact over Christmas, NHS bosses have warned. ""I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" said Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers. But he pointed out that the US saw ""record numbers"" of cases and deaths after the Thanksgiving holiday - and said the NHS was worried about January. The government's Dominic Raab said people needed the five-day relaxation of Covid rules on ""an emotional level"". Meanwhile, the chances of the Oxford University vaccine being rolled out by the end of the year are ""pretty high"", the vaccine's architect Prof Sarah Gilbert has told the BBC. A further 18,447 cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with another 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths recorded tends to be lower over the weekend because of reporting delays. UK coronavirus cases up by 21,502 on Saturday Find out the rules where you live Between 23 and 27 December, coronavirus restrictions are being relaxed across the UK, allowing three householdsto form a ""bubble""and mix indoors and stay overnight. But NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England - has written to the PM urging him to ""personally lead a better public debate about the risks inherent in the guidance"" - although it stopped short of calling for a review of the rules over Christmas. ""There seems to be a sense at the moment that, 'hey because the government's put these rules down, there's no risk to people having more social contact over Christmas',"" Mr Hopson told BBC Breakfast. ""Of course, part of it is about sticking to the rules but any kind of extra social contact over Christmas - particularly with those who are vulnerable to the virus - actually is very risky."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus ""I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas, I really don't, but I think everybody needs to think really, really carefully what are they going to do over Christmas,"" he said. ""It's not, 'is what we're going to be doing sticking within the rules?' It's 'how much risk are we going to cause to the people we interact with?'"" The rise in infections in the US after the Thanksgiving holiday was also highlighted by NHS Providers. The NHS is worried about the potential pressure on hospital beds, and its ability to treat all the patients it needs to in December, January and February, Mr Hopson said. ""At the same time you've got rising infections in places like London, Essex, parts of Kent, parts of Lincolnshire,"" he added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out any possibility that the government would review the Christmas relaxation of rules. Speaking to Sky News's Sophy Ridge programme on Sunday, he said: ""I think people do need that five-day window over Christmas to spend a bit of time with their loved ones and I think at a mental health level, an emotional level, people do need it."" It comes afterpublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld saidloosening Covid restrictions over Christmas was ""a mistake"". Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething said the rules around Christmas could be changed - but it could affect trust in the government. NHS Providers also warned that relaxing Covid rules when they are reviewed in England could trigger a third wave of the virus during the busiest time of year for hospitals. England'sthree-tier systemis due to be reviewed on Wednesday 16 December. It urged the PM against moving any area to a lower tier and said areas should be moved into tier three - the highest level of restrictions -  ""as soon as this is needed, without any delay"". Earlier this week,some health experts called for London to be placed in tier three ""now""after official figures showed Outer London had a higher infection rate than some areas already in the top tier. The government said it ""will not hesitate to take necessary actions to protect local communities"". Decisions on tiers are made by ministers, based on the latest available data and advice from public health experts, a spokesperson added. ""We have introduced strengthened local restrictions to protect the progress gained during national restrictions, reduce pressure on the NHS and ultimately save lives,"" they said. ""On top of our record NHS investment, this winter we are providing an extra Â£3bn to maintain independent sector and Nightingale hospital surge capacity and a further Â£450m to upgrade and expand A&Es."" THREE TIERS:How does the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Meanwhile, Prof Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, was upbeat when asked about the possibility of people receiving the Oxford jab by the end of the year. The vaccine has not yet been approved by the UK's regulator, buta study this week showedit was safe and effective. ""I think the chances are pretty high,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""But we do need multiple vaccines, all countries need multiple vaccines, the world needs multiple vaccines and we need vaccines made using different technologies, if that's possible.""

"'We went to relax in the sun, but we're just stressed'","A smiling Steve in Gran Canaria before the government's travel corridor announcement ""We have paid the best part of Â£2,000, we thought it was worth the investment for a relaxing week in the sun but we're flying back stressed,"" says Steve Jennings, from Liverpool. The retired chief executive was on holiday in Gran Canaria when he heardthe news that the government had changedthe quarantine rules for the Canary Islands. From Saturday morning, anyone returning to the UK from the islands has to self-isolate. Althoughthe quarantine period is being cutto 10 days from next week, anyone who doesn't get back in the next few days could see their Christmas plans at risk. What are the quarantine rules? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? For Steve, 61, the news left him anxious as he scrabbled to find out how he and his partner Lynn - who has hospital appointments booked next week - could avoid the quarantine. ""It leaves us totally confused and anxious,"" he said. ""It tends to ruin the end of the holiday."" Like many, Steve is pinning his hopes onthe government's new testing scheme,externalwhich lets travellers to England cut their quarantine by half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. But the scheme - called test-to-release - doesn't launch until Tuesday and the list of approved providers has not been published yet. ""The thing that brasses me off [is] you like to be proud of your government and civil service,"" he says. ""This [scheme] is due to be launched on Tuesday, here we are still with no details."" For other Brits in the Canaries, the pressure is on to make sure they're back in the UK with enough time to quarantine before Christmas, so their festive plans aren't ruined. ""I was extremely stressed on Thursday,"" says David Evans, 23, a DJ living and working in Fuerteventura. ""From when I got home from work at 6/7pm, I didn't do anything until 1am except talk to family members, talking to work, to my housemate, trying to work out what to do."" David DJs in clubs and on the beach, and says he has around five gigs next week He is due to fly back to Brighton next week and plans to get a test, ahead of hopefully seeing his parents and nan at Christmas. ""I already have some gigs lined up so can't come back any earlier,"" he says. David says he thinks the Canary Islands should be treated individually by the UK government when it comes to quarantine rules. The government has said data suggests cases are rising in the Canaries, but David points out the number of cases in Fuerteventura is lower than in other islands. ""I'd like to see them separate the islands as Tenerife seems to be the problem,"" he says. ""They've done this with the Greek islands, why not the same for the Canaries?"" Keith Baldwin, from Liverpool, agrees and has emailed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ask why the islands aren't being treated separately. ""Tenerife is right off the scale with Covid. Lanzarote's a bit high. But Gran Canaria is right down,"" says Keith, who is in Gran Canaria. ""Work's not going to be happy [if I have to isolate]. I'm a support worker and we're short as it is."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? The Foreign Office has not changed its travel advice for the Canary Islands, meaning many holidaymakers who were due to go on holiday may be unable to seek refunds or claim on their travel insurance policies as companies will not cancel bookings. One such holidaymaker was Kathy Hemingway, from East Yorks, who was due to fly to Fuerteventura on Saturday. She paid Â£170 to get Covid tests done on top of her holiday, which she can't get a refund for from Tui as the FCO have not changed the travel advice rules. ""We can move our booking,"" she adds. ""We have to pluck a date out of the air. We have no idea when it will be safe to travel."" Kathy had already changed her holiday destination twice, from Mexico to Lanzarote, then to Fuerteventura Other holidaymakers have highlighted how safe they feel in the Canaries. Everyone aged six and overmust provide a negative test,externalwhen arriving into Spain, and when checking in to tourist accommodation in the Canaries. ""I feel safer in Tenerife than I do back in Scotland,"" says Philip Knight, who has been on holiday with his partner Luke in Tenerife, but flew back two days early on Friday. Philip says he fears the impact this will have on the local economy ""I, and every other holiday-maker had to get a Covid-19 test before coming here,"" he says. ""Everyone must wear a mask at all times (in the street etc), there are no exemptions unless a doctor provides a certificate. Everyone obeys this. ""There is a curfew at 11pm which is enforced strictly by the police and respected by the residents and tourists. Everyone must be in their property and remain there till 6am. ""The island is quiet with no crowds  and only groups of four. ""The UK government has therefore made me return to the UK which has a higher rate of infection with less protection (i.e. no masks and no curfew),"" adds Philip, a partner in an Edinburgh law firm. Lee Rowell-Burton, from Manchester, says he and his wife ""have had no personal contact with anyone"" since arriving in Fuerteventura to fix a problem at their apartment. ""We took a private PCR test on 7 December to get here, costing Â£120 each, which both came back negative. ""Now we have to either self-isolate or take another test, at our own expense, after five days. Another test? That's another Â£120 we don't have. I'm supposed to be back to work on Monday."" ""It's so safe here,"" says Lee, in Fuerteventura He adds: ""We are both extremely careful as we both have lost relatives to Covid-19 and are on one of the safest Canary Islands to visit, and only for five nights, yet still are having to self-isolate on our return? Ridiculous."" The news of the quarantine change came on Thursday,in a tweet by Mr Shapps,externalwho said data indicated weekly cases and positive tests were increasing. The government has previously said that decisions about which places go on or off the list are based on a range of factors, not just case rates. The Department for Transport said in a statement on Saturday the government had been ""consistently clear"" that it would take action rapidly if the public health risk became too high. ""Throughout the outbreak, all our decisions have been based on the best scientific evidence,"" it said. ""Any emerging evidence is continually monitored and considered in the government's policy making."" When the test-to-release scheme opens on Tuesday, anyone already self-isolating after travelling to the UK is able to book in a test. What to do if you have Covid How are travel rules being relaxed?

How will the UK jab millions of people?,"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Zodiac Killer cipher cracked after half a century,"San Francisco police published sketches of the suspect in 1969 Code-breakers have cracked a 340-character cipher 51 years after it was purportedly sent to the San Francisco Chronicle by the so-called Zodiac Killer, the FBI has confirmed. The killer, who was never caught, murdered five people in stabbings and shootings that terrorised the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s. The message was one of several sent to newspapers during the killing spree. The code was solved by three people from the US, Belgium and Australia. ""I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice (sic) all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me,"" the decrypted message reads, without throwing any light on the killer's identity. In a video posted on YouTube, Virginia web-designer David Oranchak says he cracked the cipher along with Australian applied mathematician Sam Blake and Belgian Jarl Van Eycke, a warehouse manager and code-breaking software engineer.

The message, which Mr Oranchak described as ""more of the same attention-seeking junk from Zodiac"", consists of rows of capital letters and symbols.

This is not the first encoded message attributed to the killer,according the San Francisco Chronicle,external. Two others remain to be decoded - one of which may contain the killer's name. The series of murders began in December 1968 with a man and a woman shot dead in their car. In July 1969, another man and woman were shot, but he survived. Later that year, a man and woman - a couple - were stabbed next to a lake. Only the man survived. In October 1969, a cab driver was shot dead in San Francisco. The killer, who has never been charged or identified, claimed to have murdered 37 people in letters to newspapers, but investigators have worked on the basis of seven victims in total, five of them homicides. The murders inspired two films - 2007's Zodiac, featuring Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal, and Dirty Harry in 1971 starring Clint Eastwood as a tough San Francisco detective.

Supreme Court rejects Trump-backed election lawsuit,"The US Supreme Court has rejected an unprecedented attempt to throw out election results in four battleground states that was backed by President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed this week by the state of Texas, sought to invalidate results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President-elect Joe Biden won all four. The lawsuit was supported by 18 state attorneys general and 106 Republican members of Congress. But in a brief order rejecting the bid, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Texas did not have legal standing to bring the case. Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? The ruling represents a setback for Mr Trump, who has previously suggested without evidence that the result of November's presidential election would be settled in the Supreme Court. The court rejected a separate legal challenge against Mr Biden's victory in Pennsylvaniaearlier this week, dismissing it in a one-sentence ruling. Mr Trump has made repeated unsubstantiated assertions that ""illegal votes"" cost him a second presidential term. Since the election, Mr Trump and his supporters have launched dozens of lawsuits questioning the results of the election. None have come close to overturning Mr Biden's victory. The Democratic candidate defeated Mr Trump by a margin of 306 to 232 votes in the US electoral college, which chooses the US president. Mr Biden won seven million more votes than the president nationwide. The electoral college is expected to meet on Monday to formally elect Mr Biden as the 46th president of the US. The Supreme Court, as expected by most legal experts, wanted nothing to do with Texas's challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election. The ruling was slightly longer than the one-sentence ""motion denied"" response in a Pennsylvania case earlier this week. Two of the nine Supreme Court justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, said they wouldn't have dismissed the lawsuit outright. But even they would not express a view on whether Texas's attempt to throw out millions of votes and effectively hand the presidency to Mr Trump had merit. The decision paves the way for the members of the electoral college to meet in state capitals across the US on Monday. At that point, the door to Mr Trump's legal challenges to the election will slam closed. And while his supporters may try a last-ditch effort to block Mr Biden's victory in Congress in January, those political manoeuvres are destined to fail. Democrats will make sure of that. The implications of this challenge, however, are unlikely to quickly fade away. Eighteen states and more than 100 Republicans in Congress endorsed discarding the results of the election and putting the White House in the hands of state legislatures. That is something Democrats - and the history books - won't soon forget. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by the Republican Attorney-General of Texas, Ken Paxton - an ally of Mr Trump. It was supported by the president, who on Wednesday filed a motion to intervene and become a plaintiff in the case. The lawsuit sought to discard the presidential election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, four crucial states won by Mr Biden. Texas alleged that the results in those states were unlawful because of changes to voting procedures to help Americans cast their ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Mr Paxton's lawsuit asked the Supreme Court to allow the legislatures of those states - which are all controlled by Republicans - to determine who should get their electoral college votes. But on Thursday, the four states in a filing asked the justices to reject the lawsuit, which they said had no legal grounds. The Supreme Court agreed. ""Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognisable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections,"" the court said in its ruling. Before the ruling, legal experts were sceptical of the lawsuit's chances of success. But just hours before the ruling, Mr Trump appeared optimistic, urging the Supreme Court to show ""great Wisdom and Courage"". The court failed to do so, Mr Trump later wrote in a tweet bemoaning the verdict. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""There's no way to say it other than they dodged,"" said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, referring to the judges.  ""They dodged, they hid behind procedure, and they refused to use their authority to enforce the constitution."" A spokesman for Mr Biden said it was ""no surprise"" the Supreme Court rejected ""baseless attempts"" to deny Mr Trump lost the election. ""Our nation's highest court saw through this seditious abuse of our electoral process,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat,said on Twitter,external. Dana Nessel, Michigan's Democratic attorney general, said the ruling was ""an important reminder that we are a nation of laws, and though some may bend to the desire of a single individual, the courts will not"". The tone was gloomier among Republicans. The chairman of the Republican Party in Texas, Allen West, said the court's decision would have ""far-reaching ramifications for the future of our constitutional republic"". ""Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution,""he said in a statement,external.

First same-sex religious wedding in NI,"Chris McNaghten and Jon Swan are the first same-sex couple to have a religious wedding ceremony in NI The first same-sex religious wedding in Northern Ireland has taken place. Chris McNaghten and Jon Swan were married at a wedding venue in Larne, County Antrim, on Saturday, by Pastor Steve Ames. It followslegislation introduced by the Northern Ireland Office in July. ""For most people, your wedding day is known as being the best day of your life - for us, it's a dream come true that growing up we thought we would never have,"" said Mr McNaughten. He said his ""praise goes out to all those involved in this battle for equality over the years"". The couple had been forced to cancel their previous wedding plans twice due to coronavirus restrictions. On Saturday they were joined by their close friends and family aftera relaxation of restrictions. Same-sex marriagehas been legally recognised in Northern Ireland since Januarybut did not extend to ceremonies in churches or to religious bodies. The new law will protect religious freedom and churches will not be ""compelled nor prevented"" from offering same-sex ceremonies. Mr McNaghten said: ""Jon and I wouldn't see ourselves as having strong religious beliefs. ""However, our family minister is someone with whom we are close and trust, and some of our family take comfort from a religious ceremony.""

"Hundreds missing after Nigeria school attackGunmen on motorbikes raid a boarding school, home to some 800 boys, in north-western Katsina state.Africa","This video can not be played Bint'a Ismail: ""I have a child and younger brother who've been taken"" Hundreds of students are feared missing after gunmen raided a secondary school in north-western Nigeria. The attackers arrived on motorbikes and started shooting into the air, causing people to flee, witnesses said. They targeted the Government Science Secondary School - where more than 800 students are said to reside - in Katsina state on Friday evening. On Saturday, the military said it had located the gunmen's hideout in a forest and exchanged gunfire with them. The outcome was unclear but officials said there were no reports of students being injured. Meanwhile, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attack and ordered the school to carry out a full audit of students to find out how many are missing. Parents who dashed to the school to take their children home were also asked to notify the school authorities. Residents living near the all-boys boarding school in the Kankara area told the BBC they heard gunfire at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and that the attack lasted for more than an hour. Security personnel at the school managed to repel some of the attackers before police reinforcements arrived, officials said. In a statement on Saturday, police said that during an exchange of fire, some of the gunmen were forced to retreat. Students were able to scale the fence of the school and run to safety, they said. About 200 students who had fled - and were initially deemed missing - later returned. However, witnesses said they saw a number of students being taken away by the gunmen.

Several local residents on Saturday said they had joined the police in searching for the students who remained missing, while many parents said they had withdrawn their children from the school.

The attack on Friday came two days after the kidnapping of a village leader and 20 others in another part of the state. In 2014, more than 270 girls were kidnapped by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram from a school in the north-eastern Nigerian town of Chibok. No group has yet said it carried out the raid on the school in Katsina, which is far from Boko Haram's usual area of operation in the north-east.

Five-day Christmas relaxation period 'a mistake'The warning from a public health expert comes as the UK reports a further 519 deaths.Wales,"Professor of Public Health Linda Bauld said the UK loosening rules over Christmas is a mistake Loosening Covid restrictions across the UK over Christmas is a ""mistake,"" a public health expert has said. Edinburgh University's Prof Linda Bauld said there was concern about people travelling from ""high to low prevalence areas"" to see their loved ones. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said changes would cause ""huge issues about trust"", but could happen if case rates stayed high. The UK has recorded another 519 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Thelatest government figures,externalalso include 21,502 new positive cases in the UK, taking the total number in the past seven days to 124,988. On Saturday, the number ofpositive Covid tests in Wales surpassed 100,000, one day after the country reportedits highest case rates since the pandemic began. How many cases in my area? Have we become bored of following the rules? Post-Christmas lockdown warning for Wales Up to three households can stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, as agreed by all four UK nations. Prof Bauld told BBC Breakfast that ""from a public health perspective, I have to be perfectly honest, I think this is a mistake and I think people, even though we're permitted to do this, I think people have to think very carefully whether they can see loved ones outside or do it in a very, very modest way"". She added there was ""nothing to stop"" governments reversing the rules, ""but the problem is they've made that commitment to people across the UK, and that may affect trust in government if they roll back on that"". Mr Gething said ""of course we could"" change the rules around Christmas, but ""much of what we have done during the course of the pandemic is because people have trusted the government - when we said things we kept our word"". He said was concerned a change in rules now would have people ""completely ignoring the rules"", and was worried that may be the case even with the current five-day relaxation agreement in place. ""That's why we are anticipating an increase after Christmas, we expect there'll be an increase after New Year's Eve as well,"" he added. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, earlier this week warned people to be ""very, very sensible"" and not go ""too far"" over Christmas, which he called a ""very risky period"". According the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which feeds into UK government decision-making - just because people can meet up, it does not mean they should. This video can not be played This map shows how cases per 100,000 people across the 22 council areas in Wales have changed by day over the last two months Mr Gething said he would not rule out another lockdown if cases continued to rise,echoing a warning made by First Minister Mark Drakefordon Friday. He added: ""But the agreement around the Christmas period isn't just a political settlement. It really is because we understand that sort of shape to that period of time, we might see many people make up their own rules with the real potential of even greater harm. ""So it isn't as simple as saying 'this is just a political choice, and you could make it safer' because actually a lot of people invest lots of time, energy and effort in Christmas in travelling around the UK to see family when they don't do that in the rest of the year. ""Now we have to take account of the reality of the position as well and what would like to happen, how we want people to behave."" A UK government spokesperson said this year won't be ""a 'normal' Christmas"", but people would want to be with loved ones. ""Meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgement, and we must be mindful of the risks, particularly to vulnerable individuals,"" the spokesperson said. ""Everyone has a role to play by remembering hands, face, space and keeping indoor spaces well ventilated to limit the spread of the virus and protect our loved ones.""

Artist losing sight 'feels next to useless',"This video can not be played Alan Hughes, 65, says the potential loss of the ""gift"" of painting is ""horrible"". An artist ""feels next to useless"" after losing almost all of his sight. Alan Hughes' eyesight has been deteriorating for two years and he can no longer see his wife's ""lovely face"". After retiring with the hope of spending more time painting portraits, 65-year-old Mr Hughes can see about an inch in front of his face. He was placed on an NHS waiting list but difficult circumstances have meant an operation to save his sight has not taken place. The treatment was initially delayed due to Mr Hughes' phobia of needles meaning a second opinion was sought to see whether the operation could be done under local anaesthetic, so he would not need a blood test. And Mr Hughes had to cancel an appointment in April due to the pandemic, and his fear of catching coronavirus at the hospital and passing it on to his wife. Alan Hughes had looked forward to continuing his passion for art during his retirement He struggled to rebook any further appointment and gave up, resigning himself to going blind until he heard aboutthe case of a man in a similar situation who had received treatment and can now see again. Mr Hughes has now secured an appointment, which he hopes will spell the end of his troubles. Luke Anderson, clinical lead for ophthalmology at Swansea Bay health board, said a large number of patients were waiting for cataract treatment and the pandemic had severely restricted capacity, meaning some patients have waited over a year. ""After Mr Hughes cancelled his appointment he was not offered another as he had indicated he did not want to be seen during the pandemic,"" he added. ""He has since told us otherwise, and we are pleased to be able to offer him an appointment this week, which he has accepted."" Mr Hughes, who has been disabled since birth and only has a right hand, is terrified his poor eyesight will cause him to fall and lose use of his left hand. His wife Chris has a bad hip and has had two falls recently, and Mr Hughes is terrified his condition will leave him unable to look after the pair of them. ""I feel I am next to useless. I can no longer see my wife's lovely face, read, write, watch TV, drive, go out on my own, put toothpaste on my brush. ""My wife has to tell me where food is on my plate to enable me to eat."" Mr Hughes, from Swansea, said the problems began when he was 63 after perfect eyesight throughout his life, which had enabled him to paint portraits mainly with watercolours. He had looked forward to continuing his passion for art during his retirement, but has been left afraid to even go into his garden for fear of falling on the steps. Man 'almost blind' after waiting years for eye op Covid cancer delays 'could cause 2,000 deaths' Woman left blind after treatment delay in pandemic 'Years' before NHS waiting lists back to normal He is told his issues stem from high pressure in both eyes. ""I can't see anything, it was bad before but it has deteriorated over two years. First thing in the morning I look at my hand and if I can see it an inch away, I think 'OK, I'm fine for another day'. ""When that goes, I'm truly scuppered."" Mr Hughes said he realised how badly his eyesight was deteriorating during a holiday in Portmeirion last year - a town he had visited with his wife for 20 years. Alan Hughes' portrait of Portmeirion, which he had visited every year with his wife for two decades ""I couldn't see anything but a blur of colours, it broke me,"" he said. And Mr Hughes struggled in lockdown due to not feeling able to safely access his garden, or watch TV shows, read books or paint. ""We had a beautiful summer but I can't even go into my own garden because of the steps. ""People talk about the mental health toll with Covid when you're isolating, and I can't even sit down and watch boxsets or read, it takes a toll on you.""

Banksy house owners 'have not pulled out of sale',"The Banksy work appeared on a house in Totterdown in Bristol on Thursday The owner of a house on which a Banksy mural appeared has said the sale of the property will still go ahead, despite reports they had pulled out. Nick Makin said it was ""not true"" that his mother, Aileen Makin, had withdrawn the house in Bristol from the market. ""When you wake up to tabloids saying the house is now worth Â£5m you've got to think about what you're doing... but it's not changing anything,"" he said. He added that he wanted the artwork to remain in place and be protected. Mr Makin told BBC Radio Bristol the sale had been ""put on hold for 48 hours"" afterthe mural appeared on the side of the semi-detached house in Totterdown on Thursday. The work was authenticated on Banksy's website The creation - entitled ""Aachoo!!"" - depicts a woman in a headscarf sneezing and her dentures flying into the air. ""It does increase the value, and you have to take a moment to think about it, but it's not changing anything in terms of the house sale for us,"" Mr Makin said. He added that ""nasty things"" had been said about the family after it was reported by several newspapers and websites on Friday that they were pulling out of the sale of the Â£340,000 house. ""That's always going to happen with something like this. We've received a bit of abuse from it."" The house owners said they wanted the artwork to be protected Mr Makin said they had put a piece of clear acrylic over the artwork and installed an alarm system to try to protect it. ""Not only has it not earned us Â£5m, it's actually cost us money,"" he said. ""We think it should be protected and stay where it is."" He added that the family was ""looking at getting a covenant put into the deeds of the house"" to make sure the Banksy mural stays where it is. ""Or if it was to be removed, to be removed to Bristol City Council or the museum, so it can be kept in its condition and safe and in the right hands,"" Mr Makin added.

Merlin's beard! Harry Potter copy sells for Â£68k,"The first editions initially sold for Â£10.99 when printed in 1997 A first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has fetched a magical Â£68,000 at auction.

Banks 'too often blaming customers' for fraud,"There was a rise of more than a third in complaints to the financial watchdog about how banks dealt with victims of fraud and scams Banks ""too often"" blame customers for falling victim to criminals carrying out fraud, according to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Figures showed a 36% rise in complaints about how banks dealt with fraud and scams this year compared to 2019. Debbie Enever from the ombudsman told BBC Radio 4's Money Box ""work still needs to be done"" on a voluntary code most banks signed up to last year. UK Finance, representing banks, said stopping fraud was a primary focus. It added that the voluntary code was ""not working as intended"" and called for legislation to better protect customers. ThisContingent Reimbursement Model,externalCode - or CRM - means that banks should refund victims, if they are not at fault, when they have been tricked by criminals into transferring money out of their own banks accounts. Fraud risk warning: 'I was desperate for a job' Fraudsters 'caught me in a spider's web' 'Having my identity stolen cost me Â£10,000' Between April to September 2020, figures from the Financial Ombudsman Service showed there were 6,603 complaints about banks from victims of fraud, up from 4,840 between April and September in 2019. Fraudsters pretend to be from the police, the government or the banks themselves and use intense psychological pressure, often against elderly and vulnerable victims. Last year,Â£456m was stolen,externalfrom more than 100,000 victims using this method, destroying victims' financial futures and devastating them and their families. But whilst the Financial Ombudsman Service only upholds around a third of general complaints made about banks, when it comes to complaints about this type of fraud it backs consumers in three quarters of cases. ""Under the code that came in last year, the presumption was supposed to be that consumers would get their money back unless they were at fault in someway,"" Ms Enever said. ""We're just not seeing that the banks are following through on that at the moment. ""We are always keen to let people know that they can come and complain to us [about banks and building societies] andthe email addresses and phone numbers are on our website."",external Leslie runs a small company in London and had Â£13,200 stolen from him by criminals who hacked his email account in June 2019. He should have been covered by this code but after investigating for five months his bank, Lloyds, told him it wouldn't refund the money. Leslie complained to the ombudsman which, in June 2020, backed his complaint but six months on Lloyds still hadn't refunded the money. Money Box started investigating Leslie's case and within two hours of Lloyds being contacted by our reporter, Leslie was emailed to say he would be getting his money back. ""I'm obviously delighted to hear the money is returning... but this system is clearly broken and there needs to be a change,"" he said. ""When a bank promotes they have entered a code [to refund victims] they are asking customers to trust them to follow that code. ""My own experience suggests Lloyds at least are not deserving that trust."" Lloyds told us keeping its customers' money safe is its priority and it had a great deal of sympathy for Leslie. It said it had already agreed to refund Leslie's money before Money Box got involved, adding that the timing was just a coincidence. The Financial Ombudsman Service settles disputes between consumers and businesses that provide financial services. It is the final word in complaints and banks and building societies must abide by its decision. The agency has a two-stage process: an ""initial view"" handed down by an investigator and a ""final decision"" which is enforceable by law. In 2019/20 it upheld an average of 32% of complaints in general about banks. That figure nearly doubled to 58% in relation to complaints about frauds and scams. In cases of push payment fraud that number was even higher at 75%. Katy Worobec of UK Finance, which represents the main banks, said: ""Fraud is a crime which has a devastating emotional impact on victims and its proceeds fund serious criminal activities which damage our society."" She told Money Box the primary focus was stopping fraud in the first place and helping customers stay safe. In relation to the CRM code, Ms Worobec said it was not working as intended, admitted a lack of consistency from banks and was working on making it more effective. She said the industry was also calling for further action, including new legislation, ""to drive more consistent outcomes for consumers and firms"".

'We went to relax - now we're just stressed',"A smiling Steve in Gran Canaria before the government's travel corridor announcement ""We have paid the best part of Â£2,000, we thought it was worth the investment for a relaxing week in the sun but we're flying back stressed,"" says Steve Jennings, from Liverpool. The retired chief executive was on holiday in Gran Canaria when he heardthe news that the government had changedthe quarantine rules for the Canary Islands. From Saturday morning, anyone returning to the UK from the islands has to self-isolate. Althoughthe quarantine period is being cutto 10 days from next week, anyone who doesn't get back in the next few days could see their Christmas plans at risk. What are the quarantine rules? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? For Steve, 61, the news left him anxious as he scrabbled to find out how he and his partner Lynn - who has hospital appointments booked next week - could avoid the quarantine. ""It leaves us totally confused and anxious,"" he said. ""It tends to ruin the end of the holiday."" Like many, Steve is pinning his hopes onthe government's new testing scheme,externalwhich lets travellers to England cut their quarantine by half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. But the scheme - called test-to-release - doesn't launch until Tuesday and the list of approved providers has not been published yet. ""The thing that brasses me off [is] you like to be proud of your government and civil service,"" he says. ""This [scheme] is due to be launched on Tuesday, here we are still with no details."" For other Brits in the Canaries, the pressure is on to make sure they're back in the UK with enough time to quarantine before Christmas, so their festive plans aren't ruined. ""I was extremely stressed on Thursday,"" says David Evans, 23, a DJ living and working in Fuerteventura. ""From when I got home from work at 6/7pm, I didn't do anything until 1am except talk to family members, talking to work, to my housemate, trying to work out what to do."" David DJs in clubs and on the beach, and says he has around five gigs next week He is due to fly back to Brighton next week and plans to get a test, ahead of hopefully seeing his parents and nan at Christmas. ""I already have some gigs lined up so can't come back any earlier,"" he says. David says he thinks the Canary Islands should be treated individually by the UK government when it comes to quarantine rules. The government has said data suggests cases are rising in the Canaries, but David points out the number of cases in Fuerteventura is lower than in other islands. ""I'd like to see them separate the islands as Tenerife seems to be the problem,"" he says. ""They've done this with the Greek islands, why not the same for the Canaries?"" Keith Baldwin, from Liverpool, agrees and has emailed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ask why the islands aren't being treated separately. ""Tenerife is right off the scale with Covid. Lanzarote's a bit high. But Gran Canaria is right down,"" says Keith, who is in Gran Canaria. ""Work's not going to be happy [if I have to isolate]. I'm a support worker and we're short as it is."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? The Foreign Office has not changed its travel advice for the Canary Islands, meaning many holidaymakers who were due to go on holiday may be unable to seek refunds or claim on their travel insurance policies as companies will not cancel bookings. One such holidaymaker was Kathy Hemingway, from East Yorks, who was due to fly to Fuerteventura on Saturday. She paid Â£170 to get Covid tests done on top of her holiday, which she can't get a refund for from Tui as the FCO have not changed the travel advice rules. ""We can move our booking,"" she adds. ""We have to pluck a date out of the air. We have no idea when it will be safe to travel."" Kathy had already changed her holiday destination twice, from Mexico to Lanzarote, then to Fuerteventura Other holidaymakers have highlighted how safe they feel in the Canaries. Everyone aged six and overmust provide a negative test,externalwhen arriving into Spain, and when checking in to tourist accommodation in the Canaries. ""I feel safer in Tenerife than I do back in Scotland,"" says Philip Knight, who has been on holiday with his partner Luke in Tenerife, but flew back two days early on Friday. Philip says he fears the impact this will have on the local economy ""I, and every other holiday-maker had to get a Covid-19 test before coming here,"" he says. ""Everyone must wear a mask at all times (in the street etc), there are no exemptions unless a doctor provides a certificate. Everyone obeys this. ""There is a curfew at 11pm which is enforced strictly by the police and respected by the residents and tourists. Everyone must be in their property and remain there till 6am. ""The island is quiet with no crowds  and only groups of four. ""The UK government has therefore made me return to the UK which has a higher rate of infection with less protection (i.e. no masks and no curfew),"" adds Philip, a partner in an Edinburgh law firm. Lee Rowell-Burton, from Manchester, says he and his wife ""have had no personal contact with anyone"" since arriving in Fuerteventura to fix a problem at their apartment. ""We took a private PCR test on 7 December to get here, costing Â£120 each, which both came back negative. ""Now we have to either self-isolate or take another test, at our own expense, after five days. Another test? That's another Â£120 we don't have. I'm supposed to be back to work on Monday."" ""It's so safe here,"" says Lee, in Fuerteventura He adds: ""We are both extremely careful as we both have lost relatives to Covid-19 and are on one of the safest Canary Islands to visit, and only for five nights, yet still are having to self-isolate on our return? Ridiculous."" The news of the quarantine change came on Thursday,in a tweet by Mr Shapps,externalwho said data indicated weekly cases and positive tests were increasing. The government has previously said that decisions about which places go on or off the list are based on a range of factors, not just case rates. The Department for Transport said in a statement on Saturday the government had been ""consistently clear"" that it would take action rapidly if the public health risk became too high. ""Throughout the outbreak, all our decisions have been based on the best scientific evidence,"" it said. ""Any emerging evidence is continually monitored and considered in the government's policy making.""

S Korea 'emergency' as virus cases at record high,"The country has introduced new restrictions amid a rise in cases South Korea has recorded a new high in the number of coronavirus cases, with 950 infections announced on Saturday. President Moon Jae-in said the country was facing ""an emergency situation"" and vowed to strengthen testing and tracing in response ""This is the last hurdle before the roll-out of vaccines and treatments,"" he said. Most of the new cases have been in the capital Seoul and the surrounding areas. The region is home to around half of South Korea's population. In recent days, the country has recorded between 500 and 600 new daily infections. Earlier this week, South Korea raised its level of alert amid a third wave of cases. New measures, which came into effect on Tuesday, include a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. Gyms and karaoke bars have been closed, while restaurants are only allowed to offer deliveries after 21:00 local time. However, the government has warned that restrictions could be raised to the highest level, which would see gatherings limited to 10 people, school closures and all but essential roles working from home. This video can not be played South Korea's Covid contact tracers battle long hours as they try to get suspected carriers to co-operate South Korea has recorded more than 41,000 cases and 578 deaths since the pandemic began. The country initially saw a huge spike in  infections in February,after a religious group in the city of Daegu was identified as a virus cluster.

Rare seabirds have best season in 26 years,"Little terns travel 3,000 miles from west Africa to breed on the UK coast A colony of one of the country's rarest seabirds has had its most successful season for more than 25 years, the National Trust has said. Nesting pairs of little terns fledged more than 200 chicks at Blakeney Point, off the north Norfolk coast. The bird has been in serious decline nationally since the 1980s, with fewer than 2,000 pairs now left in the UK. Rangers counted 154 pairs of little terns nesting over the summer months and 201 chicks - the most since 1994. The National Trust,external, which manages Blakeney Point, believes the success was in part due to fewer people visiting the site at the beginning of the breeding season, during the first national lockdown. The little terns nested at the far end of The Point, which is further away from the mainland, with fewer visitors walking that far along. Little terns have been in serious decline nationally since the 1980s There were fewer predators affecting the little terns this year, rangers said. They believe this could be because the birds nested further away from the watch house, and were all together, meaning there was some safety in numbers. Staff kept watch on the site to ward off predators using techniques such as laying out food sources away from the colony. They also used clay decoys to encourage nesting in suitable areas of the shoreline. Blakeney Point is a four-mile shingle spit off the north Norfolk coast Countryside manager Chris Bielby said: ""Little terns have been rapidly declining in the UK for the past few decades, so it's particularly rewarding to see so many of these tiny seabirds fledging the nest. ""The species is still very much at risk and we'll need to keep up our efforts to make sure they have safe places to breed. ""But for now, it's good to be able to celebrate a successful season given what a challenging year 2020 has been."" Common terns had a similarly successful year at Blakeney Point, with 289 pairs fledging at least 170 chicks, the most since 1999. Rangers believe the colony relocated from other nesting sites which flooded during bad weather in June. Sandwich terns were late arrivals to the site but arrived in high numbers, almost triple that of the previous year.

Second death row inmate executed in Indiana,"Alfred Bourgeois was put to death for the murder of his two-year-old daughter A man who killed his toddler daughter nearly 20 years ago has become the second US federal inmate to be executed in as many days. Alfred Bourgeois' death by lethal injection on Friday comes after Brandon Bernard was put to death on Thursday. Three more executions are planned before the end of Donald Trump's presidency on 20 January. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before Mr Trump ordered them to resume earlier this year. If the remaining executions go ahead, Mr Trump will have overseen the most executions by a US president in more than a century. In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions Brandon Bernard executed in Trump's final days They break with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions during a presidential transition. President-elect Joe Biden takes office on 20 January. Mr Biden, who for decades was a fierce supporter of the death penalty as a Delaware senator, has now said he will seek to end federal executions once he takes office. The federal death penalty had not been used since 2003, in part due to concerns about the drugs used in executions. Courts ruled that Bourgeois had physically and sexually abused his two-year-old daughter before killing her as he passed through Texas while working as a long-haul truck driver. Prosecutors say he killed her by slamming her head into the car's window and dashboard after she spilled her training potty in the vehicle while he was parking. Bourgeois, who was sentenced to death in 2004, was making a delivery to a military base when he killed his daughter so he was tried in a federal court. His lawyers argued that he had a severe intellectual disability that should have prevented him from being executed. Brandon Bernard was executedin Indiana after last-minute clemency pleas were rejected by the US Supreme Court. Bernard, 40, was convicted of murder in 1999 when he was a teenager, and is the youngest offender to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Lisa Montgomerystrangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. She is scheduled for execution on 12 January. Her lawyers have said she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and suffers from serious mental illness. She will be the first woman to face federal execution in the US since 1953. Cory Johnsonwas convicted for the murder of seven people, related to his involvement with the drug trade in Richmond, Virginia. Johnson's legal team has argued that he suffers from an intellectual disability, related to physical and emotional abuse he experienced as a child. His execution is scheduled for 14 January. Dustin John Higgswas convicted in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three young women in the Washington, DC area. Higgs did not kill any of his victims, but instructed his co-defendant Willis Haynes to do so. Haynes has said in court documents that Higgs did not threaten him, or force him to shoot. Higgs is scheduled for execution on 15 January.

Police appeal over 'fake nude game show',"Police previously arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the investigation A fake game show host tricked two men into being filmed carrying out naked challenges for the chance to win cash, police have said. In 2018, a 28-year-old man told the Met he had been filmed in a hotel room in Newham, east London, by another man who claimed it was for a show. Earlier this year, a 31-year-old man reported a similar thing had happened to him in 2013, the force said. Scotland Yard said officers ""believe there may be more victims"". The 28-year-old approached police in June 2018 to report that a man claiming to be in the entertainment industry had asked him to take part in a game show for the chance to win Â£5,000. He said he was required to take part in several ""nude challenges"" which were filmed by the suspect who kept the footage. The second victim, who was identified by police in February this year, told officers a man had coerced him into doing something similar in a hotel in south-east London in August 2013. Officers arrested a 29-year-old man in January 2019 on suspicion of voyeurism and he was released under investigation. Sgt James Mason said: ""We believe there may be more victims in relation to these events.

EU leaders close ranks,"This video can not be played EC President Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit will be ""new beginnings for old friends"" Boris Johnson's declaration that he would go to Paris, travel to Berlin, ""do whatever it takes to reach a deal"" was quietly rebuffed again by the EU on Friday. Normally after big summits like the one we've just had in Brussels, leaders make media statements about their most pressing discussions. Climate change, Covid, relations with Turkey... they all featured prominently at the summit. Brexit was hardly mentioned. There's no denying that the prospect of the pain of no deal at all with the UK certainly weighs on EU minds. A German think tank has estimated that up to 700,000 European jobs could be at risk. But Europe's leaders are keen to clarify they won't personally intervene in the current impasse in trade talks. There'll be no last-minute handshake or ""a-ha"" moment in Paris, Warsaw or Berlin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (r) says a Brexit deal is still possible but insists that the integrity of the EU single market must be respected Behind the scenes, of course, leaders are involved in discussions with their negotiators, but they don't want to be face-to-face, or ear-to-ear, with Boris Johnson in public. EU countries are joined together in their single market. So, no individual EU leader - not even the most powerful ones, in France and Germany - can be perceived to be making the political compromises that could clinch the UK deal. Concessions will impact the whole single market - and therefore all member states, as a collective. Just this week, an ÃlysÃ©e Palace spokesman described as ""not desirable"" the idea of a visit or bilateral call between the prime minister and Emmanuel Macron in these last negotiating days. And the French president underlined again on Friday that EU countries were united behind the European Commission negotiating with the UK on their behalf. Something Downing Street then said it accepted. So can a deal be reached between the EU and UK by Sunday, despite the pervading mood of gloom plus a sense - in public, at least - that both sides are digging in their heels? It's difficult but possible. PM and EU say trade deal unlikely by Sunday What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? One of the main obstacles to a deal, according to the UK government, is that the EU refuses to accept the UK's post-Brexit national sovereignty. ""How can the EU demand that we tie ourselves to a new rule book to get good access to the single market?"" ministers ask. After all, wasn't Brexit all about breaking free from Brussels' regulations? But on Friday the European Commission president - who had a working dinner with the prime minister just this week - hit back at the EU-is-in-denial-about-UK-sovereignty claim. Yes, said Ursula von der Leyen, the EU was insisting on what it views as rules on ""fair competition"" in exchange for agreeing the UK could have preferential access to the single market - i.e. tariff and quota-free. But she pointedly added that the UK would remain free - ""sovereign, if you wish"" were the words she used - to decide what it wanted to do. ""We [the EU] would simply adapt the conditions for access to our market accordingly. It would be the decision of the UK and this would apply vice versa."" This refers to something often discussed in my blog over the past weeks. We know, oh so well by now, the three main sticking points still in talks: EU fishing rights in UK waters; competition regulations for the UK to have that good access to the single market; and the governance of the deal - how to ensure both sides keep to the agreement or face punitive measures. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are continuing:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The EU has gradually shifted its focus as it has become more and more aware that a post-Brexit UK will, almost inevitably, want to make up its own rules and regulations for business: deciding for itself which industries it wants to invest in and promote. Despite this, the EU still would rather have a trade and security deal with the UK than not. Because, in theory, it would be economically beneficial for both sides and because the deal contains other important aspects of the relationship, such as social security and police and judicial co-operation, how the EU and UK deal with nuclear waste, and more. So Brussels has been pondering how it can live with the UK's sovereign right to diverge and yet still have an overall deal. Their answer: focus more on governance. Trade between the UK and the EU would be disrupted by a no-deal Brexit This is what Mrs von der Leyen was referring to. A proposal that if the UK changes its environmental or labour standards, for example, the EU could then take immediate action to protect its businesses. And the UK would be able to take measures against the EU if the situation were reversed. So far, so sensible, you might think. But surprise, surprise, it's far from being that straightforward. The EU doesn't want to have to wait for some independent body/arbitration panel to judge whether it has the right to retaliate if it believes there is ""unfair competition"" afoot. Brussels worries a legal process like that could take too long. In the meantime, EU businesses could flounder or go under completely. EU leaders worry how they could justify that to their voters. The words ""level playing field"" or ""competition regulations"" may sound bewilderingly abstract but the Danish prime minister pointed out on Thursday that each EU leader was thinking about protecting jobs and businesses in their country - be it Denmark, Germany, France or the Netherlands, when it came to this deal with the UK. So, the EU is pushing to be able to retaliate even before a judgement on unfair competition has been reached. Something the UK clearly says it cannot accept. Can this key disagreement be resolved? Maybe. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, is described by his team as being in a ""determined, positive mood"". The UK says it's willing to go the extra mile. This video can not be played Johnson: No-deal Brexit now ""very, very likely"" You can dismiss all this as a PR exercise for public consumption, but the fact that negotiations will continue over the weekend means neither side has stopped trying. The problem facing all of us outside the negotiating room, is that there are leaks and assertions aplenty being made on both sides, but in the absence of the publication of texts, the only ones who know for sure what's going on, are the men and women currently sitting opposite each other in closed rooms in Brussels. Sunday will be here before we know it. Boris Johnson and the European Commission president say that's when ""a decision will be made"". But based on all the other false dawns in these talks, be warned: Sunday's decision could be ""deal"", ""no deal"" or ""let's keep talking, a little while longer"".

'Test and dine' proposed to support restaurants,"Birmingham is in tier three, meaning shops and gyms can open, but pubs and restaurants must remain closed, other than for takeaway and delivery A ""test and dine"" pilot has been proposed in Birmingham in a bid to help the struggling hospitality sector. The scheme, put forward by the city council, would see people wanting to eat out tested for Covid-19 a few hours earlier. It comes as hospitality businesses in the city consider legal action after being forced to close under tier three measures. The plans, at a very early stage, would need to be approved by government. Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward told a regional Covid-19 briefing on Friday that the local authority was discussing the idea. England's tiers are set to be reviewed on 16 December, but Birmingham is expected to remain in tier three until the new year ""We would pilot it initially with a very small number of restaurants,"" Mr Ward said. ""If it worked we would look to expand that going forward. ""If people book a seat at one of those restaurants to eat out, we would allow them to be tested, and provided they tested negative and the booking was within six hours of that test, then they would be able to go and dine at that particular restaurant."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Some rapid Covid-19 tests can provide results within an hour, but there have also beenconcerns about their accuracy. Mike Olley said the restrictions had been devastating to Birmingham's hospitality sector Mike Olley, who runs the Westside Business Improvement District, which supports local firms, said he would welcome any scheme to help the city's hospitality industry. ""I don't doubt the sincerity of the council,"" he said. ""It's a plan, it's something. At least they're thinking outside of the box."" However he raised questions about who would pay for the tests and how restaurants and bars could apply to take part in the pilot. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Tier three measures have been ""devastating"" for hospitality, he said. ""We've got bars, restaurants, casinos, theatres which are all incredibly safe areas and they're not trading, yet they're still having to pay out massive overheads."" The council said it believed the scheme could help businesses, but it has not yet made clear the finer details of the plans.

South Korea 'emergency' as cases reach record high,"The country has introduced new restrictions amid a rise in cases South Korea has recorded a new high in the number of coronavirus cases, with 950 infections announced on Saturday. President Moon Jae-in said the country was facing ""an emergency situation"" and vowed to strengthen testing and tracing in response ""This is the last hurdle before the roll-out of vaccines and treatments,"" he said. Most of the new cases have been in the capital Seoul and the surrounding areas. The region is home to around half of South Korea's population. In recent days, the country has recorded between 500 and 600 new daily infections. Earlier this week, South Korea raised its level of alert amid a third wave of cases. New measures, which came into effect on Tuesday, include a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. Gyms and karaoke bars have been closed, while restaurants are only allowed to offer deliveries after 21:00 local time. However, the government has warned that restrictions could be raised to the highest level, which would see gatherings limited to 10 people, school closures and all but essential roles working from home.

UK-EU talks continue as Navy boats put on standby,"Trade talks between the UK and European Union are continuing in Brussels with one day to go until a deadline imposed by the two sides. The leaders of both parties have warned they are unlikely to reach a post-Brexit trade deal by Sunday. On Friday, Boris Johnson chaired a ""stock-take"" on the UK's preparedness for a no-deal scenario. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said four Royal Navy patrol boats are ready to protect UK fishing waters. The Sunday deadline was set by Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after the pair met in Brussels on Wednesday, after months of talks failed to achieve an agreement. Mr Johnson said the EU needed to make a ""big change"" over the main sticking points on fishing rights and business competition rules, while Mrs von der Leyen said no deal was the most probable end to ""difficult"" talks. The EU has rejected Mr Johnson's request to bypass the European Commission and speak directly to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel about the unresolved issues. According to EU officials, he was told discussions could only take place through the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who is meeting with his UK equivalent in Brussels. What happens if there's no trade deal? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? If a trade deal is not reached and ratified by both sides by 31 December, the UK and EU could impose taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods. This could lead to higher prices for some goods, among other changes. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? A major sticking point in negotiations has been access to UK fishing waters, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. The MoD has said it has conducted ""extensive planning and preparation"" to ensure it is ready for a range of scenarios at the end of the transition period, including having 14,000 personnel on standby to support the government over the winter with the EU transition. It said four offshore patrol boats will be available to monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place to protect the UK's rights as an independent coastal state"". An expansion of powers for the Royal Navy Police, enabling officers to potentially board foreign boats and arrest those breaking the law, is one proposal in the MoD's no-deal contingency planning, a spokesman confirmed. Admiral Lord West, former chief of naval staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""entirely appropriate"" for the Royal Navy to protect UK waters, although he said there would need to be parliamentary authority to allow officers to board foreign ships. But Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, called the threat of using Royal Navy gunboats to patrol UK waters in a no-deal outcome ""irresponsible"". ""This isn't Elizabethan times anymore, this is global Britain - we need to be raising the bar much higher than this,"" he told Today. Accordingto the MoD's website,external, three River Class patrol ships with a crew of 45 sailors already work ""at least 275 days a year at sea enforcing British and European fisheries law"". BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said the government's contingency assumptions are that a lack of business readiness will lead to queues of thousands of lorries, with Kent - which is home to the Port of Dover, operating an access permit for hauliers. A presentation, seen by the BBC, only identified room to fast track between 70 and 100 lorries of perishable goods per day should there be tailbacks, he said. The authorities have chosen to focus on ""fish and chicks"" - live and fresh seafood, often transported from Scotland to French restaurants, as well as day old chicks. No other commodities have been added to the list, he adds, raising fears among other food exporters. There's no denying that the prospect of the pain of no deal at all with the UK certainly weighs on EU minds. But Europe's leaders are keen to clarify they won't personally intervene in the current impasse in trade talks. Behind the scenes, leaders are involved in discussions with their negotiators, but they don't want to be face-to-face, or ear-to-ear, with Boris Johnson in public.

No-deal Navy threat 'irresponsible' - Tory MP,"Deploying Royal Navy gunboats to protect UK fishing waters under a no-deal Brexit would be ""undignified"", a former Conservative minister has said. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood described the threat as ""irresponsible"" after the Ministry of Defence said four ships were ready for ""robust enforcement"" when the transition period ends. UK-EU trade talks are continuing ahead of a mutual deadline on Sunday. The MoD said it was prepared for a ""range of scenarios"" after 31 December. Navy vessels are already deployed to enforce UK and European fishing laws for large parts of the year. A major sticking point in negotiations has been access to UK fishing waters, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. A UK government source said talks were continuing overnight ""but as things stand the offer on the table from the EU remains unacceptable"". What happens if there's no trade deal? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What is an 'Australia-style deal'? Mr Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that headlines highlighting the threat to deploy the navy risked distracting from the ongoing talks and were ""absolutely irresponsible"". ""This isn't Elizabethan times anymore, this is global Britain - we need to be raising the bar much higher than this,"" he said. ""Being ready for the worst-case scenario and using this final 48 hours to actually get a deal, they are two very different things,"" he added. He said the focus should be on what is ""already in the bag"" and that outstanding issues like access to fishing waters could be sorted once a trade deal is signed. Tobias Ellwood is a former defence minister Former Tory party chairman Lord Patten accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being on a ""runaway train of English exceptionalism"". Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government justice minister, told the BBC: ""This UK government gunboat diplomacy is not welcome in Scottish waters. ""We will protect our fisheries where necessary. Police Scotland and Marine Scotland have primacy to do that. But we won't do that by threatening our allies, our Nato allies in fact, by threatening to sink their vessels."" But Admiral Lord West, a former chief of naval staff, defended the threat of using the Royal Navy to protect UK waters from foreign fishing vessels if asked to do so in a no-deal Brexit scenario. ""It is absolutely appropriate for the navy to do as it is told by the government,"" he said, adding that additional powers would allow Naval officers to deal with ""stormy"" altercations with foreign fishermen. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months.

Supreme Court rejects Trump-backed election lawsuitThe lawsuit sought to invalidate results in four states where President Trump lost the US election.US & Canada,"The US Supreme Court has rejected an unprecedented attempt to throw out election results in four battleground states that was backed by President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed this week by the state of Texas, sought to invalidate results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President-elect Joe Biden won all four. The lawsuit was supported by 18 state attorneys general and 106 Republican members of Congress. But in a brief order rejecting the bid, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Texas did not have legal standing to bring the case. Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? The ruling represents a setback for Mr Trump, who has previously suggested without evidence that the result of November's presidential election would be settled in the Supreme Court. The court rejected a separate legal challenge against Mr Biden's victory in Pennsylvaniaearlier this week, dismissing it in a one-sentence ruling. Mr Trump has made repeated unsubstantiated assertions that ""illegal votes"" cost him a second presidential term. Since the election, Mr Trump and his supporters have launched dozens of lawsuits questioning the results of the election. None have come close to overturning Mr Biden's victory. The Democratic candidate defeated Mr Trump by a margin of 306 to 232 votes in the US electoral college, which chooses the US president. Mr Biden won seven million more votes than the president nationwide. The electoral college is expected to meet on Monday to formally elect Mr Biden as the 46th president of the US. The Supreme Court, as expected by most legal experts, wanted nothing to do with Texas's challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election. The ruling was slightly longer than the one-sentence ""motion denied"" response in a Pennsylvania case earlier this week. Two of the nine Supreme Court justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, said they wouldn't have dismissed the lawsuit outright. But even they would not express a view on whether Texas's attempt to throw out millions of votes and effectively hand the presidency to Mr Trump had merit. The decision paves the way for the members of the electoral college to meet in state capitals across the US on Monday. At that point, the door to Mr Trump's legal challenges to the election will slam closed. And while his supporters may try a last-ditch effort to block Mr Biden's victory in Congress in January, those political manoeuvres are destined to fail. Democrats will make sure of that. The implications of this challenge, however, are unlikely to quickly fade away. Eighteen states and more than 100 Republicans in Congress endorsed discarding the results of the election and putting the White House in the hands of state legislatures. That is something Democrats - and the history books - won't soon forget. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by the Republican Attorney-General of Texas, Ken Paxton - an ally of Mr Trump. It was supported by the president, who on Wednesday filed a motion to intervene and become a plaintiff in the case. The lawsuit sought to discard the presidential election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, four crucial states won by Mr Biden. Texas alleged that the results in those states were unlawful because of changes to voting procedures to help Americans cast their ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Mr Paxton's lawsuit asked the Supreme Court to allow the legislatures of those states - which are all controlled by Republicans - to determine who should get their electoral college votes. But on Thursday, the four states in a filing asked the justices to reject the lawsuit, which they said had no legal grounds. The Supreme Court agreed. ""Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognisable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections,"" the court said in its ruling. Before the ruling, legal experts were sceptical of the lawsuit's chances of success. But just hours before the ruling, Mr Trump appeared optimistic, urging the Supreme Court to show ""great Wisdom and Courage"". The court failed to do so, Mr Trump later wrote in a tweet bemoaning the verdict. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"'We went to relax in the sun, but we're stressed'","A smiling Steve in Gran Canaria before the government's travel corridor announcement ""We have paid the best part of Â£2,000, we thought it was worth the investment for a relaxing week in the sun but we're flying back stressed,"" says Steve Jennings, from Liverpool. The retired chief executive was on holiday in Gran Canaria when he heardthe news that the government had changedthe quarantine rules for the Canary Islands. From Saturday morning, anyone returning to the UK from the islands has to self-isolate. Althoughthe quarantine period is being cutto 10 days from next week, anyone who doesn't get back in the next few days could see their Christmas plans at risk. What are the quarantine rules? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? For Steve, 61, the news left him anxious as he scrabbled to find out how he and his partner Lynn - who has hospital appointments booked next week - could avoid the quarantine. ""It leaves us totally confused and anxious,"" he said. ""It tends to ruin the end of the holiday."" Like many, Steve is pinning his hopes onthe government's new testing scheme,externalwhich lets travellers to England cut their quarantine by half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. But the scheme - called test-to-release - doesn't launch until Tuesday and the list of approved providers has not been published yet. ""The thing that brasses me off [is] you like to be proud of your government and civil service,"" he says. ""This [scheme] is due to be launched on Tuesday, here we are still with no details."" For other Brits in the Canaries, the pressure is on to make sure they're back in the UK with enough time to quarantine before Christmas, so their festive plans aren't ruined. ""I was extremely stressed on Thursday,"" says David Evans, 23, a DJ living and working in Fuerteventura. ""From when I got home from work at 6/7pm, I didn't do anything until 1am except talk to family members, talking to work, to my housemate, trying to work out what to do."" David DJs in clubs and on the beach, and says he has around five gigs next week He is due to fly back to Brighton next week and plans to get a test, ahead of hopefully seeing his parents and nan at Christmas. ""I already have some gigs lined up so can't come back any earlier,"" he says. David says he thinks the Canary Islands should be treated individually by the UK government when it comes to quarantine rules. The government has said data suggests cases are rising in the Canaries, but David points out the number of cases in Fuerteventura is lower than in other islands. ""I'd like to see them separate the islands as Tenerife seems to be the problem,"" he says. ""They've done this with the Greek islands, why not the same for the Canaries?"" Keith Baldwin, from Liverpool, agrees and has emailed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ask why the islands aren't being treated separately. ""Tenerife is right off the scale with Covid. Lanzarote's a bit high. But Gran Canaria is right down,"" says Keith, who is in Gran Canaria. ""Work's not going to be happy [if I have to isolate]. I'm a support worker and we're short as it is."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? The Foreign Office has not changed its travel advice for the Canary Islands, meaning many holidaymakers who were due to go on holiday may be unable to seek refunds or claim on their travel insurance policies as companies will not cancel bookings. One such holidaymaker was Kathy Hemingway, from East Yorks, who was due to fly to Fuerteventura on Saturday. She paid Â£170 to get Covid tests done on top of her holiday, which she can't get a refund for from Tui as the FCO have not changed the travel advice rules. ""We can move our booking,"" she adds. ""We have to pluck a date out of the air. We have no idea when it will be safe to travel."" Kathy had already changed her holiday destination twice, from Mexico to Lanzarote, then to Fuerteventura Other holidaymakers have highlighted how safe they feel in the Canaries. Everyone aged six and overmust provide a negative test,externalwhen arriving into Spain, and when checking in to tourist accommodation in the Canaries. ""I feel safer in Tenerife than I do back in Scotland,"" says Philip Knight, who has been on holiday with his partner Luke in Tenerife, but flew back two days early on Friday. Philip says he fears the impact this will have on the local economy ""I, and every other holiday-maker had to get a Covid-19 test before coming here,"" he says. ""Everyone must wear a mask at all times (in the street etc), there are no exemptions unless a doctor provides a certificate. Everyone obeys this. ""There is a curfew at 11pm which is enforced strictly by the police and respected by the residents and tourists. Everyone must be in their property and remain there till 6am. ""The island is quiet with no crowds  and only groups of four. ""The UK government has therefore made me return to the UK which has a higher rate of infection with less protection (i.e. no masks and no curfew),"" adds Philip, a partner in an Edinburgh law firm. Lee Rowell-Burton, from Manchester, says he and his wife ""have had no personal contact with anyone"" since arriving in Fuerteventura to fix a problem at their apartment. ""We took a private PCR test on 7 December to get here, costing Â£120 each, which both came back negative. ""Now we have to either self-isolate or take another test, at our own expense, after five days. Another test? That's another Â£120 we don't have. I'm supposed to be back to work on Monday."" ""It's so safe here,"" says Lee, in Fuerteventura He adds: ""We are both extremely careful as we both have lost relatives to Covid-19 and are on one of the safest Canary Islands to visit, and only for five nights, yet still are having to self-isolate on our return? Ridiculous."" The news of the quarantine change came on Thursday,in a tweet by Mr Shapps,externalwho said data indicated weekly cases and positive tests were increasing. The government has previously said that decisions about which places go on or off the list are based on a range of factors, not just case rates. The Department for Transport said in a statement on Saturday the government had been ""consistently clear"" that it would take action rapidly if the public health risk became too high. ""Throughout the outbreak, all our decisions have been based on the best scientific evidence,"" it said. ""Any emerging evidence is continually monitored and considered in the government's policy making."" When the test-to-release scheme opens on Tuesday, anyone already self-isolating after travelling to the UK is able to book in a test. What to do if you have Covid How are travel rules being relaxed?

US approves Pfizer Covid vaccine for use,"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. The agency said the authorisation was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, which taken more than 295,000 lives in the US. The vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, was deemed safe and effective by the FDA. President Donald Trump said the first vaccinations will take place ""in less than 24 hours"". ""Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle,"" Mr Trump said. ""We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months."" Before the announcement on Friday night, the FDA had come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the vaccine's use. The head of the agency, Stephen Hahn, was told to approve it for emergency use by Friday or quit, US media reported, although he called this ""untrue"". In further comments at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Hahn said he was ready to be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was available and stressed that the agency had not compromised safety in its testing. The issue of allergies was also addressed after testing in the UK produced a small number of allergic reactions. Dr Peter Marks, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said the few reactions in the UK ""were not seen in the larger trial data sets, but we still need to know more and we'll be taking precautions"". He added that the FDA was ""comfortable giving the vaccine to patients who have had other allergic reactions other than severe allergic reactions to a vaccine or one of its components"". His advice was that those with a history of allergies should consult a doctor. Covid: When can I get vaccinated in the US? Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters earlier on Friday that his department would work with Pfizer to get the mass vaccination programme started by Monday or Tuesday. The Pfizer vaccine has already received regulatory approval in the UK, Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Like those countries, the US will give its first doses of the vaccine to the elderly, health workers and emergency crew. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US. On Wednesday, the country recorded more than 3,000 deaths - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world. ""The FDA's authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,"" said Mr Hahn. He said the authorisation came after ""an open and transparent review process"" that ensured the vaccine met the ""FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality"". The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the coming days On Thursday, medical experts advising the FDA recommended the emergency-use authorisation. A 23-member panel concluded the vaccine's benefits outweighed its risks. Emergency use, the FDA said, is not the same as full approval, which would require Pfizer to file a separate application to secure. ""While not an FDA approval, today's emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,"" said Dr Marks. On Friday, President Trump sent out an angry tweet calling the FDA a ""big, old, slow turtle"", adding: ""Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives."" The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Mr Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing three sources. US media reported that FDA Commissioner Hahn had been ordered to approve the vaccine's use by Friday But Mr Hahn told US media he had only been ""encouraged to continue working expeditiously"" on the vaccine's approval, and that the media representation of the chief of staff's phone call was ""untrue"". Amid the reports of White House pressure, President-elect Joe Biden said he wanted to make it clear to the public that they should have confidence in the vaccine, adding: ""There is no political influence."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Operation Warp Speed says that vaccine deliveries will begin within 24 hours of approval. ""We have made sure that this vaccine will be free, for all Americans,"" Mr Trump said in a recorded video posted to Twitter. ""We have already begun shipping the vaccine to every state and zip code in the country. The first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours."" Allow Twitter content?

Pfizer plans to have 6.4 million doses ready for the US in its first rollout round in late December. Because two injections are required per person, that is enough for three million people, out of a total US population of 330 million. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups. The nation's approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Mr Trump said vaccines ""will vanquish the virus and return life back to normal"". But officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021. A second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, is also seeking emergency approval in the US. Like the Pfizer vaccine it requires a second round of injections.

UK to stop funding overseas fossil fuel projects,"Mr Sharma said progress had been made, but it was not enough yet to avoid dangerous warming this century The UK minister tasked with leading UN climate talks says world leaders are failing to show the necessary level of ambition. Alok Sharma was speaking at the conclusion of a virtual climate summit organised by the UK, UN and France. He said ""real progress"" had been made and 45 countries had put forward new climate plans for 2030. But these were not enough to prevent dangerous warming this century, Mr Sharma explained. Taking place on the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, the summit heard the UN Secretary General warn that every country needed to declare a climate emergency. Around 70 heads of state and government took part in the meeting, which was organised by the UK, UN and France. They outlined new pledges and commitments to curb carbon. China's contribution was eagerly awaited, not just because it is the world's biggest emitter, but because it has recently promised to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Achieving net zero means that emissions have been cut as much as possible and any remaining releases are balanced by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere, What is climate change? EU leaders raise target for emissions cut to 55% Covid drives record emissions drop in 2020 Have countries kept their climate change promises? But while President Xi Jinping outlined a range of new targets for 2030, many analysts felt these did not go far enough. India brought little in the way of new commitments but Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country was on track to achieve its goals under the Paris agreement and promised a major uptick in wind and solar energy. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world According to the UK, some 24 countries had outlined net zero commitments and 20 had now set out plans to adapt and become more resilient to rising temperatures and their impacts. But despite these commitments, Mr Sharma said not enough had been achieved. ""Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,"" he said. ""But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. ""Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough."" Mr Sharma re-stated a commitment made last year to double the UK's international climate finance spend. This will bring it to at least Â£11.6bn over the next five years. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would ""save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson outlines a 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" He added: ""Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere - against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming."" Meanwhile, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised rich countries for spending 50% more of their pandemic recovery cash on fossil fuels compared to low-carbon energy. Mr Guterres said that 38 countries had already declared a climate emergency and he called on leaders worldwide to now do the same. On Covid recovery spending, he said that this is money being borrowed from future generations. ""We cannot use these resources to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mountain of debt on a broken planet,"" he said. The meeting is taking place after the pandemic caused the postponement of the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting, which had been due to take place in Glasgow this year. The UK has announced an end to support for overseas fossil fuel projects, and has today deposited a new climate plan with the UN. It's the first time that Britain has had to do this, as it was previously covered by the European Union's climate commitments. The UK pointed to its new commitment on overseas fossil fuel projects as well as a new carbon cutting target of 68% by 2030, announced last week by the prime minister. The EU presented a new 2030 target of a 55% cut in emissions, agreed after all-night negotiations this week. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: ""It is the go-ahead for scaling up climate action across our economy and society."" China's President Xi Jinping announced that the country would reduce its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% compared with 2005 levels. China will also increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by about 25%. And President Xi pledged to increase forest cover and boost wind and solar capacity. Hurricane Iota was one of a record number of storms to wreak havoc on the Americas this year But Manish Bapna, managing director of the World Resources Institute (WRI) said: ""The strengthened renewable energy, carbon intensity, and forest targets are steps in the right direction, but recent WRI analysis shows that China would benefit more economically and socially if it aims higher, including by peaking emissions as early as possible."" Although President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris pact, the summit saw statements from the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, and the Democrat governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who said the US was ""all-in"" on tackling climate change. Pope Francis said the Vatican had committed to reaching net zero emissions, similar to carbon neutrality, before 2050. ""The time has come to change course. Let us not rob future generations of the hope for a better future,"" he said. A number of big emitters, including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Mexico, did not take part, as their climate actions were not deemed ambitious enough. Some observers believe this hard line on some countries is justified. ""From a kind of symbolic procedural point of view, it's good to have everybody on board,"" said Prof Heike Schroeder from the University of East Anglia. ""But from a proactive, creating some kind of sense of urgency approach, it also makes sense to say we only get to hear from you if you have something new to say."" The five years since the Paris agreement was adopted have been the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and emissions have continued to accrue in the atmosphere. But many countries and businesses have started the process of decarbonisation in that time. The progress they've made now needs to be acknowledged and encouraged, says former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. ""That progress that's been seen in the real economy has to be reflected and incentivised further by those additional commitments,"" she said. One area that yielded little progress at this meeting was the question of finance. Rich countries had promised to mobilise $100bn a year from 2020 under the Paris agreement - but the commitments on cash are not forthcoming. Follow Matton Twitter.,external What is climate change?

'Trials may collapse' as Covid delays continue,"There are fears the justice system could collapse as victims and defendants wait years for trials during the coronavirus pandemic. While jury trials have resumed, a backlog of cases means some trials have been pushed back to 2023. Now those representing victims and defendants in Wales have told the BBC trials could collapse due to the waits. The UK government said it was investing record sums in justice, and opening temporary courts to clear cases. By the end of February 2020, pre-Covid, the number of outstanding cases in crown court in England and Wales had reached 39,331,official figures show,external. 'Please don't forget us': Victims and accused face delays Call to tackle backlog of criminal court cases But by the end of October this backlog had increased to 51,595 - a rise of 31% in eight months. HM Courts and Tribunal Services (HMTS) said the number of cases being resolved in crown courts had trebled since lockdown in April, and it was investing Â£110m to boost capacity. While criminal trials have resumed after the initial lockdown, those working in the courts say a lack of open court rooms able to hold socially-distanced trials means the backlog in cases was growing almost daily. Now, some barristers and solicitors and those supporting victims, witnesses and defendants across Wales have warned lengthy waits could see cases collapse. They fear criminals who may have been convicted at trial could walk free as witnesses and victims lose faith, while innocent defendants could spend years - sometimes in custody - waiting to have their names cleared. James Rossiter, spokesman for the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said: ""Delays are going through the roof, there is a risk in rape cases that complainants will give up and walk away. ""I've heard that this is already happening, people are wanting to get on with their lives. ""It is impacting everybody, defendants' lives are on hold. It's not great for justice, it means that people who might have been convicted will walk free and could harm someone else."" This video can not be played How a jury trial takes place with social distancing Jury trials across England and Wales were halted at the end of March, as the pandemic hit, with almost half of courts shut and hearings being held via video link. But those working in the justice system say a backlog of cases existed before coronavirus, with the virus only serving to exacerbate a growing ""crisis"". In February, more than 9,000 cases were being brought before crown courts for hearings and trials, but judges were only able to dispose of around 8,400, while in the last week before lockdown 292 trials were delayed. The CBA, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said budget cuts leading to court closures, usable court rooms remaining shut and a lack of staff led to cases piling up in recent years. Court closures 'hurting witnesses and vulnerable suspects' 'Severe shortage' of magistrates in Wales In May, the first jurors were sworn back in at Cardiff Crown Court as jury trials resumed. But like most aspects of life, the court system had to adjust. One of the major challenges of clearing the backlog during the pandemic is making sure no-one comes into contact with anyone with coronavirus. Major efforts have been made to make courts safe, with glass screens installed in over 400 courts and jury deliberation rooms, with over 250 courtrooms assessed as ""capable and able to hold trials"", HM Courts and Tribunals said. The use of video links is also helping, with new video technology being used for 70,000 hearings in magistrates' and crown courts during the pandemic. In Scotland, jurors have heard trials from cinemas - with the most-serious criminal cases streamed live via video-link onto the screen in a bid to clear their backlog. Jury trials in England and Wales involve 12 jurors, court staff, barristers and legal teams, and while some can give evidence via video link, many still need to attend court. ""If one person goes down the whole thing collapses,"" Scott Bowen, a solicitor in Cardiff and Newport, said. Ahead of courts reopening, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnettsaid radical measures would be needed to restart trials, as many old court buildings were not suitable for social-distancing. More nightingale courts are planned to open in the new year to free up courts In England and Wales, 16 temporary courts -known as Nightingale Courtbuildings - were opened to free up court rooms for trials needing cells and secure docks. Only one is currently operating in Wales, in Swansea, and the CBA said, with few courts acting at capacity, at least 60 extra criminal court rooms would need to be opened to deal with the rising cases. ""The government assured us we would have over 255 court rooms ready to hear trials, which were secure, safe, but that is nowhere near enough,"" Mr Rossiter said. Some courts have trialled extended opening hours, and HMCTS wants to extend this to crown courts as officials tackle the backlog. But Mr Rossiter warned this move would be against the human rights of advocates and would discriminate against those with caring responsibilities, as well as causing issues for witnesses, defendants and court staff. This video can not be played Matt Jukes warned officers were having to work hard to keep victims and witnesses engaged due to the backlog Since March, the backlog of cases has widened, with hundreds of trials being pushed back every week. In the last week of October, just 99 crown court trials took place across England and Wales, while 465 trials were postponed. Trials involving several defendants - mostly serious crimes including trafficking, gang violence, human slavery, and sex offences - are particularly problematic due to social distancing, and many simply cannot be held. The CBA estimates at least 120 ""multi-hand"" trials are sitting in the system without a date. These are known as ""orphaned trials"". ""It means the date given for some of the bails are unacceptable, we are seeing people being given provisional trail dates for late 2022 and 2023, for offences that might have happened two or three years ago,"" Mr Rossiter said. ""There is a bigger risk of people getting anxious, or being intimidated the longer you wait. There are greater risks of self-harm. It is miserable."" However, where additional courts have been sitting on a Saturday, HMTS said it had been ""consistently completing more cases than they received"" and the case load was falling. Alice says she was prepared to go to court to face her attacker, but had a victim impact statement read out speaking of the trauma he had caused In February, Alice - who is partially sighted - was attacked by a stranger and dragged along a crowded street in south Wales. Her attacker only fled when a woman stopped her car and challenged him. Alice (not her real name) did not want to contact the police, having not being believed by officers in the past, but after approaching Victim Support for help she reported the hate crime. ""It was clear when he grabbed me he wasn't trying to rob me, he really wanted to hurt me. I believe that it could have been death,"" she said. The man was identified but Covid-19 complications and a skipped court date led to delays. However, he eventually admitted common assault by battery and was jailed for 12 weeks. While Alice believes she was lucky not to have faced a lengthy wait, she has been left traumatised and shaken by the attack. ""He may be free now, but I am still suffering,"" she said. Information and support is available via BBC Action Line Alice said she she was speaking out to encourage others not to lose hope in the system. ""Don't give up hope, sometimes justice does prevail, you will get through it,"" she said. On four occasions, Mr Bowen's client packed a bag and said goodbye to his family, ready to go to prison. But each time the man, who was arrested in December 2018 for supplying Class A drugs and waited 22 months to be sentenced, had his case adjourned. He was eventually given a suspended sentence due to the impact of the delays, which the judge said was a form of punishment. ""Some people are waiting so long, by the time they get to court they have pretty much had a mental breakdown,"" said Mr Bowen, a solicitor in Cardiff and Newport and member of The Law Society. He added that, with only four courtrooms able to run trails at Cardiff Crown Court, cases were being pushed back months. ""It's chaos, there are cases being moved left, right and centre."" Scott Bowen said people could be serving months on remand in almost total isolation due to the virus and then eventually be acquitted During the pandemic, the UK government extended the amount of time a defendant could be held incustody before trial, from six to eight months, before applications have to be made to extend the time in custody if the trial is delayed. And with fewer people going to trial, the number of people in prison who are yet to be convicted is growing. By September,the latest data available,external, the number of people in prison on remand - either awaiting trial or sentencing - had reached 12,274, equating to around one in six prisoners, the highest level since 2014. Meanwhile, the number of prisoners serving sentences has fallen below 62,000, a 10% fall since 2019. As less people are being sentenced. ""People can serve two years on remand, that's the equivalent of a four-year sentence,"" Mr Bowen said, adding the prisons were on lockdown with people confined to their cells for all but two 45-minute slots a day. ""They could be in custody for eight months and be acquitted. There are defendants who know their cases will take 18 months and are taking a chance the witnesses will just give up. ""A few weeks ago, they had a whole wing in isolation in Cardiff prison, it meant none of the defendants could go to court, we couldn't have conferences with them. ""It is a crisis. If we want it to work it needs investment, we are now at a breaking point,"" he added. Those accused of a crime are waiting longer and longer for their day in court, to clear their name or to be convicted. Now a couple, who were both wrongly accused, have set up a charity which aims to help defendants and their families left in ""limbo"" as cases drag on. Liam Allan, who was falsely accused of 23 counts of rape and sexual assault as a student, and Hannah Arkwright, set up the helpline during lockdown. Ms Arkwright said a lot of defendants were being given trial dates that were years away, and many were feeling suicidal, isolated and alone. ""We get a lot of people feeling like there's never going to be an end,"" she said. ""Once you've lost your job, your family, your friends, so what's the point anymore... people have no where to turn."" Ms Arkwright said, once arrested, there was little people could do but wait to be charged. Once charged, they had to wait for their day in court. ""One friend's case was postponed for two weeks because they had to air jury bundles, they need to print them off 24 hours beforehand and air them,"" she said. ""Someone I know was meant to have his trial in March and it's now been pushed back to September 2022. ""It's impossible not to think about it, you are constantly thinking, 'there's no point me doing this because I might spend years in prison'. Even before people have been charged, they have literally lost everything."" A HMCTS spokeswoman said the backlog in magistrates' courts was continuing to fall and the number of cases resolved in crown courts had increased since April. ""To drive this recovery further we are investing Â£110m in a range of measures to boost capacity, including recruiting 1,600 new staff and shortly opening several more Nightingale Courts,"" she said. ""These efforts will be bolstered by an extra Â£337m the UK government is spending next year to deliver swifter justice and support victims, while Â£76m will further increase capacity in family courts and tribunals.""

Space tourism: Virgin space plane set to fly,"Virgin Galactic is set to carry out a milestone test flight of its rocket-powered tourist plane on Saturday. This will be the first crewed flight of its reusable Unity vehicle to take off from the purpose-built commercial spaceport in New Mexico, US. Sir Richard Branson's company,externalwill begin space tourism flights in 2021. Already, more than 600 paying customers - including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio - are booked to take a ride on the plane. The woman who paid $250,000 to go into space Astronaut crew launch to space station Light pollution's wasted energy seen from space This video can not be played Virgin Galactic gives a glimpse of what it will look like inside the Unity vehicle Saturday's flight will be the first of three final demonstration flights before that commercial service begins. It is on the third of these that Sir Richard Branson himself will test the service he's been promising for 16 years. Before that can happen Virgin Galactic needs to go through some final preparatory steps. Saturday's mission will have just the two pilots on board - former Nasa astronaut CJ Sturckow and Galactic chief test pilot Dave Mackay. They will run checks on all their plane's operating procedures by making the first ever powered climb above Spaceport America, the centre that was developed specifically for this commercial operation by the New Mexico state government. It has been a long road for the company's engineers to get the technology to where they want it, and progress this year has, of course, been slowed by the Covid-19 crisis, with limited numbers of staff able to work both in New Mexico and at Galactic's manufacturing base in California. Will Whitehorn, president of the UK Space Industry Group,,externaldescribed the flight as a huge milestone. ""This is going to be a very safe and low-cost system,"" he told BBC News. ""Developing it has been ground-breaking and it hasn't been easy."" A fatal accident back in 2014led to an investigation and the redesign of some elements of the system. ""But when it comes to space, you're not in a race with anyone. You're in a race to be safe,"" said Mr Whitehorn. The craft will also serve as an astronaut training facility. ""At the moment, we have to train them in simulated environments - swimming pools and so-called vomit comets, which are planes that dive out of the sky,"" he explained. ""So as well as space tourism and space science, that training will be a crucial component of the industrial revolution that is coming to space."" The cabin has a big mirror at the rear so passengers can see themselves weightless Virgin Galactic recently unveiled the design of the tourist cabin. Passengers will sit in seats that move to manage G-forces in the different phases of flight - on the boost up to space and on the descent back to Earth. They'll get personal seat-back screens that display live flight data, and the 12 large windows - more than any other spacecraft in history, according to the company - are designed to ensure no passenger has to compete for a view when they unbuckle at the top of the climb to float free inside the cabin. There will even be a big mirror at the aft end so they can see themselves weightless.Â FollowJonathan,externalandVictoria,externalon Twitter Virgin Galactic set for last key test flights Astronaut crew launch to space station At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

US Pfizer Covid vaccine approved for emergency use,"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. The agency said the authorisation was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, which taken more than 295,000 lives in the US. The vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, was deemed safe and effective by the FDA. President Donald Trump said the first vaccinations will take place ""in less than 24 hours"". ""Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle,"" Mr Trump said. ""We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months."" Before the announcement on Friday night, the FDA had come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the vaccine's use. The head of the agency, Stephen Hahn, was told to approve it for emergency use by Friday or quit, US media reported, although he called this ""untrue"". In further comments at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Hahn said he was ready to be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was available and stressed that the agency had not compromised safety in its testing. The issue of allergies was also addressed after testing in the UK produced a small number of allergic reactions. Dr Peter Marks, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said the few reactions in the UK ""were not seen in the larger trial data sets, but we still need to know more and we'll be taking precautions"". He added that the FDA was ""comfortable giving the vaccine to patients who have had other allergic reactions other than severe allergic reactions to a vaccine or one of its components"". His advice was that those with a history of allergies should consult a doctor. Covid: When can I get vaccinated in the US? Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters earlier on Friday that his department would work with Pfizer to get the mass vaccination programme started by Monday or Tuesday. The Pfizer vaccine has already received regulatory approval in the UK, Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Like those countries, the US will give its first doses of the vaccine to the elderly, health workers and emergency crew. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US. On Wednesday, the country recorded more than 3,000 deaths - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world. ""The FDA's authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,"" said Mr Hahn. He said the authorisation came after ""an open and transparent review process"" that ensured the vaccine met the ""FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality"". The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the coming days On Thursday, medical experts advising the FDA recommended the emergency-use authorisation. A 23-member panel concluded the vaccine's benefits outweighed its risks. Emergency use, the FDA said, is not the same as full approval, which would require Pfizer to file a separate application to secure. ""While not an FDA approval, today's emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,"" said Dr Marks. On Friday, President Trump sent out an angry tweet calling the FDA a ""big, old, slow turtle"", adding: ""Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives."" The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Mr Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing three sources. US media reported that FDA Commissioner Hahn had been ordered to approve the vaccine's use by Friday But Mr Hahn told US media he had only been ""encouraged to continue working expeditiously"" on the vaccine's approval, and that the media representation of the chief of staff's phone call was ""untrue"". Amid the reports of White House pressure, President-elect Joe Biden said he wanted to make it clear to the public that they should have confidence in the vaccine, adding: ""There is no political influence."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Operation Warp Speed says that vaccine deliveries will begin within 24 hours of approval. ""We have made sure that this vaccine will be free, for all Americans,"" Mr Trump said in a recorded video posted to Twitter. ""We have already begun shipping the vaccine to every state and zip code in the country. The first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours."" Allow Twitter content?

Pfizer plans to have 6.4 million doses ready for the US in its first rollout round in late December. Because two injections are required per person, that is enough for three million people, out of a total US population of 330 million. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups. The nation's approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Mr Trump said vaccines ""will vanquish the virus and return life back to normal"". But officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021. A second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, is also seeking emergency approval in the US. Like the Pfizer vaccine it requires a second round of injections.

Missed Klarna payments may soon hit credit scores,"Klarna has 10 million customers in the UK and was recently valued at Â£7.5bn The Buy Now, Pay Later company Klarna plans to report missed and failed payments to credit reference agencies. Klarna gives customers different ways to pay for items online such as within 30 days or over three instalments. The company doesn't currently report customers who miss payments. ""What we are looking at in terms of to protect consumers is to work with the credit reference agencies to enable reporting in the future,"" Klarna's Alex Marsh, told Radio 4's Money Box. Mr Marsh, Klarna's UK lead, said while the company only accepts customers which it believes can pay on time, it freezes or closes down the accounts of those who end up missing too many payments or make none at all. ""We work with debt collection agencies to support customers on payment plans. They [debt collectors] do not have the ability to report back into the credit reference agencies,"" Mr Marsh said. Mr Marsh also said deferred payments services like Klarna should to be regulated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ""At the moment with a complaint, we'll treat them the same way internally. But once it reaches a certain stage, consumers won't have the right to escalate to the financial ombudsman,"" Mr Marsh said. FCA regulation would mean that Klarna customers can contact the Financial Ombudsman to resolve disputes with a company. ""Buy now, pay later"" allows customers to delay payment or split it into smaller instalments Alice Tapper, a campaigner who has called for tougher rules to stop customers falling into debt with buy now, pay later services, welcomed regulation. ""The product can encourage people to spend beyond their means and leave them unprotected if things go wrong,"" Ms Tapper said. ""There should be more transparency around credit scores and the way their products are promoted as being a payment provider rather than a form of loan or credit."" Klarna has boomed over the last few months. On Black Friday in November, the company said it processed 100 transactions a second in all the countries it operates in and did more transactions in a single day than over the last four years. Over 10 million customers have now used Klarna to pay for items in the UK. The FCA is reviewing how the deferred payment market is regulated in the UK and the results are expected in early 2021. Chris Woolard, the regulator's former chief executive, is leading the review which warns that customers can end up losing control of their finances when buy now, pay later services don't work well.

New parts of Aztec skull tower unearthed in Mexico,"The skull tower was discovered five years ago under Mexico City Archaeologists have excavated more sections of an extraordinary Aztec tower of human skulls under the centre of Mexico City. Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) said a further 119 skulls had been uncovered. The tower was discovered in 2015 during the restoration of a building in the Mexican capital. It is believed to be part of a skull rack from the temple to the Aztec god of the sun, war and human sacrifice. Known as the Huey Tzompantli, the skull rack stood on the corner of the chapel of Huitzilopochtli, the patron of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs were a group of Nahuatl-speaking peoples that dominated large parts of central Mexico from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Their empire was overthrown by invaders led by the Spanish conquistador HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s, who captured Tenochtitlan in 1521. The tower of human skulls is believed to form part of the Huey Tzompantli A similar structure to the Huey Tzompantli struck fear in the soldiers accompanying the Spanish conqueror when they invaded the city. The cylindrical structure is near the huge Metropolitan Cathedral built over the Templo Mayor, one of the main temples of Tenochtitlan, now modern day Mexico City. ""The Templo Mayor continues to surprise us, and the Huey Tzompantli is without doubt one of the most impressive archaeological finds of recent years in our country,"" Mexican Culture Minister Alejandra Frausto said. Archaeologists have identified three construction phases of the tower, which dates back to between 1486 and 1502. This video can not be played Archaeologist Lorena Vazquez explains why the Aztecs created their skull towers The tower's original discovery surprised anthropologists, who had been expecting to find the skulls of young male warriors, but also unearthed the crania of women and children, raising questions about human sacrifice in the Aztec Empire. ""Although we can't say how many of these individuals were warriors, perhaps some were captives destined for sacrificial ceremonies,"" said archaeologist Raul Barrera. ""We do know that they were all made sacred,"" he added. ""Turned into gifts for the gods or even personifications of deities themselves.""

Pubs in Scotland prepare for level 3 reopening,"Bars and restaurants across much of western and central Scotand have been shut for three weeks Pubs, restaurants and cafes across much of central western Scotland - including Glasgow - have reopened for the first time in three weeks. It comes as the areas move from level four to level three in the country's tiered system of Covid restrictions. Two million people in 11 council areas had been subject to the level four restrictions since 20 November. Hospitality venues are now allowed to reopen, however, no alcohol can be sold, and premises must close at 18:00. Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? Pub ban on background music to be lifted Figures released on Saturday,externalshowed another 39 people had died after contracting coronavirus. They also showed that a further 1,064 new cases of the virus were recorded since Friday  - with 5.2% of the 23,295 tests carried out returning a positive result. The 11 local authority areas where restrictions have been eased have seen case numbers fall, but there have been warnings that they could increase again ahead of Christmas unless people continue to be careful. Strict travel restrictions remain in place - so it is still against the law for people outside of the Glasgow City Council area to travel to the city for non-essential reasons, such as Christmas shopping or a meal out. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday the decline in cases across the level four areas could ""very easily go into reverse"" unless people continued to abide by the rules. She said this was particularly true of the ban on visiting other people's houses - which remains in place across all of mainland Scotland. Across the region, dining venues have struggled to survive the repeated lockdowns. The Fox and Willow in Ayr will be open again for sit-in customers from Saturday Allan Low, from the Fox and Willow in Ayr, said: ""It's been a tough time for everyone but hospitality has been hit as hard as anyone has. His restaurant and bar, which can normally seat 120 people, reopened for sit-in customers at 09:00 on Saturday, and despite the usually busy festive season, he is only hoping to break even. ""We feel very strongly that a restaurant is one of the safest environments now,"" he said. ""We have put a lot of money in, going beyond the government guidelines, to make sure our customers can be very confident."" Mr Low is hoping that the virus rates will not creep back up as restrictions ease. ""A return to tier four could be catastrophic for hospitality,"" he added. A maximum of six people from two households can meet in hospitality venues, either indoors or outdoors. Children under the age of 12 from those two households do not count towards the total number of people. That means a children's party with children from several households would not be allowed, but six adults and four children from two households could meet. All hospitality venues need to provide table service and face-coverings will be needed when customers are not seated. Physical distancing for people from separate households is required, and people are advised to avoid visiting more than one venue each day. Takeaways can still operate as normal. Hotels and other accommodation providers can serve food to guests staying in their premises until 22:00. Room service, including alcohol, is allowed as normal. In Glasgow, some city centre venues have opted not to reopen while others have adapted their business. A spokeswoman for Lynnet Leisure, which owns restaurants including the art deco oyster bar Roganos and nearby Chippy Doon the Lane, said their venues had been closed since the first lockdown but would re-open in the future. Colin and Carol Clydesdale, the owners of the Ubiquitous Chip in Glasgow's west end, said they were glad to be reopening in time for Christmas. ""The restrictions are becoming very difficult and we are trying to make it work for our guests to have a great time over the festive period,"" they said. The restaurant will open on Christmas Day for the first time this year, but its 50th anniversary party on Hogmanay will be postponed. Some bars such as Sweeney's are offering a takeaway service for drinks Pubs that do not serve food are unable to open under level three rules, although some have opted to adapt their business. The Wee Pub attached to The Ubiquitous Chip has been repurposed as a shop selling locally made gifts, hampers and takeaway food and drinks. On the southside of the city, Dom Sweeney, owner of Sweeney's on the Park in Shawlands, said they were going to offer take away and delivery of cocktails and draught pints, which was successful for the pub during the summer. And although the pub cannot serve alcohol or host its usual live bands, it would open each day under level three restrictions.

Space tourism: Virgin space plane set to flySir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic embarks on the first crewed flight of its rocket-powered tourist plane.Science & Environment,"Virgin Galactic is set to carry out a milestone test flight of its rocket-powered tourist plane on Saturday. This will be the first crewed flight of its reusable Unity vehicle to take off from the purpose-built commercial spaceport in New Mexico, US. Sir Richard Branson's company,externalwill begin space tourism flights in 2021. Already, more than 600 paying customers - including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio - are booked to take a ride on the plane. The woman who paid $250,000 to go into space Astronaut crew launch to space station Light pollution's wasted energy seen from space This video can not be played Virgin Galactic gives a glimpse of what it will look like inside the Unity vehicle Saturday's flight will be the first of three final demonstration flights before that commercial service begins. It is on the third of these that Sir Richard Branson himself will test the service he's been promising for 16 years. Before that can happen Virgin Galactic needs to go through some final preparatory steps. Saturday's mission will have just the two pilots on board - former Nasa astronaut CJ Sturckow and Galactic chief test pilot Dave Mackay. They will run checks on all their plane's operating procedures by making the first ever powered climb above Spaceport America, the centre that was developed specifically for this commercial operation by the New Mexico state government. It has been a long road for the company's engineers to get the technology to where they want it, and progress this year has, of course, been slowed by the Covid-19 crisis, with limited numbers of staff able to work both in New Mexico and at Galactic's manufacturing base in California. Will Whitehorn, president of the UK Space Industry Group,,externaldescribed the flight as a huge milestone. ""This is going to be a very safe and low-cost system,"" he told BBC News. ""Developing it has been ground-breaking and it hasn't been easy."" A fatal accident back in 2014led to an investigation and the redesign of some elements of the system. ""But when it comes to space, you're not in a race with anyone. You're in a race to be safe,"" said Mr Whitehorn. The craft will also serve as an astronaut training facility. ""At the moment, we have to train them in simulated environments - swimming pools and so-called vomit comets, which are planes that dive out of the sky,"" he explained. ""So as well as space tourism and space science, that training will be a crucial component of the industrial revolution that is coming to space."" The cabin has a big mirror at the rear so passengers can see themselves weightless Virgin Galactic recently unveiled the design of the tourist cabin. Passengers will sit in seats that move to manage G-forces in the different phases of flight - on the boost up to space and on the descent back to Earth. They'll get personal seat-back screens that display live flight data, and the 12 large windows - more than any other spacecraft in history, according to the company - are designed to ensure no passenger has to compete for a view when they unbuckle at the top of the climb to float free inside the cabin. There will even be a big mirror at the aft end so they can see themselves weightless.Â FollowJonathan,externalandVictoria,externalon Twitter Virgin Galactic set for last key test flights Astronaut crew launch to space station At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

UK to end support for overseas fossil fuel projects,"Mr Sharma said progress had been made, but it was not enough yet to avoid dangerous warming this century The UK minister tasked with leading UN climate talks says world leaders are failing to show the necessary level of ambition. Alok Sharma was speaking at the conclusion of a virtual climate summit organised by the UK, UN and France. He said ""real progress"" had been made and 45 countries had put forward new climate plans for 2030. But these were not enough to prevent dangerous warming this century, Mr Sharma explained. Taking place on the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, the summit heard the UN Secretary General warn that every country needed to declare a climate emergency. Around 70 heads of state and government took part in the meeting, which was organised by the UK, UN and France. They outlined new pledges and commitments to curb carbon. China's contribution was eagerly awaited, not just because it is the world's biggest emitter, but because it has recently promised to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Achieving net zero means that emissions have been cut as much as possible and any remaining releases are balanced by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere, What is climate change? EU leaders raise target for emissions cut to 55% Covid drives record emissions drop in 2020 Have countries kept their climate change promises? But while President Xi Jinping outlined a range of new targets for 2030, many analysts felt these did not go far enough. India brought little in the way of new commitments but Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country was on track to achieve its goals under the Paris agreement and promised a major uptick in wind and solar energy. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world According to the UK, some 24 countries had outlined net zero commitments and 20 had now set out plans to adapt and become more resilient to rising temperatures and their impacts. But despite these commitments, Mr Sharma said not enough had been achieved. ""Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,"" he said. ""But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. ""Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough."" Mr Sharma re-stated a commitment made last year to double the UK's international climate finance spend. This will bring it to at least Â£11.6bn over the next five years. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would ""save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson outlines a 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" He added: ""Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere - against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming."" Meanwhile, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised rich countries for spending 50% more of their pandemic recovery cash on fossil fuels compared to low-carbon energy. Mr Guterres said that 38 countries had already declared a climate emergency and he called on leaders worldwide to now do the same. On Covid recovery spending, he said that this is money being borrowed from future generations. ""We cannot use these resources to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mountain of debt on a broken planet,"" he said. The meeting is taking place after the pandemic caused the postponement of the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting, which had been due to take place in Glasgow this year. The UK has announced an end to support for overseas fossil fuel projects, and has today deposited a new climate plan with the UN. It's the first time that Britain has had to do this, as it was previously covered by the European Union's climate commitments. The UK pointed to its new commitment on overseas fossil fuel projects as well as a new carbon cutting target of 68% by 2030, announced last week by the prime minister. The EU presented a new 2030 target of a 55% cut in emissions, agreed after all-night negotiations this week. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: ""It is the go-ahead for scaling up climate action across our economy and society."" China's President Xi Jinping announced that the country would reduce its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% compared with 2005 levels. China will also increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by about 25%. And President Xi pledged to increase forest cover and boost wind and solar capacity. Hurricane Iota was one of a record number of storms to wreak havoc on the Americas this year But Manish Bapna, managing director of the World Resources Institute (WRI) said: ""The strengthened renewable energy, carbon intensity, and forest targets are steps in the right direction, but recent WRI analysis shows that China would benefit more economically and socially if it aims higher, including by peaking emissions as early as possible."" Although President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris pact, the summit saw statements from the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, and the Democrat governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who said the US was ""all-in"" on tackling climate change. Pope Francis said the Vatican had committed to reaching net zero emissions, similar to carbon neutrality, before 2050. ""The time has come to change course. Let us not rob future generations of the hope for a better future,"" he said. A number of big emitters, including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Mexico, did not take part, as their climate actions were not deemed ambitious enough. Some observers believe this hard line on some countries is justified. ""From a kind of symbolic procedural point of view, it's good to have everybody on board,"" said Prof Heike Schroeder from the University of East Anglia. ""But from a proactive, creating some kind of sense of urgency approach, it also makes sense to say we only get to hear from you if you have something new to say."" The five years since the Paris agreement was adopted have been the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and emissions have continued to accrue in the atmosphere. But many countries and businesses have started the process of decarbonisation in that time. The progress they've made now needs to be acknowledged and encouraged, says former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. ""That progress that's been seen in the real economy has to be reflected and incentivised further by those additional commitments,"" she said. One area that yielded little progress at this meeting was the question of finance. Rich countries had promised to mobilise $100bn a year from 2020 under the Paris agreement - but the commitments on cash are not forthcoming. Follow Matton Twitter.,external What is climate change?

The sticking points,"The teams negotiating a deal on trade and other issues between the UK and the EU are still locked in talks, with time running short. There have been cautious reports of progress but also of serious, remaining differences - political leaders on both sides say they do not know if an agreement will emerge. They are certainly leaving it very late - the UK/EU transition period (during which rules and trade have stayed the same) ends on 31 December. So, what are the issues still to be resolved? Even though fishing makes up only a tiny part of the economy on both sides, it was central to the Leave campaign that won the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016. It's also an important issue in several EU countries - such as France. The EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue operating in UK waters, where they currently catch nearly Â£600m worth of fish every year. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK wants most of that business back and says it will prioritise its own boats after 1 January when it will become an independent coastal state, outside the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So, the dispute is not just about access, but also about a bigger share of the fishing quota for the UK fleet - not just where you can fish, but what you can catch. And if the UK gains, which countries' fishing fleets will lose the most? These are really tricky issues to resolve. There's also been disagreement about the length of a potential transition period, before new measures come into full force. Any compromise lies somewhere between the EU asking for eight years and the UK offering three. Brexit trade deal: What do the UK and the EU want? Who really owns UK fishing quotas? If there is no agreement on access to fishing waters, the UK won't get full access to the EU market, without tariffs (or taxes), to sell its fish there. Last year, around three quarters of UK fish exports went to the EU. This is all about rules on fair competition for billions of pounds of business, now and in the future. The idea of level playing field measures, which appear in most free trade agreements, is to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. Brexit: What is a level playing field? If you cut regulations it can be cheaper to produce things, making some companies more competitive than others, and the EU is worried that the UK could do that in the future. That's why the EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to EU rules on things like workers' rights, the environmental regulations that companies have to follow and state aid (financial subsidies given by government to businesses). The UK, on the other hand, says the whole point of Brexit was to break free from following EU rules. The two sides appear to have agreed a common baseline of regulations on some issues, which neither of them would go below. But the EU has also been insisting on a system which would mean if one side raised standards the other could face penalties, if failing to follow suit resulted in unfair competition. That raises the question of defining precisely what constitutes unfair competition. The EU has also tried but failed to persuade the UK to mirror its rules on subsidies. The UK says it is determined to assert and defend its sovereignty. This is mainly about how the rules of the deal will be enforced in future and what happens if one side breaks them. The EU may have conceded that it will not have a unilateral right to impose penalties, but it wants a strong and independent arbitration system that has real teeth. It has been pushing for powers to retaliate against the UK breaking rules in one area, by hitting back in another - for example, imposing tariffs or taxes where it thinks they might hurt most. Such powers would of course cut both ways. There's also the question of who might adjudicate disputes and where precisely the European Court of Justice will fit in. These are all hugely sensitive issues which will set the tone for the future relationship for years to come and only a few people behind the scenes know all the details of where the negotiations have got to. It's still possible that a basic trade deal can be done in the short time that remains. But both sides are going to have to make concessions quickly. It's also worth remembering that the negotiations are not just about trade with the EU (which accounted for 43% of UK exports in 2019 and 51% of UK imports). There is the important issue, for example, of police and security co-operation as well. The UK had wanted to maintain the same access to shared databases that it has now but the EU says that isn't on offer to non-members. A deal would provide better access, though, than no deal at all. There has been important progress on Northern Ireland - the subject of months of separate negotiations on how to implementthe agreement already signed with the EUon keeping the land border as open as it is now. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 On 8 December, the two sides announced""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts at Northern Irish ports (for trade with Great Britain), the supply of food and medicines, and state aid. Some of the arrangements for Northern Ireland would be easier to implement if a trade deal was done, but either way trade between Northern Ireland and the EU will not face tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border. Without a deal, trade between Great Britain and the EU would be subject to tariffs in both directions. Any deal would still need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, but the time to scrutinise it properly has all but run out. That's a problem for such an important agreement between close neighbours. EU law does allow agreements of this kind to be applied provisionally by member states if necessary - but that's never been done before for a trade deal, and there would be opposition in the European parliament to doing that now. And if the trade talks fall apart, don't expect much meaningful agreement on anything else. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

How are both sides preparing?,"The UK has been in a transition period with the EU since last January, during which rules and trade have stayed the same. But all of this will come to an end on 1 January 2021. With just a few weeks left for the UK and the EU to negotiate a trade agreement, both sides are now talking about the prospect of a no-deal outcome. If there's no trade agreement in place, they will have to adjust quickly to doing things very differently. So how are both sides preparing? For the first six months from 1 January, the British government will bring in only minimal checks on goods coming in to the UK, but the EU will have full border checks on goods coming into the EU from the UK straight away. The UK government haswarned thata reasonable worst-case scenario could see queues of 7,000 trucks clogging up the roads around Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The UK government has two contingency plans for this: Operation Brock and Operation Fennel. Operation Brock is a traffic management plan, which it is hoped will prevent more than 10,000 lorries a day from clogging up roads in Kent. Under the scheme, drivers of very large lorries will need to get a special permit - a Kent Access Permit - before they enter the county, and permits will only be issued if they have completed the correct paperwork for exporting goods. Other traffic will be kept flowing around them, in what is known as a contraflow system. Highways England istrialling the moveable road barrier,external, which makes the contraflow system possible, on the M20 over four nights from 11 December. If there are more than 2,000 lorries queued up, the government has made plans for several temporary lorry parks - it bought a 27-acre site in Ashford in Kent. There is also a plan called Operation Fennel in which as many as 7,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could be diverted to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate. This is part of the government's plans for building facilities away from ports. If further capacity is needed, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. The UK government has also set up the Border Operations Centre to co-ordinate the response to any further disruption. Queuing at ports is not the only problem for lorry drivers. If no further steps are taken, UK lorry drivers would need to apply for documents called ECMT permits to be allowed to enter EU countries.The European Commission has warned that,externalthere are not enough of these permits available, which would mean not enough UK lorries being able to travel to the EU to pick up goods to bring back to the UK. The European Commission said this could result in serious disruptions, ""potentially even threatening public order"". To prevent this, it proposed allowing UK lorries and buses into the EU for six months without special permits, as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK. The proposals would also allow regular bus services that pick up and drop off passengers on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue to do so. The UK has not been clear yet on whether it plans to continue to allow EU operators to enter the country. A similar proposal is on the table for aviation. In the event of no deal, the UK would no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area, which allows British airlines to fly to destinations in the EU, and vice versa. The European Commission is proposing a six month regulation to allow flights to continue until a new agreement is in place, but it would require the UK government to offer the same to operators from EU countries. The UK has not yet responded to the proposal. The UK government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile and plan alternative supply routes in case of border problems. It has also arranged extra freight capacity for pharmaceutical companies should they need it. Ina memo, seen by the BBCin June, pharmaceutical companies warned the government that some stockpiles of medicines have been ""used up entirely"" by the coronavirus pandemic and said these could not be replenished in time for the UK's exit from the EU. The head of the Association of  the British Pharmaceutical Industrywarned,externalthat not having any sort of deal would cause ""increased complexity, duplication and cost"" in the middle of a pandemic. The government insisted, however, that ""robust contingency plans are in place"". For the coronavirus vaccine, the government says there are contingency plans for making sure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made in Belgium can be shipped to the UK if border problems arise. These include alternative sea routes and the use of freight oreven military aircraft. The European Commission has also proposed extending the deadline to reach an agreement on fishing until the end of December 2021. This would allow European fishing vessels to continue fishing in British waters and vice-versa for another year, or until an agreement is reached. But a Downing Street spokesman said the UK ""would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state"". The Ministry of Defence has saidit will make four patrol boats availableto monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place"". As things stand, if nothing is agreed then non-UK boats will not be allowed to fish in UK waters from January. But without a deal, the UK fishing industry would find its extensive exports to EU countries being hit by tariffs (import taxes) and regulatory hurdles. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? The French government has said it would hand out compensation to trawlers if they were not able to fish in UK waters.

Coronavirus: Daily updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Saturday.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Saturday. We'll have another update for you on Sunday. The US has become the latest country toapprove the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use. The Food and Drug Administration granted approval after intense pressure from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump said the first vaccines would take place ""in less than 24 hours"". The virus has killed more than 292,000 in the US. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The UK was the first country in the western world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and has already begun the rollout of millions of jabs. The vaccine, which is one of several shots the country has bought supplies of, is manufactured in Belgium and has to be kept at -70C which creates plenty of logistical difficulties in getting the jab into patients' arms.Here is how the UK is planning to inoculate tens of millions of people within months. Key workers were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as well as their three children, ata special pantomime to mark their efforts during the pandemic. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis watched a performance of Pantoland at the London Palladium on Friday. Their father paid tribute to key workers, telling the audience: ""You have given your absolute all this year and made remarkable sacrifices."" A ""test and dine"" pilot scheme has been proposed in Birminghamin a bid to help the struggling hospitality sector. People who want to eat out will need to be tested for Covid-19 a few hours before. The plan, which has been put forward by the city council, is at a very early stage and would need to be approved by the UK government. Meanwhile, in much of central western Scotland, including Glasgow,pubs and cafes are preparing to reopen for the first time in three weeks, as their areas move from level four to level three of the country's tier system. However, no alcohol can be sold, and premises must close at 18:00 GMT. One of theyoungest survivors of the coronavirus pandemic is now ""thriving"", her parents have said. Baby Peyton wasdiagnosed with the virus when she was just three weeks oldbut after causing ""a lot of worry"" in her first six months her parents said she is now a ""parcel of goodness"" who they ""could not be prouder"" of. Mum Tracy Maguire said she was ""an absolute angel"" although she said it still upsets her to think of the early days when Peyton's grandparents could only see her through a window. ""There was so much darkness, but she lights up every room... all you can ever ask for is a happy, healthy baby,"" she said.

"Monkeys could be banned as pets, says governmentMany of the thousands of primates kept in homes in England are said to be living in misery.UK Politics","People in England could be banned from keeping monkeys and other primates as pets, the government has said. Up to 5,000 are living outside licensed zoos in the UK, with animal welfare minister Lord Goldsmith saying many of them are in ""misery"" due to a lack of space and stimulation. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is also looking at restrictions on breeding primates. Aneight-week consultation,externalon the proposed changes has begun. Zoo welcomes 'ping pong ball-sized' twin monkeys Supermarkets snub coconut goods picked by monkeys Primates, including lemurs, monkeys and apes, require open spaces, varied diets, warmth and social contact. Under the plans, those who keep them without a zoo licence would need to obtain a new specialist private primate keeper licence to ensure they are meeting zoo-level welfare standards. Lord Goldsmith said: ""Primates are hugely intelligent and socially complex animals. When they are confined in tiny cages, often alone and with little stimulation, their lives are a misery. ""It's important that we take action to prevent the suffering caused to them when they are kept as pets and so I am delighted that we are moving a big step closer towards banning the practice."" Marmosets are the most commonly held primates in the UK. Capuchins, squirrel monkeys, lemurs and tamarins are also popular species. Dr Ros Clubb, senior scientific manager at the RSPCA, said primates could ""become depressed without adequate stimulation"". She added: ""Sadly, our inspectors are still seeing shocking situations where monkeys are cooped up in bird cages, fed fast food, sugary drinks or even class A drugs, deprived of companions of their own kind, living in dirt and squalor and suffering from disease."" The government is proposing that primates not living in zoos should be registered by councils, with inspectors working out a ""course of action"" for each animal.

Trump's latest legal longshot,"It's been a week of split-screens in American politics. The nation's attention is divided between the president and the president-elect; between the coronavirus vaccine and the rising death toll from the pandemic; between congressional attempts to reach compromise and congressional attempts to rebuff Donald Trump. As the days tick down until the holidays, and a new year, and a new Congress and a new president, here are some of the key political stories from this week. ""For individuals and organisations that champion the rule of law and claim the mantle of the founding principles of our nation to call for overturning an election reeks of hypocrisy""-conservative commentator Linda Chavez,external It was yet another rough week for the president's efforts to reverse the results of his November defeat in the US presidential election. First, the ""safe harbour"" date for states certifying the results arrived on Tuesday with all but one, Wisconsin, meeting the deadline. That will make it much more difficult for Trump's allies in Congress to contest the results of the election in January. Tuesday also delivered a one-two legal punch to the president. The Arizona Supreme Court unanimously ruled that there was no evidence of fraud or misconduct in Joe Biden's victory in that state. And the US Supreme Court batted down a legal challenge to the Democrat's win in that state with a terse, one-sentence ""application denied"" order. What legal challenges remain for Trump? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? That left Trump placing all his judicial hopes on a lawsuit filed by the attorney general of Texas that sought to discard the presidential election results in four states Biden won - Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. Texas asked the court to allow the state legislatures - which all happen to be controlled by Republicans - to determine who should get their electoral college votes. Election law experts largely scoffed at the prospects for the suit - ""utter garbage,""writes UC-Irvine Professor Rick Hasen,external- but 17 other states with Republican attorneys general, as well as Trump himself, joined the effort. On Friday night, the Supreme Court slammed that door closed, as well. The ruling was slightly longer than the one-sentence response in a Pennsylvania case. Two justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, wouldn't have dismissed the lawsuit outright. But even they would not express a view on whether Texas's attempt to throw out millions of votes and effectively hand the presidency to Trump had merit. The decision paves the way for the members of the Electoral College to meet in state capitals across the US on Monday. At that point, Trump's legal challenges to the election will be finished. And while his supporters may try a last-ditch effort to block the Joe Biden's victory in Congress in January, those political manoeuvres are destined to fail. Democrats will make sure of that. The implications of this challenge, however, are unlikely to quickly fade away. In a democracy of 328 million Americans, the presidency came down to what seven people on the Supreme Court thought. That will be something Democrats, and the history books, won't quickly forget. I have been through many public health crises before, but this is the toughest one we have ever faced as a nation. The road ahead will not be easy""- Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases When the president wasn't fulminating about the results of the presidential election this week, he was celebrating the development of multiple vaccines to treat Covid-19. At a ""vaccine summit"" event on Tuesday, Trump touted what is, without a doubt, a remarkable medical achievement. ""From the instant the coronavirus invaded our shores, we raced into action to develop a safe and effective vaccine at breakneck speed,"" the president said. ""In order to achieve this goal, we harnessed the full power of government, the genius of American scientists, and the might of American industry to save millions and millions of lives all over the world."" This video can not be played One travel nurse's emotional journey through US Covid hotspots The good news on immunisations, however, comes as record numbers of Americans are dying from Covid-19 every day - and the outlook for the months ahead, before the vaccinations reach most Americans. That was the message Biden was delivering to the nation from his transition headquarters in Delaware at the same time as the White House event. ""We're in a dark winter. Things may well get worse before they get better,"" Biden said. ""A vaccine may soon be available, but we need to level with each other. It will take longer than we would like to distribute it to all corners of our country. We will need to persuade enough Americans to take it. It's daunting, but I promise you that we will make progress starting on day one."" Trump hosts holiday events as Covid cases soar The mask-wearing US city that bucked the trend Biden was unveiling his choices for top health positions in his administration, including California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for health secretary, Vivek Murthy as surgeon general and Fauci as this ""chief medical adviser on Covid-19"". The president-elect said once inaugurated on 20 January, he would mandate mask-usage in interstate commerce and on federal property, distribute 100 million doses of vaccine in his first 100 days and prioritise reopening schools. It's a tall order, but his administration's ability to control the pandemic, and efficiently and equitably distribute the vaccine, will be the standard by which his early success as president will be judged. Members of the House and Senate have been engaged in good-faith negotiations and continue to make progress. The bipartisan talks are the best hope for a bipartisan solution""- Democratic Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer The public-health aspect of the coronavirus pandemic is just one component of the crisis currently facing US policymakers. The disease, and efforts to control its spread, have placed enormous strain on the US economy, as businesses have been forced to close and workers lose their jobs While Republicans and Democrats in Congress and Trump administration officials have been negotiating another round of economic stimulus for months to no avail, a bipartisan group of legislators gave new life to attempts at a compromise with their proposal for a $900bn package of aid last week. In an encouraging development, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who had been pushing for nearly three times that amount, endorsed the compromise - while saying that she would ask for more when Biden becomes president. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? A deal needs to be wrapped up in the next few weeks, before this congressional term ends, and there are still a number of big sticking points. Democrats want hundreds of millions of dollars for cash-strapped local and state governments that have seen their revenues drop during the pandemic. Republicans want lawsuit protections for business that stay open. Democrats would like to reauthorise hundreds of dollars in supplemental weekly payments to the unemployed. The Trump administration would prefer a one-time payment to all Americans. It's a lot to try to wrap up in very little time. But with the latest economic figures showing unemployment rising and businesses struggling, the pressure on Congress to do something - anything - is growing. I think one of the things I'm looking for, when I see all of these picks together is: What is the agenda? What is the overall vision going to be? I think that's a little hazy- Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Amidst all the turmoil surrounding Trump's challenge of the election results and the coronavirus pandemic, Biden continues the slow process of unveiling his nominations for top administration jobs. In addition to his health picks this week, Biden has also announced his selections for secretaries of defence (Lloyd Austin), agriculture (Tom Vilsack), veteran's affairs (Denis McDonough) and housing (Marcia Fudge). General Lloyd Austin would need a special waiver from Congress because he retired less than seven years ago Biden continues to form a diverse cabinet, but one common thread running through many of these picks is their personal connection to the president-elect - a ""team of buddies"", as a New York Times headline put it. Vilsack was agriculture secretary under Barack Obama and campaigned for Biden during this year's Iowa Caucuses. McDonough was an Obama chief-of-staff. Austin was a general in Iraq during the Obama administration and friends with Biden's late son, Beau. That has raised some unease among the more liberal members of the Democratic party who, like Ocasio-Cortez, want to see Biden - a self-professed moderate - pursue a more assertive progressive agenda. There are also specific concerns about Biden's choice of Austin, given that the recently retired Army officer would require a special congressional waiver to run the Pentagon. Trump asked for, and received, one for James Mattis, his first defence pick - over the objection of many Democrats. ""As Democrats, we just spent four years watching these kinds of rules be violated,"" Democratic Congressman Tom Malinowski told the New York Times. ""It really does feel as if a waiver would turn the exception into a rule."" Today the House sent a strong, bipartisan message to the American people: Our service members and our national security are more important than politics- House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith Speaking of national defence, a mini-showdown has been unfolding in Congress this week after Trump threatened to veto the National Defence Authorisation Act - the law funding the US military - if it did not include language removing liability protections for big tech companies. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which insulates social media companies from being held responsible for unlawful content produced by their users, has become a frequent target of criticism for the president, who says it is a government handout to tech companies that censor the speech of conservatives like him. This video can not be played Why Donald Trump keeps outperforming the polls Although it is in no way connected to military spending, Trump has made the defence appropriations the hill on which he's going to fight this battle. It looks like it's going to be a losing one for him. The general reaction to the president's threats in Congress has been one of indifference bordering on derision. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the defence bill by more than the two-thirds margin required to override a presidential veto. The Senate will probably do the same in the coming days. Then the ball is in the president's court. If he follows through with a veto - either because of Section 230 or earlier objections to a requirement that the Army rename bases honouring Confederate generals - it seems probable that, in the waning days of his presidency, this will be the first time Congress has successfully reversed such a move. While Republican politicians seem largely unwilling to challenge the president's claims that he won re-election, when it comes to military spending they're more than willing to push back.

EU leaders close ranks as no-deal talk mounts,"This video can not be played EC President Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit will be ""new beginnings for old friends"" Boris Johnson's declaration that he would go to Paris, travel to Berlin, ""do whatever it takes to reach a deal"" was quietly rebuffed again by the EU on Friday. Normally after big summits like the one we've just had in Brussels, leaders make media statements about their most pressing discussions. Climate change, Covid, relations with Turkey... they all featured prominently at the summit. Brexit was hardly mentioned. There's no denying that the prospect of the pain of no deal at all with the UK certainly weighs on EU minds. A German think tank has estimated that up to 700,000 European jobs could be at risk. But Europe's leaders are keen to clarify they won't personally intervene in the current impasse in trade talks. There'll be no last-minute handshake or ""a-ha"" moment in Paris, Warsaw or Berlin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (r) says a Brexit deal is still possible but insists that the integrity of the EU single market must be respected Behind the scenes, of course, leaders are involved in discussions with their negotiators, but they don't want to be face-to-face, or ear-to-ear, with Boris Johnson in public. EU countries are joined together in their single market. So, no individual EU leader - not even the most powerful ones, in France and Germany - can be perceived to be making the political compromises that could clinch the UK deal. Concessions will impact the whole single market - and therefore all member states, as a collective. Just this week, an ÃlysÃ©e Palace spokesman described as ""not desirable"" the idea of a visit or bilateral call between the prime minister and Emmanuel Macron in these last negotiating days. And the French president underlined again on Friday that EU countries were united behind the European Commission negotiating with the UK on their behalf. Something Downing Street then said it accepted. So can a deal be reached between the EU and UK by Sunday, despite the pervading mood of gloom plus a sense - in public, at least - that both sides are digging in their heels? It's difficult but possible. PM and EU say trade deal unlikely by Sunday What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? One of the main obstacles to a deal, according to the UK government, is that the EU refuses to accept the UK's post-Brexit national sovereignty. ""How can the EU demand that we tie ourselves to a new rule book to get good access to the single market?"" ministers ask. After all, wasn't Brexit all about breaking free from Brussels' regulations? But on Friday the European Commission president - who had a working dinner with the prime minister just this week - hit back at the EU-is-in-denial-about-UK-sovereignty claim. Yes, said Ursula von der Leyen, the EU was insisting on what it views as rules on ""fair competition"" in exchange for agreeing the UK could have preferential access to the single market - i.e. tariff and quota-free. But she pointedly added that the UK would remain free - ""sovereign, if you wish"" were the words she used - to decide what it wanted to do. ""We [the EU] would simply adapt the conditions for access to our market accordingly. It would be the decision of the UK and this would apply vice versa."" This refers to something often discussed in my blog over the past weeks. We know, oh so well by now, the three main sticking points still in talks: EU fishing rights in UK waters; competition regulations for the UK to have that good access to the single market; and the governance of the deal - how to ensure both sides keep to the agreement or face punitive measures. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are continuing:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The EU has gradually shifted its focus as it has become more and more aware that a post-Brexit UK will, almost inevitably, want to make up its own rules and regulations for business: deciding for itself which industries it wants to invest in and promote. Despite this, the EU still would rather have a trade and security deal with the UK than not. Because, in theory, it would be economically beneficial for both sides and because the deal contains other important aspects of the relationship, such as social security and police and judicial co-operation, how the EU and UK deal with nuclear waste, and more. So Brussels has been pondering how it can live with the UK's sovereign right to diverge and yet still have an overall deal. Their answer: focus more on governance. Trade between the UK and the EU would be disrupted by a no-deal Brexit This is what Mrs von der Leyen was referring to. A proposal that if the UK changes its environmental or labour standards, for example, the EU could then take immediate action to protect its businesses. And the UK would be able to take measures against the EU if the situation were reversed. So far, so sensible, you might think. But surprise, surprise, it's far from being that straightforward. The EU doesn't want to have to wait for some independent body/arbitration panel to judge whether it has the right to retaliate if it believes there is ""unfair competition"" afoot. Brussels worries a legal process like that could take too long. In the meantime, EU businesses could flounder or go under completely. EU leaders worry how they could justify that to their voters. The words ""level playing field"" or ""competition regulations"" may sound bewilderingly abstract but the Danish prime minister pointed out on Thursday that each EU leader was thinking about protecting jobs and businesses in their country - be it Denmark, Germany, France or the Netherlands, when it came to this deal with the UK. So, the EU is pushing to be able to retaliate even before a judgement on unfair competition has been reached. Something the UK clearly says it cannot accept. Can this key disagreement be resolved? Maybe. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, is described by his team as being in a ""determined, positive mood"". The UK says it's willing to go the extra mile. This video can not be played Johnson: No-deal Brexit now ""very, very likely"" You can dismiss all this as a PR exercise for public consumption, but the fact that negotiations will continue over the weekend means neither side has stopped trying. The problem facing all of us outside the negotiating room, is that there are leaks and assertions aplenty being made on both sides, but in the absence of the publication of texts, the only ones who know for sure what's going on, are the men and women currently sitting opposite each other in closed rooms in Brussels. Sunday will be here before we know it. Boris Johnson and the European Commission president say that's when ""a decision will be made"". But based on all the other false dawns in these talks, be warned: Sunday's decision could be ""deal"", ""no deal"" or ""let's keep talking, a little while longer"".

Where do Republicans go next?,"Cigar lounge owner Hassan Dakhteh hopes Trump will run in 2024 Donald Trump may have lost the election but he won a record number of votes, and tightened his grip on states like Ohio. So what can Ohio tell us about the Republican Party's future? Powell, a suburb of the capital Columbus, has a charming and old-worldly feel. Its picturesque neighbourhoods with big houses and rolling lawns reinforce the much romanticised pop culture images of the ideal American suburban life. The downtown market is lined with small cafes, handicraft shops, ice-cream parlours and wine stores. President Trump won this county and, though the election is long over, many shops and businesses still have 'Trump-Pence 2020' campaign signs staked in their lawns. Among them is a cigar shop called Stogies where a 'TRUMP 2020' banner is the centrepiece, flanking photos of Groucho Marx and Winston Churchill - celebrities of a bygone era - holding lit cigars. Concentric rings of smoke fill this cosy lounge, which used to be a church in the early 1900s. There is a group of men inside seated on sofas, all smoking cigars. President Trump looks down on them from an autographed photo. They are all Trump supporters and part of the electorate that gave him a decisive victory in Ohio. Mostly in their 50s and 60s, they're college educated professionals and businessmen. Neil Berberick, a retired professional says: ""What Trump has done is that he has gone back to core values. He picked up the people that were forgotten by the Democrats. He was in tune with us. He has changed the Republican party for the good.'' There is a sense of longing for President Trump - even though they still don't entirely believe he's lost the presidency. Asked about the future of the Republican party after Trump, Taylor Burkhart, a young mechanical engineer says: ""The party is not just going to dissolve because Trump may not be on their ticket. Someone will fill his shoes. We'll find someone else whose values that we agree with."" Hassan Dakhteh and his clientele But there is also this deep hope in the smoke-filled air that Mr Trump remains a force in Republican politics. The owner of the cigar lounge, Hassan Dakhteh, an Iranian immigrant who came to the United States over 40 years ago, says: ""I think he will run in 2024, I hope he runs in 2024."" President Trump remains a dominant force in Ohio. He won the state's 18 electoral college votes and also the popular vote by more than eight percentage points. According to the AP, he won more votes than any other presidential candidate in the state's history. It's a testament to how effectively Mr Trump spoke to rural and working class Ohioans and created a base that adores him. What Trump could do after leaving the White House Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia But not all Republican voters here endorse Mr Trump. About 14 miles from the cigar lounge, outside a grocery store in Hilliard, Amber Baumgartner is preparing to do some grocery shopping. She is a 56-year-old teacher who is passionate about healthcare for ordinary Americans. She leans conservative on most issues but is not a fan of the turn the Republican party has taken in the last four years. ""I am hoping they are going to learn,"" she says. ""They are going to see that this extremism, we are going to have to get a clamp on this. I feel that the last four years have been a joke, almost. It's been embarrassing, scary, terrifying actually. I am hoping that the party understands that and I think that they do. Because so many of them have been unwilling to get on the crazy bus."" An autographed photo of President Trump in Stogies cigar lounge Former Ohio governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich - a vocal critic of Mr Trump - thinks Republicans need to eschew Mr Trump's brand of politics going forward. ""It should become a party of ideas,"" he says. ""It's been basically an anti-Democrat party. They don't have any ideas on healthcare, environment or the wealth gap."" The Democrats are not in great shape either, he adds, but Joe Biden might be able to appeal to middle America. ""We'll see whether they will do that but Republicans really need to get some ideas otherwise they will wilt away."" The sudden death of bellwether America However, Donald Trump remains overwhelmingly popular in Ohio and it's clear he will continue exerting influence on the Republican party even after he leaves the White House. ""His performance in 2016 and 2020 suggests that he is the most popular Republican in Ohio in quite a long time, maybe since Ronald Reagan,"" says Mark Caleb Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Cedarville. His popularity among his base has allowed President Trump to attack senior party leaders who don't agree with him. Among them Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, for not backing his unsubstantiated claims of a rigged election.Mr DeWine, though a supporter of President Trump, was one of the earlier Republicans out of the gate in recognising President-elect Joe Biden's win. US President Donald Trump has been critical of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine Emboldened by Mr Trump's attack, some fellow Republicans are even trying to impeach the governor for enforcing measures to curb Covid-19, which is at a record high in the state. Gov DeWine, who took steps early on to combat the coronavirus and has handled the pandemic very differently to Mr Trump, has hit back at his detractors. So how can Republican leaders like him deal with hostility from within his own party going forward? Professor Smith says that keeping the deeply conservative base happy could be key. Supporters packed a Trump rally in Ohio in October ""Governor DeWine is willing to sign anti-abortion legislation, for example,"" he says. ""I'd expect that kind of thing to continue."" ""His rhetoric on family and marriage will probably ratchet up a bit. Governor DeWine is a staunch Catholic and I would expect him to use that language more frequently about religion and his faith. I think that does quite well with the people who are supportive of the president."" Mr Trump did very well in Ohio in the rural areas outside of major cities such as Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, where the electorate is predominantly white. However, can the party really sustain itself nationally by focusing on his base? Studies show that America is getting more diverse and minorities are already a powerful voting bloc, so Republicans will likely need new strategies going ahead. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? Republican strategist Terry Casey says the party will look for new ideas but President Trump could potentially leave a lasting legacy. ""He has shifted the party somewhat for the good because the Republican party previously had the image of the party of the country club, and the Wall Street rich people. And now it has shifted to issues of the middle class or the working class and a lot of people in the Midwest who have been forgotten."" Whether Donald Trump continues to remain a powerful presence in Republican politics will be determined in the months to come. But one thing seems certain, both parties need to make sure that middle America - like Ohio - does not feel ignored.

Can Trump overturn the result?,"Almost two weeks after Joe Biden was projected as the winner of the US presidential election, Donald Trump is still refusing to concede. Does he have a plan to overturn the outcome? The president's legal strategy to challenge the election results seems to be falling on deaf ears in courtrooms across the country. Trump's team has yet to notch a meaningful victory, or present evidence of widespread voter fraud, after filing dozens of lawsuits. His top lawyer, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, said on Thursday that the campaign was dropping its legal challenges inMichigan, which Biden won by more than 160,000 votes. InGeorgia, the state has certified its election tabulations, which give Biden just over a 12,000 vote lead after the state conducted a hand recount of nearly 5 million ballots. Five election fraud claims fact-checked As doors to remaining in office slam shut, the president appears to be shifting strategies for flipping the election results from a longshot legal one to a longer-shot political gambit. Here's what he may hope to do: Block the vote-certification process in as many states as possible, either through lawsuits or by encouraging Republican officials to object Convince Republican-controlled legislatures in states Biden narrowly won to dismiss the results of the popular vote as corrupted by widespread fraud Have the legislature then award their state's Electoral College votes, which are cast by ""electors"" on 14 December, to Trump instead of Biden Do that in enough states - Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, for instance - to pull Trump from his current total of 232 electoral votes past the winning 269-vote mark Even pulling Biden from 306 votes might work, because then the election would be decided in the House of Representatives, where even though it's controlled by the Democrats, Trump would have an advantage due to some arcane rules This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win He's applying pressure on people who can potentially change who the states pick for president. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one. They are voting for state electors who will then cast one vote each for president. These electors usually follow the will of the electorate - in Michigan, for instance, they should all vote for Joe Biden because he won the state. On Monday, a state canvassing board made up of two Republicans and two Democrats is due to meet to count the votes and officially confirm the 16 electors' votes going to Biden. The first hint that Trump was applying pressure to individual states to disregard their current vote totals came following reports that he had called Republican officials who had initially refused to certify the election results from Detroit, Michigan's largest city. That two low-level party officials, among thousands of county canvassers across the US, would speak directly to a US president was more than just a little unusual. They ultimately reversed their decision to block the proceedings - and then, after Trump's call, expressed regret for reversing themselves. Those hints became clear evidence of intent when the Republican leaders in the Michigan legislature accepted a presidential invitation to visit the White House on Friday. Attention-loving Trump now hunkers down The news has been accompanied by reports that the president is intent on finding other ways he can pressure key state legislatures to review, and perhaps reverse, their election results. What is typically a mere formality during normal elections - the bipartisan certification of state vote totals - has become the latest battleground in the president's attempts to maintain power for the next four years. It's not impossible, but the chances are very, very slim. First of all, the president would have to overturn the results in multiple states, where Biden's leads range from tens of thousands of votes to more than a hundred thousand. This isn't 2000, when everything came down just to Florida. What's more, many of the states Trump's legal team is targeting - Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada - have Democratic governors who are not going to sit idly by while all of this takes place. In Michigan, for instance, Governor Gretchen Whitmer could fire the current state election board and replace it with one willing to certify Biden's victory. This video can not be played Will Trump supporters accept Joe Biden as president? Democratic governors could respond by naming their own slate of pro-Biden electors to compete with ones a Republican legislature choose, leaving it to Congress to decide which group to acknowledge. That doesn't mean Biden's supporters aren't worried, however. While the odds of this happening are along the lines of the earth being hit by a giant meteor or someone getting struck by lightning while winning the lottery, having victory snatched away at this point would be such a cataclysmic political event that the remote prospect of such a possibility is enough to give Democrats cold sweats. Trump has spent much of his time in the White House shattering presidential norms and traditions. It appears that the last days of his term will be no different. Just because the pressure Trump is putting on election officials and state legislatures is unprecedented or controversial, however, doesn't necessarily mean it is illegal. This video can not be played How other incumbents left the White House after losing In the early days of the nation, state legislatures had broad powers of how they allocated their electoral votes, and there is still no constitutional requirement that they heed the results of a popular vote. They have since circumscribed those powers by assigning their votes based on the results of popular elections, but the underpinnings of the original system still remain intact. If the president succeeds in convincing a legislature, such as Michigan's, to act, Democrats are sure to mount legal objections. The law, both national and in each state, is fuzzy, given that this sort of thing has seldom been subject litigation. Could states retroactively change the laws governing how they run their elections? Perhaps. But it would be up to judges to render the final verdict. The last time a closely contested election involved a battle over electors was in 2000 between Al Gore and George W Bush. That was a fight in one state, Florida, where the difference between the candidates was just a few hundred votes. Eventually, the US Supreme Court stepped in and halted any further review - and Bush became president. How 2020 compares with Bush-Gore recount in 2000 For a disputed election involving multiple states you have to go back to the 1876 race between Republican Rutherford B Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tildon. In that episode, contested results in Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida meant no candidate was able to win a majority in the Electoral College. The deadlock threw the election to the US House of Representatives, which ultimately sided with Hayes, who like Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016, won fewer votes nationally than his defeated opponent. If the president's longshot attempts at reversing the election results fail, at 12:01 pm on 20 January Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th US president whether Trump formally concedes or not. At that point, the Secret Service and the US military are free to treat the former president the way they do any unauthorised individual on government property. ""It's outrageous what he's doing,"" Biden said in a press conference on Thursday. ""Incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions."" Even if the president isn't successful, his seeming scorched-earth strategy of contesting the election results is setting a precedent for elections to come and, according to polls, undermining the faith many Americans have in the US democratic systems and institutions.

"Monkeys could be banned as pets, says governmentMany of the thousands of primates kept in homes in England are said to be living in misery.","People in England could be banned from keeping monkeys and other primates as pets, the government has said. Up to 5,000 are living outside licensed zoos in the UK, with animal welfare minister Lord Goldsmith saying many of them are in ""misery"" due to a lack of space and stimulation. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is also looking at restrictions on breeding primates. Aneight-week consultation,externalon the proposed changes has begun. Zoo welcomes 'ping pong ball-sized' twin monkeys Supermarkets snub coconut goods picked by monkeys Primates, including lemurs, monkeys and apes, require open spaces, varied diets, warmth and social contact. Under the plans, those who keep them without a zoo licence would need to obtain a new specialist private primate keeper licence to ensure they are meeting zoo-level welfare standards. Lord Goldsmith said: ""Primates are hugely intelligent and socially complex animals. When they are confined in tiny cages, often alone and with little stimulation, their lives are a misery. ""It's important that we take action to prevent the suffering caused to them when they are kept as pets and so I am delighted that we are moving a big step closer towards banning the practice."" Marmosets are the most commonly held primates in the UK. Capuchins, squirrel monkeys, lemurs and tamarins are also popular species. Dr Ros Clubb, senior scientific manager at the RSPCA, said primates could ""become depressed without adequate stimulation"". She added: ""Sadly, our inspectors are still seeing shocking situations where monkeys are cooped up in bird cages, fed fast food, sugary drinks or even class A drugs, deprived of companions of their own kind, living in dirt and squalor and suffering from disease."" The government is proposing that primates not living in zoos should be registered by councils, with inspectors working out a ""course of action"" for each animal.

UK-EU trade talks to resume with one day to go,"Trade talks between the UK and European Union are continuing in Brussels with one day to go until a deadline imposed by the two sides. The leaders of both parties have warned they are unlikely to reach a post-Brexit trade deal by Sunday. On Friday, Boris Johnson chaired a ""stock-take"" on the UK's preparedness for a no-deal scenario. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said four Royal Navy patrol boats are ready to protect UK fishing waters. The Sunday deadline was set by Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after the pair met in Brussels on Wednesday, after months of talks failed to achieve an agreement. Mr Johnson said the EU needed to make a ""big change"" over the main sticking points on fishing rights and business competition rules, while Mrs von der Leyen said no deal was the most probable end to ""difficult"" talks. The EU has rejected Mr Johnson's request to bypass the European Commission and speak directly to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel about the unresolved issues. According to EU officials, he was told discussions could only take place through the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who is meeting with his UK equivalent in Brussels. What happens if there's no trade deal? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What is an 'Australia-style deal'? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? If a trade deal is not reached and ratified by both sides by 31 December, the UK and EU could impose taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods. This could lead to higher prices for some goods, among other changes. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? A major sticking point in negotiations has been access to UK fishing waters, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. The MoD has said it has conducted ""extensive planning and preparation"" to ensure it is ready for a range of scenarios at the end of the transition period, including having 14,000 personnel on standby to support the government over the winter with the EU transition. It said four offshore patrol boats will be available to monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place to protect the UK's rights as an independent coastal state"". An expansion of powers for the Royal Navy Police, enabling officers to potentially board foreign boats and arrest those breaking the law, is one proposal in the MoD's no-deal contingency planning, a spokesman confirmed. Admiral Lord West, former chief of naval staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""entirely appropriate"" for the Royal Navy to protect UK waters, although he said there would need to be parliamentary authority to allow officers to board foreign ships. But Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, called the threat of using Royal Navy gunboats to patrol UK waters in a no-deal outcome ""irresponsible"". ""This isn't Elizabethan times anymore, this is global Britain - we need to be raising the bar much higher than this,"" he told Today. Accordingto the MoD's website,external, three River Class patrol ships with a crew of 45 sailors already work ""at least 275 days a year at sea enforcing British and European fisheries law"". BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said the government's contingency assumptions are that a lack of business readiness will lead to queues of thousands of lorries, with Kent - which is home to the Port of Dover, operating an access permit for hauliers. A presentation, seen by the BBC, only identified room to fast track between 70 and 100 lorries of perishable goods per day should there be tailbacks, he said. The authorities have chosen to focus on ""fish and chicks"" - live and fresh seafood, often transported from Scotland to French restaurants, as well as day old chicks. No other commodities have been added to the list, he adds, raising fears among other food exporters. There's no denying that the prospect of the pain of no deal at all with the UK certainly weighs on EU minds. But Europe's leaders are keen to clarify they won't personally intervene in the current impasse in trade talks. Behind the scenes, leaders are involved in discussions with their negotiators, but they don't want to be face-to-face, or ear-to-ear, with Boris Johnson in public. Concessions will have an impact on the whole single market - and therefore all member states, as a collective.

"London's coronavirus levels rising, ONS says","Levels of positive tests are rising in London and could be on the up in the east of England, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Figures for the week to 5 December,external, as England's second lockdown was ending, suggest infection levels continued to fall in other regions. Infection rates are still highest in children of secondary school age, the ONS says. Across the UK, the picture is mixed, with Wales seeing rising infections. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive continues to fall - while in Scotland it has stayed the same. The R number - or reproduction number - of the virusis now between 0.9 and 1.0 for the UK,external- slightly up from 0.8-1.0 last week. But in some regions in the south and east it could be above 1, indicating infections are likely to be growing there. The ONS figures are one source of data used by the government's scientific advisers to judge the spread of the virus, and take decisions on restrictions on people's daily lives. They are based on swab tests of thousands of people in households, whether they have symptoms or not. The estimates are thought to give a more accurate picture of how many people are infected with the virus than data on positive tests alone. Infection levels in London started to rise sharply before the end of lockdown, according to the ONS, after falling in late November. In all other regions, including the North West and North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber, the percentage of people testing positive is decreasing. But there are ""early signs"" rates may be increasing in the east of England, the ONS says. It estimates: one in 115 people have the virus in England one in 120 in Scotland one in 120 in Wales one in 235 in Northern Ireland The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is up very slightly on the previous week, but still just below 1. This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown, but very slowly. This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey. It indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the scientific advisory group is that the situation is ""fragile"". Cases are increasing in London and the east of England - especially among secondary school age children - and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The government's scientific advisers believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run-up to the holidays. That's because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases - and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Data on cases - or confirmed positive tests - suggests areas such as Basildon, Medway and Havering in the south east are now experiencing more than 400 cases per 100,000 people. England's tiers system is due to be reviewed on 16 December and there have been suggestions that London should be moved from tier two to tier three to avoid a spike in deaths over Christmas. Kent is already in tier three while Essex is in tier two. What are the latest tiers and lockdown rules?

Space tourism: Virgin space plane set to flySir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic embarks on the first crewed flight of its rocket-powered tourist plane.,"Virgin Galactic is set to carry out a milestone test flight of its rocket-powered tourist plane on Saturday. This will be the first crewed flight of its reusable Unity vehicle to take off from the purpose-built commercial spaceport in New Mexico, US. Sir Richard Branson's company,externalwill begin space tourism flights in 2021. Already, more than 600 paying customers - including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio - are booked to take a ride on the plane. The woman who paid $250,000 to go into space Astronaut crew launch to space station Light pollution's wasted energy seen from space This video can not be played Virgin Galactic gives a glimpse of what it will look like inside the Unity vehicle Saturday's flight will be the first of three final demonstration flights before that commercial service begins. It is on the third of these that Sir Richard Branson himself will test the service he's been promising for 16 years. Before that can happen Virgin Galactic needs to go through some final preparatory steps. Saturday's mission will have just the two pilots on board - former Nasa astronaut CJ Sturckow and Galactic chief test pilot Dave Mackay. They will run checks on all their plane's operating procedures by making the first ever powered climb above Spaceport America, the centre that was developed specifically for this commercial operation by the New Mexico state government. It has been a long road for the company's engineers to get the technology to where they want it, and progress this year has, of course, been slowed by the Covid-19 crisis, with limited numbers of staff able to work both in New Mexico and at Galactic's manufacturing base in California. Will Whitehorn, president of the UK Space Industry Group,,externaldescribed the flight as a huge milestone. ""This is going to be a very safe and low-cost system,"" he told BBC News. ""Developing it has been ground-breaking and it hasn't been easy."" A fatal accident back in 2014led to an investigation and the redesign of some elements of the system. ""But when it comes to space, you're not in a race with anyone. You're in a race to be safe,"" said Mr Whitehorn. The craft will also serve as an astronaut training facility. ""At the moment, we have to train them in simulated environments - swimming pools and so-called vomit comets, which are planes that dive out of the sky,"" he explained. ""So as well as space tourism and space science, that training will be a crucial component of the industrial revolution that is coming to space."" The cabin has a big mirror at the rear so passengers can see themselves weightless Virgin Galactic recently unveiled the design of the tourist cabin. Passengers will sit in seats that move to manage G-forces in the different phases of flight - on the boost up to space and on the descent back to Earth. They'll get personal seat-back screens that display live flight data, and the 12 large windows - more than any other spacecraft in history, according to the company - are designed to ensure no passenger has to compete for a view when they unbuckle at the top of the climb to float free inside the cabin.

"Trump's latest, legal longshot to challenge result","It's been a week of split-screens in American politics. The nation's attention is divided between the president and the president-elect; between the coronavirus vaccine and the rising death toll from the pandemic; between congressional attempts to reach compromise and congressional attempts to rebuff Donald Trump. As the days tick down until the holidays, and a new year, and a new Congress and a new president, here are some of the key political stories from this week. ""For individuals and organisations that champion the rule of law and claim the mantle of the founding principles of our nation to call for overturning an election reeks of hypocrisy""-conservative commentator Linda Chavez,external It was yet another rough week for the president's efforts to reverse the results of his November defeat in the US presidential election. First, the ""safe harbour"" date for states certifying the results arrived on Tuesday with all but one, Wisconsin, meeting the deadline. That will make it much more difficult for Trump's allies in Congress to contest the results of the election in January. Tuesday also delivered a one-two legal punch to the president. The Arizona Supreme Court unanimously ruled that there was no evidence of fraud or misconduct in Joe Biden's victory in that state. And the US Supreme Court batted down a legal challenge to the Democrat's win in that state with a terse, one-sentence ""application denied"" order. What legal challenges remain for Trump? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? That left Trump placing all his judicial hopes on a lawsuit filed by the attorney general of Texas that sought to discard the presidential election results in four states Biden won - Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. Texas asked the court to allow the state legislatures - which all happen to be controlled by Republicans - to determine who should get their electoral college votes. Election law experts largely scoffed at the prospects for the suit - ""utter garbage,""writes UC-Irvine Professor Rick Hasen,external- but 17 other states with Republican attorneys general, as well as Trump himself, joined the effort. On Friday night, the Supreme Court slammed that door closed, as well. The ruling was slightly longer than the one-sentence response in a Pennsylvania case. Two justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, wouldn't have dismissed the lawsuit outright. But even they would not express a view on whether Texas's attempt to throw out millions of votes and effectively hand the presidency to Trump had merit. The decision paves the way for the members of the Electoral College to meet in state capitals across the US on Monday. At that point, Trump's legal challenges to the election will be finished. And while his supporters may try a last-ditch effort to block the Joe Biden's victory in Congress in January, those political manoeuvres are destined to fail. Democrats will make sure of that. The implications of this challenge, however, are unlikely to quickly fade away. In a democracy of 328 million Americans, the presidency came down to what seven people on the Supreme Court thought. That will be something Democrats, and the history books, won't quickly forget. I have been through many public health crises before, but this is the toughest one we have ever faced as a nation. The road ahead will not be easy""- Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases When the president wasn't fulminating about the results of the presidential election this week, he was celebrating the development of multiple vaccines to treat Covid-19. At a ""vaccine summit"" event on Tuesday, Trump touted what is, without a doubt, a remarkable medical achievement. ""From the instant the coronavirus invaded our shores, we raced into action to develop a safe and effective vaccine at breakneck speed,"" the president said. ""In order to achieve this goal, we harnessed the full power of government, the genius of American scientists, and the might of American industry to save millions and millions of lives all over the world."" This video can not be played One travel nurse's emotional journey through US Covid hotspots The good news on immunisations, however, comes as record numbers of Americans are dying from Covid-19 every day - and the outlook for the months ahead, before the vaccinations reach most Americans. That was the message Biden was delivering to the nation from his transition headquarters in Delaware at the same time as the White House event. ""We're in a dark winter. Things may well get worse before they get better,"" Biden said. ""A vaccine may soon be available, but we need to level with each other. It will take longer than we would like to distribute it to all corners of our country. We will need to persuade enough Americans to take it. It's daunting, but I promise you that we will make progress starting on day one."" Trump hosts holiday events as Covid cases soar The mask-wearing US city that bucked the trend Biden was unveiling his choices for top health positions in his administration, including California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for health secretary, Vivek Murthy as surgeon general and Fauci as this ""chief medical adviser on Covid-19"". The president-elect said once inaugurated on 20 January, he would mandate mask-usage in interstate commerce and on federal property, distribute 100 million doses of vaccine in his first 100 days and prioritise reopening schools. It's a tall order, but his administration's ability to control the pandemic, and efficiently and equitably distribute the vaccine, will be the standard by which his early success as president will be judged. Members of the House and Senate have been engaged in good-faith negotiations and continue to make progress. The bipartisan talks are the best hope for a bipartisan solution""- Democratic Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer The public-health aspect of the coronavirus pandemic is just one component of the crisis currently facing US policymakers. The disease, and efforts to control its spread, have placed enormous strain on the US economy, as businesses have been forced to close and workers lose their jobs While Republicans and Democrats in Congress and Trump administration officials have been negotiating another round of economic stimulus for months to no avail, a bipartisan group of legislators gave new life to attempts at a compromise with their proposal for a $900bn package of aid last week. In an encouraging development, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who had been pushing for nearly three times that amount, endorsed the compromise - while saying that she would ask for more when Biden becomes president. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? A deal needs to be wrapped up in the next few weeks, before this congressional term ends, and there are still a number of big sticking points. Democrats want hundreds of millions of dollars for cash-strapped local and state governments that have seen their revenues drop during the pandemic. Republicans want lawsuit protections for business that stay open. Democrats would like to reauthorise hundreds of dollars in supplemental weekly payments to the unemployed. The Trump administration would prefer a one-time payment to all Americans. It's a lot to try to wrap up in very little time. But with the latest economic figures showing unemployment rising and businesses struggling, the pressure on Congress to do something - anything - is growing. I think one of the things I'm looking for, when I see all of these picks together is: What is the agenda? What is the overall vision going to be? I think that's a little hazy- Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Amidst all the turmoil surrounding Trump's challenge of the election results and the coronavirus pandemic, Biden continues the slow process of unveiling his nominations for top administration jobs. In addition to his health picks this week, Biden has also announced his selections for secretaries of defence (Lloyd Austin), agriculture (Tom Vilsack), veteran's affairs (Denis McDonough) and housing (Marcia Fudge). General Lloyd Austin would need a special waiver from Congress because he retired less than seven years ago Biden continues to form a diverse cabinet, but one common thread running through many of these picks is their personal connection to the president-elect - a ""team of buddies"", as a New York Times headline put it. Vilsack was agriculture secretary under Barack Obama and campaigned for Biden during this year's Iowa Caucuses. McDonough was an Obama chief-of-staff. Austin was a general in Iraq during the Obama administration and friends with Biden's late son, Beau. That has raised some unease among the more liberal members of the Democratic party who, like Ocasio-Cortez, want to see Biden - a self-professed moderate - pursue a more assertive progressive agenda. There are also specific concerns about Biden's choice of Austin, given that the recently retired Army officer would require a special congressional waiver to run the Pentagon. Trump asked for, and received, one for James Mattis, his first defence pick - over the objection of many Democrats. ""As Democrats, we just spent four years watching these kinds of rules be violated,"" Democratic Congressman Tom Malinowski told the New York Times. ""It really does feel as if a waiver would turn the exception into a rule."" Today the House sent a strong, bipartisan message to the American people: Our service members and our national security are more important than politics- House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith Speaking of national defence, a mini-showdown has been unfolding in Congress this week after Trump threatened to veto the National Defence Authorisation Act - the law funding the US military - if it did not include language removing liability protections for big tech companies. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which insulates social media companies from being held responsible for unlawful content produced by their users, has become a frequent target of criticism for the president, who says it is a government handout to tech companies that censor the speech of conservatives like him. This video can not be played Why Donald Trump keeps outperforming the polls Although it is in no way connected to military spending, Trump has made the defence appropriations the hill on which he's going to fight this battle. It looks like it's going to be a losing one for him. The general reaction to the president's threats in Congress has been one of indifference bordering on derision. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the defence bill by more than the two-thirds margin required to override a presidential veto. The Senate will probably do the same in the coming days. Then the ball is in the president's court. If he follows through with a veto - either because of Section 230 or earlier objections to a requirement that the Army rename bases honouring Confederate generals - it seems probable that, in the waning days of his presidency, this will be the first time Congress has successfully reversed such a move. While Republican politicians seem largely unwilling to challenge the president's claims that he won re-election, when it comes to military spending they're more than willing to push back.

Where does the Republican Party go after Trump?,"Cigar lounge owner Hassan Dakhteh hopes Trump will run in 2024 Donald Trump may have lost the election but he won a record number of votes, and tightened his grip on states like Ohio. So what can Ohio tell us about the Republican Party's future? Powell, a suburb of the capital Columbus, has a charming and old-worldly feel. Its picturesque neighbourhoods with big houses and rolling lawns reinforce the much romanticised pop culture images of the ideal American suburban life. The downtown market is lined with small cafes, handicraft shops, ice-cream parlours and wine stores. President Trump won this county and, though the election is long over, many shops and businesses still have 'Trump-Pence 2020' campaign signs staked in their lawns. Among them is a cigar shop called Stogies where a 'TRUMP 2020' banner is the centrepiece, flanking photos of Groucho Marx and Winston Churchill - celebrities of a bygone era - holding lit cigars. Concentric rings of smoke fill this cosy lounge, which used to be a church in the early 1900s. There is a group of men inside seated on sofas, all smoking cigars. President Trump looks down on them from an autographed photo. They are all Trump supporters and part of the electorate that gave him a decisive victory in Ohio. Mostly in their 50s and 60s, they're college educated professionals and businessmen. Neil Berberick, a retired professional says: ""What Trump has done is that he has gone back to core values. He picked up the people that were forgotten by the Democrats. He was in tune with us. He has changed the Republican party for the good.'' There is a sense of longing for President Trump - even though they still don't entirely believe he's lost the presidency. Asked about the future of the Republican party after Trump, Taylor Burkhart, a young mechanical engineer says: ""The party is not just going to dissolve because Trump may not be on their ticket. Someone will fill his shoes. We'll find someone else whose values that we agree with."" Hassan Dakhteh and his clientele But there is also this deep hope in the smoke-filled air that Mr Trump remains a force in Republican politics. The owner of the cigar lounge, Hassan Dakhteh, an Iranian immigrant who came to the United States over 40 years ago, says: ""I think he will run in 2024, I hope he runs in 2024."" President Trump remains a dominant force in Ohio. He won the state's 18 electoral college votes and also the popular vote by more than eight percentage points. According to the AP, he won more votes than any other presidential candidate in the state's history. It's a testament to how effectively Mr Trump spoke to rural and working class Ohioans and created a base that adores him. What Trump could do after leaving the White House Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia But not all Republican voters here endorse Mr Trump. About 14 miles from the cigar lounge, outside a grocery store in Hilliard, Amber Baumgartner is preparing to do some grocery shopping. She is a 56-year-old teacher who is passionate about healthcare for ordinary Americans. She leans conservative on most issues but is not a fan of the turn the Republican party has taken in the last four years. ""I am hoping they are going to learn,"" she says. ""They are going to see that this extremism, we are going to have to get a clamp on this. I feel that the last four years have been a joke, almost. It's been embarrassing, scary, terrifying actually. I am hoping that the party understands that and I think that they do. Because so many of them have been unwilling to get on the crazy bus."" An autographed photo of President Trump in Stogies cigar lounge Former Ohio governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich - a vocal critic of Mr Trump - thinks Republicans need to eschew Mr Trump's brand of politics going forward. ""It should become a party of ideas,"" he says. ""It's been basically an anti-Democrat party. They don't have any ideas on healthcare, environment or the wealth gap."" The Democrats are not in great shape either, he adds, but Joe Biden might be able to appeal to middle America. ""We'll see whether they will do that but Republicans really need to get some ideas otherwise they will wilt away."" The sudden death of bellwether America However, Donald Trump remains overwhelmingly popular in Ohio and it's clear he will continue exerting influence on the Republican party even after he leaves the White House. ""His performance in 2016 and 2020 suggests that he is the most popular Republican in Ohio in quite a long time, maybe since Ronald Reagan,"" says Mark Caleb Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Cedarville. His popularity among his base has allowed President Trump to attack senior party leaders who don't agree with him. Among them Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, for not backing his unsubstantiated claims of a rigged election.Mr DeWine, though a supporter of President Trump, was one of the earlier Republicans out of the gate in recognising President-elect Joe Biden's win. US President Donald Trump has been critical of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine Emboldened by Mr Trump's attack, some fellow Republicans are even trying to impeach the governor for enforcing measures to curb Covid-19, which is at a record high in the state. Gov DeWine, who took steps early on to combat the coronavirus and has handled the pandemic very differently to Mr Trump, has hit back at his detractors. So how can Republican leaders like him deal with hostility from within his own party going forward? Professor Smith says that keeping the deeply conservative base happy could be key. Supporters packed a Trump rally in Ohio in October ""Governor DeWine is willing to sign anti-abortion legislation, for example,"" he says. ""I'd expect that kind of thing to continue."" ""His rhetoric on family and marriage will probably ratchet up a bit. Governor DeWine is a staunch Catholic and I would expect him to use that language more frequently about religion and his faith. I think that does quite well with the people who are supportive of the president."" Mr Trump did very well in Ohio in the rural areas outside of major cities such as Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, where the electorate is predominantly white. However, can the party really sustain itself nationally by focusing on his base? Studies show that America is getting more diverse and minorities are already a powerful voting bloc, so Republicans will likely need new strategies going ahead. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? Republican strategist Terry Casey says the party will look for new ideas but President Trump could potentially leave a lasting legacy. ""He has shifted the party somewhat for the good because the Republican party previously had the image of the party of the country club, and the Wall Street rich people. And now it has shifted to issues of the middle class or the working class and a lot of people in the Midwest who have been forgotten."" Whether Donald Trump continues to remain a powerful presence in Republican politics will be determined in the months to come. But one thing seems certain, both parties need to make sure that middle America - like Ohio - does not feel ignored.

"London's coronavirus levels rising, ONS saysBut infections kept falling in most English regions as the second lockdown ended.Health","Levels of positive tests are rising in London and could be on the up in the east of England, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Figures for the week to 5 December,external, as England's second lockdown was ending, suggest infection levels continued to fall in other regions. Infection rates are still highest in children of secondary school age, the ONS says. Across the UK, the picture is mixed, with Wales seeing rising infections. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive continues to fall - while in Scotland it has stayed the same. The R number - or reproduction number - of the virusis now between 0.9 and 1.0 for the UK,external- slightly up from 0.8-1.0 last week. But in some regions in the south and east it could be above 1, indicating infections are likely to be growing there. The ONS figures are one source of data used by the government's scientific advisers to judge the spread of the virus, and take decisions on restrictions on people's daily lives. They are based on swab tests of thousands of people in households, whether they have symptoms or not. The estimates are thought to give a more accurate picture of how many people are infected with the virus than data on positive tests alone. Infection levels in London started to rise sharply before the end of lockdown, according to the ONS, after falling in late November. In all other regions, including the North West and North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber, the percentage of people testing positive is decreasing. But there are ""early signs"" rates may be increasing in the east of England, the ONS says. It estimates: one in 115 people have the virus in England one in 120 in Scotland one in 120 in Wales one in 235 in Northern Ireland The latest estimate of the R number for the UK is up very slightly on the previous week, but still just below 1. This means that the epidemic is still shrinking after lockdown, but very slowly. This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics infection survey. It indicates that cases continued to fall in most of England and Northern Ireland last week. But the view of the scientific advisory group is that the situation is ""fragile"". Cases are increasing in London and the east of England - especially among secondary school age children - and previous experience indicates that a surge among older age groups will inevitably follow. The government's scientific advisers believe that it will be important to keep infection levels as low as possible in the run-up to the holidays. That's because the relaxation of restrictions that permit families to meet over Christmas will accelerate any increase in cases - and lead to another sharp spike in infections early in the New Year. Data on cases - or confirmed positive tests - suggests areas such as Basildon, Medway and Havering in the south east are now experiencing more than 400 cases per 100,000 people. England's tiers system is due to be reviewed on 16 December and there have been suggestions that London should be moved from tier two to tier three to avoid a spike in deaths over Christmas.
