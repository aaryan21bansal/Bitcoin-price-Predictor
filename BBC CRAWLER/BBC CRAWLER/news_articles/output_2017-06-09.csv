London attackers 'planned to use lorry',"Attackers drove into people walking across London Bridge before stabbing others in nearby Borough Market The London Bridge attackers tried to hire a 7.5 tonne lorry to carry out their attack, police say. But the three men failed to provide payment details and the vehicle was not picked up, prompting them to use a smaller van from a DIY store instead. The men drove into pedestrians on the bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market seven days ago. Police said the men tied 12in (30cm) pink ceramic knives to their wrists and had petrol bombs in the van. Eight people were killed and dozens more were injured in the attack, which began shortly before 22:00 BST on 3 June. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the attackers, who were all shot dead. Scotland Yard wants more witnesses to come forward and is also appealing to companies who hire out vans to report any suspicious activity. This video can not be played Cressida Dick said police have stopped five plots with ""murderous intent"" Early on Saturday, police said they had arrested a man, 27, on suspicion of preparing terrorists acts, after carrying out a raid in Ilford, east London, linked to the attack. At 02:05 BST, police arrested another man, 28, at a residential address in Barking, on suspicion of preparing terrorists acts. Five other men are also being held under terrorism legislation. In its most detailed description of the attack yet, the Metropolitan Police said the three attackers had rented a flat in Barking, east London, to use as a safe house. Who were the attackers? The victims of the attack What we know so far Inside, they found a copy of the Koran opened at a page describing martyrdom. They also discovered equipment for making petrol bombs, plastic bottles and duct tape for constructing fake suicide bomb belts, and an ID card for Redouane. Forensic work at this flat has determined that they acted alone. The men attached blades to their wrists before the attack The investigation has concluded that 27-year-old Butt was the ringleader. He hired the van used in the attack from a B&Q store in Romford on the morning of the attack. He is thought to have driven the van, with Redouane and Zaghba in the back, into central London. At two minutes before 22:00 BST, the van crossed London Bridge heading south.  Six minutes later it returned, crossing over the bridge again and making a U-turn at the northern end. The attack began with the van driving back along the pavements of the bridge, running down pedestrians, three of whom died, before crashing outside the Barrowboy and Banker pub opposite London Bridge station. The men jumped out clutching the ceramic kitchen knives. Police say the weapons were possibly chosen to prevent them being picked up by metal detectors. They stabbed people who had been enjoying the area's pubs and restaurants, killing five. Police found items in the van possibly used as an excuse for having hired the vehicle Police were called within two minutes and arrived eight minutes later, killing the attackers in what officers said was an ""unprecedented"" volley of 46 bullets. When briefing reporters, Commander Dean Haydon said the police - from the Met and City of London forces - had shown ""incredible bravery"". He added: ""We have stories of people armed with chairs, bottles, anything they could get their hands on with a view to trying to prevent the attackers coming to pubs and bars but also scaring them off to prevent other people being attacked."" He detailed the actions of four people who put their lives at risk to fight back and help the injured: A doctor at a restaurant heard screaming and ""with no regard for his own safety"" ran outside to pick up an injured man and carry him across the bridge A public relations consultant heard the van crashing and gave first aid to a man who'd been stabbed - despite the danger A restaurant worker tried to fight off an attacker who came in and stabbed a young woman in the back An off-duty police officer was stabbed in the stomach as he tried to disarm one of the attackers The massive police investigation into the attack continues and by Saturday there had been 20 arrests and 13 buildings had been searched. So far, 282 witnesses from 19 countries have been questioned but police still want more people who saw what happened to come forward. In the back of the white Renault van used in the attack officers found wine bottles filled with a flammable liquid with rags tied to their necks.  There were blow torches for lighting these ""Molotov cocktails"". Bottles with flammable liquid and ties around the top were also found in the hire van The three men had added bags of building gravel and several chairs - possibly to suggest a reason for having hired the van. Scotland Yard said it wanted to hear from anyone renting vans who might have suspicions about a customer. Police are also appealing for information about the ""distinctive"" pink ""Ernesto"" brand knives the men were carrying. They said they had not found evidence of anyone else being involved in the plot - or inspiring the attackers to carry it out. The Met revealed Butt had been arrested for bank fraud in October 2016 but was not charged.  He had been opening accounts and closing them again, possibly to launder money. Police also confirmed there had been a call about him to an anti-terrorism hotline, but no evidence was given that he was planning an attack. A number of bridges in central London now have ""increased security measures"" such as barriers However when he appeared in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, last year, officers did view the programme. They decided it was""deeply abhorrent"" but not evidence of criminality. Mr Haydon described the current terror alert as ""unprecedented times"".  Since March, there have been five planned attacks of which two were prevented and three carried out - in Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge. What happened in the Manchester attack? Westminster attack: What we know so far ""The tempo has increased,"" he said, adding that officers at Britain's intelligence services were ""working flat out"". ""Hostile Vehicle Mitigation Barriers"" have beenadded to central London bridges to prevent vehicles being drivenonto the pavement. Meanwhile, police are working with ""iconic venues"" and music festivals to improve their security over the summer. Police morale 'high' over thwarted plots.

Davidson given DUP gay rights assurance,"This video can not be played Ruth Davidson said: ""It was one [LGBTI rights]  that I wanted categoric assurance from the PM, and I received."" Ruth Davidson has been told by the prime minister that any Conservative deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will not affect LGBTI rights. The Scottish Conservative leader, who is gay, plans to marry her partner in the near future. The DUP opposes same-sex marriage, with Northern Ireland the only part of the UK where it is not legal. Ms Davidson said she had been given an assurance that gay rights would not be eroded in return for DUP support. In a tweet sent on Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson highlighteda speech she made in Belfast about the importance of equal marriage. May to form government with DUP backing How will this minority government actually work? Who are the DUP? She told the BBC's Reporting Scotland programme that she had spoken about the issue with Theresa May on Friday evening. Ms Davidson said: ""I was fairly straightforward with her and I told her that there were a number of things that count to me more than party. ""One of them is country, one of the others is LGBTI rights."" The Scottish Tory leader said she had asked for, and received, a ""categoric assurance"" from Mrs May that any arrangement between the Conservatives and the DUP would see ""absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK"". Ruth Davidson is engaged to her partner Jen Wilson And she said the prime minister agreed to try to use her influence to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland. Ms May, whose party lost its majority at Westminster in Thursday's general election, says she will put together a minority government with the support of the DUP to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. The DUP, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong and controversial views on a number of social issues. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - with abortion remaining illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP ""friends"" to ""get to work"" on Brexit. She referred to the ""strong relationship"" she had with the DUP, but gave little detail of how their arrangement might work. It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it ""lend"" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as ""confidence and supply"". When asked whether she was comfortable about the arrangement given the DUP's views, Ms Davidson said there was ""no suggestion"" that the Conservative government would be dependent on the support of the DUP. She added: ""The prime minister has already made it clear that it is not going to be a formal coalition, so let's see how the future days go ahead."" Ms Davidson, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, has called for the Tories to listen to other parties to deliver an ""open Brexit"", which she defines as ensuring that free trade is at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. She said: ""I want to make sure that Scottish businesses can trade as freely as possible with the other 27 countries in the EU as well as the other countries around the world."" Ms Davidson's party won 13 seats in Scotland as its vote surged across the country. Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats returned seven and four MPs respectively, with the SNP winning 35 - a drop of 21 from the 56 the party won two years ago. DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds celebrated as the party won 10 seats in the election The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views.

How will this minority government actually work?,"Theresa May needs Northern Ireland's 10 DUP MPs to form her government The incontestable truth of thisgeneral electionis that the Conservative party does not have enough MPs to win votes by itself in the new House of Commons. Nothing matters more than the parliamentary numbers and Theresa May's lack of a majority. The politics of the coming months and perhaps years will be dominated by this one fact. Now the prime minister could try to get her legislation through vote by vote, issue by issue. But that would be a recipe for instability and unpredictability. So she has announced that she will try to do a deal with theDemocratic Unionist Party, Northern Ireland's largest unionist party. The DUP have 10 MPs and if they vote with the Conservatives, the government will be able to get its business through Parliament. The easiest way for the government to ensure regular DUP support in Parliament would be to agree what's called a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement. The DUP would promise to back the government in votes of no confidence and supply - or budget - issues.  In return, the government would support or fund some of the DUP's policies. These deals tend to be loose and a long way short of a formal coalition. Full election results breakdown,external May to form government with DUP backing Heartland and strongholds and lost deposits - the result, in maps Twenty things you may have missed Minority governments like this are not uncommon. The Scottish National Party ran a minority government in Scotland a decade ago. John Major survived without a majority in the dying days of his administration in the mid-1990s. Harold Wilson and James Callaghan governed with minorities for much of the 1970s. 1974: Labour, led by Harold Wilson (left) formed a minority government after the Liberals under Jeremy Thorpe (right) failed to strike a deal with the Conservatives But these governments can be quite constrained in what they can do, passing as little legislation as possible to avoid defeat. They can also be unstable and short lived, if the deal between the parties breaks down and fresh elections have to be called. So anyarrangement between the Conservatives and the DUPwould have a large question mark over it, particularly over how long it could last. The Institute for Government think-tank says that for minority governments to last and work, ministers, MPs and the media have to change the way they think. Ministers have to be less majoritarian in their outlook, and be less ambitious and more realistic about what they can achieve. MPs need to learn how to do deals and make compromises. And the media have to stop viewing every defeat as a confidence issue. But this does not always happen. Minority governments can linger on, scrabbling around for votes, spraying around taxpayers' money in return for parliamentary support. What this means is MPs having to hang around the Palace of Westminster at all hours just in case there are unexpected votes. This can mean whips - or parliamentary managers - rushing round doing deals with MPs from other parties, threatening some, bribing others. When votes are really tight, it can mean sick MPs being brought from their hospital beds in ambulances so their votes can be counted. The biographies of MPs from the 1970s can be eye-watering in their depiction of the reality of minority government. 2010: David Cameron and Nick Clegg form a coalition government There are also specific risks for the Conservatives in doing a deal with the DUP. They will be in hock to a party whose views and policies they will not always find palatable. Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff in Downing Street, told the BBC: ""The Conservatives have made a big mistake. Theresa May has made herself a hostage to the DUP."" In terms of the politics of Northern Ireland, it may make it harder for the British government to play its traditional role of neutral mediator. In terms of UK politics, it hooks the Tories to a party that is not known for its social liberalism. A woman who once described the Tories as the ""nasty party"" may find herself having to make some rather socially conservative choices. There are also risks to the Brexit process. A key issue will be the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. All sides are worried about the potential impact on the political settlement if border posts and guards are reinstated, a reminder of the divisions and violence of the past. Some MPs fear that the DUP could shape this part of the negotiation in a way that could disrupt the sensitive status quo. The days of the Troubles are gone, and the border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic lie rusting and unused. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. How do they see the road ahead? Special report: The hardest border And then there is just the sheer lack of numbers. Even with the DUP, many of the votes will be tight. It will take discipline and stamina to ensure that all MPs turn up day after day to push through complicated and contentious legislation, such as the enormousGreat Repeal Billtransferring EU law into UK law. This cannot be guaranteed. Theresa May called this election because she concluded she could not get Brexit through the House of Commons with a majority of 17. She may struggle to do it with a similar majority that is made up of another party's MPs. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

Ex-BBC presenters jailed for sex offences,"The Wadsworths are ""sexual predators"" who lived ""double lives"", prosecutors said Two former BBC radio presenters have each been jailed for five years for indecently assaulting under-age boys. Husband and wife Tony and Julie Wadsworth were found guilty by a majority verdict of encouraging six boys to take part in sexual activity between 1992 and 1996. The couple were also convicted at Warwick Crown Court of outraging public decency by having sex in woodland. The pair, of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, had denied the charges. Following a three-week trial, Julie Wadsworth, 60, was convicted by majority 10-2 verdicts of nine indecent assaults against boys and five counts of outraging public decency. Her spouse, 69, who acted as a ""look-out"", was found guilty of the same charges, also by majority verdicts. Both were found not guilty of three counts of indecent assault, one of which related to a single complainant. The couple claimed they had ""hanky panky"" outdoors in order to boost Julie Wadsworth's self esteem Some victims, who were aged 11 to 15 at the time of the offences, told the court Julie Wadsworth was variously dressed in a ""flasher's mac"" trench coat, white high-heels, stockings, suspenders and a split-skirt. Prosecutors said the abuse took place at a number of locations, including the couple's then home in Atherstone, Warwickshire, as well as on a nearby golf course and surrounding woodland. During the trial, the Wadsworths  - who married in 1994 - told how they had outdoor ""hanky panky"" in order to empower Julie Wadsworth and help her with body image issues stemming from a troubled past. She admitted having sexual encounters with ""young men"" but repeatedly denied any of them had been under the age of consent. Julie Wadsworth ""loved the attention"" of young boys and her husband encouraged her, the judge said In court it emerged that two groups of victims contacted police after a complainant realised what had taken place in the 90s ""was not right and not appropriate"". In videos of police interviews played to the jury, the man claimed he had up to 15 sexual encounters as a teenager with Julie Wadsworth - around half of them before he turned 16. On one occasion, the court heard, Tony Wadsworth joined in a ""threesome"" with the teenager at the couple's home after he turned 16. The Wadsworths were known for sharing a suggestive sense of humour Tony and Julie Wadsworth were a well-known double act in the Midlands, presenting together for more than two decades for BBC local radio in Leicester and in Birmingham. The couple were known for their double-entendres and ""Carry On"" sense of humour - and played up to it on camera and for publicity. Although little-known outside the Midlands, the case generated lurid headlines in the newspapers as details of the couple's sex lives were revealed in court. Staff who worked with them said they had absolutely no suspicions about their sexual behaviour. Another victim, who was 14 at the time, told the court he was ""100% convinced"" that a couple he saw having sex against a tree in 1992 were the Wadsworths and said she had performed a sex act on him. One of the complainants told the trial Julie Wadsworth ""must have known"" her victims were under-age because of their physical appearance. The sixth witness estimated that he was about 11 when he and older boys saw the Wadsworths having sex against a tree. He was either 12 or 13 when he and two other boys were indecently assaulted, the man recalled. Sentencing the pair, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC said the ""grave"" offences had caused emotional damage to all the victims. He said Julie Wadsworth, had ""loved the attention and that young boys were attracted to you"" and her husband had encouraged the offences. He said it would have been obvious to anyone that the victims - some of whom were riding bikes or climbing trees in parkland - were young boys. The Wadsworths enjoyed a high profile among local radio listeners in the Midlands As the verdicts were returned, Julie Wadsworth repeatedly gulped and wiped away tears. Her husband showed little emotion. Mitigating for her after conviction, David Hislop QC said: ""At 60 years of age, hers has been a tragic fall from grace... a period of incarceration will be made even more difficult for her, knowing the stigma attached to her convictions will carry on forever."" Tony Wadsworth's lawyer, Michelle Clarke, said the hardest thing for him would be being separated from his wife. Speaking after the case, David Rouse, a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said the couple had lived ""double lives"". ""In their public and professional lives they were a couple who came across as caring, warm and respectable. ""However, in their private lives, they preyed on young, impressionable victims for their own sexual gratification."" He thanked the victims for their courage in bringing ""two sexual predators to justice"". Det Sgt Rhys Bower, from Warwickshire Police, said: ""These two individuals gave no thought to the impact their actions were having on the young boys they abused; they were only concerned with their own gratification."" The NSPCC said: ""The Wadsworths' behaviour has been exposed for what it is - child sexual abuse. ""Julie Wadsworth's fatuous claim in court that she was a victim in this case is insulting. ""The true victims were young boys who were repeatedly encouraged to engage in illegal sexual activity."" A BBC spokesman said the Wadsworths were last on air in December 2015 and no longer work for the corporation.

May to form government with DUP backing,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she'll ""reflect on what we need to do to take the party forward"" Theresa May has said she will put together a government with the support of the Democratic Unionists to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. Speaking after visiting Buckingham Palace, she said only her party had the ""legitimacy"" to govern, despite falling eight seats short of a majority. Later, she said she ""obviously wanted a different result"" and felt ""sorry"" for colleagues who lost their seats. But Labour said they were the ""real winners"". The Lib Dems said Mrs May should be ""ashamed"" of carrying on. The Tories needed 326 seats to win another majority but they fell short and must rely on the DUP to continue to rule.

Referring to the ""strong relationship"" she had with the DUP but giving little detail of how their arrangement might work, she said she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"".

""I'm sorry for all those candidates... who weren't successful, and also particularly sorry for MPs and ministers who'd contributed so much to our country, and who lost their seats and didn't deserve to lose their seats. ""As I reflect on the results, I will reflect on what I need to do in the future to take the party forward.""

While always striving for the ""best deal"" for Northern Ireland and its people, she said her party would always have the best interests of the UK at heart. Scottish Conservative leaderRuth Davidson has since sought assurancesfrom Mrs May that any deal with the DUP will not affect LGBTI rights across the UK. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal.

Who's in the Cabinet? In an ongoing Cabinet reshuffle, five cabinet ministers are certain to stay: Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon; Brexit Secretary David Davis; Home Secretary Amber Rudd; Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Hammond said, in a tweet, that he was ""pleased to be reappointed so we can now get on and negotiate a Brexit deal that supports British jobs, business and prosperity"". Mr Johnson tweeted that he was ""delighted"", adding ""lots of great work to do for greatest country on earth"". However, those rarely seen on the campaign trail, including Andrea Leadsom, Priti Patel and Liam Fox, could be out, says BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. Comebacks from Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove and prominent leave campaigner Dominic Raab were being floated, she adds. Where does this leave Labour? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has denounced Mrs May's plan to head up a minority government, calling for her to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He said Labour was ready to form a minority government of its own, after far exceeding expectations by picking up 30 seats in England, Wales and Scotland. But even if it joined together in a so-called progressive alliance with the SNP, Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru, it would only reach 314 seats - short of the 326 figure needed. ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said, while stressing he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson said the ""surprise"" result was a political ""earthquake"",  and he'd been ""wrong"" to criticise Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. There are three posts that Mr Corbyn now needs to fill in the shadow cabinet, but sources say an announcement is not likely until Sunday at the earliest. Streatham MP Chuka Umunna, a leading figure on the right of the party, has said he would accept a role in the shadow cabinet. The Jeremy Corbyn factor What about Scotland? This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP 'will listen to voters' The SNP remains the largest party in Scotland but lost 21 seats to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Leading figures in the party such as Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were defeated. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her party's plans for a second independence referendum were ""undoubtedly"" a factor in the results, and she would ""reflect carefully"". Ruth Davidson - whose Scottish Conservatives went from one seat to 13 - said Ms Sturgeon should now take a second referendum ""off the table"". Read morehere. How did the parties fare? The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the PM has returned to No 10 a ""diminished figure"", having ended up with 13 fewer seats than when she called the election in April. She had called the election with the stated reason that it would strengthen her hand in negotiations for the UK to leave the EU - the talks are due to start on 19 June. But the Tories are on 318 seats, ahead of Labour on 262 following itslate win in Kensington,the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems on 12. The DUP won 10 seats. As it stands, the Tories and the DUP would have 328 MPs in the Commons, giving it a wafer-thin majority although as Sinn Fein will not be taking its seven seats, the new administration will have slightly more room for manoeuvre.

Some in her own party have also called for her resignation, with Anna Soubry saying she should consider her position after a ""disastrous"" campaign. However, other MPs have urged her to stay on - Iain Duncan Smith said a leadership contest would be a ""catastrophe"". Tory MP Philip Davies said his party had made ""a pig's ear"" of the campaign, and fellow Tory MP Nigel Evans said his party had ""shot ourselves in the head"". Mrs May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, said the party should never have run a Presidential-style campaign when the leader is ""shy"" and doesn't like doing interviews. The Green Party, which held its one seat at the election but saw its total vote halve, said a Conservative government propped up by the DUP would be a ""coalition of chaos"". ""The DUP, I don't think, are the kind of people you want calling the shots,"" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said. Downing Street said Mrs May received congratulatory calls from French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he was pleased that she would continue to be a close partner, and US President Donald Trump, who agreed with her that they looked forward to close co-operation. Read how the rest of the world reacted Where does this leave Brexit and the Conservative manifesto? Britain's exit from the European Union has been plunged into uncertainty, says BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. The government - and the DUP - may have to rethink their strategy, and the EU will be dismayed to be facing a divided British parliament in a divided Britain, he adds. European Council president Donald Tusk says there is now ""no time to lose"" over Brexit and the European Parliament's chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the result was an ""own goal"" which made negotiations more ""complicated"". Read more from James here BBC analysts says the Conservative's election manifesto may also be in jeopardy. Policies, such as new grammar schools and social care reforms, are likely to get ditched, they say. Without a majority in the Commons, members of the Lords might feel entitled to block them. Also, within the Conservative party, there is a widespread perception that the manifesto was a disaster which they need to distance themselves from, they add. Other big shocks and surprises In a night of high drama, former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg lost his seat while current leader Tim Farron clung on by less than 800 votes in his Cumbrian constituency.

How do you get over losing your dream job as an MP?,"Gemma Doyle lost what had once been seen as a 'safe seat' in 2015 How long does it take to get over the shock of losing your job as an MP? A year, two days? Inevitably some MPs - such as former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and former SNP leader Alex Salmond - found themselves out of a job in the early hours of this morning - and it can be tough to take. Astudy by the Open University Business School,externaldidn't beat about the bush when summing up just how difficult it can be for some MPs to leave office. It included an anonymous quote from one former MP, who said: ""It was like a bereavement, and it was, but there was no funeral."" In the same study, Baroness Jowell, who stood down at the 2015 election after 23 years as the MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, explained why it can be such a terrible shock to the system. ""As an elected politician, you are always switched on and feel the responsibility for your electorate day and night. This is not easy to give up."" Election 2017: Which seats changed hands May to form government with DUP For some former ministers, the pain can be mitigated by trading in a high political profile for a high profile elsewhere. Former Chancellor George Osborne is now editor of the London Evening Standard, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls used a comedy turn on Strictly Come Dancing to raise his profile and transform the way he was viewed by the public. Michael Portillo emerged from a defeat in the 1997 election so famous that it became known as the ""Were you up for Portillo?"" moment, but reinvented himself as a cultured presenter of railway travelogue documentaries. Some people even revel in the their new-found freedom. Liberal Democrat Norman Baker, a minister in the 2010 coalition government, reformed his old band the - er - Reform Club, released new material and went on the road. This video can not be played Norman Baker performs at London's Piccadilly Circus A scathing review of a single in the Daily Telegraph - ""banal, obvious and utterly pedestrian"" - hasn't stopped him embracing a varied media life to the point where he told the Independent newspaper he had no intention of returning to front-line party politics. Others, like Labour's Chris Williamson, who lost his seat in Derby in 2015 by 41 votes, immediately work to get back to Westminster as soon as possible. ""I'm a Derby lad,"" he told the New Statesman, ""You're elected to represent your city, and then you lose - I was in the depths of despair."" He duly won his seat back on Friday morning, with a majority of 2,015. Election 2017: The result in maps and charts How will this minority government actually work? Twenty things you may have missed from election night Others, however, choose a different path. Jackie Ballard lost her seat at the 2001 general election after four years as the Lib Dem MP for Taunton, agonisingly falling short by just 235 votes. ""I was very disappointed as I knew I had been a good, hard-working MP and had a great team of helpers, who I felt I had let down,"" she said. Jackie Ballard during her time as Lib Dem home affairs spokeswoman ""I decided as soon as I knew the result (although it was about 05:00 in the morning, after a  number of recounts) that I would not stand again. I felt rejected by the people in Taunton, where  I had lived for many years, and didn't want to live there any longer."" It was a painful change of fortune for a woman who had stood for the leadership of her party just two years earlier. For a year she went away to lick her wounds on a ""gap year"", living and studying in Iran. But when she got back she found that her Westminster experience - even the tough times - held her in good stead when looking for an alternative career. As an MP some thought her outspoken opposition to blood sports, including co-sponsorship of the first bill to attempt to introduce a ban on fox hunting, had sealed her electoral fate. But her campaigning track record helped her to secure a plum job as director general of the RSPCA. Nick Clegg lost the Sheffield seat he had held since 2005 Ms Ballard went on to hold senior roles with the RNID, and Womankind Worldwide, a relatively small but respected international women's rights charity, before becoming chief executive of Alcohol Concern in 2014. She was also appointed to the Independent Standards Authority, overseeing MPs' expenses in 2009. ""I have loved working in the charity sector and feel that I have made a lasting contribution to a number of very worthwhile charities,"" she said. ""It was challenging to move into leadership and management, but I loved doing something worthwhile and where my Parliamentary experience was useful on the campaigning side. ""A key skill which is needed to get things done in Parliament and in charities is the ability to make alliances and work with others to achieve an outcome."" Gemma Doyle, one of the raft of Labour MPs in Scotland who lost their seat to the SNP in 2015, says she adjusted quickly to the new reality of life after Westminster. Couldn't stay away: Chris Williamson has made a speedy return to Westminster after losing his seat in 2015 ""I spent about two days feeling sorry for myself, but fairly quickly moved on to accepting that there was nothing I could have done about the result, that it was the consequence of a principled stance we had taken on the Scottish referendum, and there was no point in dwelling on it,"" she said. ""The 2015 election result was quite unusual, I had lost in a constituency which, under normal circumstances, would have been a guaranteed safe seat. The swing against me, and my Scottish colleagues was massive. ""However, strange as it sounds, there is comfort in losing in such a spectacular way. If you lose by just a little, it must be difficult not to dwell on the things you could or should have done differently. If you lose the way most of us did in Scotland, there's just nothing that would have changed the result."" Ms Doyle is now a director at a public affairs firm, and also freelances in the sector. ""There is a myth that ex-MPs are given or helped to find new jobs. That's not true, you are on your own, and there's no doubt that but for a few exceptions, it's tough to work out what comes next, especially when you have just lost, what for me was my dream job. ""I worried I wouldn't end up doing something that felt like it mattered again, but I fell into freelancing, including consultancy in some strange bits of the world working to support emerging democracies, which I enjoy enormously. ""I feel hugely privileged to have been an MP. In the end if you stand for election you have to be prepared for defeat. That's politics.""

Mars recalls chocolates over salmonella fear,"Chocolate maker Mars is recalling some bars of Galaxy, Maltesers Teasers and bags of Minstrels due to the ""potential presence of salmonella"". Mars said the products, for sale in the UK and Ireland, should not be eaten. The recall began after tests showed salmonella may be in ingredients. ""We are working closely with the relevant food safety authorities and our customers to ensure that the affected products are no longer available for purchase,"" Mars said. Mars said thousands of potentially affected chocolates -  fewer than 3,000 - could already have been sold to customers. Products including,externalGalaxy Milk 200g bars, Minstrel 118g pouches and Maltesers Teasers 35g bars with best-before dates of 6 May 2018 and 13 May 2018 are affected. Other products included in the recall include Galaxy Milk 4x42g multipacks and Galaxy Counters 78g and 112g pouches with the 6 May 2018 and 13 May 2018 best-before dates. The company has asked food retailers across the UK and Ireland to pull the affected products from shelves immediately. Tesco told the BBC that it wasn't going to sell any of the affected products it had in stock, whatever the best before date, as a temporary measure to help avoid any customer confusion. The chocolate products affected were made at Mars' Slough factory. People who have purchased the affected confectionary should contact the Mars customer call centre for ""returns and reimbursement"", it said. The Food Standards Agency said the recall ""is for a small number of products and is on a precautionary basis."" Mars said no other brands or varieties of chocolate, pack formats, bar sizes or best before dates had been affected. The products being recalled are: Galaxy Milk 200g Bar - product code AC76R, batches 719G1SLO00, 719G2SLO00, with the best-before date of May 6, 2018, and batches 720A2SLO00, 720B1SLO00 with the best-before date of May 13, 2018 Galaxy Milk 4x42g Multipack Bars - product code AF67D, batches 719G1SLO00 and 719G2SLO00 with the best-before date of May 6, 2018 Galaxy Milk 42g Bar - product code AN22R, batch number 719G2SLO00, with the best-before date of May 6, 2018 Galaxy Counters 78g Treat Bag - product code AW99N, batch number 719G2SLO00, with the best-before date of May, 6, 2018 Galaxy Counters 112g Pouch - product code AW99G in Ireland, batch numbers 720B1SLO00 and 720C1SLO00 with best-before dates of May 13, 2018 Maltesters Teasers 35g Bar - product code AX46E, batches 720C1SLO00 and 720D2SLO00 in the UK and Ireland, with the best-before date of May 13, 2018 Galaxy Minstrels 118g Pouch (Sweet Nights In promotion) - product code BJ30K, batch number 720B1SLO00, with the best-before date of May 13, 2018 Mars said UK consumers can call 0800 952 0084 for reimbursement and Irish consumers can contact 1890 812 315.

Who are the DUP?,"The DUP had a good night in Northern Ireland, securing two more MPs. The Conservatives lost their overall majority in the general election and Prime Minister Theresa May is now dependent on seeking alliances with parties to get the 326 votes she needs to pass legislation in a hung Parliament. Theresa May has already said thatshe will form a government with the support of Northern Irish partythe Democratic Unionists (DUP). The DUP have the crucial 10 extra seats needed by the Tories to govern, and as a result will wield a lot of influence in the new administration. Party leader Arlene Foster will meet the prime minister on Tuesday, and she has already said she will be seeking a better deal for Northern Ireland. It is not clear what shape the proposed Tory/DUP alliance will take, but Ms Foster confirmed it is not going to be a formal coalition. On Friday morning, the DUP was one of the most searched terms on Google - so what do they stand for? Basically, they are pro-union (UK, not Europe), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. What price for DUP support? Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? Hung Parliament: What happens next? 20 things you may have missed on election night The party is now the fifth largest in Parliament; its 36% share of the vote in Northern Ireland resulted in 10 MPs being returned to Westminster, but it wasn't always so popular. It started as a one-man-band, with Rev Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist Protestant preacher, at its helm. He founded the party in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists; the party of the political establishment since the state was founded in 1921. The Democratic Unionist Party moved from a hard-line fringe unionist party in the 1970s, led by Ian Paisley, to Northern Ireland's biggest party Unlike nationalists, who want to see the Irish border removed and rule from Westminster ended, unionists want the link with Britain preserved. For most of his political career, Ian Paisley saw the prospect of devolved power sharing with his political enemies as a Trojan Horse to Irish unity. He set his face against successive attempts to cobble together an agreement between nationalists and unionists, knowing that simply by saying no he could make political gains. And so it was that by 2005 the Democratic Unionist Party, which started as the party of resistance to any hint of accommodation, displaced the ruling class of the Ulster Unionists as the party which could legitimately claim to speak for all of unionism. Power sharing with Sinn Fein followed in 2007 and, until recently, the DUP had a reputation for fiscal prudence and deft political strategising. Ian Paisley became unlikely friends with former IRA commander and Sinn FÃ©in politician Martin McGuinness When Ian Paisley became first minister in Stormont - Northern Ireland's seat of government - with Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness acting as deputy first minister, the two of them got on so well that they were nicknamed the ""chuckle brothers"". But all of that seems like a distant memory. The party remained electorally dominant under its next leader Peter Robinson, but relations between nationalists and unionists in the country's fragile power-sharing executive began to cool. After Mr Robinson lost his Westminster seat in the 2010 general election, Mrs Foster took over as party leader in December 2015, and first minister in 2016. Her leadership has been sullied by controversy over the Renewable Heat Incentive Deal, which saw the power-sharing executive collapse in 2017, causing a snap election in Stormont. Northern Ireland is still without a government but the DUP has found itself in a position to influence political events across the entire United Kingdom, and that has led to scrutiny of some of the party's policies. The party may be less overtly religious than it was in the days when Rev Paisley was in charge, but on social issues it is still deeply conservative. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. Broadcaster Jon Snow makes his feelings about the deal known on Twitter Paul Johnson is deputy editor of the Guardian - the DUP's controversial views are gaining a lot of attention everywhere, not just in the left-leaning press DUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, a devout climate change denier,external, was once Northern Ireland's environment minister. Mervyn Storey, the party's former education spokesman, once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. He has alsoobjected to an exhibition on evolution in the Ulster Museumand signs at the Giant's Causeway in his North Antrim constituency. Then there's the party's historical links to loyalist paramilitaries. During this general election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly received the endorsement of the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. This video can not be played The DUP: Partners in government Although the DUP said it did not accept their support, in her acceptance speech, Mrs Little-Pengelly thanked those who came out to vote for her, singling out several loyalist working class areas in Belfast. In December, theDUP's Trevor Clarke was criticised by Sir Elton Johnafter the politician admitted he did not know heterosexual people could contract HIV until a charity explained the facts to him. A new frontier? The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland The DUP was a wholehearted supporter of Brexit and got heavily involved in the Leave campaign. After Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland becomes an EU frontier and the DUP is not in favour of a so-called hard border. This means no checkpoints or intrusive enforcement. So no hard border but in the round, the party's vision of Brexit is a fairly hard one - it was the most Eurosceptic party in the UK before the ascent of UKIP. The party also wants to leave the EU customs union - their manifesto says there should be ""progress on new free trade deals with the rest of the world"" - and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, ensuring that in future British law is supreme. One red line is the idea of Northern Ireland being granted some sort of ""special status"" when Brexit comes to pass - the DUP will not stand for any arrangement that physically sets the region apart from anywhere else in the UK. Its2017 manifesto,externalset out its position on Brexit and other issues, including: Further increases to the personal tax allowance - similar to Conservative Party policy Continued rises in the national living wage - similar Renew Trident - similar Revisit terrorism laws - similar Abolish air passenger duty - different from the Conservatives Cut VAT for tourism businesses - different Call for""triple lock"" on pensions- different Its key slogan during the campaign turned out to be rather prescient: ""A vote for the DUP team is a vote to send 'Team Northern Ireland' to Westminster.  It is a team that has real influence"". Theresa May literally bumped into Arlene Foster at an agricultural show while the PM was on the campaign trail in Northern Ireland Ahead of the election, Northern Ireland's largest party made clear its preference was for a Conservative rather than Labour government. The DUP's most senior MPs, including its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, have been consistently critical of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, particularly for his past links with Sinn FÃ©in and his stance on security issues.

UK's 'youngest double murderers' named,"This video can not be played Teenage sweethearts had 'dark dreams' The couple believed to be Britain's youngest double murderers have been named, after a judge lifted a ban on identifying them. Kim Edwards and her boyfriend Lucas Markham murdered Edwards' mother Elizabeth, 49, and her younger sister Katie, 13, at their home in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in April 2016. The killers, who were 14 at the time, were both jailed in November. A bid to stop their names being made public was rejected in the High Court. Why did Kim Edwards kill her mother and sister? More stories from across Lincolnshire Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her daughter Katie, 13, were found dead in April 2016 Edwards and Markham were originally jailed for at least 20 years each, but judges have reduced the sentences to 17 and a half years. Markham, who admitted the killings, used a kitchen knife to stab both victims in the neck a total of ten times as they slept. Edwards, who helped to plan the ""cold, calculated and callous"" killings, denied murder, claiming to be suffering a mental abnormality which impaired her ability to form rational judgments, but wasfound guilty by a jury. This video can not be played Edwards: 'I never got on with my mum' The teenagers were both jailed for life at Nottingham Crown Court in November and told they must serve at least 20 years before being considered for parole. The court heard Markham walked for around 30 minutes along Spalding's Coronation Channel to reach Edwards' home before knocking three times on a bedroom window as a pre-arranged signal that he had arrived. Edwards then opened a bathroom window to allow Markham to climb into the house from the roof of a shed, and gave him advice on moving quietly around the property. Police discovered the bodies of Mrs Edwards and her daughter Katie at their home in Dawson Avenue, Spalding Evidence heard in the trial, but unpublished until now, revealed that the couple remained at the house in Dawson Avenue immediately after the killings where they had sex, shared a bath and watched the vampire-themed teen romance Twilight films. They were discovered and arrested at the home Edwards shared with her mother and sister 36 hours later, having been reported missing to police. Kim Edwards and Lucas Markham planned a double murder born out of an intense relationship. Kim resented her mother, Elizabeth, and disliked her sister, Katie, for the close relationship she had with their mum. Drawn together by suicidal thoughts the couple convinced each the solution to the grudge she held against her mum was to kill her and her teenage sister. Lucas wounded Mrs Edwards terribly before smothering her with a pillow. It wasn't quick - she struggled and fought for her life while Kim watched on. Despite Kim's reservations about killing her sister, they weren't strong enough to stop Markham. The details of the murders are some of the most harrowing I have heard in 17 years of court reporting. The ban on naming the two teenagers was lifted by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave on 8 December but their identities remained secret until now to allow their lawyers to appeal against the ruling. Outlining his reasons for lifting the ban, the judge said: ""It is impossible for the public properly to understand this case without knowing the identity of the defendants and that these murders took place in a closed family context. ""This singular fact informs and colours one's entire understanding of the case... unless one knows this singular fact, it is impossible to understand the true motive behind these murders."" Lucas Markham and Kim Edwards plotted the murders for days, their trial heard Upholding the trial judge's view, the ban on naming the pair was lifted by Sir Brian Leveson, Mr Justice Blake and Mr Justice Lewis. Sir Brian said: ""In the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding that the appellants are only 15 years of age, we have no doubt that the lifting of reporting restrictions is in accordance with law, pursues a legitimate aim and is a reasonable and proportionate measure ... properly balancing the welfare of the appellants ... against the Article 10 rights of the press and the interests of the public."" Elizabeth and Katie Edwards were stabbed in the throat as they slept Det Supt Martin Holvey, of Lincolnshire Police, said the ""horrific and brutal"" murders had shocked the community and the naming of the teenage killers would only add to that. ""I'm sure that sense of disbelief and horror will be deepened now it is known that it was Elizabeth's own daughter who was responsible for plotting with her boyfriend to carry out the murders,"" he said. He said the extra details now made public, including how the couple stayed in the house after the killings and the lack of remorse showed by Edwards and Markham, were ""chilling"". ""These new revelations will undoubtedly focus attention on Spalding once again.  I would like to repeat sentiments I have made earlier, thanking the community for their cooperation throughout the case and paying tribute to the courage of Elizabeth and Katie's family,"" he said. ""They have endured a terrible ordeal and faced the additional anguish of knowing that this horrific crime was committed by a family member.""

How the Tory campaign went wrong,"Theresa May heads out of Downing Street on her way to see the Queen At the start of this campaign, we started tracking where the party leaders went, in the hope of picking up clues about what to expect. Had we done this in 2015, it would have helped us spot the Conservatives' big push against the Liberal Democrats. We hoped our experiment might help us avoid a 2015-style shock. So how did it do? The main thing we have learned is that past performance is a poor guide to the future. The Tories were largely using much of the same team as in 2015 and, once again, they were very well funded. But this evidence implies that the Conservative party campaign in England was an absolute catastrophe, and appalling data and analysis drove them to use their resources poorly. The dots in this graph represent the state of the Tory-Labour battleground before polls opened on Thursday. The higher-up dots show places with more UKIP voters. The furthest left dots show safe Labour seats, and the furthest right dots show safe Conservative seats. The blue rings show where Theresa May visited. You can see she was more ambitious - going further left - in areas with more UKIP voters. This stuff matters. While leader visits may be a small part of a party's campaign arsenal, if they were gettingthatwrong, they were probably getting other campaigning efforts wrong. So I've drawn in a rough line showing where the Tory campaign thought the battleground roughly was - what we have called an ""implied frontier"" between the parties. Think of it as the centre of the fight. Towards the end of the race, the Tories thought it was closer in. Earlier on, they thought it was a bit further out. But treat it as a rough campaign summary. In short, they hoped to flip those Labour seats on the right hand side of the dotted line. This was a strategy aiming for a triple-digit majority - or something close. Instead, though, everything went wrong. In a graph below, I have coloured in the seats by who holds them now. And you can see the actual battleground was in a totally different place. That is the second line I've drawn in. You could draw this line in a few ways, but none of them get close to the Tory implied frontier. And the length of that big arrow is the size of the error. This was a double-digit polling error. Note, amid this, one further piece of evidence on the importance of polling to this disaster.Last month, YouGov broke from the consensus,externaland got close to the real result. Their model implied a hung parliament. When it was published, the Conservatives' pollsters in England - Mark Textor and Jim Messina - used Twitter to comment on how poor it was. Their reading of the race was, it transpires, way off. There is another datapoint which supports this conclusion. The campaigns tracker implied the frontier that the Conservatives were aiming for in Scotland was 13 gains. They made 12. And Nicola Sturgeon's patterns of visits suggest she roughly agreed. So the Conservative campaign there seemed to make sense. It so happens, though, that this was the one part of Great Britain where Mr Messina and Mr Textor were not running the show. The data operation in Scotland was run by James Kanagasooriam of Populus. Labour's efforts have always been harder to read. They did seem to build events designed to emphasise their presence on local TV bulletins, which made the charts difficult to interpret. Here, though, is a graph showing Jeremy Corbyn's visits, combined with that same estimate of where the real frontier was. Look at the right side. However they did it, Mr Corbyn was actually being deployed right there on the front line. The front line is just not where most public polls said it was. Did Labour quietly run a perfect campaign, then? Labour activists have had a great day, so I hope they do not mind me saying ""no"". Before the vote,as I said in my last piece, campaign officials in the party told me that they did not think Mr Corbyn's visits to Tory-held seats should be read as showing their ambitions. He went to places where he was wanted, which was not always a helpful guide to the party's thoughts. In truth, their analysis was, in effect, very close to the Conservative analysis I posted up above. You can see that elsewhere. When you look at the party's ground operations, they were not matching these visits with resources. I know of MPs who got cut off by the party as dead losses who held their seats comfortably. Just on Thursday, activists were dispatched to a deep defensive line. Shock gains like Enfield Southgate and Canterbury were shocks to lots of local activists, too, who yesterday were being sent to defend Labour-held seats elsewhere. To be clear, this is not about people trying to do Mr Corbyn down. I have spoken to people today who could be claiming credit for their foresight, who are wandering around in a state of shock. And, frankly, it is a tribute to Mr Corbyn that Labour did so well, when they put their troops in strange places. Ian McNichol, Labour's general secretary, and Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader What, then, can we learn? First, these charts explain the epic scale of the Tory shock this morning is explained by how far short of their goals they have fallen. This is simply not a prospect they countenanced Second, the fight in Scotland was much better understood by the pollsters and parties than the race in England and Wales. And the Scottish Tories are utterly formidable Third, this was not 2015, when one party knew something the others didn't. This was a result that shocked absolutely everyone.

The Corbyn factor,"For Jeremy Corbyn, this was the sweetest of defeats. The Labour leader won just 262 seats, not nearly enough to secure a majority in Parliament. His party is the second largest in the House of Commons, not the first. He won fewer seats than Neil Kinnock in 1992. And yet for Mr Corbyn this is a result that exceeded all expectations. Having begun the campaign 20 points behind in the polls, he has won an astonishing 40% of the votes. That is the largest increase in the share of the vote by a Labour leader since Clement Attlee in 1945. As a result, Mr Corbyn won 30 more seats for his party than Ed Miliband achieved two years ago. He has deprived Theresa May of her majority. He has won seats in southern England such as Canterbury and Plymouth that for years have been Labour no-go areas. After months of internal criticism, a man who was described as Labour's weakest leader since Michael Foot now has his position assured. He is being compared to Bernie Sanders, the populist American Democratic politician who gave Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the last presidential contest. Election night at-a-glance Full UK results breakdown,external So bullish is the Labour leader that he is even suggesting his party could form an unlikely minority government and not the Conservatives. At the very least, he is now very much the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition with real heft in the House of Commons. Mr Corbyn was rewarded for a campaign that had an old-fashioned feel, one where he addressed large rallies and channelled a mass grassroots movement with effective party organisation. Unlike the prime minister, he engaged with the media and chose to take part in the TV debates. He showed he could learn, ditching the down-at-heel lecturer look for a more professional demeanour. He cut his hair, did up his tie and bought a proper suit. In the face of a brutal onslaught from the print media, Mr Corbyn learned to keep his calm, realising that peevishness is seen by many voters to be an unattractive trait. In fact, he may well have benefited from the negative headlines in the Daily Mail and the Sun if they convinced wavering Labour voters to return to the fold out of tribal loyalty. And Mr Corbyn appears to have done what few political leaders have done in recent years - he engaged with young people and convinced them to come out to vote. He did this by promising not just to cut their tuition fees - a bribe as shameless as past Tory promises to protect pensioner benefits - but also offering them some positive politics and a little passion. There was less of this on offer from the other side. He managed to engage with voters by appearing authentic, feeling the pain of those who have endured austerity for years as real wages fell, acknowledging their belief that globalisation at times has left them behind. He showed, amazingly, that Labour did not have to move to the centre to win votes but could do so from the unashamed left. He appealed to a coalition of young people, public sector workers and urban liberals, many of whom showed they were once again prepared to back someone who calls himself a socialist, promises to tax more and spend more, and is reluctant to deploy nuclear force. Many voters dismissed concerns about the affordability of his plans - dubbed the famous ""magic money tree"" by his opponents - and instead embraced the new radicalism. Mr Corbyn has changed British politics and as such the Labour party, whose obituary was being written by some Tories before this election, is now a force to be reckoned with in this new parliament.

The kingmakers: Who are the DUP's 10 MPs?,"The results of the 2017 general election have put the Democratic Unionist Party in the role of kingmakers. The Conservatives fell short of a parliamentary majority of 326 seats, but can achieve it with the support of the DUP's 10 MPs. The DUP is now set to support Theresa May in forming a new government. So who are the DUP's 10 MPs? The son of long-time party leader, its founder and former Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, Mr Paisley succeeded his father as North Antrim MP in 2010. He is a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, which his father led. Following the resignation of the late Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness earlier this year, Mr Paisley paid tribute to the Sinn FÃ©in leader and former IRA member. He said Mr McGuinness' ""remarkable journey not only saved lives, but made the lives of countless people better"". Mr Paisley has said he has no ambition to follow in his father's footsteps to lead the party. This video can not be played The DUP: Partners in government Earlier this year, Mr Paisley said that US President Donald Trump had accepted his invitation to visit Northern Ireland for the Open golf championship at Portrush in July 2019. Last year, Mr Paisley told the BBC:  ""I first met Donald Trump, along with my father, in 2006 and I've kept that relationship going. I've met him every year, bar one, since then."" In a 2007 interview, Mr Paisley expressed his views on same sex marriages. He toldHot Press magazine,externalhe was ""pretty repulsed"" by gay people and lesbianism. Mr Paisley later went on to defend his comments on BBC Newsnight saying he was ""repulsed by many things"". A former lord mayor of Belfast, Sammy Wilson has been MP for East Antrim since 2005. Known for his often outspoken views, Mr Wilson's 2008 appointment as Northern Ireland environment minister was criticised by environmental groups and members of the NI Assembly's environment committee because of his views on climate change. He said he was sceptical that all climate change was caused by CO2 emissions and described some campaigners' views as an ""hysterical pseudo-religion"". Mr Wilson has also served as Northern Ireland finance minister. He was also an environment minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, andtold the Belfast Telegraph,externalthe world had been ""conned"" into spending billions on climate change. Mr Wilson said politicians feel under pressure from lobby groups and ""go along with the flow"". ""I don't care about CO2 emissions to be quite truthful because I don't think it's all that important,"" he was quoted as saying. Paul Girvan won the South Antrim seat at his first attempt in this general election, defeating outgoing Ulster Unionist Danny Kinahan by more than 3,000 votes. He was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2003, but was deselected by the DUP in South Antrim in 2007. He returned to the assembly in 2010 when he was selected to replace Rev William McCrea following his resignation. Mr Girvan is a former mayor of Newtownabbey. Nigel Dodds is the deputy leader of the DUP and its leader at Westminster. He has been North Belfast MP since 2001,  taking the seat from Ulster Unionist Cecil Walker. In 2015, Mr Dodds who studied law at Cambridge University, ruled himself out of the race to succeed former party leader Peter Robinson. In 1996, a police officer guarding Mr Dodds while he visited his critically ill son in hospital, was shot and injured by the IRA. A former Belfast lord mayor, Mr Dodds' wife Diane is one of Northern Ireland's three MEPs. Like the majority of the DUP's parliamentary party, Mr Dodds is a member of the Orange Order. The order is a Protestant cultural and religious  organisation which has attracted controversy because of parades it has held through or near some Catholic areas. Who are the Orangemen? In 2013,Mr Dodds was expelled from the Commons chamberafter accusing the Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, of ""deliberate deception"". He claimed she had been deceptive when answering questions about her powers in respect of a controversial Orange parade ruling. Gavin Robinson won back the East Belfast seat for the DUP in 2015, which former party leader Peter Robinson (no relation) had lost to the Alliance Party's Naomi Long. He was re-elected this time around, defeating Mrs Long by more that 8,000 votes. Educated at Queen's University, Belfast, Mr Robinson read Law and attained a Masters in Irish Politics before starting work as a barrister. He is another DUP MP who has served as lord mayor of Belfast. Emma Little-Pengelly bounced back from losing her Northern Ireland Assembly seat in South Belfast in March, by winning the constituency's Westminster seat in June, defeating the SDLP's Alasdair McDonnell. It marks a rapid rise for Mrs Little-Pengelly, who first stood for election for the DUP in the 2015 assembly election. She is married to Richard Pengelly, who is a top civil servant in the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. During the campaign, she received the endorsement of the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. The DUP said it did not accept their support. In her acceptance speech, Mrs Little-Pengelly thanked those who came out to vote for her, singling out several loyalist working class areas such as Taughmonagh and Donegall Pass. Her father Noel Little was one of three men arrested in Paris in April 1989, along with a South African diplomat and an arms dealer. Little was given a suspended sentence and fined for his part in a loyalist intelligence plot. Mrs Little-Pengelly has said,externalshe has ""unconditional"" love for her father and that ""just because someone may have a past should not mean you cannot have a future"". From Kilkeel in County Down, Sir Jeffrey began his political career with the Ulster Unionist Party and was part of the UUP's negotiating team for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. He announced his resignation from the party, along with current leader Arlene Foster, in December 2003 in protest against Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's policies; both joined the DUP the following month. Sir Jeffrey was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2016. A former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, two of Sir Jeffrey's cousins - police officers Alex and Sam Donaldson - were murdered by the IRA during the Troubles. Jim Shannon increased his majority in Strangford by 9,000, securing 62% of the vote. He was first elected to the constituency in 2010. Mr Shannon served in the Ulster Defence Regiment in the 1970s and earlier this year hebroke down in tears in the House of Commonsas he discussed the IRA murder of his cousin Kenneth Smith. In 2011, he laughed off a website rating naming him as the least sexy MP in the UK. In 2016 he was ordered to repay almost Â£14,000 in mileage expenses claims.,external The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority found Mr Shannon was the highest claimant for staff constituency mileage during 2015, but it put the incorrect claims down to ""a number of errors"" and said there was no fraud. David Simpson was first elected as MP for Upper Bann in 2005, taking the seat from Ulster Unionist leader and former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble. He had lost out to Mr Trimble in 2001. In 2007, Mr Simpson used parliamentary privilege to accuse Sinn Fein's Francie Molloy - the current MP for Mid Ulster - of involvement in his cousin Frederick Lutton's murder and of being a police informer. Mr Molloy denied both allegations and challenged Mr Simpson to make them outside Parliament. Mr Simpson also spoke in the Commons against same-sex marriage, stating: ""In the garden of Eden it was Adam and Eve, it wasn't Adam and Steve."" He has lobbied to have creationism included,externalin the science curriculum in Northern Ireland. Born in Londonderry, Gregory Campbell joined the DUP in the 1970s and was first elected to Derry City Council in 1981. In 1985, theBBC Real Lives documentary At the Edge of the Union,externalfocused on Mr Campbell and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness. The documentary showed Mr Campbell loading his legally held gun, interspersed with pictures of him addressing a rally. It was temporarily blocked by direct government intervention from then-Home Secretary Leon Brittan. This led to a one-day strike by the National Union of Journalists to defend the independence of the BBC. Mr Campbell initially contested the Foyle constituency held by SDLP leader John Hume, but in 1997 was transferred to the more unionist East Londonderry. He was elected there in his second attempt in 2001, defeating sitting MP William Ross of the Ulster Unionist Party. In 2014, Mr Campbell was barred from addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly for a day for failing to apologise for parodying the Irish language during an address to the assembly. Mr Campbell has previously supported the reintroduction of the death penalty, during a 2009 Commons debate on a world-wide ban on capital punishment. When the Commons voted on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in 2013, DUP MPs Gregory Campbell, David Simpson, Jim Shannon, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Ian Paisley Jnr, Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds all voted against it. The bill was eventually passed 400 votes to 175. Kuenssberg: Can May survive? May: Country needs stability.

"Kamal Ahmed: So, farewell austerity?","Talk of controlling the deficit is now likely to be dialled down Before the 2010 election, David Cameron and George Osborne believed they would be tested on one issue. Could they be trusted to get the public finances ""back in order"". It was an age-old attack narrative used by the Conservatives over the decades - to great success. Labour breaks the national bank, eventually, it was claimed. And the Conservatives are voted in to sweep up the mess. It was a policy that became known by a single word - austerity. In the Budget of 2010, Mr Osborne, the Chancellor, announced Â£81bn of cuts over four years, some of the sharpest reversals in public financing seen for decades. ""It is a hard road, but it leads to a better future,"" he said. The argument held, just, in 2015. Ed Miliband relentlessly attacked the Conservatives on the issue of ""cuts"". And was rejected at the ballot box. Yesterday, a change, and economically as well as politically, a pretty fundamental one. Yes, Labour didn't win the election. But Jeremy Corbyn - on a vision of higher spending, higher taxes and higher levels of investment - came closer than almost everyone, apart from maybe Jeremy Corbyn, believed possible. So close that Theresa May will need the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to maintain her government. What next for the ""sound money"" pledge contained in the Conservative manifesto, the idea that cuts would continue for the sake of the health of public finances? Well, like a number of pledges made by Mrs May, let's say it might well be flexible. One Tory close to Number 10 told me that the message would need to change or Mrs May would not be able to convince non-Conservative voters to back her. ""It's time for the austerity policies to shift,"" he said. Hung Parliament: What happens next? Election 2017: At a glance Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury, tweeted the election result ""guarantees a higher deficit"". In short, many economists believe the government will be obliged to borrow more as political uncertainty weighs on growth, leading to less wealth creation and therefore the need for higher borrowing. Mrs May and her chancellor were already saying before the election - most clearly in private - that the age of constant cuts was harder to sell to the public. But rather than make an increase in spending the focus of their ""offer"" to the voter - as Labour tried to do - they allowed the whiff of tax rises to hang over their campaign. The triple tax lock of 2015 (no increases in income tax, national insurance contributions or VAT) was dumped in favour of a single lock on VAT and a vaguer pledge to lower taxes generally. Mrs May also abandoned the pensions triple lock, which guaranteed a rise in the annual pension of at least 2.5% a year. And said nothing about curtailing the public sector pay freeze or reversing any of the in-work benefit reductions announced in previous Budgets. Cuts to public services would continue, Mrs May suggested. Cuts so deep that the Institute for Fiscal Studies wondered whether they were actually deliverable. The ""tough"" party was still on show, and with poll leads storming above 20%, it seemed like a tactic that could work. But it crumbled in the face of Labour's very different proposition. Mr Corbyn was the change candidate, Mrs May ""more of the same"". The classic election split which plays well for the former if people are feeling dissatisfied with where their lives are. And in an era when real incomes are once again falling, ""change"" had many attractions. Now, I expect that the Conservatives will do their best to distance themselves from the nasty party tag. And, on economic policy at least, the DUP may help. In their manifesto, the party says that the pensions triple lock should be maintained. It attacks plans to means test the Winter Fuel Allowance (a Tory pledge) as well as any other ""assaults"" on benefits, which could of course include the in-work benefits freeze. If Mrs May wants to push her policies through Parliament she will have to recognise where the DUP is coming from. Talk of controlling the deficit (the amount the government spends above what it gains in tax revenue) is likely to be dialled down. The overall debt will be allowed to rise. Tories I have spoken to say that the Conservatives have to change the record on austerity. And they are looking to Mrs May to take the lead.

What now for your finances?,"Now the voting is over, it is time for a new kind of count - a calculation of what a hung Parliament means for your finances. Uncertainty abounds yet, even in its infancy, we know that the government - whomever forms it and however it operates - will make changes that will have a significant impact on your finances. This will have permutations for pay, decisions determining the length of our working lives and, of course, a new relationship with the European Union that will affect our financial outlook as a nation and individually. There is some consensus on matters of finances between the parties, for example on help for those in serious debt, but there are questions over whether these will be high on a priority list for a government that will have to work hard for any policy to be given the green light. So, what might change and when? Theperformance of the poundwill be closely watched in the coming days, not least by those planning a holiday this summer. Sterling fell sharply against the dollar and the euro following the UK's vote to leave the EU - making the cost of a typical holiday including travel and currency about 12% more expensive since the Brexit vote, according to one estimate. The election result broughtan initial 2.3% drop in sterlingagainst the dollar at just below $1.27, having been at $1.29 before the first exit poll.Against the euro, the pound was down 1.4% at 1.1386. The trajectory now as the fallout of the election takes shape, and when negotiations with the EU begin in earnest in a few days' time, will determine what people get at the bureau de change for their summer getaway. A weaker pound could mean prices rising faster in the shops. It also seems unlikely that interest rates will be raised by the Bank of England anytime soon, which is good for borrowers but bad for savers. Those withinvestmentswill also be watching howshare pricesreact to the result. However, in their case, unless they plan to cash in now, the long-term actions of the government are far more relevant, as most people invest for the future. Experts say predicting what will happen is tough. ""While the pound may be the barometer of the election result, predicting where it will settle is a fool's errand and if the last year has taught us anything it is the wisdom of humility and prudence in your investment approach,"" says Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. ""So it will pay to keep an eye on your long-term financial goals and to place your investment eggs in a wide variety of baskets."" There is a technical consideration for the new government too. Owing to this being a snap election, the Finance Bill that followed the Budget had to be rushed through and some plans affecting personal finances were dropped. If a Conservative-led government is successfully formed, it may wish to reinstate them possibly in a future Budget. They include a plan to cut thetax-free dividend allowancefrom Â£5,000 to Â£2,000. That will affect those who own a small business and pay themselves in dividends alongside a small salary. It will also hit people with large portfolios of shares. It also includes a proposal to stop people cashing in their pension, then reinvesting it to get tax relief again. ThisMoney Purchase Annual Allowancewas supposed to fall from Â£10,000 to Â£4,000 but was postponed. Not everyone is happy, and one pensions company says the policy is in ""a weird sense of limbo"" owing to the delay. A more day-to-day consideration for many families with young children is thecost of childcare. From September, three and four-year-olds in England will be entitled to30 free hours of carea week in term time, but exactly how this will work and the effect on parents' finances will be ironed out in the coming months. The average person earns Â£26,329 a year, before tax. Out of that they pay about Â£2,964 in income tax, Â£2,180 in national insurance, Â£2,248 in VAT, a further Â£208 in alcohol duty, and Â£538 on fuel duty. That adds up to Â£8,138 a year in tax - almost a third of their salary. Some changes were always in the pipeline. For example, the Conservatives have said that by 2020, the amount you can earn before you start paying income tax - thepersonal allowance- will go up to Â£12,500 from the current level of Â£11,500. Such a move would have broad support across the parties. More questionable is a plan to raise the starting point for paying the higher, or 40%, rate of tax to Â£50,000 by 2020 from the current level of Â£45,000, saving higher-rate taxpayers about Â£200 a year. In Scotland the higher rate threshold has been frozen at Â£43,000, and it is for the Scottish government to decide what happens to that threshold. This video can not be played How much tax do we pay and what is the money spent on? Significant changes are more certain than others. Among those likely to continue is a rise in theNational Living Wage- the minimum level of pay for those aged 25 and over. The Low Pay Commission has been set a target of it reaching 60% of median earnings by 2020. Official forecasters believe that will be about Â£8.75 an hour. Labour wants this to go up further. Details of aban on cold callsoffering exotic investment opportunities to people cashing in their pension pots was expected when the election was called. This is likely to be resurrected soon. A starting date should also be given for a ban onlettings agent fees, cutting upfront costs for those looking to rent a home. Election: Latest news What is happening to the pound? Kamal Ahmed: So, farewell austerity? People facingserious debtsshould get a legal right to ""breathing space"", mirroring the Scottish system in which borrowers can apply to have six weeks free from further interest, charges or debt collection to get debt advice and set up a repayment plan. All the major parties were in favour of a system of this kind. Experts are suggesting a period of uncertainty in thehousing market. ""The election is likely to lead to more subdued activity, with some doubts about how policy will evolve,"" says Simon Rubinsohn, of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. However, he said that beyond the summer, the property market might still pick up. A weaker pound may lead to more foreign investment in London, which could push up prices in the capital. Housebuilders' shares have been hit since the election result came in. The future ofausterity measures, including a freeze on working-age benefits that was planned for the Conservatives for the next three years may be challenged. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of housing benefit, and child benefit. There is also a cap on local housing allowance, limits to certain elements of tax credits, and a 1% pay rise cap for public sector workers until 2020 - all of which have proved unpopular among a large swathe of the electorate. This video can not be played Reality Check: What is the triple lock on pensions? The future for pensioners - one of the major battlegrounds during the campaign - ironically may end up a little more settled. The ""triple lock"", in which thestate pensionis raised in line with the highest of average earnings, prices or 2.5%, may be unchanged. The Conservatives were alone in arguing for a ""double lock"" from 2020, by cutting the 2.5% element. Significantly, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which may support the Conservatives in Parliament, wants to retain the triple lock. ""The triple lock is undoubtedly here to stay until 2020 and possibly for longer now; the Conservatives were alone in campaigning for its abolition after 2020,"" says Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown. The Conservatives were also alone in proposing means testing forWinter Fuel Payment, currently worth up to Â£300 for pensioners. One huge decision, which should have determined whether millions of people will have towork for longer, is now likely to be kicked into the long grass. An analysis for the Department for Work and Pensions has suggested that workers under the age of 30 may not get a state pension until the age of 70. A second report,by John Cridland,external, proposes that those under the age of 45 may have to work a year longer, to 68. The government was obliged to respond by May, but delayed doing so owing to the election being called. Now there needs to be some response, but as there is no consensus between the parties a definitive policy is looking more unlikely. One of the most controversial subjects during the election campaign was the Conservative plan forsocial carein England. Again, this is a particularly toxic issue and it is difficult to see how a major new policy could be agreed upon. That will mean more uncertainty on how much individuals will be expected to fund their care and how. The Conservatives pledged to cap somedomestic energy prices, which the party said would save 17 million people an average of Â£100 a year. A rise in the share prices of the energy companies suggests the markets believe this is now a more distant prospect. Finally, and most significantly, the biggest effect on your pay, job security, job prospects, tax demands, and general prosperity will be theBrexitnegotiations. The deal made with the EU and then trade deals with other countries will determine the financial outlook for the country and for individuals for many years to come.

The girl who killed her mother and sister,"Kim Edwards murdered her mother and sister with the help of boyfriend Lucas Markham A judge has ruled that teenager Kim Edwards can be identified as having killed her mother and sister. But how did their relationship turn from love to loathing? As the details of the cold and brutal killings of Elizabeth Edwards and her daughter Katie were read out in court, the facts seemed at odds with the slight and seemingly timid teenager sitting in the dock. Nottingham Crown Court heard how she and her boyfriend Lucas Markham, both aged 14 at the time, had plotted for days to cut their victims' throats as they slept at the family home in Spalding, Lincolnshire. A grudge Kim held against her mother - and her bitter resentment of her mother's close relationship with her sister - was the motivation for the murders, prosecutor Peter Joyce QC said. But it was not until jurors heard the details of a series of interviews Kim gave to police and psychiatrists that the depth of her hatred was revealed. Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her daughter Katie, 13, were found dead at their home in Spalding ""I wanted to get revenge for the way she treated me,"" Kim told one psychiatrist. ""I did it because I did not like Mum at all and I did not want her to ruin or corrupt anyone else. ""I did not feel anything for my mother, she deserved it and I'm glad she's dead."" UK's 'youngest double murderers' named Teenagers jailed for life for killing mother and daughter Mother and daughter killed in ""cold, calculated and callous"" killing She also told detectives: ""Ever since I was young I never got on with my mum, she always favoured my sister."" In the three-person household of 5 Dawson Avenue she felt unwanted, unloved and cut adrift. Mrs Edwards and her daughter Katie were murdered in their beds Prosecutors said Kim showed ""utter contempt"" for her mother and her sister (pictured) The court heard the difficulties between Kim and her mother could be traced back to January 2008 when Mrs Edwards had struck Kim, aged six at the time, in a row over the television. Mrs Edwards referred herself to social services and Kim and Katie were placed in care for several months. Social services closed the file on the Edwards family later that same year but Mrs Edwards would later say she believed Kim never truly forgave her. The issues between Mrs Edwards and her eldest daughter resurfaced in 2013 and lurched from one problem to another over the next three years. In September 2013, Mrs Edwards told Kim's teachers her daughter was planning to run away, although by March 2014 she told them their relationship had improved. Eight months later Kim told support workers her mother had tried to strangle her, but this was denied by both Mrs Edwards and her sister. In January 2015 Mrs Edwards asked her GP for family therapy. Kim Edwards and her mother shared a Facebook conversation just 10 days before the killings At the start of 2015 Mrs Edwards arranged an emergency psychiatric appointment after discovering a suicide note left by Kim. Following an assessment, no evidence of mental illness was found, however. In August of the same year the child and adolescent mental health services in Lincolnshire reported Kim's relationship with her mother was much better but Kim was feeling left out of the family triangle. In May of that year, Kim had begun her relationship with Lucas. The pair ran away from home in October, before being discovered six days later sleeping rough in woods north of Spalding. Mrs Edwards disapproved of her daughter's relationship with Lucas, the court heard. In the weeks before her death, the churchgoing dinner lady had barred Lucas from her home, forcing the couple to meet in the garden, and had described the couple as ""a time-bomb waiting to go off"". Kim told psychiatrists that by this stage her life had become a ""like a living, walking hell"", and in March she tried to kill herself by taking an overdose of painkillers. The following month the fast deteriorating mother-daughter relationship blew up withmurderous consequences. A psychiatrist described the teenagers' relationship as ""toxic"" In court, psychiatrists Dr Philip Joseph and Dr Indranil Chakrabarti attempted to explain what led to the killings. Dr Joseph, for the prosecution, blamed the toxic ""Bonnie and Clyde"" relationship between Kim and Lucas. He said Kim had not been suffering from a recognised mental disorder but had been struggling to feel part of the family unit. ""In that triangle she felt very much left out,"" he said. ""She felt that her mother was very much more attached to her younger sister."" He said she had told him the family dynamic made her feel unhappy and she was ""jealous"" of her sister. She felt the only solution was to kill her mother. ""I was getting rid of the only problem I could see,"" Kim had told him. ""I thought it would have been better for my sister to die too. ""I was not killing my sister out of anger, and I miss her, but I was excited about killing my mother and I was looking forward to it."" Kim and Lucas had been in a relationship since May 2015 Dr Chakrabarti, for the defence, contended Kim had an adjustment disorder and longstanding attachment issues as a result of her strained relationship with her mother. He said the disorder had been brought on by a series of stressful events, including Lucas being expelled from school and her attempt to kill herself. He also pointed to a row between Kim and her mother on 9 April in which Mrs Edwards told Kim she would turn out like her father, who had left the family home when she was two years old. Following the argument, Kim had gone to Lucas's home and the couple barricaded themselves in his room overnight. When Kim returned home she found her mother had bagged up some of her possessions and given others to her sister. Kim had told Dr Chakrabarti her mother's actions had left her feeling like she ""did not belong to the family anymore"". The following day, the court was told, she and Lucas began plotting the killings. Kim Edwards said she was ""jealous"" of her sister Katie (left) and her relationship with their mother On the night of the murders, Kim let Lucas into the house through the bathroom window. He had brought a bag of knives with him. Lucas took one of the knives and crept in to Mrs Edwards room where he stabbed her through the throat - he stabbed her eight times while smothering her with a pillow to stop her screaming out. He then went in to Katie's room and stabbed her twice in the neck while she slept. Following the murders, Kim and Lucas had sex on a mattress in the living room, ate ice cream and settled down to watch the vampire-themed Twilight films. Over the next day-and-a-half they stayed at the house. They ignored visits from Lucas's aunt and police officers sent to the property to look for the two teenagers, who by now had been reported missing from school. It was not until police forced their way into the house through a downstairs window that the couple were discovered. PC Alistair Pullen, who was the first officer to enter the house, said that when he asked where Mrs Edwards was Lucas ""looked at me clean in the eye and said 'Why don't you go up and see?'"". Kim would later tell Dr Joseph: ""We felt laid back about what had happened - neither of us felt that bad about it."" Det Ch Insp Martin Holvey, who led the murder investigation, said: ""The actual after-effects are probably the most chilling, the fact of what happened in those 36 hours after and how they carried on as normal, watching TV, watching a film, going upstairs to use the toilet while people are lying upstairs dead; it beggars belief."" He said he believed the ""tragic and unprecedented"" killings had been a result of a combination of issues. ""I guess many people through life will say things, especially juveniles, that they don't mean - 'I hate you' or 'I'm going to kill you'. ""It's a throwaway comment for many, many people, but this wasn't, this carried on, and they carried on talking about it over the next few days."" The whole truth of what happened in the Edwards' family home will probably never be known. The jury rejected Kim's version of events and decided she did not have a psychological condition which would diminish her responsibility. It leaves only an inescapable, if unpalatable, conclusion - that this 14-year-old girl was so consumed by hatred for her mother, she decided to kill her and her sister as well.

How generous are China's super rich?,"When US billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett held a banquet in China a few years ago to urge fellow tycoons to donate their fortunes to charity, some of their intended targets didn't bother to turn up. The no-shows sparked a fierce debate on social media: are China's super rich really so stingy? By some measures, they are. Total charitable giving in China stands at just 4% of levels in the US or Europe, according to the United Nations Development Programme. Chinese charities have been hit by scandal, and there is widespread mistrust of the private wealth on which much of the giving depends. But according to a new report from Harvard University and the Swiss bank UBS, the picture is far more complex. ""Philanthropy in China today is in a state of expansion, experimentation and evolution,"" it said. Donations from the top 100 philanthropists in mainland China have more than tripled between 2010 and 2016 to $4.6bn (Â£3.6bn), according to the study. Wang Bing, China's 'most influential' philanthropist Of the 200 wealthiest people in China, 46 have foundations. And two-thirds of the people surveyed by the study's authors had established or were planning to establish foundations. Wang Bing, who has been called China's ""most influential"" philanthropist, says Chinese tycoons aren't stingy, they're just cautious. ""Everybody in my circle wants to give,"" he tells BBC News. ""There is a lot of money available that hasn't been donated."" ""These people are smart. That's why they're rich. So, they're not going to give their money to just anyone. They want to donate to charities that are effective at what they do."" Asked how many such organisations exist in China, he says ""very few"". Mr Wang, 47, made his fortune on the stock market in the 1990s. After disappointing experiences donating to government-affiliated agencies, he decided to start his own charity. In 2004, Mr Wang founded the Ai You Foundation, China's first registered private foundation, which started out helping sick and orphaned children. The country's top billionaires, including Jack Ma of Alibaba and Robin Li of Baidu, sit on the board of directors at Ai You. China's top 3 philanthropists (according to the 2016 Hurun Report): Pony Ma, founder of Tencent, gave $2.15bn to the Tencent Charity Foundation Chen Yidan, co-founder Tencent, gave $615m to Wuhan College He Qiaonu of Beijing Orient Landscape, gave $450m to various charities Experts say the challenges to philanthropic giving are numerous, including public scepticism, a lack of transparency and shortage of experienced talent. But Rupert Hoogewerf, who closely tracks the behaviour of China's super rich, agrees that charitable giving is changing quickly. ""It is evolving away from just giving to government institutions,"" he says, especially in the wake of a major scandal in 2011. That year, a young woman called Guo Meimei made headlines for her lavish lifestyle and claims of working for a company associated with the Chinese Red Cross. China's Red Cross saw donations drying up after the scandal Even though the charity denied any connection to her, donations dried up. Mao Jihong, a fashion designer who last year set up his own foundation, says he believes donors have largely moved on from the scandal. ""That was a great setback for philanthropy,"" says the designer, who is considered to be one of the favourites of the Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan. He believes last year's introduction of a new charity law helped to develop greater confidence among potential donors. What is clear, according to the Harvard report, is that there is genuine innovation happening in China's vibrant tech world. Technology giants Tencent, Alibaba and Sina all have desktop and mobile platforms designed to encourage mass giving by the general public, as well as larger-scale donations by the wealthy. Jack Ma is another one of China's super rich ""What they are doing there is really cutting edge,"" says Mr Hoogewerf of the Hurun Report. According to one estimate, more than 23 million people in China gave charitable gifts online in 2015. And since that year, Tencent has been hosting annual giving days on its platforms. Last September, a total of 300m Chinese yuan ($44m; Â£34m) in online donations were raised within three days. Tencent and its partners matched that amount, giving more than $77m to thousands of charities. Mr Wang of the Ai You Foundation says his goal is to make his foundation the ""Facebook of philanthropy"" - to create a platform to make it simple and straightforward for donors to give. China's growing group of philanthropists says they are aware of the immense challenges ahead but are determined to continue their work.

Six key lessons from a surprise result,"Rather than producing a ""strong and stable"" government, Theresa May's election gamble has created uncertainty. So, what can we learn? Areas where most people voted Remain swung very differently from those where most voted Leave. On the one hand, the Conservatives often secured a swing to themselves in constituencies where the Leave vote was highest. These were nearly all places where UKIP performed best in 2015 - and so were the areas where there were most UKIP votes for the Conservatives to snatch away. Leave seats with clear swings to the Conservatives includedBoston and Skegnesswhere there was a 6% swing to the Conservatives andBolsoverwhere there was as much as an 8% swing. But seats which voted Remain last year - and where there were relatively few UKIP voters in 2015 - saw Labour pull off some of its best performances. Just one example in London wasHampstead and Kilburn, where there was a 12% swing to Labour, whilein Hoveon the south coast, there was a remarkable 15% swing to the party. It seems to be the case that Mrs May's brand of Brexit may have helped to squeeze the UKIP vote, but that at the same time it put off some Remain voters. As a result of these patterns, while, at just under 44%, the Conservative Party secured its highest share of the vote since Mrs Thatcher's first election victory in 1979, it was not enough for an overall majority. This was because, at 41%, Labour's vote also rose to its highest level since Tony Blair's first victory in 1997. One consequence of this divergent pattern between Remain and Leave areas is that there has been a marked change in the social geography of the Conservative vote. Traditionally, the party holds most appeal for middle class voters. But Leave voters were disproportionately working class. Consequently, at this election the Conservative vote increased least in middle class seats, rising only two points in the constituencies with the highest proportion of middle class voters. In contrast, the party's vote rose by no fewer than nine points in seats with the highest proportion of working class voters. Brexit has therefore served to undermine one of the traditional features of the geography of voting in Britain. Labour has seemingly been highly successful in getting young voters and other former abstainers to turn out and vote - and for them - just as Jeremy Corbyn intended. Where young voters were more numerous, the swing to Labour was often especially high - places likeBristol West(16% to Labour),Cardiff CentralandCanterbury(both 9% to Labour). More generally, in England and Wales there was only a 2.5% swing to Labour in seats where fewer than 7% of the population is aged 18-24, but a swing of 5% in seats where at least one in 10 people is of that age. Meanwhile, turnout increased most in constituencies where Labour was strongest last time, and, at the same time, its vote increased most where the turnout went up by the highest amount. But although Labour will be delighted at having denied the Conservatives an overall majority, its own success should not be exaggerated. Its tally of 262 seats is only a handful higher than the total that the party won in 2010, when Gordon Brown's administration was ejected from office. Labour is still a long way away from winning a majority for itself. Although the SNP is still the largest party in Scotland, it lost more than a third of its Westminster seats - falling back to 35 seats overall. This will be a severe blow to the party's morale as it supposedly tries to embark on a second independence referendum. The party suffered the misfortune of finding that its vote fell most where the party was previously strongest, such as the 21 point drop from 60% in 2015 to 39% now inBannff and Buchan, enabling the Conservatives to win the seat. Key losses included its former leader Alex Salmond and its current deputy leader Angus Robertson. It was a mixed night for Tim Farron's party - gaining eight seats but losing four. The party has on average seen a small increase in its support in constituencies with the largest number of those with degrees, most notably in London. But otherwise it has typically fallen back. Tim Farron's party had a mixed night However there have been a number of notable personal performances such as gains inBath,EastbourneandTwickenham. The damage that the party suffered from its involvement in the coalition in the 2010-15 parliament has not begun to be repaired. This is a result that brought disappointment to all parties. The Conservatives lost their majority. Labour suffered its third defeat in a row. The Liberal Democrats found themselves treading water. The SNP's independence bandwagon came to a juddering halt. And UKIP imploded. It is not only Conservatives who will be asking why Mrs May changed her mind about holding a snap election. The only winners are perhaps the DUP - to whom she seems to have awarded the role of kingmakers. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

UK election: Six key lessons from a surprise result,"Rather than producing a ""strong and stable"" government, Theresa May's election gamble has created uncertainty. So, what can we learn? Areas where most people voted Remain swung very differently from those where most voted Leave. On the one hand, the Conservatives often secured a swing to themselves in constituencies where the Leave vote was highest. These were nearly all places where UKIP performed best in 2015 - and so were the areas where there were most UKIP votes for the Conservatives to snatch away. Leave seats with clear swings to the Conservatives includedBoston and Skegnesswhere there was a 6% swing to the Conservatives andBolsoverwhere there was as much as an 8% swing. But seats which voted Remain last year - and where there were relatively few UKIP voters in 2015 - saw Labour pull off some of its best performances. Just one example in London wasHampstead and Kilburn, where there was a 12% swing to Labour, whilein Hoveon the south coast, there was a remarkable 15% swing to the party. It seems to be the case that Mrs May's brand of Brexit may have helped to squeeze the UKIP vote, but that at the same time it put off some Remain voters. As a result of these patterns, while, at just under 44%, the Conservative Party secured its highest share of the vote since Mrs Thatcher's first election victory in 1979, it was not enough for an overall majority. This was because, at 41%, Labour's vote also rose to its highest level since Tony Blair's first victory in 1997. One consequence of this divergent pattern between Remain and Leave areas is that there has been a marked change in the social geography of the Conservative vote. Traditionally, the party holds most appeal for middle class voters. But Leave voters were disproportionately working class. Consequently, at this election the Conservative vote increased least in middle class seats, rising only two points in the constituencies with the highest proportion of middle class voters. In contrast, the party's vote rose by no fewer than nine points in seats with the highest proportion of working class voters. Brexit has therefore served to undermine one of the traditional features of the geography of voting in Britain. Labour has seemingly been highly successful in getting young voters and other former abstainers to turn out and vote - and for them - just as Jeremy Corbyn intended. Where young voters were more numerous, the swing to Labour was often especially high - places likeBristol West(16% to Labour),Cardiff CentralandCanterbury(both 9% to Labour). More generally, in England and Wales there was only a 2.5% swing to Labour in seats where fewer than 7% of the population is aged 18-24, but a swing of 5% in seats where at least one in 10 people is of that age. Meanwhile, turnout increased most in constituencies where Labour was strongest last time, and, at the same time, its vote increased most where the turnout went up by the highest amount. But although Labour will be delighted at having denied the Conservatives an overall majority, its own success should not be exaggerated. Its tally of 262 seats is only a handful higher than the total that the party won in 2010, when Gordon Brown's administration was ejected from office. Labour is still a long way away from winning a majority for itself. Although the SNP is still the largest party in Scotland, it lost more than a third of its Westminster seats - falling back to 35 seats overall. This will be a severe blow to the party's morale as it supposedly tries to embark on a second independence referendum. The party suffered the misfortune of finding that its vote fell most where the party was previously strongest, such as the 21 point drop from 60% in 2015 to 39% now inBannff and Buchan, enabling the Conservatives to win the seat. Key losses included its former leader Alex Salmond and its current deputy leader Angus Robertson. It was a mixed night for Tim Farron's party - gaining eight seats but losing four. The party has on average seen a small increase in its support in constituencies with the largest number of those with degrees, most notably in London. But otherwise it has typically fallen back. Tim Farron's party had a mixed night However there have been a number of notable personal performances such as gains inBath,EastbourneandTwickenham. The damage that the party suffered from its involvement in the coalition in the 2010-15 parliament has not begun to be repaired. This is a result that brought disappointment to all parties. The Conservatives lost their majority. Labour suffered its third defeat in a row. The Liberal Democrats found themselves treading water. The SNP's independence bandwagon came to a juddering halt. And UKIP imploded. It is not only Conservatives who will be asking why Mrs May changed her mind about holding a snap election. The only winners are perhaps the DUP - to whom she seems to have awarded the role of kingmakers. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

Trump: I would speak under oath on Comey,"This video can not be played President Trump willing to testify under oath US President Donald Trump says he is ""100%"" willing to speak under oath about his conversations with ex-FBI chief James Comey. Speaking at the White House, he denied having asked for Mr Comey's loyalty or for an inquiry into a former White House aide to be dropped. ""James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things he said just weren't true,"" Mr Trump said. Meanwhile, a congressional panel asked for any tapes of their conversations. This video can not be played How Republicans are dealing with Comey Mr Comey says Mr Trump fired him because of his Russia inquiry. The former FBI chief was investigating an alleged Kremlin plot to sway last year's US election in favour of Mr Trump, and whether there was any collusion with the president or his campaign staff. On Thursday, Mr Comey testified to one of several congressional committees that is also looking into the Russia claims. He said the president had pressured him to drop a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whom Mr Trump fired for misleading the White House over contacts with Moscow's ambassador. Who do you believe? Five takeaways from Comey's testimony Under oath, the former FBI director also told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had asked him during a one-to-one dinner at the White House to pledge loyalty. Nearly 20 million US television viewers tuned in to the explosive testimony. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments At a press conference on Friday afternoon in the Rose Garden with the visiting president of Romania, Mr Trump rejected Mr Comey's claims. He said the former FBI director's testimony showed there was ""no collusion, no obstruction"". Mr Comey told senators he had assured the president he himself was not under scrutiny over Russia. The US president was asked by a journalist if he would be willing to give his version of events under oath. ""One hundred per cent,"" Mr Trump said. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words ""I hardly know the man [Mr Comey],"" he said. ""I'm not going to say, 'I want you to pledge allegiance.' ""Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. This video can not be played Trump will talk about Comey hearing in the ""near future"" ""I hardly know the man. It doesn't make sense."" When asked about whether he had recordings of his conversations with Mr Comey, which he has previously hinted, the president said he would address it at a later date. ""I'll tell you something about that maybe sometime in the very near future,"" he said on Friday. ""I'll tell you about it over a short period of time. I'm not hinting at anything."" Shortly after the press conference, leaders of the House Intelligence Committee said they had asked the White House whether there were any such tapes. The House panel requested that if the recordings exist they be submitted by 23 June. The Senate Judiciary Committee asked the White House last month about such audio. This video can not be played Who is behind the projections on the Trump Hotel? Days after he fired Mr Comey on 9 May, Mr Trump tweeted: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" Mr Trump tweeted earlier on Friday he felt ""complete vindication"" after the hearing. Mr Comey also told senators that he had leaked details of his memos about his conversations with Mr Trump to a friend, who passed them on to a reporter.

Can a Conservative and DUP pact work?,"Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, with Prime Minister Theresa May Can a Conservative and DUP pact possibly govern for the life of this Parliament? They face a long, precarious high wire act if they attempt to do so, and they - and any alternative alliance - will be beset by troubles and entanglements at every turn. Armed with a combined majority of three MPs, their pact would also be bolstered by the absence of the seven Sinn Fein MPs who continue to refuse to take their seats, and probably by the support of the independent unionist, Lady Sylvia Hermon. But those numbers assume all MPs toe the party line in every vote. And that looks unlikely. Imagine you are Tory MPs Zac Goldsmith - with a majority of 45 votes - or Theresa Villiers - who has a majority of 353 - or one of the legion of other Conservatives who have just scraped in - often having seen apparently comfortable majorities dissolve. Suppose you are asked to support a measure which could have constituency consequences, like a squeeze on school funding, or a hospital downgrade. It's easy for the opposition parties, they can oppose. However, you face a choice between braving the wrath of the government whips, or providing your local opponents with a new stick with which to beat you. Nobody knows what those particular individuals would do, when confronted by such a choice, but it is a fair bet that some Conservative MPs might be prepared to defy the whip - and it would only take a handful, fewer even than in the last Parliament. The same problem applies to infrastructure mega-projects - can a government with such a small majority deliver the next phases of HS2 or Heathrow expansion? Then we come to Brexit. This election was supposed to be about strengthening the prime minister against inimical anti-Brexit forces in Parliament. Yet she emerges far weaker. I question whether the new government can cobble together a majority for any version of Brexit - hard, soft, poached, scrambled, or devilled with Tabasco sauce - without losing the support of some Conservative MPs, and potentially losing a Commons vote. The DUP factor matters here. Remember the DUP are a Northern Ireland party, with deep concerns about maintaining a ""frictionless"" border with the Republic of Ireland, which could complicate the ultimate deal, possibly dragging the government into a deal which could arouse the ire of Conservative Brexiteers, if it did not ditch the European Court of Justice, or if it involved unacceptable payments to the EU in return for market access. The other aggravating factor about the DUP is its coldly transactional approach. Of course they have a policy agenda - but they also want what the Americans call ""pork"". Extra funding for all things Northern Ireland, more powers for the NI Executive - if it can be reconstituted - localised tax concessions, you name it. And some of these things would have to come at the expense of English constituencies. It is worth remembering that the last time a UK government was sustained by Northern Irish votes, it didn't end well. James Callaghan's minority Labour government of the mid 1970s survived, hand to mouth, for years until Callaghan could no longer stomach the endless deal-making. He might have survived the famous 1979 Commons no confidence debate, if he'd been prepared to fund a gas pipeline to Northern Ireland, but he'd had enough. People walking past Big Ben Half way through the election campaign I was hearing that the government's chief whip, Gavin Williamson, had embarked on a tour to meet and mark the cards of the candidates who were expected to win in the predicted Tory landslide. Most will not be arriving, and if he stays in post, his job will be the kind of extreme whipping last seen when Callaghan's legendary parliamentary ringmaster, Walter Harrison (the hero of James Graham's great play This House) ducked, dived, manoeuvred, cajoled and arm-twisted to keep the minority Labour government in power. On one level it was one of the most brilliant whipping performances in Parliamentary history; on another the spectacle of endless wheeler-dealing may have worsened Labour's ultimate electoral crash, when the government finally fell. Now, Mr Williamson, or his successor, will have to hold the Tory factions together, possibly through a divisive leadership battle. He will have to soothe ideological and Brexit divisions, and smooth the ruffled feathers of ministers who were said to be facing removal from the cabinet - as well as ex-ministers dropped when the prime minister took over. An early test will be the appointments to her new government. Will unifying figures like the 1922 Committee Chairman Graham Brady be brought into the fold? Will dangerous luminaries of the David Cameron years - such as former chief whip Mark Harper - return to government. There are, at least, vacancies to fill. If the government can dance with sufficient agility, it might be able to survive for a fair while. But there is a difference between survival and governing. The Brexit clock is ticking, the economy needs attention, and the world is a dangerous place. Decisions are unavoidable, but getting them through the Commons may prove impossible. And at some point another election may become unavoidable, too.

Sturgeon: Indyref2 'factor' in SNP losses,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP 'will listen to voters' SNP plans for a second independence referendum were ""undoubtedly"" a factor in the general election result, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. The SNP remains thelargest party in Scotland with 35 seats- but lost 21 of the 56 constituencies it won in 2015. Ms Sturgeon said she would ""reflect carefully"" on the result. However, Ruth Davidson - whose Scottish Conservatives went from one seat to 13 -  said Ms Sturgeon should now take a second referendum ""off the table"". Her call was echoed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who both took seats from the SNP and who also campaigned heavily against another referendum. Across the UK theTories have 318 seats, leaving them eight seats short of a majority. Brian Taylor's thoughts on the election What does the result mean for Scotland? May will seek to form government Election 2017: Scottish results The election result in maps Theresa May has said she willform a government with the support of the Democratic Unionists. Please enable Javascript to view our results map Giving her reaction to the result, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Undoubtedly the issue of an independence referendum was a factor in this election result, but I think there were other factors in this election result as well."" Ms Sturgeon said Brexit, a late surge in support for UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and tactical voting were some of the other factors which had contributed to the outcome. ""I strongly suspect there were independence supporters amongst those who voted for Jeremy Corbyn yesterday,"" she said, stressing that ""rushing to overly-simplistic judgments"" about the election was ""not the right thing to do"". Her comments follow those of her deputy, John Swinney, who said the prospect of another vote on Scottish independence was a ""significant motivator"" in the election result and that the party had be ""attentive to that point"". Yes, the SNP won the election in Scotland. Arithmetic and every Nationalist will tell us so. But they lost votes, they lost 21 seats and they markedly lost momentum. Aides say Ms Sturgeon is genuinely considering options, authentically rethinking - while urging others in Scotland to do the same. In the immediate term, she is demanding a role in Brexit negotiations which she says must now be rescheduled and repeating her offer to oust Mrs May, if the parliamentary votes can be found. Those issues are the prime focus. But what about indyref2? She will certainly not abandon the aim of independence - nor the calculation that it would be brought about via a referendum. I also think it unlikely that she will formally renounce the proposed timetable for indyref2 - which is at the end of the Brexit process. Perhaps, rather, she might seek to clarify the detail of that timetable. In practice, though, indyref2 is hobbled. It may not be ""dead"", as Ruth Davidson declared. But it is certainly ailing. Read more from Brian Ms Sturgeon admitted that her party had suffered ""bitterly disappointing"" losses, but accused the Conservatives of ""causing chaos on an industrial scale"". She said: ""They are planning to cobble together an unstable administration causing yet more damaging uncertainty, all of this because they have consistently put the interests of the Tory party ahead of the interests of the country."" Ms Sturgeon added that ""the reckless Tory pursuit of a hard Brexit must be abandoned"" and she appealed to MPs from all parties to join together to keep the UK and Scotland within the European single market. The first minister also congratulated those who had been elected MPs and paid tribute to those that had lost their seats - includingformer first minister Alex SalmondandSNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson. She described Mr Robertson as a politician and parliamentarian of ""immense stature"" who had held Theresa May to account. Mr Robertson lost his seat to Conservative Douglas Ross after holding Moray since 2001. She described former leader Alex Salmond as ""my friend and mentor for almost 30 years and without a shadow of a doubt the giant of modern Scottish politics"". The Conservatives' tally of 13 MPs gave the party its best result in Scotland since 1983. Scottish party leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP candidates that had failed in their bid for re-election had done so because of a ""massive political miscalculation"" by Ms Sturgeon. She said the campaign had been dominated by one issue - Ms Sturgeon's decision in March to move for another independence referendum. Ms Davidson said: ""This morning, we have heard SNP figures acknowledge that the referendum demands were behind its bad result. We have heard the first minister say she will 'reflect' on the matter. I'm afraid that's not enough."" Ms Davidson said that while the SNP's share of the vote had fallen by 13%, her party's had risen by the same amount. This video can not be played Davidson says Scotland 'needs a break' from indyref2 plans She added: ""Simply put, Scotland has had its fill. We need to focus on the challenges we face on education, on NHS funding, on the new tax and welfare powers - as well as the huge challenge of Brexit. ""Nobody will condemn the first minister if she now decides to re-set her course. This is her opportunity to do so - and I urge her to take it immediately. She must take it off the table."" Despite her party's success in Scotland, Ms Davidson acknowledged that the UK result had ""fallen short"" of Conservative expectations. She said it was now incumbent on her party to listen to others in parliament as well as the people outside it. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale called the Scottish result the ""final nail in the coffin"" of plans for a second independence referendum. Her party saw their numbers rise from one MP to seven. Ms Dugdale said: ""This was a stunning general election result that proves Scottish Labour is back. Kezia Dugdale with Labour's new MPs in Rutherglen ""Just two years after we were nearly wiped out in Scotland, we have staged a remarkable recovery and overturned some gigantic SNP majorities, and pushed the Nationalists incredibly close in many seats. ""I am incredibly proud of the campaign we ran in Scotland, which focused on our belief that together we're stronger with Scotland as part of the UK, coupled with Jeremy Corbyn's positive vision of a country for the many, not the few."" Ms Dugdale said the prime minister's decision to call a snap poll seven weeks ago had backfired. ""Theresa May has gambled and lost spectacularly and she should now resign as prime minister - and Ruth Davidson should tell her that,"" said Ms Dugdale. ""As for the SNP, this was a catastrophic result and is the final nail in the coffin for Nicola Sturgeon's plans for a divisive second independence referendum."" The result proved to be bitter sweet for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who increased their tally on the 2015 result to four. However, the party lost out to the SNP's Stephen Gethins in Fife North East by the narrowest of margins. TheNationalists held the seat by two votes following a third re-count. The Lib Dems are understood to be considering taking the issue to court. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said that the overall Scottish result had been a rejection of another independence referendum. He said: ""The central issue of the election in Scotland was another independence referendum. ""The Scottish people have rejected that proposal. Nicola Sturgeon must respond immediately to this major event. ""That's why they should hold an early vote in the Scottish Parliament to delay and stop any independence referendum in this parliamentary term.""

Twenty things you may have missed from election night,"It's difficult to catch everything during an election night whirlwind of facts, stats and spin. Beyond the immediate headlines, here are 20 things you may have missed. This video can not be played The moment Nick Clegg lost his seat The SNP has suffered some of the night's biggest losses. Former leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland's first minister between 2007 and 2014, lost hisGordon seatto the Scottish Conservatives. The SNP leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, also lost hisMoray seatto the Tories. Former Lib Dem Leader and deputy PM Nick Clegg also suffered a fall from grace. He looked visibly upset when he lost hisSheffield Hallam seat- which he had held for 12 years - to Labour. But his departure didn't seem to shock everyone. ""Who is Nick Clegg?"" was one of the top trending questions on Google overnight. Turnout is the highest since 1997. It's up by 2% to 69%. It looks like Labour has been successful in persuading young voters to turn out and vote for the party. There has been a greater swing to Labour in seats with a higher population of 18 to 24-year-olds, according to professor of politics John Curtice. Turnout has also increased more in seats with young people - and Labour's vote seems to have advanced most in constituencies where the turnout increased most. A record number of female MPs have been elected. There will be208 women in this Parliament,outnumbering the 196 women elected in 2015. About 30% of candidates were women this year - up from the previous record of 26% in 2015. However  the actual number of women standing was down from 1,036 to 983. Record number of female MPs Mrs May may have had a terrible night, but the Scottish Conservative leader has arguably achieved one of the biggest success stories of recent UK political history. The  Scottish Tories were wiped out by the Tony Blair landslide in 1997 and narrowly escaped oblivion again in 2015 when the SNP swept to power in 56 of Scotland's 59 constituencies. The party's single MP hung on by only a few hundred votes. Now they're back. The Conservatives won 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in Scotland since 1983. The SNP are currently on 34 seats. Election results live updates Full UK results breakdown,external A tale of two Tory parties Sunderlandhas historically been the first place to count and declare its results. But this year it lost out to Newcastle in the battle to be first, trumping its neighbour. Newcastle Centralwas declared first at 23:01 BST, followed by Houghton and Sunderland South nine minutes later. Sunderland has been the fastest to declare for the past six elections. New Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill retained the party'sseat of Birmingham Edgbaston, becoming the UK's first female Sikh MP. The 44-year-old, who got a majority of 6,917, said her passion for politics was inspired by her late father and his close friend Lord King, who became the first Sikh peer in the UK. The seat of Birmingham Edgbaston has been continuously represented by women from both main parties since 1953. Preet Gill elected as first female Sikh MP Labour has done well in seats that voted to Remain in the EU. The Tories have seen an uptick in seats that voted strongly to Leave, but far less than Labour's gain. The swing to Labour in seats where Remain won over 55% in 2016 is averaging seven points, whereas there is a 1% swing to the Conservatives in seats where over 60% voted for Leave, according to Mr Curtice. The Labour leader might have had a belter of a night, but he needs to work on his high-fives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry appeared to get a slap across the chest when he overreached. Mrs May had an unusual opponent in herconstituency of MaidenheadLord Buckethead, who won 249 votes. It's not the first time he's tried to be an MP.  In 1987, Lord Buckethead stood against Margaret Thatcher in Finchley, winning 131 votes. And in 1992, he stood against then prime minister John Major. Lord Buckethead wasn't the only odd person the PM shared a stage with. Bobby ""Elmo"" Smith, pictured above, got three votes. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron also had an unusual opponent in hisWestmorland and Lonsdaleconstituency, Mr Fishfinger. Mr Fishfinger raised enough money to cover his Â£500 deposit through a crowdfunding page. He managed to win 309 votes. The battle forRichmond Park- between the Conservative's Zac Goldsmith and Lib Dem's Sarah Olney - came down to 45 votes after two recounts, with the  Conservatives winning with a majority of 45. But there was an even closer race in Scotland. The SNP held onto theFife North Eastseat by just two votes - 0.005% of the vote - following three recounts. Mr Farage resigned as UKIP party leader last July, but said he would have ""no choice"" but to return to frontline politics if Brexit was under threat. It wouldn't be the first time the former UKIP leader has done a U-turn. He resigned after failing to win a seat in 2015, but later decided he ""owed it to the party to stay"" on as leader. Arlene Foster's DUP made big gains, winning 10 seats The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) built its 2015 general election campaign around the idea that its MPs might be kingmakers at Westminster. But that's the position the 10 newly returned DUP MPs are now in given the hung parliament. Senior DUP figures have made clear their antipathy towards Jeremy Corbyn because of his historic links with Sinn FÃ©in but Theresa May - or whoever succeeds her - could be a plausible partner, as both parties are pro-Brexit and right of centre on many issues. It's too early to say whether they might consider a formal  coalition or a more informal ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, according to sources. The DUP website crashed on Friday morning after a surge of interest. DUP was also one of the most searched terms on Google. Could DUP be Westminster kingmakers? Mr Curtice's polling wisdom has attracted a bit of a cult following for years, but his social media fame reached a peak on election night. A Twitterpage,externalcalled, ""Is John Curtice on TV"", designed to monitor and celebrate Curtice's TV appearances, was started in April and has more than 8,000 followers. The cult of Curtice British politics has returned to a two-party system on the greatest scale since the 1970s. In 2015, UKIP achieved 12.6% of the popular vote, while the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats it contested. This year the vote share was Conservative 42%, Labour 40%, Lib Dem 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. The SNP remain the largest party in Scotland but the Conservatives have won 12 seats off them so far, Labour has won seven and the Lib Dems three. The count in the extremely wealthy central London constituency ofKensingtonwas suspended following a request for a third recount, because staff were too tired. The seat, which has been strongly Tory since its inception, finally went to Labour for the first time in its history.

UK election result: How the world reacted,"British PM Theresa May is now facing calls to resign The result of the UK election, with the ruling Conservatives unexpectedly losing their overall majority, has sent shockwaves across Europe and beyond. Politicians across the Continent have been questioning the impact on the Brexit talks. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, said he wanted discussions to proceed without delay. ""As far as the Commission is concerned we can open negotiations tomorrow morning at half past nine,"" he said. ""First we have to agree on the divorce and exit modalities, and then we have to envisage the architecture of our future relations. I do hope that the result of the elections will have no major impact on the negotiations we are desperately waiting for."" Sweden's former Prime MinisterCarl Bildt, who now chairs the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, called the outcome ""messy"". ""One mess risks following another. Price to be paid for lack of true leadership,"" hetweeted,external. Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt, who is president of the Alliance of Liberals & Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, had caustic words for Mrs May. ""Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated,"" hetweeted,external. A simple guide to the UK election result Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance European media see bleak future for May Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit, had a more conciliatory message. ""#Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready; timetable and EU positions are clear. Let's put our minds together on striking a deal,"" hesaid,external. European Council PresidentDonald Tuskalluded to the March 2019 deadline for Brexit talks. ""We don't know when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations',"" hewrote,external. Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier say they want to get on with Brexit negotiations The EU's foreign policy chief,Federica Mogherini, said it was uncertain when Britain would have a clear Brexit strategy. ""One year after their referendum, we still don't know the British position in the negotiations on Brexit and it seems difficult to predict when we will, because democracy often requires time,"" she observed. A spokeswoman for German ChancellorAngela Merkelsaid her government would not comment on the election result out of ""politeness and respect"" while the process of forming a new government was ongoing. Can Theresa May stay as PM? What happens when no-one wins the election? Election 2017: The result in maps Meanwhile Irish Prime Minister-electLeo Varadkarwas positive about the outcome. ""The results of the UK election indicate to me that there is no strong mandate to proceed with a hard Brexit, which represents an opportunity for Ireland,"" he said. He also described the result as an opportunity to re-engage in talks to restore Northern Ireland's devolved power-sharing administration, which collapsed in January. Mrs May is expected to form a government with the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists. European newspapershave been focusing on the uncertainty about Mrs May's future and the anger among Britain's voters. In the first official comment by the White House, President Trump said the result was ""surprising"", but offered no further insight. TheWashington Postnewspaper noted the unpredictable nature of recent British politics. ""The results mark the second time in as many years that the British body politic has defied predictions, scrambled the country's direction and bucked the will of a prime minister who had gambled by calling a vote when none had been required,"" it said. ""But unlike last year's EU referendum - which delivered a clear if close verdict to get out of the bloc - the will of the voters who cast ballots Thursday was not nearly as easy to decipher.""

In Hong Kong, independent outlets said the Tories had made a ""grave miscalculation"". Shi Zhiqin, a professor from Tsinghua University in Beijing, said China might no longer see the need to keep Britain as a strong ally in the EU. ""But I think Britain's main concern is to keep China as a trade partner after it lost the EU market,"" he told theSouth China Morning Post. In Russia, state-owned news agencyRIA Novostiis claiming the Conservatives will not forgive Theresa May for the result, and predicts a new prime minister. What the election result means for Brexit Why did Theresa May call an election? A record number of female MPs Brexit delays over UK hung parliament? On the morning of 9 June, state-run rolling news channelRossiya 24called it ""Theresa May's devastating defeat."" A correspondent for Qatar-fundedAl Jazeera TV, which ran a special segment on the polls, said the opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn had led a ""fierce campaign that the Conservative Party did not expect"". The results were covered prominently on some Lebanese newspaper websites, with the front page of left-wingAl Akhbarnewspaper reading: ""Britain: Corbyn brings down the hopes of the Conservatives."" InIndia, newspapers are taking an interest in Preet Gill, who has becomethe UK's first Sikh woman MP, and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the first turban-wearing Sikh winner. Indian headlines also concluded that the result was a setback for Theresa May, with theHindustan Timescalling it a ""stunning blow"" for the prime minister. Labour boosted its number of seats by 29 overnight, exciting Corbyn supporters abroad. US SenatorBernie Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate, told the Washington Post he was thrilled. ""I am delighted to see Labour do so well. All over the world people are rising up against austerity and massive levels of income and wealth inequality. ""People in the UK, the US and elsewhere want governments that represent all the people, not just the 1%. I congratulate Jeremy Corbyn for running a very positive and effective campaign."" Bill Shorten, leader of the Australian Labor Party, made similar observations, telling reporters: ""One of the things which my counterpart, the Labour leader in the United Kingdom, did is he campaigned and his slogan was 'For the many, not the few.' ""I think Mr Turnbull [Australia's prime minister] would be well advised to look at the popularity of that message.""

The Conservatives lost six seats in the capital, losingBattersea,Croydon Central,Enfield SouthgateandKensingtonto Labour, who saw its majorities increase in a number of constituencies. The Liberal Democrats also made gains in London as former government ministers Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey both won back the seats they had lost in 2015 to the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats lost both of the seats they previously held in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. The most high-profile scalp came inSheffield Hallam, where the party's former leader and former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg lost the seat he had held since 2005 to Labour. The Conservatives suffered losses in the South East, losing six seats in the region, four to Labour and two to the Liberal Democrats.

The gamble that settled nothing,"The prospect of a hung parliament appears to have taken most people by surprise. But what does it mean for how the UK will be governed? Perhaps everyone should have known. The age of political convulsion hasn't yet passed. Indeed, this election result isn't just a surprise that will be accommodated with some kind of changing of the guard, after which everything settles down. Instead, it is a prelude to a time of uncertainty that's bound to last. A contest that Prime Minister Theresa May called to give her a clear mandate to negotiate Britain's departure from the European Union - and in truth to give her room for the compromises she knows will be necessary - has delivered the opposite. A minority government condemned to live day to day, fearful of the next big parliamentary vote. Theresa May: ""Still in office but with so much power gone"" Theresa May didn't only place herself at the head of the Conservative campaign - she personalised it to a remarkable degree, pulling it round herself like a warrior's suit of armour. Give me ""my"" majority, she seemed to say. The voters declined. And by the end of the night she was contemplating the most pyrrhic of victories. Still in office, but with so much power gone. No British election for more than a generation has set such a puzzle. Negotiations for departure from the European Union were supposed to start in less than two weeks. But a government without a working majority in Parliament is ill-equipped. And remember that there is a substantial group of Conservatives who never wanted Brexit in the first place, and may - paradoxically - be rather emboldened by their party's failure to win outright. All this and Jeremy Corbyn too. Like a British version of Senator Bernie Sanders, he was mocked in his own Labour party - the outsider who was said not to be serious about government, but who enthused a young army that, for once, turned out to vote. He's got many fewer seats than the Conservatives, but with other smaller opposition parties ready to co-operate, his parliamentary power is formidable. That means that this weekend Theresa May is a hugely diminished figure. One former head of the civil service, Andrew Turnbull, even went public as the results were coming in to say that she should resign. Why? Back came the answer - she's not up to the job. Election results live updates Election night at-a-glance Tories set to be largest party - exit poll Full UK results breakdown,external Among Conservatives, shaken by their failure to confront effectively the most left-wing Labour campaign in living memory, there's a shiver of fear - might they be heading for another divisive leadership election? Some of them will be reflecting on the trouble you get from referendums in which everything is reduced to an all too simple question of ""yes"" or ""no"". The vote to leave the European Union last year split the country nearly down the middle. It removed one prime minister - David Cameron - from office, prompted Mrs May to have this election and has now saddled her, and the country, with a government doomed to endure a hand-to-mouth existence. It was that wise old Frenchman, Francois Mitterrand, who once said that the trouble with referendums was that too many people voted on a question that hadn't been asked. It was supposed to settle everything and has settled nothing. Britain embarks on a negotiation with 27 European countries without a settled view on the outcome it wants and with a government mired in uncertainty. Indeed, the happiest people around, as dawn broke on this remarkable, unexpected election result, were those who want it all to be a muddle - to slow the whole thing down. Perhaps to prepare the ground for another referendum on the terms or - strange though it seems to say it so soon - another election. Everything's in flux. The only flicker of light in the gloom for Theresa May is that the Conservatives' performance in Scotland - where the Nationalists lost 21 of their 56 seats - certainly put to bed another referendum on Scottish independence. But it's a meagre piece of compensation. Those of us who watched the Brexit vote, Donald Trump's victory soon afterwards, and saw 11 million people vote for the far-right in France, maybe thought we'd seen it all. But there was more to come. A prime minister who asked for trust was denied it. The opposition cry as the votes rolled in was - she's been found out. Cruel, but maybe true. Though it was presented as an election to produce ""strength and stability"" the voters sensed it was too personal: ""Give me my majority"". So they decided to say ""No"". Anyone who thinks the age of awkwardness is over, is wrong.

Charlie Gard treatment 'must continue',"Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry Terminally-ill baby Charlie Gard must continue to receive life-support treatment until Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights has said. His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, have launched a final legal challenge at the European court after their Supreme Court challenge failed. They want the 10-month old to undergo a trial in the US, but London specialists believe he has no chance of survival. The European court wants until Tuesday to consider the case. Judges in Strasbourg, France, ruled that Charlie should receive treatment while they look at paperwork in the case. The court said this type of interim measure was exceptional, when the applicants would face a ""real risk of irreversible harm"". A spokeswoman said Charlie's parents wanted a panel of seven judges to look at the case in detail. No decisions about whether or not the case would be analysed at a hearing had yet been made, she said. Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October last year. He has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the genetic building blocks that give energy to cells. Doctors say he cannot hear, move, cry or swallow and that his lungs only go up and down because he is on a machine that does it for him. Specialists believe the US trial is experimental and will not improve his quality of life, and therefore he should be allowed to die with dignity. Charlie's parents have exhausted all legal options in the UK. On Tuesday, the High Court ruled that life-sustaining treatment could be withdrawn, and on Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected the parents' appeal against that decision. The Supreme Court said parents were not entitled to insist on treatment which was not in their child's best interests. Charlie is thought to be just one of 16 children in the world to suffer from mitochondrial depletion syndrome. His parents have managed to raise Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for the US treatment and to get him to the country safely, as a specialist plane and nurses are needed. The American doctor who has agreed to treat Charlie has previously told the High Court the six-month therapy would be ""treatment but not a cure"".

Election result: New dawn for Labour?,"This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: ""I'm very, very proud of the campaign my party has run"" A new dawn has broken, has it not? Well almost - Labour has gained its most votes since Tony Blair uttered that phrase the morning after the 1997 election. But there is one crucial difference. Labour won by a landslide then. This time they have merely stopped Theresa May from winning outright. Jeremy Corbyn has admitted he didn't expect to win Labour's leadership election.  The first one, anyway. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance What happens if no-one wins the election? Full UK results breakdown,external Many of his supporters felt he could cause a similar political upset by engaging and energising young people to vote. But, frankly, amongst the party's backroom strategists - and indeed many of its MPs - the result is a surprise. What was expected were some Labour gains but a net loss of seats - perhaps retaining around 200. What was also anticipated is that the share of the Labour vote - largely in safe seats - would go up. So today it was assumed anti-Corbyn forces would be arguing that the party had indeed been defeated as it wasn't good enough just to defy expectations. This would clear the ground for a later assault on his leadership. Now, with Labour picking up more seats as well as more votes than in 2015, two putative leadership challenges are on hold. It's worth scratching beneath the surface to assess why Labour has achieved a hung parliament when local election results and private polling (more in line with ICM, showing a clear Conservative lead, than Survation, which suggested a narrow gap) suggested otherwise. First, it appears there has been a higher turnout by younger voters - perhaps attracted by messages such as scrapping tuition fees in England. Second, Jeremy Corbyn played to his strengths and appeared authentic. But third - let's not lose sight of the campaigns fought by Labour MPs on the ground. Some, such as Peter Kyle, Paul Farrelly, Ben Bradshaw and Ian Austin, were explicit. They told voters they didn't back Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, airbrushed him from leaflets and said little about the party manifesto. Labour's joy as party reclaims key seats Corbyn: Theresa May should go Labour defeats Nick Clegg John Woodcock, who held Barrow and Furness, where nuclear submarines are built, went further and said he wouldn't make Corbyn PM. Many others, though, avoided direct criticism of the party leader but their message was essentially the same: ""Don't give Theresa May a landslide. Rein her in."" It was not a confident message of a brave new dawn. But it looks like it was effective. The question is now whether Labour's fractious parliamentary party can unite behind its leader to put what would appear to be a minority Conservative government on the ropes - or whether the battle for Labour's future is just in a state of armed truce.

May to forge government with DUP backing,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she'll ""reflect on what we need to do to take the party forward"" Theresa May has said she will put together a government with the support of the Democratic Unionists to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. Speaking after visiting Buckingham Palace, she said only her party had the ""legitimacy"" to govern, despite falling eight seats short of a majority. Later, she said she ""obviously wanted a different result"" and felt ""sorry"" for colleagues who lost their seats. But Labour said they were the ""real winners"". The Lib Dems said Mrs May should be ""ashamed"" of carrying on. The Tories needed 326 seats to win another majority but they fell short and must rely on the DUP to continue to rule. What happens when no-one wins the election? Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? How the Tory campaign went wrong In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP ""friends"" to ""get to work"" on Brexit. Referring to the ""strong relationship"" she had with the DUP but giving little detail of how their arrangement might work, she said she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"". ""Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years,"" she said. ""And this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom."" It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it ""lend"" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as ""confidence and supply"". The PM earlier visited Buckingham Palace Later, she told reporters that she had ""wanted to achieve a larger majority but that was not the result"". ""I'm sorry for all those candidates... who weren't successful, and also particularly sorry for MPs and ministers who'd contributed so much to our country, and who lost their seats and didn't deserve to lose their seats. ""As I reflect on the results, I will reflect on what I need to do in the future to take the party forward."" This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed that she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to ""explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge"". While always striving for the ""best deal"" for Northern Ireland and its people, she said her party would always have the best interests of the UK at heart. Scottish Conservative leaderRuth Davidson has since sought assurancesfrom Mrs May that any deal with the DUP will not affect LGBTI rights across the UK. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal. A source close to Ms Davidson, who is gay, told the BBC: ""The PM needs to remember there are more Scottish Conservatives than DUP MPs."" Who are the DUP? The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. One MP is a devout climate change denier, while a former MP once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. During the election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly was endorsed by the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. Read more about theDUP hereand meet theirMPs here. Who's in the Cabinet? In an ongoing Cabinet reshuffle, five cabinet ministers are certain to stay: Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon; Brexit Secretary David Davis; Home Secretary Amber Rudd; Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Hammond said, in a tweet, that he was ""pleased to be reappointed so we can now get on and negotiate a Brexit deal that supports British jobs, business and prosperity"". Mr Johnson tweeted that he was ""delighted"", adding ""lots of great work to do for greatest country on earth"". However, those rarely seen on the campaign trail, including Andrea Leadsom, Priti Patel and Liam Fox, could be out, says BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. Comebacks from Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove and prominent leave campaigner Dominic Raab were being floated, she adds. Where does this leave Labour? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has denounced Mrs May's plan to head up a minority government, calling for her to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He said Labour was ready to form a minority government of its own, after far exceeding expectations by picking up 30 seats in England, Wales and Scotland. But even if it joined together in a so-called progressive alliance with the SNP, Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru, it would only reach 314 seats - short of the 326 figure needed. ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said, while stressing he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson said the ""surprise"" result was a political ""earthquake"",  and he'd been ""wrong"" to criticise Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. There are three posts that Mr Corbyn now needs to fill in the shadow cabinet, but sources say an announcement is not likely until Sunday at the earliest. Streatham MP Chuka Umunna, a leading figure on the right of the party, has said he would accept a role in the shadow cabinet. The Jeremy Corbyn factor What about Scotland? This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP 'will listen to voters' The SNP remains the largest party in Scotland but lost 21 seats to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Leading figures in the party such as Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were defeated. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her party's plans for a second independence referendum were ""undoubtedly"" a factor in the results, and she would ""reflect carefully"". Ruth Davidson - whose Scottish Conservatives went from one seat to 13 - said Ms Sturgeon should now take a second referendum ""off the table"". Read morehere. How did the parties fare? The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the PM has returned to No 10 a ""diminished figure"", having ended up with 13 fewer seats than when she called the election in April. She had called the election with the stated reason that it would strengthen her hand in negotiations for the UK to leave the EU - the talks are due to start on 19 June. But the Tories are on 318 seats, ahead of Labour on 262 following itslate win in Kensington,the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems on 12. The DUP won 10 seats. As it stands, the Tories and the DUP would have 328 MPs in the Commons, giving it a wafer-thin majority although as Sinn Fein will not be taking its seven seats, the new administration will have slightly more room for manoeuvre. Six key lessons from a surprise result Full UK results breakdown,external Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Reaction to Theresa May's performance Staff applaud Mrs May and her husband, Philip, in 10 Downing Street. Outside protesters gathered, waving placards condemning a Conservative-DUP government After losing her majority, Mr Corbyn called on the prime minister to quit and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said she should resign ""if she has an ounce of self-respect"". Some in her own party have also called for her resignation, with Anna Soubry saying she should consider her position after a ""disastrous"" campaign. However, other MPs have urged her to stay on - Iain Duncan Smith said a leadership contest would be a ""catastrophe"". Tory MP Philip Davies said his party had made ""a pig's ear"" of the campaign, and fellow Tory MP Nigel Evans said his party had ""shot ourselves in the head"". Mrs May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, said the party should never have run a Presidential-style campaign when the leader is ""shy"" and doesn't like doing interviews. The Green Party, which held its one seat at the election but saw its total vote halve, said a Conservative government propped up by the DUP would be a ""coalition of chaos"". ""The DUP, I don't think, are the kind of people you want calling the shots,"" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said. Downing Street said Mrs May received congratulatory calls from French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he was pleased that she would continue to be a close partner, and US President Donald Trump, who agreed with her that they looked forward to close co-operation. Read how the rest of the world reacted Where does this leave Brexit and the Conservative manifesto? Britain's exit from the European Union has been plunged into uncertainty, says BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. The government - and the DUP - may have to rethink their strategy, and the EU will be dismayed to be facing a divided British parliament in a divided Britain, he adds. European Council president Donald Tusk says there is now ""no time to lose"" over Brexit and the European Parliament's chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the result was an ""own goal"" which made negotiations more ""complicated"". Read more from James here BBC analysts says the Conservative's election manifesto may also be in jeopardy. Policies, such as new grammar schools and social care reforms, are likely to get ditched, they say. Without a majority in the Commons, members of the Lords might feel entitled to block them. Also, within the Conservative party, there is a widespread perception that the manifesto was a disaster which they need to distance themselves from, they add. Other big shocks and surprises In a night of high drama, former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg lost his seat while current leader Tim Farron clung on by less than 800 votes in his Cumbrian constituency. Vince Cable and Jo Swinson are among the Lib Dems returning to the Commons after winning back their former seats.

Ex-BBC presenters guilty of sex offences,"The Wadsworths are ""sexual predators"" who lived ""double lives"", prosecutors said Two former BBC radio presenters have each been jailed for five years for indecently assaulting under-age boys. Husband and wife Tony and Julie Wadsworth were found guilty by a majority verdict of encouraging six boys to take part in sexual activity between 1992 and 1996. The couple were also convicted at Warwick Crown Court of outraging public decency by having sex in woodland. The pair, of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, had denied the charges. Following a three-week trial, Julie Wadsworth, 60, was convicted by majority 10-2 verdicts of nine indecent assaults against boys and five counts of outraging public decency. Her spouse, 69, who acted as a ""look-out"", was found guilty of the same charges, also by majority verdicts. Both were found not guilty of three counts of indecent assault, one of which related to a single complainant. The couple claimed they had ""hanky panky"" outdoors in order to boost Julie Wadsworth's self esteem Some victims, who were aged 11 to 15 at the time of the offences, told the court Julie Wadsworth was variously dressed in a ""flasher's mac"" trench coat, white high-heels, stockings, suspenders and a split-skirt. Prosecutors said the abuse took place at a number of locations, including the couple's then home in Atherstone, Warwickshire, as well as on a nearby golf course and surrounding woodland. During the trial, the Wadsworths  - who married in 1994 - told how they had outdoor ""hanky panky"" in order to empower Julie Wadsworth and help her with body image issues stemming from a troubled past. She admitted having sexual encounters with ""young men"" but repeatedly denied any of them had been under the age of consent. Julie Wadsworth ""loved the attention"" of young boys and her husband encouraged her, the judge said In court it emerged that two groups of victims contacted police after a complainant realised what had taken place in the 90s ""was not right and not appropriate"". In videos of police interviews played to the jury, the man claimed he had up to 15 sexual encounters as a teenager with Julie Wadsworth - around half of them before he turned 16. On one occasion, the court heard, Tony Wadsworth joined in a ""threesome"" with the teenager at the couple's home after he turned 16. The Wadsworths were known for sharing a suggestive sense of humour Tony and Julie Wadsworth were a well-known double act in the Midlands, presenting together for more than two decades for BBC local radio in Leicester and in Birmingham. The couple were known for their double-entendres and ""Carry On"" sense of humour - and played up to it on camera and for publicity. Although little-known outside the Midlands, the case generated lurid headlines in the newspapers as details of the couple's sex lives were revealed in court. Staff who worked with them said they had absolutely no suspicions about their sexual behaviour. Another victim, who was 14 at the time, told the court he was ""100% convinced"" that a couple he saw having sex against a tree in 1992 were the Wadsworths and said she had performed a sex act on him. One of the complainants told the trial Julie Wadsworth ""must have known"" her victims were under-age because of their physical appearance. The sixth witness estimated that he was about 11 when he and older boys saw the Wadsworths having sex against a tree. He was either 12 or 13 when he and two other boys were indecently assaulted, the man recalled. Sentencing the pair, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC said the ""grave"" offences had caused emotional damage to all the victims. He said Julie Wadsworth, had ""loved the attention and that young boys were attracted to you"" and her husband had encouraged the offences. He said it would have been obvious to anyone that the victims - some of whom were riding bikes or climbing trees in parkland - were young boys. The Wadsworths enjoyed a high profile among local radio listeners in the Midlands As the verdicts were returned, Julie Wadsworth repeatedly gulped and wiped away tears. Her husband showed little emotion. Mitigating for her after conviction, David Hislop QC said: ""At 60 years of age, hers has been a tragic fall from grace... a period of incarceration will be made even more difficult for her, knowing the stigma attached to her convictions will carry on forever."" Tony Wadsworth's lawyer, Michelle Clarke, said the hardest thing for him would be being separated from his wife. Speaking after the case, David Rouse, a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said the couple had lived ""double lives"". ""In their public and professional lives they were a couple who came across as caring, warm and respectable. ""However, in their private lives, they preyed on young, impressionable victims for their own sexual gratification."" He thanked the victims for their courage in bringing ""two sexual predators to justice"". Det Sgt Rhys Bower, from Warwickshire Police, said: ""These two individuals gave no thought to the impact their actions were having on the young boys they abused; they were only concerned with their own gratification."" The NSPCC said: ""The Wadsworths' behaviour has been exposed for what it is - child sexual abuse. ""Julie Wadsworth's fatuous claim in court that she was a victim in this case is insulting. ""The true victims were young boys who were repeatedly encouraged to engage in illegal sexual activity."" A BBC spokesman said the Wadsworths were last on air in December 2015 and no longer work for the corporation.

Kamal Ahmed: Election catches investors off-guard,"Uncertainty - we'll be hearing a lot more of that word over the next few days. Uncertainty over the form the next government will take. Uncertainty over the Brexit process and the country's approach to it, and our largest trading partner, the European Union. Uncertainty over the economic policies the country will follow - a Conservative-led or Labour-led mix which are very different propositions. And whether there might, ultimately, be another election. The problem is, whatever the political uncertainties over the next few weeks and months, a few things are certain. Real incomes are falling. Growth has slowed. Prices are going up. While politicians face the mother of all negotiation headaches - domestically and with the European Union - the economy stutters on. And all the economic issues that the country faced on June 8, are all still here on June 9. When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm last night, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election. Why would that lead the currency to decline in value? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel is less clear. Deals with different parties may need to be done - each with very different outcomes. Nervousness in the markets is likely to increase and investors in charge of large amounts of global capital could decide to move their money to more attractive markets, such as the Eurozone where growth has picked up and political risk (the major Dutch and French elections are behind us for example) has reduced. In any election, investors would rather a large majority, for either the Conservatives or for Labour. Because that means the threat of another dislocating general election recedes. And the direction of travel for the economy becomes more certain. Strong and stable as some might describe it. We are a long way from that scenario, and from being clear on the policies any new government will propose to solve the myriad economic challenges the UK faces. And whilst we are in that position, downward pressure on sterling will continue, even if there is now a greater chance of a ""softer"" Brexit which many investors might welcome.

What happens when no-one wins the election?,"The general election has ended in a hung Parliament, where no party has the 326 seats needed to get an overall majority in the House of Commons. So what happens now? Theresa May remains prime minister. She plans to form a minority government, relying on the Democratic Unionist Party for support. Election results live updates Election night at-a-glance Full UK results breakdown,external If the DUP supports the Conservatives, then yes, they would together have more than the 326 seats required for a majority to pass a legislative programme. The two parties are currently in discussion, DUP leader Arlene Foster said. And the Conservatives, as the government in power before the general election, get the first attempt at forming an administration. In theory, if they fail to secure DUP backing, Labour could attempt to form its own minority government. But this is unlikely. The Conservatives and the DUP: 328 Labour, SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green: 314 A reminder: The magic number required for a Commons majority is 326. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  If the Conservatives go forward as a minority administration, they will fill all the ministerial positions themselves. But they will rely on the support of the DUP to help them pass legislation. Key to this is an arrangement called ""confidence and supply"" whereby the DUP would support the Tories if a vote of no confidence was called and help them to pass their Budget. Negotiations would still be needed to prevent ordinary day-to-day government business from being defeated. Theresa May has said her government will provide ""stability"" going into Brexit negotiations. And the next general election isn't due until 2022. But maintaining party unity and passing the government's bills will be a tricky task with so little room for rebellion - and the DUP are sure to make their own demands in return for propping up Mrs May's government. The BBC's Mark D'Arcypredictsa Conservative/DUP alliance faces a ""long, precarious high-wire act"", which will be ""beset by troubles and entanglements at every turn"". If the government grinds to a halt as a result, another general election could become unavoidable. This can only happen if: Two-thirds of MPs vote for it. In practice, it would need to be supported by both Labour and the Conservatives. Or: MPs pass a motion of no confidence in the government AND an existing or new government cannot win a confidence vote in the Commons within 14 days of the no-confidence vote Several elections resulted in minority government in the early part of the 20th century. Governments have also started out with majorities which were then lost due to by-elections and defections. Labour had a majority of three after the 1974 general election - but this had vanished by 1977, and it stayed in power thanks to a ""pact"" with the Liberal Party. And John Major's Conservative government started out with a majority of 21 in 1992 but was a minority government by the 1997 general election. The first deadline isTuesday 13 June, when the new Parliament meets for the first time. Mrs May has until this date to put together a deal to keep herself in power or resign,according to official guidance issued by the Cabinet Office.,external She is entitled to wait until the new Parliament to see if she has the confidence of the House of Commons. The government then needs to see if it can assemble the votes it needs to get its programme of proposed new laws passed in the Queen's Speech, which is scheduled forMonday 19 June. This is when it will be relying on the DUP's support. David Cameron and Nick Clegg led a coalition after the 2010 general election A coalition is when two or more parties join forces to govern as a single unit. The junior partners are given ministerial jobs and a joint programme for government is set out. This is what happened in 2010, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems teamed up, but it is unlikely this time given the numbers involved and the parties' statements. Labour has ruled one out - and in any case an alliance with the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens would still leave it short of a majority. The talks are currently due to begin on 19 June but if it takes a while to form a government it could ask the EU for a delay. The EU Parliament's chief negotiator said the outcome ""will make already complex negotiations even more complicated"". What would you like to know about the election results and what happens next?

"May stays, for today","Theresa May and husband Philip arrive at Conservative HQ What a day. This time last night, the two main parties were pouring cold water all over the exit poll that put Theresa May's future in doubt. Tonight that question is very much on Tory minds. She said today that she wants to stay and is in the process of working out how to deal more closely with the DUP (not without controversy) to get her business through Parliament. Yet, there is an increasing mood that she might not get the chance to do so for very long. One minister predicted that, ""slowly and reluctantly"", the party might rally round her. But sentiment in the party, never scientific, seems to be drifting away from allowing that situation to happen. Three MPs have publicly questioned her right to stay on. One senior Conservative told me tonight she ""has to go"", suggesting she has a ""responsibility to the party"" to get the Queens Speech through, show the Conservatives can form the government, and then she ought to move aside. Full UK election results breakdown,external Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Other MPs are gently exploring the possibility of submitting letters to the chairman of the 1922 committee - 48 would be required to trigger a leadership contest. Another former minister told me: ""I just can't see how she stays."" To stay, there are already demands that Theresa May changes her ways of working. Her loyal chiefs of staff could be forced to go and a deputy prime minister might be appointed to create a less brittle and vulnerable government. But moves from her might not be enough. Her gamble may not ultimately have just cost the Tories their majority, but for her, her political career. This situation is changing fast and could feel totally different by the morning. But the rallying round the prime minister that has given her the chance to form a government may turn out to be only a brief window of opportunity - a space to allow her the time to come to her own conclusions. She stays, for today. After a few hours of wild uncertainty, Theresa May will head to Buckingham Palace to seek permission from the Queen to form a government. She has the understanding and assurance from the DUP to be able to form a government, it seems. The PM has experienced a political disaster of her own making. But uniquely perhaps for a prime minister in this situation she is, despite her ruthless party's DNA, planning to stay. The reason? Brexiteers don't want to rock the boat. No-one wants another election. And there is paranoia, whatever the EU says publicly, that Brussels would use the opportunity to cause the maximum amount of trouble. The way it's hoped at top levels of the party to avoid that is to leave 'the boss' as they call her, in place. But only for now. I am yet to talk to a Tory source today who believes she can stay for as long as she likes. She is being seen as a caretaker PM, here for continuity at a time of great volatility - strangely the sort of reasons cited when she was nominated for the leadership. That was of course, before Theresa May revealed herself to be a gambler too. A trait only revealed once she moved into Number 10 - a trait that might be her political undoing, even if she keeps the address for now. In the last few minutes the PM has made it plain she will try to stay on and form a government. That's her right to do so, and as the party with the largest number of seats and votes the Tories will almost definitely form the next government. But there is already pressure on her to go. The question is not just whether enough Tory MPs are happy to keep backing her but also if it is vaguely realistic for her to stay on with her authority so challenged. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party. As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me 'I can't see how she can stay'. A minister texts to say the Tory party is 'absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in'. One Tory source says it is '50:50' that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. It's clear the Tory party won't allow her to stay on to fight another General Election campaign in some years hence. But cooler heads may press on her to stay, not to walk away. This is the election none of the main parties predicted. Just as David Cameron finished off his own career by gambling with the EU referendum he didn't have to have, Theresa May has followed him by calling a national vote when it was not required, because of our relationship with the European Union, and ended her career in the same way. It's only just after two am. There are lots of seats to come in. But at this stage, Tory ministers are saying they do not expect to outperform the exit poll. That means, despite all of those Tory expectations, that confidence they regained in the last week or so of the campaign, the disbelief there was when our exit poll was announced, that privately at the highest level the Conservatives are now beginning to give up on achieving a majority. It's just not clear yet whether or not they will be the largest party. Our exit poll suggests that they will. But either way, Theresa May is damaged, ""strong and stable"" sounds less like an irritating political catchphrase, and more like a parallel universe. She called this election only because she thought she would achieve a much bigger majority than the Tories already had. Even if the Conservatives still end up ahead in terms of the number of seats, her authority looks set to be seriously damaged. It is hard to see how her reputation will recover, and she will have achieved the opposite effect of what she had hoped. This election could produce a more uncertain political picture, a wounded Prime Minister trying to take on the most complicated task any Prime Minister has faced -  that's if, of course, the Tories remain the largest party, and she hangs on. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg: Theresa May has played a high risk political game If these numbers are correct, Theresa May played a high-risk political game and has lost it  - she didn't have to call this election, and only did so in order to give herself a mandate and breathing space during the bumpy ride of Brexit. Just a few weeks ago at the start of all of this she seemed unassailable, but a shaky campaign and an insurgent Labour Party may have dashed the Tories' hopes. This exit poll result is not what either parties were predicting privately - this would be another political surprise - the public again defying the expectations of both the main sides. The Conservatives do look set to be the largest party - it's not clear on these numbers if they will be able to govern alone. Theresa May's promise throughout was to offer her catchphrase ""strong and stable leadership"" - instead she may end diminished - but only of course, your votes, and the real results, will determine through the course of the night what really happens next.

Paul Nuttall quits as UKIP leader,"This video can not be played UKIP's Paul Nuttall: ""I am standing down with immediate effect"" UKIP's Paul Nuttall has stood down as leader of the party after it failed to win any seats in the general election. He has resigned with immediate effect and it was announced former party chairman Steve Crowther would lead UKIP on an interim basis. Mr Nuttall took 3,308 votes in Boston and Skegness - more than 10,000 fewer votes than the party's result in 2015. He said it was clear ""UKIP requires a new focus and new ideas"" but was confident it had a ""great future"". Since resigning as leader he has deleted his Twitter and Facebook accounts. Mr Nuttall said the party was more relevant than ever and would continue to be ""the guard dogs of Brexit"". ""The prime minister, and I suspect it will be a Tory, must know that if they begin to backtrack or barter things away then they must know they will be punished at the ballot box and that will only happen if UKIP is electorally viable and strong. ""We are in effect the country's insurance policy on Brexit,"" he said. Paul Nuttall: The full story Full election results breakdown,external May to seek to form UK government Are we 'watching UKIP's funeral'? UKIP saw its popularity collapse in the election after securing only 593,852 votes - down from 3,881,099 in 2015. Mr Nuttall said after the election of a new leader, the party needed to relaunch and rebrand itself and required a new focus, new ideas and a renewed energy. ""I say to members: keep the faith, politics will come back onto our turf and we have to be organised and ready to take full advantage when it does,"" he said. ""To the voters I say: UKIP is still here and UKIP is not going away."" The party announced Mr Crowther had ""overwhelmingly"" been chosen by the national executive committee (NEC). He resigned as UKIP chairman in July 2016 but stood as a candidate in North Devon in the election. UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said: ""Conversations have taken place within the NEC to establish who is best placed to offer that stability in the very short term"". He added: ""Steve has a solid relationship with the NEC, both former leaders and our biggest donors. He has seen this situation before and will know how best to navigate through these tumultuous weeks. Knowing that Steve came top in the last NEC elections by a clear margin, also gives us confidence that he has the support of our membership."" Mr Nuttall took over from Nigel Farage as leader of UKIP last November. Asked about a future role for Mr Farage in the party, Mr Nuttall said: ""If Nigel Farage wants to come back, I would be more than happy to do a job swap. ""I'll take his slot on LBC (radio station) and he can come back as leader of UKIP."" Mr Nuttall, a former history lecturer, joined UKIP in 2004 after running for the Conservatives in a council election in Bootle two years earlier. He became an MEP for North West England in 2009 and served as UKIP deputy leader from 2010 until September last year. After Mr Farage resigned as UKIP leader following the Brexit referendum in July, Mr Nuttall ruled himself out of taking over. But when Diane James quit after just 18 days in the job, he put himself forward and was elected with 62% of the vote. Heartland and strongholds and lost deposits - the result, in maps The places where power changed hands A record number of female MPs Summary of events so far Twenty things you may have missed Mr Nuttall's resignation came shortly before UKIP's general secretary, Jonathan Arnott, also announced he would be resigning. In a departing statement, he said the party had ""lost its way in recent times"" and he ""profoundly disagreed"" with UKIP's election campaign. He attacked the party's ""clumsy, blundering approach"" to tackling female genital mutilation and its ""hardline anti-Islam messages"". ""The people pushing such an agenda need to reflect on the party's future. They need to stop making it difficult - impossible, even - for many people to vote UKIP,"" he said. ""This election result is the last wake-up call that they will ever get."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

He said: ""I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to Paul Nuttall for having had the courage and strength of will to forge on.

Could the DUP be Westminster kingmakers?,"Arlene Foster's DUP made big gains, winning 10 seats In 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) built its general election campaign around the idea that its MPs might be kingmakers at Westminster. Their posters bore the slogan ""More Votes. More Seats. More Influence. More for Northern Ireland"". When David Cameron won his majority, that strategy was quietly forgotten. But that's the position the 10 newly returned DUP MPs are in, despite leaderArlene Fosterpredicting it did ""not look likely"" at the campaign outset. What price for DUP supporting Tories? Profile: The DUP What happens when no-one wins the election? Election results in full Live updates: UK election ends in hung parliament An arrangement with a Labour-led Rainbow Coalition is a non-starter. Senior DUP figures have made clear their antipathy towards Jeremy Corbyn because of his historic links with Sinn FÃ©in. Theresa May - or whoever succeeds her - would be a far more plausible partner for the DUP, which is pro-Brexit and right of centre on many issues. DUP sources say it is too early to predict whether they might consider a formal coalition or a more informal ""confidence and supply"" arrangement. But what would they want in return for such support? The Democratic Unionist Party is the largest political party in Northern Ireland. It was the most Euro-sceptic party in the UK before the ascent of UKIP. It opposes same-sex marriage, and is anti-abortion. DUP MPs have been consistently critical of Jeremy Corbyn, particularly for his past links with Sinn FÃ©in and his stance on security. But they have made positive comments about Theresa May's leadership of the Conservative Party. The DUP based its Westminster campaign around a call to defend the union, saying unionists had to turn out to rebut republican demands for a referendum on Irish unity. Read morehere. On Brexit, the DUP want the border with the Irish Republic to be as ""seamless and frictionless"" as possible, and they reject the Special EU status championed by Sinn FÃ©in, which they regard as watering down Northern Ireland's Britishness. Other clues to what the DUP might demand can be gleanedfrom their manifesto,external, which includes retaining the""triple lock"" on pensions, cutting VAT for tourism businesses, abolishing Air Passenger Duty, and reviewing the price of ferries between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUP's 10 MPs - a gain of two since the last election - are the fruit of a polarisation in politics in Northern Ireland. The party had a difficult Northern Ireland Assembly election in March, when Sinn FÃ©in made substantial gains. This election was to some extent a return match and the DUP was able to rally its supporters in order to ensure Sinn FÃ©in did not become the biggest party in Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in has done well, winning a record seven seats. The casualties were the two smaller, more moderate nationalist and unionist parties - the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists - who have been wiped off the map. The Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has reiterated that his new MPs will not abandon their abstentionism - the party's MPs do not take their seats in Westminster. DUP sources say it is too early to predict whether they might consider a formal coalition or a more informal ""confidence and supply"" arrangement That means there will be no Irish nationalist voice in the House of Commons chamber as the forthcoming Brexit negotiations unfold. The fact that the seven Sinn FÃ©in MPs won't take their seats will also have an impact on the arithmetic of the hung parliament, reducing the winning post from 326 to something more like 322 seats. So ironically Sinn FÃ©in might, by staying away, make the management of the new parliament a little easier for the DUP and the Conservatives. At Stormont, the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly, there is no power-sharing executive because of a stand off between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, which has remained unresolved since the start of this year. Talks were due to get going after this election, with the aim of restoring power sharing within the next three weeks. But now it looks like the DUP will be double-booked, playing a role in forming a government not at Stormont, but at Westminster. Kuenssberg: Can May survive? May: Country needs stability.

May seeks to form government after losses,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she'll ""reflect on what we need to do to take the party forward"" Theresa May has said she will put together a government with the support of the Democratic Unionists to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. Speaking after visiting Buckingham Palace, she said only her party had the ""legitimacy"" to govern, despite falling eight seats short of a majority. Later, she said she ""obviously wanted a different result"" and felt ""sorry"" for colleagues who lost their seats. But Labour said they were the ""real winners"". The Lib Dems said Mrs May should be ""ashamed"" of carrying on. The Tories needed 326 seats to win another majority but they fell short and must rely on the DUP to continue to rule. What happens when no-one wins the election? Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? How the Tory campaign went wrong In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP ""friends"" to ""get to work"" on Brexit. Referring to the ""strong relationship"" she had with the DUP but giving little detail of how their arrangement might work, she said she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"". ""Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years,"" she said. ""And this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom."" It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it ""lend"" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as ""confidence and supply"". The PM earlier visited Buckingham Palace Later, she told reporters that she had ""wanted to achieve a larger majority but that was not the result"". ""I'm sorry for all those candidates... who weren't successful, and also particularly sorry for MPs and ministers who'd contributed so much to our country, and who lost their seats and didn't deserve to lose their seats. ""As I reflect on the results, I will reflect on what I need to do in the future to take the party forward."" This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed that she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to ""explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge"". While always striving for the ""best deal"" for Northern Ireland and its people, she said her party would always have the best interests of the UK at heart. Scottish Conservative leaderRuth Davidson has since sought assurancesfrom Mrs May that any deal with the DUP will not affect LGBTI rights across the UK. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal. A source close to Ms Davidson, who is gay, told the BBC: ""The PM needs to remember there are more Scottish Conservatives than DUP MPs."" Who are the DUP? The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. One MP is a devout climate change denier, while a former MP once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. During the election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly was endorsed by the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. Read more about theDUP hereand meet theirMPs here. Who's in the Cabinet? In an ongoing Cabinet reshuffle, five cabinet ministers are certain to stay: Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon; Brexit Secretary David Davis; Home Secretary Amber Rudd; Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Hammond said, in a tweet, that he was ""pleased to be reappointed so we can now get on and negotiate a Brexit deal that supports British jobs, business and prosperity"". Mr Johnson tweeted that he was ""delighted"", adding ""lots of great work to do for greatest country on earth"". However, those rarely seen on the campaign trail, including Andrea Leadsom, Priti Patel and Liam Fox, could be out, says BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. Comebacks from Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove and prominent leave campaigner Dominic Raab were being floated, she adds. Where does this leave Labour? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has denounced Mrs May's plan to head up a minority government, calling for her to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He said Labour was ready to form a minority government of its own, after far exceeding expectations by picking up 30 seats in England, Wales and Scotland. But even if it joined together in a so-called progressive alliance with the SNP, Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru, it would only reach 314 seats - short of the 326 figure needed. ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said, while stressing he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson said the ""surprise"" result was a political ""earthquake"",  and he'd been ""wrong"" to criticise Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. There are three posts that Mr Corbyn now needs to fill in the shadow cabinet, but sources say an announcement is not likely until Sunday at the earliest. Streatham MP Chuka Umunna, a leading figure on the right of the party, has said he would accept a role in the shadow cabinet. The Jeremy Corbyn factor What about Scotland? This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP 'will listen to voters' The SNP remains the largest party in Scotland but lost 21 seats to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Leading figures in the party such as Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were defeated. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her party's plans for a second independence referendum were ""undoubtedly"" a factor in the results, and she would ""reflect carefully"". Ruth Davidson - whose Scottish Conservatives went from one seat to 13 - said Ms Sturgeon should now take a second referendum ""off the table"". Read morehere. How did the parties fare? The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the PM has returned to No 10 a ""diminished figure"", having ended up with 13 fewer seats than when she called the election in April. She had called the election with the stated reason that it would strengthen her hand in negotiations for the UK to leave the EU - the talks are due to start on 19 June. But the Tories are on 318 seats, ahead of Labour on 262 following itslate win in Kensington,the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems on 12. The DUP won 10 seats. As it stands, the Tories and the DUP would have 328 MPs in the Commons, giving it a wafer-thin majority although as Sinn Fein will not be taking its seven seats, the new administration will have slightly more room for manoeuvre.

Outside protesters gathered, waving placards condemning a Conservative-DUP government After losing her majority, Mr Corbyn called on the prime minister to quit and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said she should resign ""if she has an ounce of self-respect"". Some in her own party have also called for her resignation, with Anna Soubry saying she should consider her position after a ""disastrous"" campaign. However, other MPs have urged her to stay on - Iain Duncan Smith said a leadership contest would be a ""catastrophe"". Tory MP Philip Davies said his party had made ""a pig's ear"" of the campaign, and fellow Tory MP Nigel Evans said his party had ""shot ourselves in the head"". Mrs May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, said the party should never have run a Presidential-style campaign when the leader is ""shy"" and doesn't like doing interviews. The Green Party, which held its one seat at the election but saw its total vote halve, said a Conservative government propped up by the DUP would be a ""coalition of chaos"". ""The DUP, I don't think, are the kind of people you want calling the shots,"" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said. Downing Street said Mrs May received congratulatory calls from French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he was pleased that she would continue to be a close partner, and US President Donald Trump, who agreed with her that they looked forward to close co-operation. Read how the rest of the world reacted Where does this leave Brexit and the Conservative manifesto? Britain's exit from the European Union has been plunged into uncertainty, says BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. The government - and the DUP - may have to rethink their strategy, and the EU will be dismayed to be facing a divided British parliament in a divided Britain, he adds. European Council president Donald Tusk says there is now ""no time to lose"" over Brexit and the European Parliament's chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the result was an ""own goal"" which made negotiations more ""complicated"". Read more from James here BBC analysts says the Conservative's election manifesto may also be in jeopardy. Policies, such as new grammar schools and social care reforms, are likely to get ditched, they say. Without a majority in the Commons, members of the Lords might feel entitled to block them. Also, within the Conservative party, there is a widespread perception that the manifesto was a disaster which they need to distance themselves from, they add. Other big shocks and surprises In a night of high drama, former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg lost his seat while current leader Tim Farron clung on by less than 800 votes in his Cumbrian constituency. Vince Cable and Jo Swinson are among the Lib Dems returning to the Commons after winning back their former seats.

Record number of female MPs elected,"Layla Moran, newly elected Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon There are now 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015, as a result of Thursday's general election. This takes female representation in the Commons to a new high. Overall 32% of MPs are women but there are significant variations between parties. For Labour the figure is 45%, and 21% for the Conservatives. This was the breakdown for each party and for the Commons as a whole: WomenMen Before:of(%) After:of(%) WomenMen Before:of(%) After:of(%) WomenMen Before:of(%) After:of(%) WomenMen Before:of(%) After:of(%) WomenMen Before:of(%) After:of(%) As for the gender balance of the smaller parties at Westminster, the Greens' only MP is a woman, there is one woman among Plaid Cymru's four MPs, two women among Sinn Fein's seven MPs, and one MP among the DUP's block of 10 MPs. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for women's rights, said: ""The outcome of this election was a surprise to many pollsters, but it has seen more Labour women MPs elected. The Conservative Party has not seen a significant reduction in women MPs despite losing seats. ""But the real story is that progress has stalled. Getting more women in cannot be subject to party political fortunes. As we approach the centenary of women first getting to vote in general elections, we cannot wait for another nine elections to achieve equality. ""We agree with the recommendation of the cross-party Women and Equalities Select Committee that 45% of each party's candidates must be women. The time has come for a legally enforceable target to achieve the radical and sustainable change we need."" Among Labour's new intake was Preet Gill, the UK'sfirst female Sikh MP. Ms Gill secured 24,124 votes to hold the seat in Birmingham Edgbaston for Labour with a majority of 6,917. For many decades after women were first legally allowed to stand for election, female MPs made up less than 5% of the total. This reached double digits for the first time under Margaret Thatcher in 1987, but shot up as a consequence of Labour's 1997 landslide, when Tony Blair's party increased its number of female MPs by 173%.

Election result rattles faith in economy,"The likelihood of a minority Conservative government could stave off a further fall in sterling when trading begins on Monday, according to analysts. Prime Minister Theresa May is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to support her administration. The Tories lost their Commons majority in Thursday's general election. Sterling closed on Friday1.6% lower against the dollar at $1.2743and fell 1.4%against the euroto 1.1382 euros. Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said: ""You may well see the pound bounce on the optimism ... but it will be short-lived."" David Madden of CMC Markets said Mrs May staying on as prime minister with help from the DUP may assist sterling ""a little"". Calls mount for rethink of Brexit stance The pound's fall against both the dollar and euro was less dramatic than the drop in the wake of the EU referendum in June last year. The chances of Mrs May securing a ""hard"" Brexit have diminished following the loss of the Conservatives' Commons majority, according to some commentators. George Osborne, the former chancellor, told the BBC he did not believe that most MPs now backed a ""hard"" Brexit"" following the election result. Panmure Gordon market commentator David Buik said the hung parliament would ""require an immediate response to settle for a much softer Brexit"". Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, who is returning to the Commons after regaining Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats, said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". The DUP campaigned for Brexit, but wants a common travel area between the UK and Ireland and no hard border with the Republic - the UK's only land border with the EU.

Jobcentre-hostages suspect arrested,"Officers were on the scene within nine minutes Staff at a Jobcentre in Newcastle were released unharmed after being held by a man armed with a knife who was wearing a fake explosive device. The 28-year-old entered the Clifford Street building at about 08:00 BST and held several members of staff hostage. He surrendered to armed officers at 11:15 and was arrested for threats to kill. He remains in custody. Northumbria Police said they had ""very real concerns"" the man could have caused serious harm. The force said officers responded within nine minutes. They quickly shut down roads, closed the nearby Byker Metro Station, evacuated nearby buildings including the student accommodation and began negotiating with the suspect. A spokesman said the incident was not terror-related and the man was known to Jobcentre staff. An explosive device reportedly strapped to the man's chest was later found to be fake. Bomb disposal experts swept the building and searches of the building and of other properties in the area were carried out. This video can not be played The suspect was led away from the scene in his underwear by police Officers said it had been suggested on social media and by members of the public at the scene that some people had been stabbed, but the force said that was ""not the case"". At about 10:20 police tweeted the hostages had been released and later confirmed the staff had been freed at about 08:30, half an hour after the incident began. Assistant Ch Con Darren Best said: ""In recent weeks we have heard many positive stories about the police and how quickly they have responded to some of the atrocities we have witnessed in London and Manchester. ""When we first received the call there were very real concerns that this individual could have caused serious harm and to be on the scene in a matter of minutes is a fantastic response. Bomb disposal teams were called to the scene ""It must have been particularly traumatising for those staff members who were kept inside the premises. ""Our specialist negotiators engaged with the man very early on and their efforts are one of the main reasons that this incident was brought to a safe conclusion and that nobody was injured."" A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services (PCS), which represents most Jobcentre staff, said: ""We are pleased to confirm that police were quick to respond, all staff are confirmed as safe and have been evacuated, but the Jobcentre remains closed as a precaution.

May to seek to form UK government,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she'll ""reflect on what we need to do to take the party forward"" Theresa May has said she will put together a government with the support of the Democratic Unionists to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. Speaking after visiting Buckingham Palace, she said only her party had the ""legitimacy"" to govern, despite falling eight seats short of a majority. Later, she said she ""obviously wanted a different result"" and felt ""sorry"" for colleagues who lost their seats. But Labour said they were the ""real winners"". The Lib Dems said Mrs May should be ""ashamed"" of carrying on. The Tories needed 326 seats to win another majority but they fell short and must rely on the DUP to continue to rule. What happens when no-one wins the election? Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? How the Tory campaign went wrong In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP ""friends"" to ""get to work"" on Brexit. Referring to the ""strong relationship"" she had with the DUP but giving little detail of how their arrangement might work, she said she intended to form a government which could ""provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country"". ""Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years,"" she said. ""And this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom."" It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it ""lend"" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as ""confidence and supply"". The PM earlier visited Buckingham Palace Later, she told reporters that she had ""wanted to achieve a larger majority but that was not the result"". ""I'm sorry for all those candidates... who weren't successful, and also particularly sorry for MPs and ministers who'd contributed so much to our country, and who lost their seats and didn't deserve to lose their seats. ""As I reflect on the results, I will reflect on what I need to do in the future to take the party forward."" This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed that she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to ""explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge"". While always striving for the ""best deal"" for Northern Ireland and its people, she said her party would always have the best interests of the UK at heart. Scottish Conservative leaderRuth Davidson has since sought assurancesfrom Mrs May that any deal with the DUP will not affect LGBTI rights across the UK. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal. A source close to Ms Davidson, who is gay, told the BBC: ""The PM needs to remember there are more Scottish Conservatives than DUP MPs."" Who are the DUP? The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. One MP is a devout climate change denier, while a former MP once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. During the election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly was endorsed by the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. Read more about theDUP hereand meet theirMPs here. Who's in the Cabinet? In an ongoing Cabinet reshuffle, five cabinet ministers are certain to stay: Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon; Brexit Secretary David Davis; Home Secretary Amber Rudd; Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Hammond said, in a tweet, that he was ""pleased to be reappointed so we can now get on and negotiate a Brexit deal that supports British jobs, business and prosperity"". Mr Johnson tweeted that he was ""delighted"", adding ""lots of great work to do for greatest country on earth"". However, those rarely seen on the campaign trail, including Andrea Leadsom, Priti Patel and Liam Fox, could be out, says BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. Comebacks from Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove and prominent leave campaigner Dominic Raab were being floated, she adds. Where does this leave Labour? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has denounced Mrs May's plan to head up a minority government, calling for her to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He said Labour was ready to form a minority government of its own, after far exceeding expectations by picking up 30 seats in England, Wales and Scotland. But even if it joined together in a so-called progressive alliance with the SNP, Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru, it would only reach 314 seats - short of the 326 figure needed. ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said, while stressing he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson said the ""surprise"" result was a political ""earthquake"",  and he'd been ""wrong"" to criticise Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. There are three posts that Mr Corbyn now needs to fill in the shadow cabinet, but sources say an announcement is not likely until Sunday at the earliest. Streatham MP Chuka Umunna, a leading figure on the right of the party, has said he would accept a role in the shadow cabinet. The Jeremy Corbyn factor What about Scotland? This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP 'will listen to voters' The SNP remains the largest party in Scotland but lost 21 seats to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Leading figures in the party such as Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were defeated. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her party's plans for a second independence referendum were ""undoubtedly"" a factor in the results, and she would ""reflect carefully"". Ruth Davidson - whose Scottish Conservatives went from one seat to 13 - said Ms Sturgeon should now take a second referendum ""off the table"". Read morehere. How did the parties fare? The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the PM has returned to No 10 a ""diminished figure"", having ended up with 13 fewer seats than when she called the election in April. She had called the election with the stated reason that it would strengthen her hand in negotiations for the UK to leave the EU - the talks are due to start on 19 June. But the Tories are on 318 seats, ahead of Labour on 262 following itslate win in Kensington,the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems on 12. The DUP won 10 seats. As it stands, the Tories and the DUP would have 328 MPs in the Commons, giving it a wafer-thin majority although as Sinn Fein will not be taking its seven seats, the new administration will have slightly more room for manoeuvre. Six key lessons from a surprise result Full UK results breakdown,external Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Reaction to Theresa May's performance Staff applaud Mrs May and her husband, Philip, in 10 Downing Street. Outside protesters gathered, waving placards condemning a Conservative-DUP government After losing her majority, Mr Corbyn called on the prime minister to quit and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said she should resign ""if she has an ounce of self-respect"". Some in her own party have also called for her resignation, with Anna Soubry saying she should consider her position after a ""disastrous"" campaign. However, other MPs have urged her to stay on - Iain Duncan Smith said a leadership contest would be a ""catastrophe"". Tory MP Philip Davies said his party had made ""a pig's ear"" of the campaign, and fellow Tory MP Nigel Evans said his party had ""shot ourselves in the head"". Mrs May's former director of communications, Katie Perrior, said the party should never have run a Presidential-style campaign when the leader is ""shy"" and doesn't like doing interviews. The Green Party, which held its one seat at the election but saw its total vote halve, said a Conservative government propped up by the DUP would be a ""coalition of chaos"". ""The DUP, I don't think, are the kind of people you want calling the shots,"" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said. Downing Street said Mrs May received congratulatory calls from French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he was pleased that she would continue to be a close partner, and US President Donald Trump, who agreed with her that they looked forward to close co-operation. Read how the rest of the world reacted Where does this leave Brexit and the Conservative manifesto? Britain's exit from the European Union has been plunged into uncertainty, says BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. The government - and the DUP - may have to rethink their strategy, and the EU will be dismayed to be facing a divided British parliament in a divided Britain, he adds. European Council president Donald Tusk says there is now ""no time to lose"" over Brexit and the European Parliament's chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the result was an ""own goal"" which made negotiations more ""complicated"". Read more from James here BBC analysts says the Conservative's election manifesto may also be in jeopardy. Policies, such as new grammar schools and social care reforms, are likely to get ditched, they say. Without a majority in the Commons, members of the Lords might feel entitled to block them. Also, within the Conservative party, there is a widespread perception that the manifesto was a disaster which they need to distance themselves from, they add. Other big shocks and surprises In a night of high drama, former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg lost his seat while current leader Tim Farron clung on by less than 800 votes in his Cumbrian constituency. Vince Cable and Jo Swinson are among the Lib Dems returning to the Commons after winning back their former seats.

Six Day War: Six ways the conflict still matters,"Israel was forged in, and defined by, war. Each armed conflict, large and small, left its mark. But it is the shortest, the Six Day War of June 1967, that seems to resonate more than all the others. Why? For many Israelis, this was a moment of euphoria. Their young state's military prowess had been amply demonstrated. The whole of Jerusalem, and all of Judaism's holiest places, were back under Jewish control for the first time in 2,000 years. Just 22 years after the Holocaust, the Jewish people's future now seemed secure, in their ancestral homeland. This was heady stuff. For the Palestinians, it was a different story. More than a million Palestinian Arabs came under Israeli military rule and hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes, some of them for the second time. For them, this was a grim sequel to the ""Nakba"" (Catastrophe) of 19 years earlier, when Israel gained its independence and more than 700,000 Palestinians became refugees in the fighting which surrounded it. What caused the war? Six Day War - in 60 seconds What the war meant to Arabs and Israelis For a small number of Israelis, this was an opportunity not to miss. In 1968, a group of Jewish settlers, posing as tourists, checked into a hotel in Hebron, in the West Bank. They refused to leave until the government agreed to let them settle - temporarily - nearby. It was the start of a process which led, over time, to the colonisation of large parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By 2015, 386,000 settlers occupied 131 West Bank settlements. Until Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, 8,000 settlers lived there too. In the eyes of the international community, Jewish settlements are illegal. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits an occupying power from transferring its citizens into occupied territory. Israel disputes its applicability and every government since 1967 has allowed settler numbers to rise. Settlers are well-represented by nationalist political parties which regard the West Bank as part of their Jewish birthright. The settlement issue has long dogged efforts to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Some argue that the settlement enterprise is now so extensive and entrenched that it renders a viable two-state solution all-but impossible. Can settlements issue be resolved? The image of young Israeli paratroopers gazing up at the Western Wall in June 1967 came to symbolise a moment of national redemption. Ever since then, Israel has regarded the whole of Jerusalem as its unified capital. But 50 years after the Six Day War, the city remains deeply divided. There are almost no mixed neighbourhoods. Development in Arab areas of East Jerusalem has been severely constrained. The demographic balance has been dramatically altered by the arrival of more than 200,000 Jewish residents. Palestinians, like Israelis, see Jerusalem as their capital, but the city's 300,000 Arab residents are all but cut off from the West Bank by Israel's barrier construction and a series of large Jewish neighbourhoods built on land captured in 1967. Jerusalem represents the concentrated heart of a conflict which mixes land, religion and politics. Its ancient sites can still inspire the sense of awed reverence depicted in David Rubinger's 1967 photo, an image iconic to Jews around the world. But they also serve as magnets for intolerant nationalism, laced with fear and prejudice. Difficult instincts to overcome. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Jerusalem's holy sites in 2.5 minutes The Israeli cabinet held long, anguished discussions after the war about what to do with the territories now under its control. No formal peace offer was ever made and, at a summit in Khartoum in September 1967, humiliated Arab leaders declared there would be ""no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel."" But 10 years later, after another Arab-Israeli war, Egypt's President Anwar Sadat became the first Arab leader to visit Israel, initiating a peace process that led to a peace treaty in 1979. Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which its troops had captured in the Six Day War. The Egyptian leader paid a heavy price. His fellow Arab leaders, shocked that he had chosen bilateral relations over pan-Arab solidarity, turned their backs on him. And, on 6 October 1981, Sadat was assassinated by members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The start of an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, in the early 1990s, made it easier for Jordan to follow Egypt's example. Jordan had already renounced its claim to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, so the treaty signed in 1994 had no territorial implications, other than minor adjustments. This remains the central unresolved legacy of 1967. Israelis and Palestinians have sat down countless times but have never managed to reach a final deal. The stumbling blocks have simply proved insurmountable. Israeli settlements have gradually eaten away at the territory in question. Acts of Palestinian violence, including suicide bombs aimed at cafes and busses, have convinced many Israelis they have no partner. To make matters worse, both sides have experienced profound political division. In 1995, the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, suffered the same fate as Anwar Sadat: gunned down by a religious zealot, two years after shaking hands with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn. For their part, the Palestinians have been deeply split for over a decade, between a PLO-dominated Palestinian Authority, willing to negotiate with Israel, and an Islamist militant movement, Hamas, which still says it wants to liberate ""all of Palestine"". What are alternatives to a two-state solution? Israel's capture of the strategic basalt plateau known as the Golan Heights represented the final Arab humiliation of the Six Day War. Syria, believing that Egypt was in the process of defeating Israel in the south, launched its own attack. It was a costly mistake. Israel counter-attacked. Around 100,000 Syrians fled or were driven out. In 1981, Israel passed a law which annexed the area in all but name, and has not been recognised internationally. While less central to Israeli identity than Jerusalem or the West Bank, Jewish settlers have gradually made their homes and livelihoods on the Golan. By 2014, there were around 20,000. Peace efforts have been fitful. In 2000, hopes were raised when Syria's ailing president, Hafez al-Assad (father of the current leader) agreed to meet US President Bill Clinton in Geneva.  But the talks went nowhere, foundering on Syria's demands to return to its pre-1967 position on the north-east shore of the Sea of Galilee.

Jobcentre hostages released by knifeman,"Officers were on the scene within nine minutes Staff at a Jobcentre in Newcastle were released unharmed after being held by a man armed with a knife who was wearing a fake explosive device. The 28-year-old entered the Clifford Street building at about 08:00 BST and held several members of staff hostage. He surrendered to armed officers at 11:15 and was arrested for threats to kill. He remains in custody. Northumbria Police said they had ""very real concerns"" the man could have caused serious harm. The force said officers responded within nine minutes. They quickly shut down roads, closed the nearby Byker Metro Station, evacuated nearby buildings including the student accommodation and began negotiating with the suspect. A spokesman said the incident was not terror-related and the man was known to Jobcentre staff. An explosive device reportedly strapped to the man's chest was later found to be fake. Bomb disposal experts swept the building and searches of the building and of other properties in the area were carried out. This video can not be played The suspect was led away from the scene in his underwear by police Officers said it had been suggested on social media and by members of the public at the scene that some people had been stabbed, but the force said that was ""not the case"". At about 10:20 police tweeted the hostages had been released and later confirmed the staff had been freed at about 08:30, half an hour after the incident began. Assistant Ch Con Darren Best said: ""In recent weeks we have heard many positive stories about the police and how quickly they have responded to some of the atrocities we have witnessed in London and Manchester. ""When we first received the call there were very real concerns that this individual could have caused serious harm and to be on the scene in a matter of minutes is a fantastic response. Bomb disposal teams were called to the scene ""It must have been particularly traumatising for those staff members who were kept inside the premises. ""Our specialist negotiators engaged with the man very early on and their efforts are one of the main reasons that this incident was brought to a safe conclusion and that nobody was injured."" A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services (PCS), which represents most Jobcentre staff, said: ""We are pleased to confirm that police were quick to respond, all staff are confirmed as safe and have been evacuated, but the Jobcentre remains closed as a precaution. ""Department of Work and Pensions management and our officials are with the members to support them and no injuries have been reported.""

Saudi apology over London attack tribute,"At least one Saudi player stood still, but most of the team did not Saudi football chiefs have apologised after their national team elected not to take part in a minute's silence for victims of the London Bridge attack. Australian players linked arms as a sign of respect before Thursday's World Cup qualifying match at Adelaide Oval. Saudi players took up field positions and some continued to stretch. Football officials said they had been told in advance that the ""tradition was not in keeping with Saudi culture"". An Australian MP called it ""disgraceful"". Football's world body Fifa says the Saudi team will not face sanctions. It said it had reviewed what had happened and judged that there were ""no grounds to take disciplinary action"". Eight people were killed and 48 injured on Saturday when three men drove into pedestrians on London Bridge, before abandoning the vehicle and stabbing people in the surrounding area. Two Australians,Kirsty Boden and Sara Zelenak, were among the eight victims of the terror attack. Australian football officials said the Saudi team had agreed a minute's silence could be held. But officials were ""further advised by Saudi team officials that this tradition was not in keeping with Saudi culture and they would move to their side of the field and respect our custom whilst taking their own positions on the field"", a statement from Football Federation Australia said. During the silence, as the Australian team lined up, most Saudi players dispersed to take up their positions on the pitch. Number 7 Salman Al Faraj, appeared to stand still. Two other players are also pictured standing with their hands behind their back. The Saudi Arabian Football Federation made an ""unreserved"" apology on Friday. Full story: London Bridge attack In pictures: Tributes to victims ""The players did not intend any disrespect to the memories of the victims or to cause upset to their families, friends or any individual affected by the atrocity,"" it said in astatement,external. ""The Saudi Arabian Football Federation condemns all acts of terrorism and extremism and extends its sincerest condolences to the families of all the victims and to the government and people of the United Kingdom."" The observance of moments of silence has been for years a subject of religious disagreement between moderate Muslim clerics, who do not object to it and consider it to be an appropriate expression of respect for the deceased, and hard-line Salafi clerics who believe that it is religiously prohibited. In Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, minutes of silence are not uncommon at football matches to pay tribute to the victims of natural disasters, or individuals who have died. And despite the Saudi team's actions in Adelaide, it has emerged that Saudi sportsmen too have observed moments of silence in the past. This suggests the controversy might be linked to current tensions in domestic Saudi politics, says Sajjad Rizvi, an associate professor at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter. The decision was widely criticised in Australia Several Australian politicians have criticised the Saudi team. ""This is not about culture,"" one MP, Anthony Albanese, told the local Nine network. ""This is about a lack of respect and I thought it was disgraceful."" Asked about the incident, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had not seen the footage, adding: ""The whole world... is united in condemnation of that terrorist attack and terrorism generally."" Teams observe one minute of silence during the match between FC Barcelona and Al-Ahli Saudi FC on 13 December 2016 in Doha, Qatar Saudi sportsmen have observed silences in the past. Players from Al-Ahli Saudi FC observed one minute of silence before the Qatar Airways Cup match with FC Barcelona on 13 December 2016 in Doha, Qatar, in memory of players from Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense whodied in a plane crashon 28 November. Saudi male handball players also held a minute's silence before a match against Germany in January 2015 to remember the late king, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz.

Instead, it lost 21 seats, with the Conservatives the biggest beneficiaries. How do things look if all the seats are the same size? Standard geographical maps tend to emphasise sparsely populated rural areas over urban seats, although all constituencies are of the same political value.

While support for the Lib Dems in England dropped slightly, dwindled for the Greens, and fell off a cliff for UKIP, the combined vote share for the Conservatives and Labour is at its highest for decades. ""I believe it's only a temporary return to two-party politics,"" UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said as he announced his resignation. The Conservatives lost six seats in the capital, losingBattersea,Croydon Central,Enfield SouthgateandKensingtonto Labour, who saw its majorities increase in a number of constituencies. The Liberal Democrats also made gains in London as former government ministers Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey both won back the seats they had lost in 2015 to the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats lost both of the seats they previously held in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. The most high-profile scalp came inSheffield Hallam, where the party's former leader and former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg lost the seat he had held since 2005 to Labour. The Conservatives suffered losses in the South East, losing six seats in the region, four to Labour and two to the Liberal Democrats. Labour defeated the Conservatives to gainCanterbury, winning the constituency for the first time since it was formed in 1918. Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas heldBrighton Pavilion, increasing her vote share in the seat to above 50%. When a party gets less than 5% of the vote in a constituency, it loses the Â£500 deposit each candidate needs to put down to stand. And in terms of lost deposits, some of the smaller parties in Westminster had disastrous nights. While the Lib Dems increased its number of MPs, it lost its deposit in 375 seats. UKIP lost 337 deposits. But the party with the most lost deposits was the Greens, they only saved their deposit in 11 of the 466 constituencies they contested.

Fifteen things you may have missed from election night,"It's difficult to catch everything during an election night whirlwind of facts, stats and spin. Beyond the immediate headlines, here are 20 things you may have missed. This video can not be played The moment Nick Clegg lost his seat The SNP has suffered some of the night's biggest losses. Former leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland's first minister between 2007 and 2014, lost hisGordon seatto the Scottish Conservatives. The SNP leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, also lost hisMoray seatto the Tories. Former Lib Dem Leader and deputy PM Nick Clegg also suffered a fall from grace. He looked visibly upset when he lost hisSheffield Hallam seat- which he had held for 12 years - to Labour. But his departure didn't seem to shock everyone. ""Who is Nick Clegg?"" was one of the top trending questions on Google overnight. Turnout is the highest since 1997. It's up by 2% to 69%. It looks like Labour has been successful in persuading young voters to turn out and vote for the party. There has been a greater swing to Labour in seats with a higher population of 18 to 24-year-olds, according to professor of politics John Curtice. Turnout has also increased more in seats with young people - and Labour's vote seems to have advanced most in constituencies where the turnout increased most. A record number of female MPs have been elected. There will be208 women in this Parliament,outnumbering the 196 women elected in 2015. About 30% of candidates were women this year - up from the previous record of 26% in 2015. However  the actual number of women standing was down from 1,036 to 983. Record number of female MPs Mrs May may have had a terrible night, but the Scottish Conservative leader has arguably achieved one of the biggest success stories of recent UK political history. The  Scottish Tories were wiped out by the Tony Blair landslide in 1997 and narrowly escaped oblivion again in 2015 when the SNP swept to power in 56 of Scotland's 59 constituencies. The party's single MP hung on by only a few hundred votes. Now they're back. The Conservatives won 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in Scotland since 1983. The SNP are currently on 34 seats. Election results live updates Full UK results breakdown,external A tale of two Tory parties Sunderlandhas historically been the first place to count and declare its results. But this year it lost out to Newcastle in the battle to be first, trumping its neighbour. Newcastle Centralwas declared first at 23:01 BST, followed by Houghton and Sunderland South nine minutes later. Sunderland has been the fastest to declare for the past six elections. New Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill retained the party'sseat of Birmingham Edgbaston, becoming the UK's first female Sikh MP. The 44-year-old, who got a majority of 6,917, said her passion for politics was inspired by her late father and his close friend Lord King, who became the first Sikh peer in the UK. The seat of Birmingham Edgbaston has been continuously represented by women from both main parties since 1953. Preet Gill elected as first female Sikh MP Labour has done well in seats that voted to Remain in the EU. The Tories have seen an uptick in seats that voted strongly to Leave, but far less than Labour's gain. The swing to Labour in seats where Remain won over 55% in 2016 is averaging seven points, whereas there is a 1% swing to the Conservatives in seats where over 60% voted for Leave, according to Mr Curtice. The Labour leader might have had a belter of a night, but he needs to work on his high-fives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry appeared to get a slap across the chest when he overreached. Mrs May had an unusual opponent in herconstituency of MaidenheadLord Buckethead, who won 249 votes. It's not the first time he's tried to be an MP.  In 1987, Lord Buckethead stood against Margaret Thatcher in Finchley, winning 131 votes. And in 1992, he stood against then prime minister John Major. Lord Buckethead wasn't the only odd person the PM shared a stage with. Bobby ""Elmo"" Smith, pictured above, got three votes. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron also had an unusual opponent in hisWestmorland and Lonsdaleconstituency, Mr Fishfinger. Mr Fishfinger raised enough money to cover his Â£500 deposit through a crowdfunding page. He managed to win 309 votes. The battle forRichmond Park- between the Conservative's Zac Goldsmith and Lib Dem's Sarah Olney - came down to 45 votes after two recounts, with the  Conservatives winning with a majority of 45. But there was an even closer race in Scotland. The SNP held onto theFife North Eastseat by just two votes - 0.005% of the vote - following three recounts. Mr Farage resigned as UKIP party leader last July, but said he would have ""no choice"" but to return to frontline politics if Brexit was under threat. It wouldn't be the first time the former UKIP leader has done a U-turn. He resigned after failing to win a seat in 2015, but later decided he ""owed it to the party to stay"" on as leader. Arlene Foster's DUP made big gains, winning 10 seats The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) built its 2015 general election campaign around the idea that its MPs might be kingmakers at Westminster. But that's the position the 10 newly returned DUP MPs are now in given the hung parliament. Senior DUP figures have made clear their antipathy towards Jeremy Corbyn because of his historic links with Sinn FÃ©in but Theresa May - or whoever succeeds her - could be a plausible partner, as both parties are pro-Brexit and right of centre on many issues. It's too early to say whether they might consider a formal  coalition or a more informal ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, according to sources. The DUP website crashed on Friday morning after a surge of interest. DUP was also one of the most searched terms on Google. Could DUP be Westminster kingmakers? Mr Curtice's polling wisdom has attracted a bit of a cult following for years, but his social media fame reached a peak on election night. A Twitterpage,externalcalled, ""Is John Curtice on TV"", designed to monitor and celebrate Curtice's TV appearances, was started in April and has more than 8,000 followers. The cult of Curtice British politics has returned to a two-party system on the greatest scale since the 1970s. In 2015, UKIP achieved 12.6% of the popular vote, while the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats it contested. This year the vote share was Conservative 42%, Labour 40%, Lib Dem 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. The SNP remain the largest party in Scotland but the Conservatives have won 12 seats off them so far, Labour has won seven and the Lib Dems three. The count in the extremely wealthy central London constituency ofKensingtonwas suspended following a request for a third recount, because staff were too tired. The seat, which has been strongly Tory since its inception, finally went to Labour for the first time in its history. This video can not be played Mansfield has its Oscars moment Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire, had its own version of the Oscars' ""Envelopegate"" - after the returning officer announced the wrong winning candidate. The Conservatives tookMansfieldfor the first time, overturning 94 years of Labour rule. On Friday morning, it was down more than 2% against the dollar at $1.26800 - its biggest single day drop of the year. It was almost 2% lower against the euro at 1.13300 euros.

The deep diplomatic tensions behind the Qatar row,"Sometimes the recipe for a dispute says ""leave to simmer"". This one has been simmering for years. But then suddenly some of the cooks increase the heat substantially and dispute boils over into full-blown crisis. The underlying tensions between Qatar and three of her Gulf neighbours in particular have been visible for two decades. This is a region largely of absolute monarchs - kings or emirs - who have in common a very firm grip on politics at home, to head off any dissent which could represent a threat to their individual regime survival. But the emir of Qatar pursues a series of policies which simply don't fit into the rigid orthodoxy expected by most of the others, notably Saudi Arabia, the superpower of Sunni Islam. His unconventional foreign policy is seen as a threat to Sunni solidarity, particularly because the emir and his ministers promote dialogue and a search for good relations with the rival regional superpower, Shia Muslim Iran. Saudi Arabia is deeply hostile to that approach and now feels empowered to turn that hostility to action, in the certain knowledge that a new president, Donald Trump, is at Saudi King Salman's side. The Qatar-based Al-Jazeera network is at the centre of the row The core charge laid against Qatar as justification for this week's new and punitive blockade is the country's alleged funding of religious extremists, including the secret arming of some jihadi groups. Those are charges rejected by Qatar's government and similar ones have also been levelled in the past at many of those now condemning the country, notably Saudi Arabia. But the single most powerful motive behind the blockade may be a quite different one: the desire to rein in, or even to close down, one of the emir of Qatar's most cherished projects - the global television news channels of Al-Jazeera. Qatar diplomatic crisis: What you need to know Saudi and Egypt among countries to cut Doha links Qatar row: Economic impact threatens food, flights and football Trumplomacy: Should Trump be patting himself on the back over Qatar? He sees Al-Jazeera as an agent of positive change across the Arab world, opening up political debate, reporting on the challenges from ordinary people from the street, so evident during the ""Arab Spring"". However odd, even hypocritical it may seem for an absolute monarch in Qatar, a country devoid of elected politicians, to champion the cause of disaffected citizens demanding change elsewhere, that is a large part of what drives this emir, set on what he regards as a path of Middle East modernisation. His fellow autocrats see things quite differently, in Egypt as well as the Gulf. There, President Sisi drove the Muslim Brotherhood out of elected government and to near oblivion, branding them as intolerable Islamists. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani met Donald Trump in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in May 2017 Al-Jazeera was painted as a propagandist for the Brotherhood. That's a portrayal other leaders who have been challenged by the station are happy to endorse, leaving the broadcaster as now another substantial target of the action against Qatar. So, how will this crisis end? There's no sign of any real progress towards a settlement yet, rather the reverse. The rift seems to be both deeper and wider than it was at the start of the week. Deeper because the accusations being thrown about on both sides are becoming harsher. The United Arab Emirates is amplifying the charge that Qatar encourages extremism. Qatar, through its Human Rights Council, is saying Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE together are abusing the human rights of all those caught up in the programme of expulsions and flight bans, separating families for whom the borders between Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries have never been closed in this way before. Turkey has passed a law allowing for an accelerated deployment of its troops to Qatar And it is becoming a wider rift as more and more outside countries weigh in and take sides. Several member states of the Arab League have lined up behind the anti-Qatar campaign. Equally, both Turkey and Russia are consolidating their positions as friends to Qatar. Turkey passed a law in near record time this week which would allow an accelerated deployment of Turkish troops to Qatar: something already possible but on a longer timeframe. Russia has invited Qatar's embattled foreign minister for talks in Moscow which Qatar hopes to use to maximise support. Meanwhile, the emir of Kuwait, playing a customary role as peacemaker within the GCC, faces his toughest task yet, shuttling between the royal courts of Gulf capitals trying to find a way through which somehow curbs Qatar's sovereignty - the demand of others - and does not curb that sovereignty, the insistence of the emir who rules in Doha. There's no sign yet of any such progress being made. This feels like a crisis which will be maintained at high temperature for some time. That alarms much of the outside world, fearing even greater instability in the Middle East, and this time instability in the area they normally rely on for dependable, but certainly not democratic, calm.

May 'not resigning' after election losses,"This video can not be played Theresa May says the UK needs a period of stability The UK has woken up to a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party, after the general election produced no overall winner.

An overall majority requires 326 seats. The BBC understands the PM will try to form a government, but Jeremy Corbyn also says he is ""ready to serve"". The prime minister said the country needed ""stability"" after the inconclusive election result and the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May intended to try and govern on the basis that her party had won the largest number of votes and seats. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance What happens if no-one wins the election? Full UK results breakdown,external There has been speculation she may seek some kind of informal arrangement with the Democratic Unionists, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland, which could see it support the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she expects ""some contact"" with the Tories over the coming days but she also told the BBC she believes Mrs May will find it ""difficult to survive"". After a better-than-expected night for Mr Corbyn, Labour is set to pick up 29 seats. The Tories are on course to lose 13 seats. The SNP are down by 22, losing seats to the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems, in a major setback for Nicola Sturgeon. Turnout so far is 68.7% - up 2% up on 2015 - but it has been a return to two-party politics in many parts of the country, with Labour and the Conservatives both piling up votes in numbers not seen since the 1990s and both set to top 40% of the vote. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party This video can not be played The Tories haven't won an overall majority UKIP's vote slumped dramatically but rather than moving en masse to the Tories, as they had expected, their voters also switched to Labour. Mr Corbyn, speaking after being re-elected in Islington North, said it was time for Mrs May to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He later told the BBC it was it was ""pretty clear who has won this election"". ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said - but he also stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Corbyn: Theresa May should go UKIP: May put Brexit 'in jeopardy' The biggest political upsets of the night Scotland: A tale of two Tory parties Wales: Labour hails 'fantastic' result The Conservatives have said in the event of a hung Parliament, Mrs May would get the opportunity to form a government first, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2010 when there was also no clear winner but the party had comfortably more seats than their nearest rival. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party; as I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister, Anna Soubry, has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me ""I can't see how she can stay"". A minister texts to say the Tory party is ""absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in"". One Tory source says it is ""50:50"" that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. Read Laura's full blog Lord O'Donnell, formerly the UK's top civil servant, told the BBC that the prime minister had a duty to stay in post ""for now"" and had the right to seek the confidence of the House of Commons by asking it to approve a Queen's Speech, scheduled for 19 June. He added that he would be advising her to seek an audience with The Queen later on Friday to explain her intentions over the coming days. However, Labour has said it is ready to try and form a minority government of its own, while there is also a chance that the UK could be facing a fresh election later this summer. Could the DUP be kingmakers? Analysis: What this means for Brexit Did the youth vote cause a hung Parliament? How the world reacted Questions are also being asked about the potential impact on the upcoming Brexit negotiations which are due to start on 19 June. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has hinted that this could now be delayed,tweeting that,externalthe talks should begin only when the UK is ""ready"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign Although one party needs to get 326 seats to get an overall majority, in practice the Conservatives would be expected to be able to get a Queen's Speech through with 318 MPs, if they had the backing of the DUP MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who is against Brexit, said it had been a ""dreadful campaign"" and Mrs May should ""now consider her position"". But her Brexit-supporting colleague Steve Baker said it was essential the party supported Mrs May to ""provide all the stability we can"". The Conservatives are forecast to win 42% of the vote, Labour 40%, the Lib Dems 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. Speaking at her count in Maidenhead, Theresa May said the full picture had yet to emerge, but added: ""At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability. ""And if... the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us to ensure we have that period of stability - and that is exactly what we will do.""

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed"" to have lost a number of seats but claimed her party had still ""won the election in Scotland"". She said she would like the SNP to ""play a part in a progressive alternative to a Tory government"" but would wait to see the final results. The Green Party are unchanged with one seat and Plaid Cymru still have three MPs, while the Lib Dems are on course to gain five.

Job centre hostages released by knifeman,"Officers were on the scene within nine minutes Staff at a Jobcentre in Newcastle were released unharmed after being held by a man armed with a knife who was wearing a fake explosive device. The 28-year-old entered the Clifford Street building at about 08:00 BST and held several members of staff hostage. He surrendered to armed officers at 11:15 and was arrested for threats to kill. He remains in custody. Northumbria Police said they had ""very real concerns"" the man could have caused serious harm. The force said officers responded within nine minutes. They quickly shut down roads, closed the nearby Byker Metro Station, evacuated nearby buildings including the student accommodation and began negotiating with the suspect. A spokesman said the incident was not terror-related and the man was known to Jobcentre staff. An explosive device reportedly strapped to the man's chest was later found to be fake. Bomb disposal experts swept the building and searches of the building and of other properties in the area were carried out. This video can not be played The suspect was led away from the scene in his underwear by police Officers said it had been suggested on social media and by members of the public at the scene that some people had been stabbed, but the force said that was ""not the case"". At about 10:20 police tweeted the hostages had been released and later confirmed the staff had been freed at about 08:30, half an hour after the incident began. Assistant Ch Con Darren Best said: ""In recent weeks we have heard many positive stories about the police and how quickly they have responded to some of the atrocities we have witnessed in London and Manchester.

Germany fears huge losses in massive tax scandal,"The practices involved fiendishly complex transactions It is reckoned to be the biggest tax scandal in German post-war history. An international group of bankers, lawyers and stockbrokers - reportedly with links to the City of London - appears to have fiddled the tax system, employing practices which were at best unethical, at worst illegal. Ultimately they may have deprived the state of nearly â¬32bn (Â£28bn; $36bn). As the German broadcaster ARD wryly noted, that would have paid for repairs to a lot of schools and bridges. The newspaper Die Zeit adds that the sum would more than cover the cost of the refugee influx for a year. Prosecutors have been investigating for some time. And gradually it is emerging that large-scale tax avoidance was taking place right under the noses of the authorities. And that - in some cases - they turned a blind eye to practices employed, not just by individuals out to make a fortune, but by some of the country's biggest banks and respected businesses. We may never really know the full extent of those practices; largely because they involved fiendishly complex transactions, which German media broadly divide into two kinds. In the first type, German banks and stockbrokers bought and sold shares for foreign investors in a way which allowed them to claim a tax refund for which they were not eligible. Many question the legality of the practice. Panama was in the spotlight last year when systematic offshore tax-dodging was revealed In the second (a more complicated variation), investors and banks bought and sold shares just before and just after dividends were paid. With a bit of imaginative paperwork, and by exploiting a procedure which allows more than one person or institution to simultaneously own a share, they were able to claim numerous tax refunds. The practice was outlawed in 2012. German prosecutors are investigating a number of banks - among them institutions which were bailed out by the state - and individuals. But in the meantime, a group of German journalists has been researching too, working alongside an expert from the University of Mannheim. Five EU nations launch tax crackdown How assets are hidden and taxes dodged Panama leaks spur global investigations Their investigations, broadcast on Thursday night, reveal that, despite a warning from State Commissioner August SchÃ¤fer in 1992 and the testimony of five whistleblowers, the practices continued and were widespread. They involved 40 German banks and scores of other financial institutions around the world. And, as those German reporters reveal, in the end it wasn't a national authority, a finance minister or the justice system who finally exposed the practice. It was a young administrative assistant in Germany's central tax office, who noticed that she was receiving claims for huge tax rebates from a single US pension fund. Anna Schablonski (a pseudonym) dug further and, despite threats, began to uncover other cases. She is modest about her role - even though 30 colleagues are now dedicated to trying to recover some of the money, and prosecutors are building their cases against some of those involved. She does not want to be cast as a hero, she says. She was just doing her job.

Pound falls sharply but UK shares rise,"The likelihood of a minority Conservative government could stave off a further fall in sterling when trading begins on Monday, according to analysts. Prime Minister Theresa May is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to support her administration. The Tories lost their Commons majority in Thursday's general election. Sterling closed on Friday1.6% lower against the dollar at $1.2743and fell 1.4%against the euroto 1.1382 euros. Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said: ""You may well see the pound bounce on the optimism ... but it will be short-lived."" David Madden of CMC Markets said Mrs May staying on as prime minister with help from the DUP may assist sterling ""a little"". Calls mount for rethink of Brexit stance The pound's fall against both the dollar and euro was less dramatic than the drop in the wake of the EU referendum in June last year. The chances of Mrs May securing a ""hard"" Brexit have diminished following the loss of the Conservatives' Commons majority, according to some commentators. George Osborne, the former chancellor, told the BBC he did not believe that most MPs now backed a ""hard"" Brexit"" following the election result. Panmure Gordon market commentator David Buik said the hung parliament would ""require an immediate response to settle for a much softer Brexit"". Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, who is returning to the Commons after regaining Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats, said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". The DUP campaigned for Brexit, but wants a common travel area between the UK and Ireland and no hard border with the Republic - the UK's only land border with the EU.

SNP lose 21 seats amid Tory surge,"Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and Scottish first minister, was defeated in Gordon Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were among the high-profile casualties as the SNP lost more than a third of its seats in the general election. The party won 35 of the 59 Scottish constituencies - a fall of 21 seats from the 56 they won in 2015. The Conservatives secured 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in the country since 1983. Labour won seven seats and the Lib Dems four. The three pro-UK parties had won just one seat each in 2015. The Tories saw big increases in their vote across the country, with the SNP vote dropping sharply.

May under pressure after election losses Kuenssberg: Can Theresa May stay as PM? Deputy First Minister John Swinney admitted that the issue of a second referendum on Scottish independence had played a ""significant"" role in the result. The SNP MSP told the BBC: ""We will take time and care to reflect on the outcome of this result. ""But we have to acknowledge that the question of a second independence was a significant motivator of votes against the SNP in this election, and we have to be attentive to that point."" The SNP won 36.9% of the votes, a drop of 13.1 percentage points since 2015. The Scottish Tories doubled their share of the vote to 28.6%, with Labour up by 2.8 points at 27.1% and the Lib Dems down slightly to 6.8%. The SNP's former leader Alex Salmond saw his majority crumble in Gordon, where Tory Colin Clark took the seat with 21,861 votes.

He added: ""The SNP have lost many fine parliamentarians this evening and that's a grievous blow to the SNP. ""But overall the result in Scotland shows the SNP will have won a majority of the seats in this country and the majority of the vote, something which I suspect the prime minister would like to be able to claim in the early hours of this morning but is not able to do so."" Douglas Ross of the Tories overturned a majority of 9,065 to defeat the SNP's leader at Westminster Angus Robertson by 4,200 votes in Moray. This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'SNP have won the election in Scotland' The SNP's Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh also lost Ochil and South Perthshire to the Tories, who were a distant third in 2015. John Nicolson of the SNP lost Dunbartonshire East to Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, who also saw Alistair Carmichael hold his Orkney and Shetland seat. The final Scottish seat to declare was Fife North East, where there were three recounts before Stephen Gethins of the SNP was declared the winner after finishing justtwo votes ahead of the Lib Dem candidate. The results mean that the SNP has lost its Westminster leader, chief whip, foreign affairs spokesman and international trade spokeswoman. Mr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSP But the picture is less positive for the Conservatives across the UK, with the partylosing its majority at Westminsterand the prime minister facing calls for her resignation. Speaking as she arrived at the Glasgow count, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the SNP had won the election in Scotland, with the party achieving its second best performance ever in a Westminster election. Asked about the impact of the lost SNP seats on her desire to hold a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Like most politicians I have not had any sleep and I am not going to take any rash decisions. ""Clearly I have to reflect on the result of the election and I will take time to do that. But it would be the wrong thing for me to do at this hour to take decisions before having had the opportunity to properly think about it. ""But properly think about it I will certainly do"". Ruth Davidson said the prospect of a second independence referendum was now ""dead"" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson hailed a ""historic"" night for her party, which she said was largely due to Ms Sturgeon's attempts to ""ram-raid through"" a second independence referendum. She added: ""I think we have seen the country's reaction in the number of SNP seat's falling. Indyref2 is dead."" ""Now it's time to get back to what matters to the people of Scotland - that's sorting out our schools, growing our economy and looking at our public services."" And Labour's Ian Murray, whoincreased his majority in Edinburgh to more than 15,000, said voters had ""hammered the final nail into the independence coffin"". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale celebrated her party's improved performance with Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray The Tories have seen their vote surge across the country as they took several seats from the SNP There was better news for the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, where Mhairi Black kept her seat despite a big drop in her share of the vote. Ms Black, the youngest MP at Westminster in the last parliament, had her majority over Labour cut from about 6,000 to about 2,500. Elsewhere, Stewart Hosie held Dundee East - which had been the safest seat in Scotland - for the SNP, while Angus MacNeil held on in the Western Isles, despite his share of the vote falling by nearly 14%. Pete Wishart also held on for the SNP in Perth and Perthshire North after finishing just 21 votes ahead of the Tory candidate, while Tommy Sheppard held Edinburgh East. An exit poll had predicted that the SNP would lose 22 of the 56 seats it won in the last election in 2015. The poll, which was taken at polling stations across the UK, also suggested the Conservatives would fall short of an overall majority at Westminster. SNP politicians had cast doubt on the exit poll result when it was first published - with many insisting the party would not lose as many as 22 seats. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

The SNP MSP told the BBC: ""We will take time and care to reflect on the outcome of this result. ""But we have to acknowledge that the question of a second independence was a significant motivator of votes against the SNP in this election, and we have to be attentive to that point."" The SNP won 36.9% of the votes, a drop of 13.1 percentage points since 2015. The Scottish Tories doubled their share of the vote to 28.6%, with Labour up by 2.8 points at 27.1% and the Lib Dems down slightly to 6.8%. The SNP's former leader Alex Salmond saw his majority crumble in Gordon, where Tory Colin Clark took the seat with 21,861 votes. This video can not be played The winners and losers in Scotland Despite his defeat, Mr Salmond insisted that people have ""not seen the last of my bonnets and me"". He added: ""The SNP have lost many fine parliamentarians this evening and that's a grievous blow to the SNP. ""But overall the result in Scotland shows the SNP will have won a majority of the seats in this country and the majority of the vote, something which I suspect the prime minister would like to be able to claim in the early hours of this morning but is not able to do so."" Douglas Ross of the Tories overturned a majority of 9,065 to defeat the SNP's leader at Westminster Angus Robertson by 4,200 votes in Moray. This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'SNP have won the election in Scotland' The SNP's Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh also lost Ochil and South Perthshire to the Tories, who were a distant third in 2015. John Nicolson of the SNP lost Dunbartonshire East to Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, who also saw Alistair Carmichael hold his Orkney and Shetland seat. The final Scottish seat to declare was Fife North East, where there were three recounts before Stephen Gethins of the SNP was declared the winner after finishing justtwo votes ahead of the Lib Dem candidate. The results mean that the SNP has lost its Westminster leader, chief whip, foreign affairs spokesman and international trade spokeswoman. Mr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSP But the picture is less positive for the Conservatives across the UK, with the partylosing its majority at Westminsterand the prime minister facing calls for her resignation. Speaking as she arrived at the Glasgow count, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the SNP had won the election in Scotland, with the party achieving its second best performance ever in a Westminster election. Asked about the impact of the lost SNP seats on her desire to hold a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Like most politicians I have not had any sleep and I am not going to take any rash decisions. ""Clearly I have to reflect on the result of the election and I will take time to do that. But it would be the wrong thing for me to do at this hour to take decisions before having had the opportunity to properly think about it. ""But properly think about it I will certainly do"". Ruth Davidson said the prospect of a second independence referendum was now ""dead"" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson hailed a ""historic"" night for her party, which she said was largely due to Ms Sturgeon's attempts to ""ram-raid through"" a second independence referendum. She added: ""I think we have seen the country's reaction in the number of SNP seat's falling. Indyref2 is dead."" ""Now it's time to get back to what matters to the people of Scotland - that's sorting out our schools, growing our economy and looking at our public services."" And Labour's Ian Murray, whoincreased his majority in Edinburgh to more than 15,000, said voters had ""hammered the final nail into the independence coffin"". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale celebrated her party's improved performance with Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray The Tories have seen their vote surge across the country as they took several seats from the SNP There was better news for the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, where Mhairi Black kept her seat despite a big drop in her share of the vote. Ms Black, the youngest MP at Westminster in the last parliament, had her majority over Labour cut from about 6,000 to about 2,500. Elsewhere, Stewart Hosie held Dundee East - which had been the safest seat in Scotland - for the SNP, while Angus MacNeil held on in the Western Isles, despite his share of the vote falling by nearly 14%. Pete Wishart also held on for the SNP in Perth and Perthshire North after finishing just 21 votes ahead of the Tory candidate, while Tommy Sheppard held Edinburgh East. An exit poll had predicted that the SNP would lose 22 of the 56 seats it won in the last election in 2015. The poll, which was taken at polling stations across the UK, also suggested the Conservatives would fall short of an overall majority at Westminster. SNP politicians had cast doubt on the exit poll result when it was first published - with many insisting the party would not lose as many as 22 seats. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

Eleven things you may have missed from election night,"It's difficult to catch everything during an election night whirlwind of facts, stats and spin. Beyond the immediate headlines, here are 20 things you may have missed. This video can not be played The moment Nick Clegg lost his seat The SNP has suffered some of the night's biggest losses. Former leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland's first minister between 2007 and 2014, lost hisGordon seatto the Scottish Conservatives. The SNP leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, also lost hisMoray seatto the Tories. Former Lib Dem Leader and deputy PM Nick Clegg also suffered a fall from grace. He looked visibly upset when he lost hisSheffield Hallam seat- which he had held for 12 years - to Labour. But his departure didn't seem to shock everyone. ""Who is Nick Clegg?"" was one of the top trending questions on Google overnight. Turnout is the highest since 1997. It's up by 2% to 69%. It looks like Labour has been successful in persuading young voters to turn out and vote for the party. There has been a greater swing to Labour in seats with a higher population of 18 to 24-year-olds, according to professor of politics John Curtice. Turnout has also increased more in seats with young people - and Labour's vote seems to have advanced most in constituencies where the turnout increased most. A record number of female MPs have been elected. There will be208 women in this Parliament,outnumbering the 196 women elected in 2015. About 30% of candidates were women this year - up from the previous record of 26% in 2015. However  the actual number of women standing was down from 1,036 to 983. Record number of female MPs Mrs May may have had a terrible night, but the Scottish Conservative leader has arguably achieved one of the biggest success stories of recent UK political history. The  Scottish Tories were wiped out by the Tony Blair landslide in 1997 and narrowly escaped oblivion again in 2015 when the SNP swept to power in 56 of Scotland's 59 constituencies. The party's single MP hung on by only a few hundred votes. Now they're back. The Conservatives won 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in Scotland since 1983. The SNP are currently on 34 seats. Election results live updates Full UK results breakdown,external A tale of two Tory parties Sunderlandhas historically been the first place to count and declare its results. But this year it lost out to Newcastle in the battle to be first, trumping its neighbour. Newcastle Centralwas declared first at 23:01 BST, followed by Houghton and Sunderland South nine minutes later. Sunderland has been the fastest to declare for the past six elections. New Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill retained the party'sseat of Birmingham Edgbaston, becoming the UK's first female Sikh MP. The 44-year-old, who got a majority of 6,917, said her passion for politics was inspired by her late father and his close friend Lord King, who became the first Sikh peer in the UK. The seat of Birmingham Edgbaston has been continuously represented by women from both main parties since 1953. Preet Gill elected as first female Sikh MP Labour has done well in seats that voted to Remain in the EU. The Tories have seen an uptick in seats that voted strongly to Leave, but far less than Labour's gain. The swing to Labour in seats where Remain won over 55% in 2016 is averaging seven points, whereas there is a 1% swing to the Conservatives in seats where over 60% voted for Leave, according to Mr Curtice. The Labour leader might have had a belter of a night, but he needs to work on his high-fives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry appeared to get a slap across the chest when he overreached. Mrs May had an unusual opponent in herconstituency of MaidenheadLord Buckethead, who won 249 votes. It's not the first time he's tried to be an MP.  In 1987, Lord Buckethead stood against Margaret Thatcher in Finchley, winning 131 votes. And in 1992, he stood against then prime minister John Major. Lord Buckethead wasn't the only odd person the PM shared a stage with. Bobby ""Elmo"" Smith, pictured above, got three votes. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron also had an unusual opponent in hisWestmorland and Lonsdaleconstituency, Mr Fishfinger. Mr Fishfinger raised enough money to cover his Â£500 deposit through a crowdfunding page. He managed to win 309 votes. The battle forRichmond Park- between the Conservative's Zac Goldsmith and Lib Dem's Sarah Olney - came down to 45 votes after two recounts, with the  Conservatives winning with a majority of 45. But there was an even closer race in Scotland. The SNP held onto theFife North Eastseat by just two votes - 0.005% of the vote - following three recounts. Mr Farage resigned as UKIP party leader last July, but said he would have ""no choice"" but to return to frontline politics if Brexit was under threat. It wouldn't be the first time the former UKIP leader has done a U-turn. He resigned after failing to win a seat in 2015, but later decided he ""owed it to the party to stay"" on as leader. Arlene Foster's DUP made big gains, winning 10 seats The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) built its 2015 general election campaign around the idea that its MPs might be kingmakers at Westminster. But that's the position the 10 newly returned DUP MPs are now in given the hung parliament. Senior DUP figures have made clear their antipathy towards Jeremy Corbyn because of his historic links with Sinn FÃ©in but Theresa May - or whoever succeeds her - could be a plausible partner, as both parties are pro-Brexit and right of centre on many issues. It's too early to say whether they might consider a formal  coalition or a more informal ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, according to sources. The DUP website crashed on Friday morning after a surge of interest. DUP was also one of the most searched terms on Google. Could DUP be Westminster kingmakers? Mr Curtice's polling wisdom has attracted a bit of a cult following for years, but his social media fame reached a peak on election night. A Twitterpage,externalcalled, ""Is John Curtice on TV"", designed to monitor and celebrate Curtice's TV appearances, was started in April and has more than 8,000 followers. The cult of Curtice British politics has returned to a two-party system on the greatest scale since the 1970s. In 2015, UKIP achieved 12.6% of the popular vote, while the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats it contested. This year the vote share was Conservative 42%, Labour 40%, Lib Dem 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. The SNP remain the largest party in Scotland but the Conservatives have won 12 seats off them so far, Labour has won seven and the Lib Dems three. The count in the extremely wealthy central London constituency ofKensingtonwas suspended following a request for a third recount, because staff were too tired. The seat, which has been strongly Tory since its inception, finally went to Labour for the first time in its history.

The seats still to watch out for,"The UK is to have a hung parliament after the Conservatives failed to win an overall majority in the general election. The Conservatives ended the night with 318 seats, Labour with 262, the SNP with 35 and the Lib Dems with 14. Parties require 326 seats to command a majority. Prime Minister Theresa May's party may now have to depend on Northern Irish Unionist support to maintain its position in office.

Enter a postcode or seat name  Election results live updates Full UK results breakdown,external Analysis for this page is carried out by professor of politics John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, and his team. The BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll is conducted by asking a random sample of voters at 144 polling locations scattered around the country to complete in private a mock ballot paper to indicate how they just voted. Nearly all the locations are ones in which the 2015 exit poll was also conducted. The share of the vote recorded for each party at each polling location this time around is compared with the share obtained in the 2015 exit poll in order to derive 144 estimates of change in support for each party. These estimated changes in vote share are then statistically modelled to (i) ascertain any systematic geographical variation in the estimated changes in vote shares, and (ii) derive estimated vote shares for every party in every constituency in Great Britain. From the latter, the probability as to which party will win each seat is derived. For each party the exit poll forecast of seats won is the sum of these probabilities of winning across all constituencies. Once declarations begin, forecasts are then based on a combination of exit poll and real results.

Pound falls further in choppy trading,"The likelihood of a minority Conservative government could stave off a further fall in sterling when trading begins on Monday, according to analysts. Prime Minister Theresa May is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to support her administration. The Tories lost their Commons majority in Thursday's general election. Sterling closed on Friday1.6% lower against the dollar at $1.2743and fell 1.4%against the euroto 1.1382 euros. Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said: ""You may well see the pound bounce on the optimism ... but it will be short-lived."" David Madden of CMC Markets said Mrs May staying on as prime minister with help from the DUP may assist sterling ""a little"". Calls mount for rethink of Brexit stance The pound's fall against both the dollar and euro was less dramatic than the drop in the wake of the EU referendum in June last year. The chances of Mrs May securing a ""hard"" Brexit have diminished following the loss of the Conservatives' Commons majority, according to some commentators. George Osborne, the former chancellor, told the BBC he did not believe that most MPs now backed a ""hard"" Brexit"" following the election result. Panmure Gordon market commentator David Buik said the hung parliament would ""require an immediate response to settle for a much softer Brexit"". Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, who is returning to the Commons after regaining Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats, said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". The DUP campaigned for Brexit, but wants a common travel area between the UK and Ireland and no hard border with the Republic - the UK's only land border with the EU.

May under pressure after election losses,"This video can not be played Theresa May says the UK needs a period of stability The UK has woken up to a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party, after the general election produced no overall winner. With nearly all results in, Theresa May faces ending up with 12 fewer seats than when she called the election. The Tories are set to get 319, Labour 261, the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems 12. An overall majority requires 326 seats. The BBC understands the PM will try to form a government, but Jeremy Corbyn also says he is ""ready to serve"". The prime minister said the country needed ""stability"" after the inconclusive election result and the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May intended to try and govern on the basis that her party had won the largest number of votes and seats. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance What happens if no-one wins the election? Full UK results breakdown,external There has been speculation she may seek some kind of informal arrangement with the Democratic Unionists, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland, which could see it support the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she expects ""some contact"" with the Tories over the coming days but she also told the BBC she believes Mrs May will find it ""difficult to survive"". After a better-than-expected night for Mr Corbyn, Labour is set to pick up 29 seats. The Tories are on course to lose 13 seats. The SNP are down by 22, losing seats to the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems, in a major setback for Nicola Sturgeon. Turnout so far is 68.7% - up 2% up on 2015 - but it has been a return to two-party politics in many parts of the country, with Labour and the Conservatives both piling up votes in numbers not seen since the 1990s and both set to top 40% of the vote.

Mr Corbyn, speaking after being re-elected in Islington North, said it was time for Mrs May to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He later told the BBC it was it was ""pretty clear who has won this election"". ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said - but he also stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Corbyn: Theresa May should go UKIP: May put Brexit 'in jeopardy' The biggest political upsets of the night Scotland: A tale of two Tory parties Wales: Labour hails 'fantastic' result The Conservatives have said in the event of a hung Parliament, Mrs May would get the opportunity to form a government first, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2010 when there was also no clear winner but the party had comfortably more seats than their nearest rival. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party; as I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister, Anna Soubry, has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me ""I can't see how she can stay"". A minister texts to say the Tory party is ""absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in"". One Tory source says it is ""50:50"" that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. Read Laura's full blog Lord O'Donnell, formerly the UK's top civil servant, told the BBC that the prime minister had a duty to stay in post ""for now"" and had the right to seek the confidence of the House of Commons by asking it to approve a Queen's Speech, scheduled for 19 June. He added that he would be advising her to seek an audience with The Queen later on Friday to explain her intentions over the coming days. However, Labour has said it is ready to try and form a minority government of its own, while there is also a chance that the UK could be facing a fresh election later this summer. Could the DUP be kingmakers? Analysis: What this means for Brexit Did the youth vote cause a hung Parliament? How the world reacted Questions are also being asked about the potential impact on the upcoming Brexit negotiations which are due to start on 19 June. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has hinted that this could now be delayed,tweeting that,externalthe talks should begin only when the UK is ""ready"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign Although one party needs to get 326 seats to get an overall majority, in practice the Conservatives would be expected to be able to get a Queen's Speech through with 318 MPs, if they had the backing of the DUP MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who is against Brexit, said it had been a ""dreadful campaign"" and Mrs May should ""now consider her position"". But her Brexit-supporting colleague Steve Baker said it was essential the party supported Mrs May to ""provide all the stability we can"". The Conservatives are forecast to win 42% of the vote, Labour 40%, the Lib Dems 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. Speaking at her count in Maidenhead, Theresa May said the full picture had yet to emerge, but added: ""At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability. ""And if... the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us to ensure we have that period of stability - and that is exactly what we will do.""

Len McCluskey, leader of the UK's biggest union Unite, said Labour could put together a minority government as Mrs May ""can't go on for another five years"". ""So my message is that Labour now has to prepare for government,"" he added. ""And they do that by the Parliamentary Labour Party coming back together and being united and making certain that the policies are developed and spread out and propagated in a way that will be attract more and more people to us."" Mr Corbyn has been praised for his ""sure footed"" election campaign which saw Labour gain 29 more seats than in the 2015 election Earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell also suggested Labour could form a minority government. He told BBC News: ""We have laid the foundations for a minority government, and then eventually a majority government."" He said a Labour government would be formed ""not through deals or coalitions but policy by policy"". Former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson described the election result was a political ""earthquake"". He acknowledged Mr Corbyn, whose leadership he had previously criticised, had been ""very sure footed"" in the campaign. But he said if Labour was to come first and not ""a good second"" next time, the leader had to be much more ""ecumenical"" in his approach. Full UK results breakdown,external Find the result where you live,external Labour took seats from the Conservatives, including Battersea and Canterbury, and unseated former Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam. The party also made gains in Scotland, which included regaining ex-PM Gordon Brown's former seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Speaking following his re-election as the MP for Islington North, Mr Corbyn said: ""The prime minister called this election because she wanted a mandate. ""Well the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence. ""I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country."" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry described Labour's election result as a ""extraordinary performance"" which ""shows what we can do when we unite"". Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the count in his Islington North constituency, which he won with more than 40,000 votes SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon spoke during the election campaign of a desire to form a ""progressive alternative"" to the Tories and supporting Labour on a ""case by case"" basis if the numbers added up. However, Mr Corbyn ruled out a formal deal with the SNP. Responding to the exit poll, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""Any Green MPs elected tonight will do all they can to keep the Tories from Number 10, and back a Labour-led government on a case by case basis."" The Liberal Democrat press office tweeted: ""We are getting a lot of calls so just to be clear: No coalition. No deals."" Jeremy Corbyn has been mobbed by supporters at a series of campaign rallies In the 2015 general election, Labour won 232 seats under former leader Ed Miliband, down from the 258 seats secured in 2010. It went into the 2017 election with 229 seats. When Prime Minister Theresa May announced the election in April, her Conservative Party had a big double-digit lead in many polls and hoped for a landslide victory. But the campaign saw the Tories' poll lead narrowing. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson called Mrs May ""a damaged prime minister whose reputation may never recover"". Mr Watson said he thought Mr Corbyn's leadership of Labour was safe. ""It would be very foolish for anyone to want to stand down in the Labour Party tonight after this result."" But he added: ""I can see Boris Johnson sharpening the knives for Theresa May after this result."" The leader of the Unite Union, Len McCluskey, said the election result was ""an incredible advance"" and it wouldn't be long before there was a Labour government. He said that Labour's performance reflected that ""there is a desperate wish out there for an alternative"". ""We've had austerity rammed down our throats, it's brought about inequality, it's brought about the type of society that nobody wants - a low pay, race to the bottom society.

Can Theresa May stay as PM?,"Theresa May and husband Philip arrive at Conservative HQ What a day. This time last night, the two main parties were pouring cold water all over the exit poll that put Theresa May's future in doubt. Tonight that question is very much on Tory minds. She said today that she wants to stay and is in the process of working out how to deal more closely with the DUP (not without controversy) to get her business through Parliament. Yet, there is an increasing mood that she might not get the chance to do so for very long. One minister predicted that, ""slowly and reluctantly"", the party might rally round her. But sentiment in the party, never scientific, seems to be drifting away from allowing that situation to happen. Three MPs have publicly questioned her right to stay on. One senior Conservative told me tonight she ""has to go"", suggesting she has a ""responsibility to the party"" to get the Queens Speech through, show the Conservatives can form the government, and then she ought to move aside. Full UK election results breakdown,external Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Other MPs are gently exploring the possibility of submitting letters to the chairman of the 1922 committee - 48 would be required to trigger a leadership contest. Another former minister told me: ""I just can't see how she stays."" To stay, there are already demands that Theresa May changes her ways of working. Her loyal chiefs of staff could be forced to go and a deputy prime minister might be appointed to create a less brittle and vulnerable government. But moves from her might not be enough. Her gamble may not ultimately have just cost the Tories their majority, but for her, her political career. This situation is changing fast and could feel totally different by the morning. But the rallying round the prime minister that has given her the chance to form a government may turn out to be only a brief window of opportunity - a space to allow her the time to come to her own conclusions. She stays, for today. After a few hours of wild uncertainty, Theresa May will head to Buckingham Palace to seek permission from the Queen to form a government. She has the understanding and assurance from the DUP to be able to form a government, it seems. The PM has experienced a political disaster of her own making. But uniquely perhaps for a prime minister in this situation she is, despite her ruthless party's DNA, planning to stay. The reason? Brexiteers don't want to rock the boat. No-one wants another election. And there is paranoia, whatever the EU says publicly, that Brussels would use the opportunity to cause the maximum amount of trouble. The way it's hoped at top levels of the party to avoid that is to leave 'the boss' as they call her, in place. But only for now. I am yet to talk to a Tory source today who believes she can stay for as long as she likes. She is being seen as a caretaker PM, here for continuity at a time of great volatility - strangely the sort of reasons cited when she was nominated for the leadership. That was of course, before Theresa May revealed herself to be a gambler too. A trait only revealed once she moved into Number 10 - a trait that might be her political undoing, even if she keeps the address for now. In the last few minutes the PM has made it plain she will try to stay on and form a government. That's her right to do so, and as the party with the largest number of seats and votes the Tories will almost definitely form the next government. But there is already pressure on her to go. The question is not just whether enough Tory MPs are happy to keep backing her but also if it is vaguely realistic for her to stay on with her authority so challenged. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party. As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me 'I can't see how she can stay'. A minister texts to say the Tory party is 'absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in'. One Tory source says it is '50:50' that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. It's clear the Tory party won't allow her to stay on to fight another General Election campaign in some years hence. But cooler heads may press on her to stay, not to walk away. This is the election none of the main parties predicted. Just as David Cameron finished off his own career by gambling with the EU referendum he didn't have to have, Theresa May has followed him by calling a national vote when it was not required, because of our relationship with the European Union, and ended her career in the same way. It's only just after two am. There are lots of seats to come in. But at this stage, Tory ministers are saying they do not expect to outperform the exit poll. That means, despite all of those Tory expectations, that confidence they regained in the last week or so of the campaign, the disbelief there was when our exit poll was announced, that privately at the highest level the Conservatives are now beginning to give up on achieving a majority. It's just not clear yet whether or not they will be the largest party. Our exit poll suggests that they will. But either way, Theresa May is damaged, ""strong and stable"" sounds less like an irritating political catchphrase, and more like a parallel universe. She called this election only because she thought she would achieve a much bigger majority than the Tories already had. Even if the Conservatives still end up ahead in terms of the number of seats, her authority looks set to be seriously damaged. It is hard to see how her reputation will recover, and she will have achieved the opposite effect of what she had hoped. This election could produce a more uncertain political picture, a wounded Prime Minister trying to take on the most complicated task any Prime Minister has faced -  that's if, of course, the Tories remain the largest party, and she hangs on. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg: Theresa May has played a high risk political game If these numbers are correct, Theresa May played a high-risk political game and has lost it  - she didn't have to call this election, and only did so in order to give herself a mandate and breathing space during the bumpy ride of Brexit. Just a few weeks ago at the start of all of this she seemed unassailable, but a shaky campaign and an insurgent Labour Party may have dashed the Tories' hopes. This exit poll result is not what either parties were predicting privately - this would be another political surprise - the public again defying the expectations of both the main sides. The Conservatives do look set to be the largest party - it's not clear on these numbers if they will be able to govern alone. Theresa May's promise throughout was to offer her catchphrase ""strong and stable leadership"" - instead she may end diminished - but only of course, your votes, and the real results, will determine through the course of the night what really happens next.

Pound and shares set for volatile trading,"The likelihood of a minority Conservative government could stave off a further fall in sterling when trading begins on Monday, according to analysts. Prime Minister Theresa May is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to support her administration. The Tories lost their Commons majority in Thursday's general election. Sterling closed on Friday1.6% lower against the dollar at $1.2743and fell 1.4%against the euroto 1.1382 euros. Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said: ""You may well see the pound bounce on the optimism ... but it will be short-lived."" David Madden of CMC Markets said Mrs May staying on as prime minister with help from the DUP may assist sterling ""a little"". Calls mount for rethink of Brexit stance The pound's fall against both the dollar and euro was less dramatic than the drop in the wake of the EU referendum in June last year. The chances of Mrs May securing a ""hard"" Brexit have diminished following the loss of the Conservatives' Commons majority, according to some commentators. George Osborne, the former chancellor, told the BBC he did not believe that most MPs now backed a ""hard"" Brexit"" following the election result. Panmure Gordon market commentator David Buik said the hung parliament would ""require an immediate response to settle for a much softer Brexit"". Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, who is returning to the Commons after regaining Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats, said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". The DUP campaigned for Brexit, but wants a common travel area between the UK and Ireland and no hard border with the Republic - the UK's only land border with the EU.

Election 2017: SNP win 35 seats - down 21,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon concedes indyref2 a factor in the election The SNP ends the night with 35 seats, the Tories have 13, Labour 7 and the Lib Dems 4 Former SNP leader Alex Salmond and the SNP's Deputy leader Angus Robertson lose their seats to the Conservatives Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson says the result shows indyref2 ""is dead"" Election ends in hung Parliament: Conservatives set for 319 seats, Labour 261 Tories to form UK government with DUP to 'provide certainty' and keep country 'safe' BBC Scotland News The 8 June election result is now known - no party gained an overall majority; the SNP retained the most seats in Scotland and the Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour and Scottish Lib Dems all made gains on 2015. Here's a re-cap on the main headlines in Scotland..... The Scottish Conservatives have had their best performance in Scotland since 1983 Labour in Scotland increased their representation from a single MP to seven. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale told Rpeorting Scotland: ""What Jeremy Corbyn put forward was a fantastic manifesto that has the potential to transform this country. ""I still think we have a chance of that. ""The prime minister called this election because she wanted a majoirty and a mandate. She has failed to get that. I think she should resign.""

Prime Minister Theresa May failed to achieve a majority of seats in the House of Commons and will be looking to the DUP for support. The party is extremely conservative on moral issues and Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not allowed. On Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson pointedly tweeted a reference to a lecture she gave in Belfast last year in which she talked of her own same-sex relationship and her desire to marry her Irish Catholic partner.

She told Reporting Scotland: ""I spoke with the prime minister this evening. I was fairly straightforward with her. ""I told her there was a number of things that count to me more than party, one of them is country and one of the others is LGBTi rights. ""I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTi rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would try to use any influence that we had to advance LGBTi rights in Northern Ireland."" I told her [Theresa May] there was a number of things that count to me more than party, one of them is country and one of the others is LGBTi rights Ruth Davidson Dundee East SNP MP Stewart Hosie told Reporting Scotland there were many reasons why the SNP lost votes - not just the prospect of another independence referendum. He said: ""The late surge to Labour - many indepence supporters liked many of the things Jeremy Corbyn was saying. ""So I think the Tories would be very wrong to think that every single non-SNP vote was necessarily a vote against independence.""  This video can not be played SNP's Hosie says independence might have motivated Unionist vote Theresa May is paying the price for a ""monumental act of self-indulgence and folly"", the SNP's Stewart Hosie told Reporting Scotland. In terms of what happened to the SNP, Mr Hosie said it was diappointing to lose so many talented MPs. Responding to Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson's demand that a second independence referendum be ""taken of the table"", the Dundee East MP said she was ""overplaying her hand"". He said: ""I think it would be wrong for any party leader, particularly one whose party did not win the election, to try to stop the Scottish people deciding on their future, now or at any time in the future."" Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""Will Nicola Sturgeon abandon independence as a political objective? Absolutely not. Behave yourself. ""She still yearns for independence and believes that a referendum is the appropriate route to pursue. ""She may have to modify or adapt the zeal with which she demands a relatively early independence referendum, at the close of the Brexit period. ""It is a question of momentum. Indyref2 may not be dead but it is certainly ailing."" This is the Scottish political map before Thursday's vote This is the new political map of Scotland. The Tories have dominated the large rural seats in the South of Scotland. After Thursday's election 22 new MPs will be making their way to the benches of Westminster. Find out who they arehere Jackie Bird presents live from Westminster Watch Reporting Scotland live on BBC iplayer The SNP won 35 seats in Scotland and polled977,569votes. This was down from 2015 when it got 1,454,436 votes - or pretty much exactly half of all the votes cast. This time the SNP vote share was 36.9%. The Conservatives got 13 seats and757,949votes this time. In 2015 they got 434,097 votes and just one seat. Their share of the vote went up from 14.9% of the Scots who voted to 28.6%, almost double. Labour only added about 10,000 voters in Scotland. In 2015 they got 707,147 votes and this time they polled717,007. Their share of the vote rose from 24.3% to 27.1% but their seats went up from one to seven. The Lib Dems dropped about 40,000 votes from 219,675 to179,061but they also increased their number of seats - from one to four. The Greens slumped from 39,205 to just5,886- but this was mainly because they only stood in three constituencies. UKIP dropped from 47,078 to5,302. Intrriguingly, while the SNP came second in 24 seats and Labour were the runner-up in 25 seats, the Scottish Tories were only second in 9 seats.  Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars said the SNP leadership was ""delusional"" if they thought last night's election result was a win for them. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive: ""They should have done a lot better. There is a difference between arithmetic and political reality. Arithmetically taking the most seats is not a political victory. ""Once they went below 40, in my view that is a political defeat."" The veteran independence campaigner added: ""The quicker the party leadership realises it is a political defeat the better. ""They will start to think 'what went wrong and how do we fix it?'."" He said Nicola Sturgeon was too quick after Brexit to jump in and start calling for a second independence referendum without learning the lessons of the 2014 campaign. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""The SNP won the election as arithmetic and Nationalists will repeatedly reminds us. ""But they lost votes everywhere in Scotland. They lost 21 seats and they markedly lost momentum. ""They lost ground on the body politic in Scotland, particularly perhaps with regard to the question of independence and a further referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon herself concedes was one of the factors in play in costing them votes in these particular elections."" Spectator editor Fraser Nelson, normally a supporter of Conservative politics was scathing about Theresa May when he appeared on BBC Scotland's Newsdrive. He said: ""I'm struggling to think of any historical precedent where such a mistake was made. ""David Cameron needed to have the EU referendum to get past his party. ""No-one forced Theresa May to have this general election, she chose to and she chose to make it all about herself because she wanted greater control over her own party and her own Cabinet. She [Theresa May] blew it because she is no good at campaigning and she didn't realise how useless she is Fraser Nelson ""It was all 'me, me, me, Theresa May's Conservatives, Theresa May's candidates'. ""I think the public got the impression they were being roped into a Coronation and not everyone was wild about that. ""It is amazing to think that Theresa May started from a position of strength but she gambled it and she blew it. ""She blew it because she is no good at campaigning and she didn't realise how useless she is. ""She is very much culpable for inflicting huge damage on her party and making her government far less strong and far less stable."" It is estimated that turnout among 18-24 year olds was more than 70% yesterday. Youth turnout had been in steady decline since the 90s. Election expert Prof Michael Keating told BBC Scotland: ""We are seeing right across Europe an increasing interest in politics by young people because they feel that they are losing out. There are big generational conflicts over things like the distribution of resources. ""We know that in many European there is this new social movement, a massive awakening of interest. In other countries it tends to go to new parties but in this country it has gone to the Labour party. ""This is very significant. Had this occurred before the EU referendum the result could have been quite different because young people were strongly in favour of Remain, it was just that most of them didn't vote."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats are considering going to court over the general election result in North East Fife. SNP MP Stephen Gethins won the seat by only two votes. Scottish Lib Dem sources say there were multiple recounts which saw them winning until the final count which went in the SNP's favour. They say a court may rule that the election should be re-run and that they're convinced they could win. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Profile: Which SNP politicians lost?,"The SNP has lost a number of key politicians, on a night where both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives made gains. Former First Minister Alex Salmond was the biggest Scottish parliamentarian to fall. The former first minster was the biggest name to face defeat in the June 8 election. Alex Salmond led the SNP for a decade, and as first minister brought Scotland to the brink of independence in 2014. After Scotland voted to stay within the Union, he stood down as leader, but did not stay out of the spotlight for long. He successfully stood in the Gordon constituency in 2015 as the SNP gained all but three Scottish seats. Perhaps the most influential person in recent Scottish political history, he spent 30 years as a parliamentarian. Mr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSP Angus Robertson had represented Moray at Westminster for 16 years, and was the SNP's leader in the House of Commons. He became one of the party's most high-profile members thanks to the role he played at Prime Minister's Questions. He was often credited for holding Theresa May to account more successfully than Jeremy Corbyn. He was defeated by former MSP Douglas Ross of the Scottish Conservatives who overturned a majority of more than 9,000. John Nicolson had been MP for the constituency since 2015 Former broadcaster John Nicolson was defeated by Jo Swinson, for the Liberal Democrats. He took the East Dunbartonshire seat from her two years ago. Before becoming a politician in 2015, he was a one-time presenter on BBC Breakfast as well as a reporter on Newsnight and Panorama. He was the SNP's shadow Culture spokesman in the House of Commons. Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh previously stood for the Scottish Conservatives. Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh entered parliament in 2015 as an SNP politician, but she had previously stood for the Scottish Conservatives in the Scottish Parliament before briefly having been a member of the Labour Party. Before her election she worked as a lawyer, and remains a partner in a Glasgow firm. While in the House of Commons, she was prominent in calling for the UK to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis, and campaigning on equality issues. She acted as the SNP's Westminster trade spokesperson. George Kerevan lost his seat to Scottish Labour after two years. George Kerevan had been MP for East Lothian since his election in the 2015 SNP landslide. He had worked as a journalist and academic for many years before entering politics. He defected to the SNP from the Labour Party in the 1990s and spent 12 years on Edinburgh Council. He remained as an occasional columnist for pro-independence newspaper The National while in parliament.

Prime Minister Theresa May failed to achieve a majority of seats in the House of Commons and will be looking to the DUP for support. The party is extremely conservative on moral issues and Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not allowed. On Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson pointedly tweeted a reference to a lecture she gave in Belfast last year in which she talked of her own same-sex relationship and her desire to marry her Irish Catholic partner.

She told Reporting Scotland: ""I spoke with the prime minister this evening. I was fairly straightforward with her. ""I told her there was a number of things that count to me more than party, one of them is country and one of the others is LGBTi rights. ""I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTi rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would try to use any influence that we had to advance LGBTi rights in Northern Ireland."" I told her [Theresa May] there was a number of things that count to me more than party, one of them is country and one of the others is LGBTi rights Ruth Davidson Dundee East SNP MP Stewart Hosie told Reporting Scotland there were many reasons why the SNP lost votes - not just the prospect of another independence referendum.

In terms of what happened to the SNP, Mr Hosie said it was diappointing to lose so many talented MPs. Responding to Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson's demand that a second independence referendum be ""taken of the table"", the Dundee East MP said she was ""overplaying her hand"". He said: ""I think it would be wrong for any party leader, particularly one whose party did not win the election, to try to stop the Scottish people deciding on their future, now or at any time in the future."" Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""Will Nicola Sturgeon abandon independence as a political objective? Absolutely not. Behave yourself. ""She still yearns for independence and believes that a referendum is the appropriate route to pursue. ""She may have to modify or adapt the zeal with which she demands a relatively early independence referendum, at the close of the Brexit period. ""It is a question of momentum. Indyref2 may not be dead but it is certainly ailing."" This is the Scottish political map before Thursday's vote This is the new political map of Scotland. The Tories have dominated the large rural seats in the South of Scotland. After Thursday's election 22 new MPs will be making their way to the benches of Westminster. Find out who they arehere Jackie Bird presents live from Westminster Watch Reporting Scotland live on BBC iplayer The SNP won 35 seats in Scotland and polled977,569votes. This was down from 2015 when it got 1,454,436 votes - or pretty much exactly half of all the votes cast. This time the SNP vote share was 36.9%. The Conservatives got 13 seats and757,949votes this time. In 2015 they got 434,097 votes and just one seat. Their share of the vote went up from 14.9% of the Scots who voted to 28.6%, almost double. Labour only added about 10,000 voters in Scotland. In 2015 they got 707,147 votes and this time they polled717,007. Their share of the vote rose from 24.3% to 27.1% but their seats went up from one to seven. The Lib Dems dropped about 40,000 votes from 219,675 to179,061but they also increased their number of seats - from one to four. The Greens slumped from 39,205 to just5,886- but this was mainly because they only stood in three constituencies. UKIP dropped from 47,078 to5,302. Intrriguingly, while the SNP came second in 24 seats and Labour were the runner-up in 25 seats, the Scottish Tories were only second in 9 seats.  Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars said the SNP leadership was ""delusional"" if they thought last night's election result was a win for them. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive: ""They should have done a lot better. There is a difference between arithmetic and political reality. Arithmetically taking the most seats is not a political victory. ""Once they went below 40, in my view that is a political defeat."" The veteran independence campaigner added: ""The quicker the party leadership realises it is a political defeat the better. ""They will start to think 'what went wrong and how do we fix it?'."" He said Nicola Sturgeon was too quick after Brexit to jump in and start calling for a second independence referendum without learning the lessons of the 2014 campaign. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""The SNP won the election as arithmetic and Nationalists will repeatedly reminds us. ""But they lost votes everywhere in Scotland. They lost 21 seats and they markedly lost momentum. ""They lost ground on the body politic in Scotland, particularly perhaps with regard to the question of independence and a further referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon herself concedes was one of the factors in play in costing them votes in these particular elections."" Spectator editor Fraser Nelson, normally a supporter of Conservative politics was scathing about Theresa May when he appeared on BBC Scotland's Newsdrive. He said: ""I'm struggling to think of any historical precedent where such a mistake was made. ""David Cameron needed to have the EU referendum to get past his party. ""No-one forced Theresa May to have this general election, she chose to and she chose to make it all about herself because she wanted greater control over her own party and her own Cabinet. She [Theresa May] blew it because she is no good at campaigning and she didn't realise how useless she is Fraser Nelson ""It was all 'me, me, me, Theresa May's Conservatives, Theresa May's candidates'. ""I think the public got the impression they were being roped into a Coronation and not everyone was wild about that. ""It is amazing to think that Theresa May started from a position of strength but she gambled it and she blew it. ""She blew it because she is no good at campaigning and she didn't realise how useless she is. ""She is very much culpable for inflicting huge damage on her party and making her government far less strong and far less stable."" It is estimated that turnout among 18-24 year olds was more than 70% yesterday. Youth turnout had been in steady decline since the 90s. Election expert Prof Michael Keating told BBC Scotland: ""We are seeing right across Europe an increasing interest in politics by young people because they feel that they are losing out. There are big generational conflicts over things like the distribution of resources. ""We know that in many European there is this new social movement, a massive awakening of interest. In other countries it tends to go to new parties but in this country it has gone to the Labour party. ""This is very significant. Had this occurred before the EU referendum the result could have been quite different because young people were strongly in favour of Remain, it was just that most of them didn't vote."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats are considering going to court over the general election result in North East Fife. SNP MP Stephen Gethins won the seat by only two votes. Scottish Lib Dem sources say there were multiple recounts which saw them winning until the final count which went in the SNP's favour. They say a court may rule that the election should be re-run and that they're convinced they could win. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pound under pressure amid Labour surge,"The pound has fallen sharply as traders react to the results of the general election. The currency markets had been expecting a clear victory for Theresa May's Conservatives, but the party does not appear set to win a Commons majority. Sterling fell as lowas $1.27, down about two and a half cents from its level late on Thursday. It has since recovered to be down 1.5% at $1.2760, but the market is volatile and traders remain cautious. The BBC is projecting that the Conservatives will be the largest party with 318 seats - eight short of a majority. Given the surprise outcome of the poll so far, the pound could have been expected to fall even more sharply. However, the fact it has not slipped further may reflect the diminishing prospect of a ""hard"" Brexit. Although a hung parliament would mean uncertainty, Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said that a ""softer version of Brexit"" was now more likely. ""Mrs May's mandate to push through her clean, hard Brexit has evaporated. Voters didn't want to hand her the blank cheque for Brexit. It may leave negotiations in limbo but would also tend to suggest that the downside for sterling is limited,"" he said. When will we know who's won? Seat-by-seat result forecasts Election results live updates Election 2017: At a glance Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that suggested the UK's membership of both the single market and customs union would now be ""back on the table"". Sir Vince is returning to the Commons after regaining the seat of Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats. Sterling fell after an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky released as the polls closed at 22:00 cast doubt on an overall Conservative majority, raising concerns about increased uncertainty and a possible delay to Brexit negotiations. Sterling has been trading in a range between $1.28 and $1.30 in recent weeks. Against the eurothe pound is down 1% at 1.142 euros. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

Tories 'set to fall short of majority',"This video can not be played Theresa May says the UK needs a period of stability The UK has woken up to a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party, after the general election produced no overall winner. With nearly all results in, Theresa May faces ending up with 12 fewer seats than when she called the election. The Tories are set to get 319, Labour 261, the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems 12. An overall majority requires 326 seats. The BBC understands the PM will try to form a government, but Jeremy Corbyn also says he is ""ready to serve"". The prime minister said the country needed ""stability"" after the inconclusive election result and the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May intended to try and govern on the basis that her party had won the largest number of votes and seats. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance What happens if no-one wins the election? Full UK results breakdown,external There has been speculation she may seek some kind of informal arrangement with the Democratic Unionists, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland, which could see it support the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she expects ""some contact"" with the Tories over the coming days but she also told the BBC she believes Mrs May will find it ""difficult to survive"". After a better-than-expected night for Mr Corbyn, Labour is set to pick up 29 seats. The Tories are on course to lose 13 seats. The SNP are down by 22, losing seats to the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems, in a major setback for Nicola Sturgeon. Turnout so far is 68.7% - up 2% up on 2015 - but it has been a return to two-party politics in many parts of the country, with Labour and the Conservatives both piling up votes in numbers not seen since the 1990s and both set to top 40% of the vote. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party This video can not be played The Tories haven't won an overall majority UKIP's vote slumped dramatically but rather than moving en masse to the Tories, as they had expected, their voters also switched to Labour. Mr Corbyn, speaking after being re-elected in Islington North, said it was time for Mrs May to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He later told the BBC it was it was ""pretty clear who has won this election"". ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said - but he also stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Corbyn: Theresa May should go UKIP: May put Brexit 'in jeopardy' The biggest political upsets of the night Scotland: A tale of two Tory parties Wales: Labour hails 'fantastic' result The Conservatives have said in the event of a hung Parliament, Mrs May would get the opportunity to form a government first, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2010 when there was also no clear winner but the party had comfortably more seats than their nearest rival. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party; as I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister, Anna Soubry, has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me ""I can't see how she can stay"". A minister texts to say the Tory party is ""absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in"". One Tory source says it is ""50:50"" that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. Read Laura's full blog Lord O'Donnell, formerly the UK's top civil servant, told the BBC that the prime minister had a duty to stay in post ""for now"" and had the right to seek the confidence of the House of Commons by asking it to approve a Queen's Speech, scheduled for 19 June. He added that he would be advising her to seek an audience with The Queen later on Friday to explain her intentions over the coming days. However, Labour has said it is ready to try and form a minority government of its own, while there is also a chance that the UK could be facing a fresh election later this summer. Could the DUP be kingmakers? Analysis: What this means for Brexit Did the youth vote cause a hung Parliament? How the world reacted Questions are also being asked about the potential impact on the upcoming Brexit negotiations which are due to start on 19 June. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has hinted that this could now be delayed,tweeting that,externalthe talks should begin only when the UK is ""ready"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign Although one party needs to get 326 seats to get an overall majority, in practice the Conservatives would be expected to be able to get a Queen's Speech through with 318 MPs, if they had the backing of the DUP MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who is against Brexit, said it had been a ""dreadful campaign"" and Mrs May should ""now consider her position"". But her Brexit-supporting colleague Steve Baker said it was essential the party supported Mrs May to ""provide all the stability we can"". The Conservatives are forecast to win 42% of the vote, Labour 40%, the Lib Dems 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. Speaking at her count in Maidenhead, Theresa May said the full picture had yet to emerge, but added: ""At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability. ""And if... the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us to ensure we have that period of stability - and that is exactly what we will do.""

Salmond loses seat to the Conservatives,"Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and Scottish first minister, was defeated in Gordon Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were among the high-profile casualties as the SNP lost more than a third of its seats in the general election. The party won 35 of the 59 Scottish constituencies - a fall of 21 seats from the 56 they won in 2015. The Conservatives secured 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in the country since 1983. Labour won seven seats and the Lib Dems four. The three pro-UK parties had won just one seat each in 2015. The Tories saw big increases in their vote across the country, with the SNP vote dropping sharply.

May under pressure after election losses Kuenssberg: Can Theresa May stay as PM? Deputy First Minister John Swinney admitted that the issue of a second referendum on Scottish independence had played a ""significant"" role in the result. The SNP MSP told the BBC: ""We will take time and care to reflect on the outcome of this result. ""But we have to acknowledge that the question of a second independence was a significant motivator of votes against the SNP in this election, and we have to be attentive to that point."" The SNP won 36.9% of the votes, a drop of 13.1 percentage points since 2015. The Scottish Tories doubled their share of the vote to 28.6%, with Labour up by 2.8 points at 27.1% and the Lib Dems down slightly to 6.8%. The SNP's former leader Alex Salmond saw his majority crumble in Gordon, where Tory Colin Clark took the seat with 21,861 votes.

He added: ""The SNP have lost many fine parliamentarians this evening and that's a grievous blow to the SNP. ""But overall the result in Scotland shows the SNP will have won a majority of the seats in this country and the majority of the vote, something which I suspect the prime minister would like to be able to claim in the early hours of this morning but is not able to do so."" Douglas Ross of the Tories overturned a majority of 9,065 to defeat the SNP's leader at Westminster Angus Robertson by 4,200 votes in Moray. This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'SNP have won the election in Scotland' The SNP's Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh also lost Ochil and South Perthshire to the Tories, who were a distant third in 2015. John Nicolson of the SNP lost Dunbartonshire East to Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, who also saw Alistair Carmichael hold his Orkney and Shetland seat. The final Scottish seat to declare was Fife North East, where there were three recounts before Stephen Gethins of the SNP was declared the winner after finishing justtwo votes ahead of the Lib Dem candidate. The results mean that the SNP has lost its Westminster leader, chief whip, foreign affairs spokesman and international trade spokeswoman. Mr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSP But the picture is less positive for the Conservatives across the UK, with the partylosing its majority at Westminsterand the prime minister facing calls for her resignation. Speaking as she arrived at the Glasgow count, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the SNP had won the election in Scotland, with the party achieving its second best performance ever in a Westminster election. Asked about the impact of the lost SNP seats on her desire to hold a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Like most politicians I have not had any sleep and I am not going to take any rash decisions. ""Clearly I have to reflect on the result of the election and I will take time to do that. But it would be the wrong thing for me to do at this hour to take decisions before having had the opportunity to properly think about it. ""But properly think about it I will certainly do"". Ruth Davidson said the prospect of a second independence referendum was now ""dead"" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson hailed a ""historic"" night for her party, which she said was largely due to Ms Sturgeon's attempts to ""ram-raid through"" a second independence referendum. She added: ""I think we have seen the country's reaction in the number of SNP seat's falling. Indyref2 is dead."" ""Now it's time to get back to what matters to the people of Scotland - that's sorting out our schools, growing our economy and looking at our public services."" And Labour's Ian Murray, whoincreased his majority in Edinburgh to more than 15,000, said voters had ""hammered the final nail into the independence coffin"". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale celebrated her party's improved performance with Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray The Tories have seen their vote surge across the country as they took several seats from the SNP There was better news for the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, where Mhairi Black kept her seat despite a big drop in her share of the vote. Ms Black, the youngest MP at Westminster in the last parliament, had her majority over Labour cut from about 6,000 to about 2,500. Elsewhere, Stewart Hosie held Dundee East - which had been the safest seat in Scotland - for the SNP, while Angus MacNeil held on in the Western Isles, despite his share of the vote falling by nearly 14%. Pete Wishart also held on for the SNP in Perth and Perthshire North after finishing just 21 votes ahead of the Tory candidate, while Tommy Sheppard held Edinburgh East. An exit poll had predicted that the SNP would lose 22 of the 56 seats it won in the last election in 2015. The poll, which was taken at polling stations across the UK, also suggested the Conservatives would fall short of an overall majority at Westminster. SNP politicians had cast doubt on the exit poll result when it was first published - with many insisting the party would not lose as many as 22 seats. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

The Tories have dominated the large rural seats in the South of Scotland. After Thursday's election 22 new MPs will be making their way to the benches of Westminster. Find out who they arehere Jackie Bird presents live from Westminster Watch Reporting Scotland live on BBC iplayer The SNP won 35 seats in Scotland and polled977,569votes. This was down from 2015 when it got 1,454,436 votes - or pretty much exactly half of all the votes cast. This time the SNP vote share was 36.9%. The Conservatives got 13 seats and757,949votes this time. In 2015 they got 434,097 votes and just one seat. Their share of the vote went up from 14.9% of the Scots who voted to 28.6%, almost double. Labour only added about 10,000 voters in Scotland. In 2015 they got 707,147 votes and this time they polled717,007. Their share of the vote rose from 24.3% to 27.1% but their seats went up from one to seven. The Lib Dems dropped about 40,000 votes from 219,675 to179,061but they also increased their number of seats - from one to four. The Greens slumped from 39,205 to just5,886- but this was mainly because they only stood in three constituencies. UKIP dropped from 47,078 to5,302. Intrriguingly, while the SNP came second in 24 seats and Labour were the runner-up in 25 seats, the Scottish Tories were only second in 9 seats.  Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars said the SNP leadership was ""delusional"" if they thought last night's election result was a win for them. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive: ""They should have done a lot better. There is a difference between arithmetic and political reality. Arithmetically taking the most seats is not a political victory. ""Once they went below 40, in my view that is a political defeat."" The veteran independence campaigner added: ""The quicker the party leadership realises it is a political defeat the better. ""They will start to think 'what went wrong and how do we fix it?'."" He said Nicola Sturgeon was too quick after Brexit to jump in and start calling for a second independence referendum without learning the lessons of the 2014 campaign. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""The SNP won the election as arithmetic and Nationalists will repeatedly reminds us. ""But they lost votes everywhere in Scotland. They lost 21 seats and they markedly lost momentum. ""They lost ground on the body politic in Scotland, particularly perhaps with regard to the question of independence and a further referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon herself concedes was one of the factors in play in costing them votes in these particular elections."" Spectator editor Fraser Nelson, normally a supporter of Conservative politics was scathing about Theresa May when he appeared on BBC Scotland's Newsdrive. He said: ""I'm struggling to think of any historical precedent where such a mistake was made. ""David Cameron needed to have the EU referendum to get past his party. ""No-one forced Theresa May to have this general election, she chose to and she chose to make it all about herself because she wanted greater control over her own party and her own Cabinet. She [Theresa May] blew it because she is no good at campaigning and she didn't realise how useless she is Fraser Nelson ""It was all 'me, me, me, Theresa May's Conservatives, Theresa May's candidates'. ""I think the public got the impression they were being roped into a Coronation and not everyone was wild about that. ""It is amazing to think that Theresa May started from a position of strength but she gambled it and she blew it. ""She blew it because she is no good at campaigning and she didn't realise how useless she is. ""She is very much culpable for inflicting huge damage on her party and making her government far less strong and far less stable."" It is estimated that turnout among 18-24 year olds was more than 70% yesterday. Youth turnout had been in steady decline since the 90s. Election expert Prof Michael Keating told BBC Scotland: ""We are seeing right across Europe an increasing interest in politics by young people because they feel that they are losing out. There are big generational conflicts over things like the distribution of resources. ""We know that in many European there is this new social movement, a massive awakening of interest. In other countries it tends to go to new parties but in this country it has gone to the Labour party. ""This is very significant. Had this occurred before the EU referendum the result could have been quite different because young people were strongly in favour of Remain, it was just that most of them didn't vote."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats are considering going to court over the general election result in North East Fife. SNP MP Stephen Gethins won the seat by only two votes. Scottish Lib Dem sources say there were multiple recounts which saw them winning until the final count which went in the SNP's favour. They say a court may rule that the election should be re-run and that they're convinced they could win. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

SDLP wiped out in general election,"All 18 of Northern Ireland's MPs have been confirmed with the SDLP and UUP losing their seats at Westminster. The final result came in Fermanagh and South Tyrone where UUP's Tom Elliott lost to Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle Gildernew.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a ""very difficult night"" for the party and paid tribute to the party's three former MPs. Meanwhile, the DUP celebrated a resurgence with a 10% increase in their vote share, a return to a level of support they last enjoyed in the 2005 general election. Elected DUP MPs Nigel Dodds, Emma Little-Pengelly and Gavin Robinson with party leader Arlene Foster (middle left) The confirmed results saw the DUP win 10 seats, Sinn FÃ©in win seven and independent candidate Lady Sylvia Hermon retain her seat in North Down. DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was ""absolutely delighted"" with the result, and that it showed the voters had bought into the party's vision. Michelle O'Neill, Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader, ruled out the prospect of the party taking its seats at Westminster.

Politics here has turned another corner. The middle-ground parties have been wiped from Westminster and the DUP will be Northern Ireland's only voice on the green benches. Playing the union and border poll card has paid off for the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The polarisation of politics has moved to another level. The upshot may well be a coming together of the unionist parties while the SDLP are likely to look south to Fianna Fail to find their way back from the wilderness.

It's been a disappointing night for SDLP leader Colum Eastwood (left) Sinn FÃ©in's Paul Maskey, Mickey Brady and Francie Molloy also retained their seats in Belfast West, Newry and Armagh and Mid-Ulster while Barry McElduff won in West Tyrone. A total of 109 candidates stood across Northern Ireland and 1.2m people were eligible to vote. Turnout figures have been confirmed across Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies The general election exit pollindicated that the Conservatives will be the largest partyat Westminster but may not secure an overall majority.

SNP deputy leader loses seat to Tories,"Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and Scottish first minister, was defeated in Gordon Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were among the high-profile casualties as the SNP lost more than a third of its seats in the general election. The party won 35 of the 59 Scottish constituencies - a fall of 21 seats from the 56 they won in 2015. The Conservatives secured 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in the country since 1983. Labour won seven seats and the Lib Dems four. The three pro-UK parties had won just one seat each in 2015. The Tories saw big increases in their vote across the country, with the SNP vote dropping sharply. Election 2017: Scottish results Election 2017: At-a-glance The election result in maps What does the result mean for Scotland? May under pressure after election losses Kuenssberg: Can Theresa May stay as PM? Deputy First Minister John Swinney admitted that the issue of a second referendum on Scottish independence had played a ""significant"" role in the result. The SNP MSP told the BBC: ""We will take time and care to reflect on the outcome of this result. ""But we have to acknowledge that the question of a second independence was a significant motivator of votes against the SNP in this election, and we have to be attentive to that point."" The SNP won 36.9% of the votes, a drop of 13.1 percentage points since 2015. The Scottish Tories doubled their share of the vote to 28.6%, with Labour up by 2.8 points at 27.1% and the Lib Dems down slightly to 6.8%. The SNP's former leader Alex Salmond saw his majority crumble in Gordon, where Tory Colin Clark took the seat with 21,861 votes. This video can not be played The winners and losers in Scotland Despite his defeat, Mr Salmond insisted that people have ""not seen the last of my bonnets and me"". He added: ""The SNP have lost many fine parliamentarians this evening and that's a grievous blow to the SNP. ""But overall the result in Scotland shows the SNP will have won a majority of the seats in this country and the majority of the vote, something which I suspect the prime minister would like to be able to claim in the early hours of this morning but is not able to do so."" Douglas Ross of the Tories overturned a majority of 9,065 to defeat the SNP's leader at Westminster Angus Robertson by 4,200 votes in Moray. This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'SNP have won the election in Scotland' The SNP's Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh also lost Ochil and South Perthshire to the Tories, who were a distant third in 2015. John Nicolson of the SNP lost Dunbartonshire East to Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, who also saw Alistair Carmichael hold his Orkney and Shetland seat. The final Scottish seat to declare was Fife North East, where there were three recounts before Stephen Gethins of the SNP was declared the winner after finishing justtwo votes ahead of the Lib Dem candidate. The results mean that the SNP has lost its Westminster leader, chief whip, foreign affairs spokesman and international trade spokeswoman. Mr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSP But the picture is less positive for the Conservatives across the UK, with the partylosing its majority at Westminsterand the prime minister facing calls for her resignation. Speaking as she arrived at the Glasgow count, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the SNP had won the election in Scotland, with the party achieving its second best performance ever in a Westminster election. Asked about the impact of the lost SNP seats on her desire to hold a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Like most politicians I have not had any sleep and I am not going to take any rash decisions. ""Clearly I have to reflect on the result of the election and I will take time to do that. But it would be the wrong thing for me to do at this hour to take decisions before having had the opportunity to properly think about it. ""But properly think about it I will certainly do"". Ruth Davidson said the prospect of a second independence referendum was now ""dead"" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson hailed a ""historic"" night for her party, which she said was largely due to Ms Sturgeon's attempts to ""ram-raid through"" a second independence referendum. She added: ""I think we have seen the country's reaction in the number of SNP seat's falling. Indyref2 is dead."" ""Now it's time to get back to what matters to the people of Scotland - that's sorting out our schools, growing our economy and looking at our public services."" And Labour's Ian Murray, whoincreased his majority in Edinburgh to more than 15,000, said voters had ""hammered the final nail into the independence coffin"". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale celebrated her party's improved performance with Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray The Tories have seen their vote surge across the country as they took several seats from the SNP There was better news for the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, where Mhairi Black kept her seat despite a big drop in her share of the vote. Ms Black, the youngest MP at Westminster in the last parliament, had her majority over Labour cut from about 6,000 to about 2,500. Elsewhere, Stewart Hosie held Dundee East - which had been the safest seat in Scotland - for the SNP, while Angus MacNeil held on in the Western Isles, despite his share of the vote falling by nearly 14%. Pete Wishart also held on for the SNP in Perth and Perthshire North after finishing just 21 votes ahead of the Tory candidate, while Tommy Sheppard held Edinburgh East. An exit poll had predicted that the SNP would lose 22 of the 56 seats it won in the last election in 2015. The poll, which was taken at polling stations across the UK, also suggested the Conservatives would fall short of an overall majority at Westminster. SNP politicians had cast doubt on the exit poll result when it was first published - with many insisting the party would not lose as many as 22 seats. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

Labour 'could form next government',"This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: ""I'm very, very proud of the campaign my party has run"" Jeremy Corbyn has said Theresa May ""underestimated"" voters and the Labour Party after the Tories failed to win an overall majority in the election. He said people had voted ""for hope"" after his party secured 262 seats in Parliament. The Labour leader called on Mrs May to resign after the Conservatives were left eight seats short of a majority. However, Mrs May has said she would form a government with the support of the Democratic Unionists. Ina video post,externalon Twitter, Mr Corbyn thanked those who voted for Labour. ""Your vote for us was a vote for change, a vote for our country and a vote for hope,"" he said. He went on to say Theresa May called the general election ""in her party's interests, not in the interests of the country"" and thought she could ""take your vote for granted"". ""But she underestimated the Labour Party, and more importantly, she underestimated you."" The Jeremy Corbyn factor May to form government with DUP Who are the DUP? Which seats changed hands? After Kensington declared for Labour, it now has 262 seats behind the Conservatives' 318, with the SNP on 35 and Lib Dems on 12. Len McCluskey, leader of the UK's biggest union Unite, said Labour could put together a minority government as Mrs May ""can't go on for another five years"". ""So my message is that Labour now has to prepare for government,"" he added. ""And they do that by the Parliamentary Labour Party coming back together and being united and making certain that the policies are developed and spread out and propagated in a way that will be attract more and more people to us."" Mr Corbyn has been praised for his ""sure footed"" election campaign which saw Labour gain 29 more seats than in the 2015 election Earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell also suggested Labour could form a minority government. He told BBC News: ""We have laid the foundations for a minority government, and then eventually a majority government."" He said a Labour government would be formed ""not through deals or coalitions but policy by policy"". Former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson described the election result was a political ""earthquake"". He acknowledged Mr Corbyn, whose leadership he had previously criticised, had been ""very sure footed"" in the campaign. But he said if Labour was to come first and not ""a good second"" next time, the leader had to be much more ""ecumenical"" in his approach. Full UK results breakdown,external Find the result where you live,external Labour took seats from the Conservatives, including Battersea and Canterbury, and unseated former Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam. The party also made gains in Scotland, which included regaining ex-PM Gordon Brown's former seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Speaking following his re-election as the MP for Islington North, Mr Corbyn said: ""The prime minister called this election because she wanted a mandate. ""Well the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence. ""I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country."" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry described Labour's election result as a ""extraordinary performance"" which ""shows what we can do when we unite"". Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the count in his Islington North constituency, which he won with more than 40,000 votes SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon spoke during the election campaign of a desire to form a ""progressive alternative"" to the Tories and supporting Labour on a ""case by case"" basis if the numbers added up. However, Mr Corbyn ruled out a formal deal with the SNP. Responding to the exit poll, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""Any Green MPs elected tonight will do all they can to keep the Tories from Number 10, and back a Labour-led government on a case by case basis."" The Liberal Democrat press office tweeted: ""We are getting a lot of calls so just to be clear: No coalition. No deals."" Jeremy Corbyn has been mobbed by supporters at a series of campaign rallies In the 2015 general election, Labour won 232 seats under former leader Ed Miliband, down from the 258 seats secured in 2010. It went into the 2017 election with 229 seats. When Prime Minister Theresa May announced the election in April, her Conservative Party had a big double-digit lead in many polls and hoped for a landslide victory. But the campaign saw the Tories' poll lead narrowing. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson called Mrs May ""a damaged prime minister whose reputation may never recover"". Mr Watson said he thought Mr Corbyn's leadership of Labour was safe. ""It would be very foolish for anyone to want to stand down in the Labour Party tonight after this result."" But he added: ""I can see Boris Johnson sharpening the knives for Theresa May after this result."" The leader of the Unite Union, Len McCluskey, said the election result was ""an incredible advance"" and it wouldn't be long before there was a Labour government. He said that Labour's performance reflected that ""there is a desperate wish out there for an alternative"". ""We've had austerity rammed down our throats, it's brought about inequality, it's brought about the type of society that nobody wants - a low pay, race to the bottom society.

Tories on course to be largest party,"This video can not be played Theresa May says the UK needs a period of stability The UK has woken up to a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party, after the general election produced no overall winner. With nearly all results in, Theresa May faces ending up with 12 fewer seats than when she called the election. The Tories are set to get 319, Labour 261, the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems 12. An overall majority requires 326 seats. The BBC understands the PM will try to form a government, but Jeremy Corbyn also says he is ""ready to serve"". The prime minister said the country needed ""stability"" after the inconclusive election result and the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May intended to try and govern on the basis that her party had won the largest number of votes and seats. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance What happens if no-one wins the election? Full UK results breakdown,external There has been speculation she may seek some kind of informal arrangement with the Democratic Unionists, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland, which could see it support the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she expects ""some contact"" with the Tories over the coming days but she also told the BBC she believes Mrs May will find it ""difficult to survive"". After a better-than-expected night for Mr Corbyn, Labour is set to pick up 29 seats. The Tories are on course to lose 13 seats. The SNP are down by 22, losing seats to the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems, in a major setback for Nicola Sturgeon. Turnout so far is 68.7% - up 2% up on 2015 - but it has been a return to two-party politics in many parts of the country, with Labour and the Conservatives both piling up votes in numbers not seen since the 1990s and both set to top 40% of the vote. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party This video can not be played The Tories haven't won an overall majority UKIP's vote slumped dramatically but rather than moving en masse to the Tories, as they had expected, their voters also switched to Labour. Mr Corbyn, speaking after being re-elected in Islington North, said it was time for Mrs May to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He later told the BBC it was it was ""pretty clear who has won this election"". ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said - but he also stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Corbyn: Theresa May should go UKIP: May put Brexit 'in jeopardy' The biggest political upsets of the night Scotland: A tale of two Tory parties Wales: Labour hails 'fantastic' result The Conservatives have said in the event of a hung Parliament, Mrs May would get the opportunity to form a government first, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2010 when there was also no clear winner but the party had comfortably more seats than their nearest rival. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party; as I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister, Anna Soubry, has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me ""I can't see how she can stay"". A minister texts to say the Tory party is ""absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in"". One Tory source says it is ""50:50"" that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. Read Laura's full blog Lord O'Donnell, formerly the UK's top civil servant, told the BBC that the prime minister had a duty to stay in post ""for now"" and had the right to seek the confidence of the House of Commons by asking it to approve a Queen's Speech, scheduled for 19 June. He added that he would be advising her to seek an audience with The Queen later on Friday to explain her intentions over the coming days. However, Labour has said it is ready to try and form a minority government of its own, while there is also a chance that the UK could be facing a fresh election later this summer. Could the DUP be kingmakers? Analysis: What this means for Brexit Did the youth vote cause a hung Parliament? How the world reacted Questions are also being asked about the potential impact on the upcoming Brexit negotiations which are due to start on 19 June. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has hinted that this could now be delayed,tweeting that,externalthe talks should begin only when the UK is ""ready"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign Although one party needs to get 326 seats to get an overall majority, in practice the Conservatives would be expected to be able to get a Queen's Speech through with 318 MPs, if they had the backing of the DUP MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who is against Brexit, said it had been a ""dreadful campaign"" and Mrs May should ""now consider her position"". But her Brexit-supporting colleague Steve Baker said it was essential the party supported Mrs May to ""provide all the stability we can"". The Conservatives are forecast to win 42% of the vote, Labour 40%, the Lib Dems 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. Speaking at her count in Maidenhead, Theresa May said the full picture had yet to emerge, but added: ""At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability. ""And if... the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us to ensure we have that period of stability - and that is exactly what we will do."" This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'SNP have won the election in Scotland' This video can not be played Nick Clegg: 'There's a huge gulf between young and old' Speaking on ITV, George Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor last year by Mrs May, said: ""Theresa May is probably going to be one of the shortest-serving prime ministers in our history.""

Former business secretarySir Vince Cable retook his Twickenham seat for the Lib Demsmoments later - although theLib Dems later lost Richmond Park to Conservative Zac Goldsmithafter two recounts. The Lib Dems, which are to end up with four more seats, have ruled out going into coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed"" to have lost a number of seats but claimed her party had still ""won the election in Scotland"". She said she would like the SNP to ""play a part in a progressive alternative to a Tory government"" but would wait to see the final results. The Green Party are unchanged with one seat and Plaid Cymru still have three MPs, while the Lib Dems are on course to gain five.

The Lib Dems dropped about 40,000 votes from 219,675 to179,061but they also increased their number of seats - from one to four. The Greens slumped from 39,205 to just5,886- but this was mainly because they only stood in three constituencies. UKIP dropped from 47,078 to5,302. Intrriguingly, while the SNP came second in 24 seats and Labour were the runner-up in 25 seats, the Scottish Tories were only second in 9 seats.  Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars said the SNP leadership was ""delusional"" if they thought last night's election result was a win for them. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive: ""They should have done a lot better. There is a difference between arithmetic and political reality. Arithmetically taking the most seats is not a political victory. ""Once they went below 40, in my view that is a political defeat."" The veteran independence campaigner added: ""The quicker the party leadership realises it is a political defeat the better. ""They will start to think 'what went wrong and how do we fix it?'."" He said Nicola Sturgeon was too quick after Brexit to jump in and start calling for a second independence referendum without learning the lessons of the 2014 campaign. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""The SNP won the election as arithmetic and Nationalists will repeatedly reminds us. ""But they lost votes everywhere in Scotland. They lost 21 seats and they markedly lost momentum. ""They lost ground on the body politic in Scotland, particularly perhaps with regard to the question of independence and a further referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon herself concedes was one of the factors in play in costing them votes in these particular elections."" Spectator editor Fraser Nelson, normally a supporter of Conservative politics was scathing about Theresa May when he appeared on BBC Scotland's Newsdrive. He said: ""I'm struggling to think of any historical precedent where such a mistake was made. ""David Cameron needed to have the EU referendum to get past his party. ""No-one forced Theresa May to have this general election, she chose to and she chose to make it all about herself because she wanted greater control over her own party and her own Cabinet.

There are big generational conflicts over things like the distribution of resources. ""We know that in many European there is this new social movement, a massive awakening of interest.

Had this occurred before the EU referendum the result could have been quite different because young people were strongly in favour of Remain, it was just that most of them didn't vote."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats are considering going to court over the general election result in North East Fife. SNP MP Stephen Gethins won the seat by only two votes. Scottish Lib Dem sources say there were multiple recounts which saw them winning until the final count which went in the SNP's favour.

The Conservatives secured 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in the country since 1983. Labour won seven seats and the Lib Dems four.

Election 2017: Scotland results,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon concedes indyref2 a factor in the election The SNP ends the night with 35 seats, the Tories have 13, Labour 7 and the Lib Dems 4 Former SNP leader Alex Salmond and the SNP's Deputy leader Angus Robertson lose their seats to the Conservatives Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson says the result shows indyref2 ""is dead"" Election ends in hung Parliament: Conservatives set for 319 seats, Labour 261 Tories to form UK government with DUP to 'provide certainty' and keep country 'safe' BBC Scotland News The 8 June election result is now known - no party gained an overall majority; the SNP retained the most seats in Scotland and the Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour and Scottish Lib Dems all made gains on 2015. Here's a re-cap on the main headlines in Scotland..... The Scottish Conservatives have had their best performance in Scotland since 1983 Labour in Scotland increased their representation from a single MP to seven. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale told Rpeorting Scotland: ""What Jeremy Corbyn put forward was a fantastic manifesto that has the potential to transform this country. ""I still think we have a chance of that. ""The prime minister called this election because she wanted a majoirty and a mandate. She has failed to get that. I think she should resign."" This video can not be played Davidson spoke to PM over DUP gay rights concern Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has told Reporting Scotland that she has sought ""categoric"" assurance from Theresa May that any deal the Tory party make with the DUP in Northern Ireland will not affect the rights of gay and lesbian people in the rest of the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May failed to achieve a majority of seats in the House of Commons and will be looking to the DUP for support. The party is extremely conservative on moral issues and Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not allowed. On Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson pointedly tweeted a reference to a lecture she gave in Belfast last year in which she talked of her own same-sex relationship and her desire to marry her Irish Catholic partner.

She told Reporting Scotland: ""I spoke with the prime minister this evening. I was fairly straightforward with her. ""I told her there was a number of things that count to me more than party, one of them is country and one of the others is LGBTi rights. ""I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTi rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would try to use any influence that we had to advance LGBTi rights in Northern Ireland."" I told her [Theresa May] there was a number of things that count to me more than party, one of them is country and one of the others is LGBTi rights Ruth Davidson Dundee East SNP MP Stewart Hosie told Reporting Scotland there were many reasons why the SNP lost votes - not just the prospect of another independence referendum. He said: ""The late surge to Labour - many indepence supporters liked many of the things Jeremy Corbyn was saying. ""So I think the Tories would be very wrong to think that every single non-SNP vote was necessarily a vote against independence.""

In terms of what happened to the SNP, Mr Hosie said it was diappointing to lose so many talented MPs. Responding to Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson's demand that a second independence referendum be ""taken of the table"", the Dundee East MP said she was ""overplaying her hand"". He said: ""I think it would be wrong for any party leader, particularly one whose party did not win the election, to try to stop the Scottish people deciding on their future, now or at any time in the future."" Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor ""Will Nicola Sturgeon abandon independence as a political objective? Absolutely not. Behave yourself. ""She still yearns for independence and believes that a referendum is the appropriate route to pursue. ""She may have to modify or adapt the zeal with which she demands a relatively early independence referendum, at the close of the Brexit period. ""It is a question of momentum. Indyref2 may not be dead but it is certainly ailing."" This is the Scottish political map before Thursday's vote This is the new political map of Scotland.

Labour win 'rejection of indyref2',"David Mundell says Theresa May is still the best person to lead the country into Brexit negotiations. She may recover, of course, but last night she scarcely sounded up for that fight. She entered this contest to gain a personal mandate and hoping for a landslide.  She has achieved neither of those aims. The Tories have made 20 gains across the UK - with 12 of them in Scotland - thus emphasising how poor the result for the Conservatives is in England. They are now looking to a hung parliament - with the Tories presumably dependent on the DUP to secure votes in the Commons. This will mean that the issue of Ireland takes immediate centre stage in Brexit talks - at least for the UK government. Alex Salmond says the SNP have won the election in Scotland. Handling defeat with dignity and humour, he insisted the SNP would be in a position of influence in the Commons. He said they would build a progressive alliance, if possible. Alex Salmond defeated in Gordon. This will characterise the night for the SNP, despite them holding many key seats. Ruth Davidson very blunt on indyref2.  Says it is ""dead"". Theresa May's party are set to win the most seats. And she looks as if she has swallowed a wasp. Nicola Sturgeon's party are set to win the most seats in Scotland. And she sounds cautious and constrained. Isn't politics remarkable? It is, as ever, a question of momentum and relativity. If Nicola Sturgeon sounds faintly disappointed, Theresa May looked crushed. Her acceptance speech was downbeat. She urged unity - without suggesting she was able to offer it - then left the stage swiftly. Speculation will increase that she is not likely to be long in office. Nicola Sturgeon says it is the second best result in Westminster polling for the SNP. But also says she will need time to reflect upon the issue of a referendum. Intriguing stuff ahead? Alex Salmond is laying emphasis upon the prospect that the SNP will win the election in Scotland. Not upon the seats lost. He says Labour experienced a late surge on the basis of support for Jeremy Corbyn. He also says the SNP will be even more influential in what might be a hung parliament. Tories take Aberdeen South and Ayr. And so the record swing is overturned. Anne McLaughlin won Glasgow North East with a 39% swing last time. But Labour has now overturned that. Kezia Dugdale, asked whether Jeremy Corbyn had won the right to stay as Labour leader, replied:  ""Absolutely"". Huge cheers as David Linden holds Glasgow East for SNP. This was where Natalie McGarry was elected two years ago - but withdrew from the party whip. Jo Swinson took the East Dunbartonshire seat for the Liberal Democrats Very good victory for Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems in East Dunbartonshire. She says she is humbled - and suggests that the SNP might now show comparable humility by abandoning indyref2. Intriguing though that the Tory vote here is up by more than the LibDems. Still, to the victor the prize. For the SNP, it is a question of relativity. Relative to their historic performance in Westminster elections, tonight still looks good. Relative to the result in 2015, tonight looks notably poor. And so the Portillo moment occurs. Douglas Ross wins Moray. However the SNP perform, this will colour their night. They have lost their deputy leader and a strong Westminster performer, Angus Robertson. Same pattern in the Western Isles. The SNP returned with pro-Union parties all putting on votes. Again, in East Kilbride, pro-Union parties all put on votes. The SNP won, with a reduced share. Same pattern in Dunbartonshire West. Labour up. Tories up more. SNP hold. More re Paisley. Labour failed to emerge as sole challenger. Indeed, their vote went down when other pro-Union parties, Lib Dems and especially Tories, registered an increase. Could that division in the pro Union vote help the SNP to hold on in other seats, if replicated? The SNP's Mhairi Black retains her seat in Paisley and Renfrewshire South Mhairi Black is back in Paisley and Renfrewshire South. Especially good victory for her and the SNP, given expectations elsewhere. And further evidence that we have to await detailed outcomes from individual seats. The Scottish Secretary David Mundell is blunt. He says the SNP bubble has burst and the voters ""deeply dislike"" Nicola Sturgeon. Kevin Pringle, former SNP spin doctor and special adviser, says the 2015 result was ""unrepeatable"" for the SNP. A narrative which may well be pursued if the results continue to follow the exit poll pattern in Scotland, with SNP defeats. Labour candidate Gerard Killen takes the first seat from the SNP Winning MP in Rutherglen says result is rejection of austerity and of indyref2. First seat to change hands tonight. James Kelly, the Labour MSP, had tipped this from the outset. Labour up in Rutherglen. Tories up. SNP well down in voting share. Labour take Rutherglen - where Labour's Scottish campaign was lost. Huge cheers from Labour supporters at the count. Derek Mackay, who co-ordinated the SNP campaign, is saying that it was always going to be tough to replicate 2015. But he says that a victory is a victory. The expectation from the outset was that the SNP would win the election in Scotland, but lose ground. Question right now is: how much ground? More thoughts. In English seats, particularly in the North-east, the Tory vote is holding up better than the exit poll would suggest. But how will the UKIP slump play out in core seats in the English Midlands and North-west? In Scotland, talk is all of tight contests - including in the Western Isles, an SNP stronghold of late. Julie Elliott who won the Sunderland Central constituency - one of the first few results declared Three results in (none Scottish). Each Labour victories. But each with rising Conservative support, apparently contrary to the exit poll. Another point. UKIP vote sharply down, even in Leave-voting Sunderland. Are they being squeezed - or is the conclusion that it is job done on UKIP's principal objective? Quick reminder. Exit poll was by GFK /Ipsos Mori for three broadcasters: BBC, ITV, Sky. Sample was 30,450 voters leaving 144 polling stations. Ten sampling stations in Scotland. Could Nicola Sturgeon's popularity be on the decline? Murdo Fraser, from the Scottish Tories, says the exit poll, if proved correct, takes indyref2 off the table. IF - and remember it is if - the exit poll is correct, then to what might one attribute the decline in SNP strength? Douglas Alexander, who lost his seat two years ago, reckons one factor is growing discontent with Nicola Sturgeon. Jeane Freeman of the SNP says she finds it hard to see where the SNP's ""lost"" 22 seats - as identified in the exit poll - might come from. Might she well have a point?  We shall see. Another thought re the exit poll. It is, as I said on air, only a sample, albeit a pretty big one. Final campaign polls mostly suggested a big lead for Tories although one or two indicated much smaller. Exit poll suggests 314 for Tories, short of majority. If it is correct, then she has lost any pretension to a renewed mandate for negotiating Brexit - and would face big questions from within her party. In Scotland, poll suggests 34 for the SNP, down 22. Jeane Freeman for SNP places emphasis on poor result for Tories.
