Two million couples miss out on tax break,"Nearly half the couples eligible to claim marriage tax allowance are still failing to do so, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The tax allowance - worth Â£230 a year - can be claimed by married couples or those in a civil partnership if they meet certain conditions. However, since it was introduced in 2015, only 2.2 million couples have claimed it, from 4.4 million eligible. The government said it had now simplified the application process. Last year,HMRC reportedthat only a quarter of eligible couples were claiming. The latest figures were obtained as the result of a Freedom of Information request to HMRC by insurance company Royal London. Steve Webb, the director of policy at Royal London, said the take-up was ""shockingly low"". ""When family finances are so tight, I would encourage every married couple to check whether they might be eligible, including for the last two years, as they could qualify for a useful lump sum as well as a reduction in their ongoing tax bill,"" he said. Partners must either be married, or in a civil partnership. One partner needs to be earning at least Â£11,500 a year, and paying tax at the basic rate of 20%. If he or she is earning over Â£45,000 (Â£43,000 in Scotland) they are not eligible. The other partner must be earning less than Â£11,500 in 2017-18, meaning they pay no tax. If the above conditions are satisfied, the partner not paying tax can transfer 10% of his or her tax allowance to a partner, so saving Â£230 in this tax year. Back-claims can be made for previous years HMRC has organised several advertising campaigns to persuade people toapply for Marriage Allowance,,externaland is known to be frustrated by the lack of take-up. ""Applications have increased year on year, and the application process is easy, and families can apply at a time which is convenient for them,"" a spokesperson said. Steve Webb said the complexity of claiming might be one reason why so many people have not applied. ""I suspect people don't know who's eligible, or how to go about claiming it,"" he said. A government spokesperson said: ""2.2 million couples across the UK are keeping more of the money they earn thanks to the Marriage Allowance. ""Applications have increased year on year and we have simplified the application process to make it easier for families to apply at a time which is convenient for them.""

UK's credit rating downgraded by Moody's,"The UK's credit rating has been cut over concerns about the UK's public finances and fears Brexit could damage the country's economic growth. Moody's, one of the major ratings agencies, downgraded the UK to an Aa2 rating from Aa1. It said leaving the European Union was creating economic uncertainty at a time when the UK's debt reduction plans were already off course. Downing Street said the firm's Brexit assessments were ""outdated"". The other major agencies, Fitch and S&P,changed their ratingsin 2016, with S&P cutting it two notches from AAA to AA, and Fitch lowering it from AA+ to AA. Moody's said,externalthe government had ""yielded to pressure and raised spending in several areas"" including health and social care. It says revenues were unlikely to compensate for the higher spending. This video can not be played Alastair Wilson, head of sovereign ratings at Moody's, gave two reasons for cutting the credit rating, but there was some good news The agency said because the government had not secured a majority in the snap election it ""further obscures the future direction of economic policy"". It also said Brexit would dominate legislative priorities, so there could be limited capacity to address ""substantial"" challenges. It added ""any free trade agreement will likely take years to negotiate, prolonging the current uncertainty for business"". Moody's has also changed the UK's long-term issuer and debt ratings to ""stable"" from ""negative"". Moody'sstripped Britain of its top-notch AAArating in 2013. The government said the latest downgrade followed a meeting on 19 September, and did not consider the prime minister's speech on Friday, in which she outlined her vision for Brexit. ""The prime minister has just set out an ambitious vision for the UK's future relationship with the EU, making clear that both sides will benefit from a new and unique partnership,"" it said. ""The foundations on which we build this partnership are strong."" It said it had a robust economic record and had made substantial progress in reducing the deficit. ""We are not complacent about the challenges ahead, but we are optimistic about our bright future."" But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, called the downgrade a ""hammer blow"" to the economic credibility of the Conservatives and Chancellor Philip Hammond. He pointed out that it was the second time the credit rating had shifted downwards under their government. Credit rating agencies, in essence, rate a country on the strength of its economy - scoring governments or large companies on how likely they are to pay back their debt. A rating downgrade can affect how much it costs governments to borrow money in the international financial markets. In theory, a high credit rating means a lower interest rate, and vice versa.

McCain sinks Obamacare repeal again,"Healthcare affects one-fifth of the US economy Senator John McCain has said he cannot support his fellow Republicans' latest effort to repeal Obamacare, dealing it a potentially fatal blow. The Arizona senator, who is battling brain cancer, said he ""cannot in good conscience"" vote for the new plan, which President Donald Trump backs. Mr McCain said it was wrong to pass such far-reaching legislation without input from the Democrats. It is the second time he has thwarted his party leadership on the issue. President Trump, speaking in Alabama late on Friday, condemned Republicans who did not back the new legislation, saying: ""They don't have the guts to vote for it."" Republicans need 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48 to succeed. With Democrats united in opposition, there is little margin for error. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Where Trump went wrong on healthcare Mr McCain's objection could doom conservatives' seven-year campaign to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. In a statement on Friday, the Arizona senator said such a bill demands extensive hearings, debate and amendment. This video can not be played Mr McCain's ""no"" vote in July scuppered the last Republican bid to repeal Obamacare ""That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform,"" he wrote, ""without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority."" Mr McCain said he could not support a rushed bill ""without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect [sic] insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it"". One other Republican senator, Rand Paul, is also against the party's latest bill. Why is Obamacare so controversial? Susan Collins indicated on Friday afternoon she may join the opposition. The Maine senator said she was worried the legislation did not do enough to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. ""I'm leaning against the bill,"" Ms Collins said at a constituency event. At least four other Republican senators are undecided: Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter As several Republican senators explained - ones who were firm ""yesses"" - the main attraction for the plan was that it was the only plan on the table. Now it appears Republicans will have to go back to the drawing board. Although the end of September is the deadline for passing a bill with a simple majority in the Senate for this federal budget, there's no reason the party couldn't start the wheels turning for another vote next year - or, conceivably, simply change the rules, as Donald Trump has suggested. None of that will alter the simple dynamic that made itself clear over the course of the past months, however. The Republican Party, despite campaigning ferociously for Obamacare repeal for nearly seven years, could never agree on how to turn those promises into reality without sending the healthcare industry into a tailspin. Read more from Anthony Follow@awzurcher,external The Republican leadership had evidently hoped South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's authors, might be able to persuade his close friend Mr McCain to back the measure. Undeterred on Friday, Mr Graham vowed: ""We press on."" President Trump has been phoning lawmakers and state governors in a bid to tilt the scales in favour of the bill. But several Republican governors this week also criticised the process as rushed, urging colleagues to abandon the proposal in favour of a slower, cross-party approach. Sixteen major medical groups meanwhile issued a joint statement against the Republican legislation. US Vice-President Mike Pence said on Thursday the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill was their ""last best chance"" to repeal Obamacare. This video can not be played 'Trump not thinking about the little people' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was planning to bring the legislation to a vote next week, but it is unclear now if that will go ahead. Republicans are still reeling from the collapse in July of their efforts to secure Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal Obamacare. US health groups condemn Republican plan A dramatic late-night 'no' vote from Mr McCain - just days after he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour - sunk that bill, too. According to analysis released on Friday, if the Graham-Cassidy bill were to pass, 32 million fewer Americans would have health insurance by 2027. Allow Twitter content?

And the non-partisan Brookings Institution said its findings ""likely understates the reductions in insurance coverage"". The new bill, also drafted by Senator Bill Cassidy, would give states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programmes. But critics say that when left to the states, the money going into the Medicaid programme for people on low incomes would diminish. Republicans have long deplored Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act, as government overreach into the US healthcare system.

Keep EU trade as it is until 2021 - May,"This video can not be played May on Brexit: ""A two year transition period"" PM Theresa May has said there should be a transition period of ""about"" two years after Brexit, during which trade should continue on current terms. EU migrants will still be able to live and work in the UK but they will have to register with the authorities, under her proposals. And the UK will pay into the EU budget so member states are not left out of pocket. She hopes this offer, made in a speech in Italy, will unblock Brexit talks. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier described the speech as ""constructive"" and said the prime minister had shown ""a willingness to move forward"". Reality Check: Decoding the PM's speech Time for action, say businesses Will Tory MPs swallow May's Brexit formula? Recap: May speech and reaction A guide to the Brexit negotiations The prime minister also proposed a ""bold new security agreement"" and said the UK would be the EU's ""strongest partner and friend"". On trade, she said the two sides could do ""so much better"" than adopt existing models. There was ""no need to impose tariffs where there are none now"", the prime minister said. She did not mention how much the UK would be prepared to continue to pay into the EU for two years after it leaves in March 2019, but it has been estimated as being at least 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would ""honour commitments"" made while it had been a member to avoid creating ""uncertainty for the remaining member states"". She also suggested that the UK and EU would continue working together on projects promoting long-term economic development and the UK would want to ""make an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved"". UK expats gathered in Florence to protest ahead of the speech When the two-year transition period is up, the UK and EU could move towards a new ""deep and special partnership,"" she said in her speech. But by March 2019, neither the UK or EU would be ready to ""smoothly"" implement new arrangements needed: ""So during the implementation period access to one another's markets should continue on current terms and Britain also should continue to take part in existing security measures."" Such a period should be ""time limited"", she said, as neither the EU nor the British people would want the UK to remain in the EU longer than necessary - with its length being determined by how long it takes to set up new systems. As new immigration systems would take time to introduce, she said ""people will continue to be able to come and live and work in the UK, but there will be a registration system - an essential preparation for the new regime"". It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Today was not about lavishing detail on the EU side who are eager to understand more about what it is the UK actually wants from them after we leave. It was the notional writing of an undated cheque from us to them, that government insiders hope means next week, when the official talks get back under way, some progress can actually be made. Read Laura's full blog But she hoped to build a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" new economic partnership with the EU in the long-term. This should not be based on existing agreements with Canada or European Economic Area membership, she said, but a ""creative solution"" should be found to reflect the existing relationship between the UK and EU. To EU citizens in the UK she offered reassurance that ""we want you to stay, we value you"" and acknowledged differences with the EU over which courts should guarantee their rights after Brexit. She said she wanted UK courts to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice and hoped ""on this basis, our teams can reach firm agreement quickly"". Cabinet ministers were in the front row in Florence to hear the speech Mrs May opened her speech by saying Brexit was a ""critical time in the evolution of the relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union"". ""I look ahead with optimism, believing that if we use this moment to change not just our relationship with Europe but also the way we do things at home - this will be a defining moment in the history of our nation,"" she told the audience of cabinet members, journalists and Italian dignitaries. Responding to the speech, EU Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier, who did not attend, said the prime minister had ""expressed a constructive spirit which is also the spirit of the European Union during this unique negotiation - the speech shows a willingness to move forward, as time is of the essence"". But he added that while her statements on EU citizens were ""a step forward"", they ""must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the UK government"". And he said he would have to examine the ""concrete implications"" of the UK's pledge that no member state would have to pay more as a result of Brexit adding: ""We shall assess ... whether this assurance covers all commitments made by the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union."" The European Parliament's Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt, said the UK's position,externalwas becoming ""more realistic"" but ""a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question"". Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech suggested the PM had ""listened to Labour and faced up to the reality that Britain needs a transition on the same basic terms to provide stability for businesses and workers"". He added: ""There has to be a transition period to protect jobs. ""Our whole point throughout this whole process has been a Brexit that damages employment and jobs is very, very dangerous for everybody in this country."" The speech was broadly welcomed by pro-EU Conservative MPs Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry, but pro-Brexit former cabinet minister Owen Paterson expressed concern about a two-year period during which ""we are still bound in by European rules"". The speech was called ""positive, optimistic and dynamic"" by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -  who was in the audience days after publishing a 4,000-word article outlining his vision for leaving the EU, which had led to him being accused of being a Brexit ""back-seat driver"". He said: ""We are going to have a transition period and after that, of course, we are going to be taking back control of our borders, of our laws, of our destiny."" Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was an ""excellent speech"", and a ""decisive intervention"" that had given ""great clarity to business and to our EU partners about our ambitions for an interim period, and our plans for the long-term relationship with the European Union"". He was confident ""we're now going to be able to move the negotiations forward"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""Theresa May's vision is that we leave the European Union but we do it in name only. ""We have a transitional period, that begins for a two year [period] and it could go on of course much longer than that, in which case we effectively don't leave anything.""

US-N Korea row 'like kindergarten fight',"Mr Lavrov said the exchanges were ""like when children in a kindergarten start fighting"". Russia's foreign minister has likened the war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un to a kindergarten fight between children. The North Korean leader earlier labelled Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"" after Mr Trump threatened to destroy his country. Mr Trump responded with a tweet calling Kim Jong-un ""a madman"" who ""will be tested like never before!"" Moscow's Sergei Lavrov said a pause was needed, ""to calm down the hotheads"". ""Yes, it's unacceptable to silently watch North Korea's nuclear military adventures but it is also unacceptable to unleash war on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

He called for a political process, which he said was a key part of the United Nations Security Council process. ""Together with China we'll continue to strive for a reasonable approach and not an emotional one like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' The North Korean leader had attacked Donald Trump days after his speech at the UN, in which the US president said he would ""totally destroy"" North Koreaif the US was forced to defend itself or its allies. He also mocked Kim Jong-un with a disparaging nickname, saying: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission."" But the North Korean leader said remarks by the ""deranged"" US president convinced him he is right to develop weapons for North Korea. On Thursday North Korean state news agency released this picture of Mr Kim delivering his statement In anunprecedented personal statement,external, Mr Kim said Mr Trump would ""pay dearly"" for his speech, which he labelled ""unprecedented rude nonsense"". He said Mr Trump had insulted his country in the eyes of the world, and threatened to ""surely and definitely tame the mentally derangedUS dotard with fire."" Experts say this is the first time a North Korean leader has made a direct address to an international audience - and it merits serious and thorough consideration. China also urged a calming of the heated rhetoric on both sides, saying the issue was ""complicated and sensitive"". ""All relevant parties should exercise restraint instead of provoking each other,"" said Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang. Kim's 'dotard' insult explained What weapons does North Korea have? North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has demonstrated unprecedented progress this year. It recently conducted its sixth nuclear test and now claims it has miniaturised a nuclear warhead to fit on a long-range missile. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho earlier warned that Pyongyang could test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean in response to the US president's threat. That would demonstrate North Korea's claimed thermonuclear capability as a credible threat. But the risk of such a move would be very high. It is not certain that missile defence systems in the Pacific could intercept the missile, and the risk of accidentally striking Japan - over which recent tests have flown - could spark a serious conflict. How a Pacific nuclear test might happen How do you defend against Pyongyang? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Earlier, Mr Kim's comments had prompted swift criticism from the Japanese government. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a news conference on Friday: ""North Korea's remarks and behaviour are provocative to regional and international security, and they are absolutely unacceptable."" Mr Trump on Thursday signed a new orderboosting sanctionsagainst North Korea, where the US treasury would target firms and financial institutions doing business with Pyongyang. He said: ""For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs."" The UN Security Council had approved new rounds of sanctions earlier this month aimed at starving North Korea of fuel and income, which were in response to Pyongyang's much-condemnedsixth nuclear teston 3 September.

Chinese firm buys UK chip designer,"Apple uses Imagination's technology in its iPhones UK technology firm Imagination, which designs graphics chips for smartphones, is being bought for Â£550m by a Chinese-backed investment firm. Imaginationput itself up for salein June after Apple, its largest customer, said it would stop using its products. The boss of Imagination, Andrew Heath, said the takeover by China-backed Canyon Bridge was a ""very good outcome"" and would ensure it remained in the UK. It becomes the latest UK chip designer to be bought by a foreign investor. Last year, ARM, which designs microchip technology used in Apple and Samsung smartphones, was bought by Japan's Softbank for Â£24bn. Canyon Bridge recently raised $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) from Chinese investors and has offices in Beijing and San Francisco. The firm said it currently has no plans to cut jobs at Hertfordshire-based Imagination after the takeover. Ray Bingham, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said: ""We are investing in UK talent and expertise in order to accelerate the expansion of Imagination, particularly into Asia, where its technology platform will lead the continued globalisation of British-developed innovation."" Imagination saw its shares halve in value when Apple said in April that it wouldend a deal to use its products. The two firms are still engaged in a dispute over the move - with Imagination questioning Apple's ""assertions"" that it would be able to develop its own computer chip designs without breaching Imagination's intellectual property rights. Apple's royalty payments for the chip technology, used in its iPhones, iPads and iPods, accounted for about half of Imagination's revenues. The Trump administration blocked Canyon Bridge's attempts to buy a US tech firm Mr Heath said: ""Imagination has made excellent progress both operationally and financially over the last 18 months until Apple's unsubstantiated assertions and the subsequent dispute forced us to change course. ""The acquisition will ensure that Imagination - with its strong growth prospects - remains an independent IP licensing business, based in the UK, but operating around the world."" It is not Canyon Bridge's first deal for a Western tech company. The firm is seeking approval for a $1.3bn deal to buy US chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor. Last week, the Trump administrationbarred the saleof Lattice to the Chinese-backed company, citing national security risks.

What does the London Uber ban mean?,"Taxi-hailing app Uber is set to lose its London licence at the end of the month after a ruling from regulators at Transport for London. However, the US tech firm has said it plans to appeal against the ruling. That has made it unclear whether Uber will stop being available to its 3.5 million customers in London. Uber also has more than 40,000 drivers in London, who now face an anxious wait to find out the fate of the company's licence. TfL hasruled it will not renew,externalUber's private hire operator licence after it expires on Saturday 30 September. The body, which operates London's public transport network and regulates taxis in the capital, said Uber was ""not fit and proper"" to hold the licence. London mayor Sadiq Khan backed the decision. There were potential public safety and security implications from the way the company is run, TfL said. It pointed to Uber's approach to: reporting serious criminal offences; obtaining medical certificates; and background checks into drivers. Uber's use of secret software - called ""Greyball"" - which could be used to block regulators from gaining full access to the app, was also cited by TfL in its decision. The company rejected TfL's claims that it endangers public safety and said Greyball had never been used in the UK for the purposes cited by TFL. Uber has 28 days to lodge an appeal, and the firm has said it will do just that. Fred Jones, an executive for Uber UK, told the BBC that Uber would appeal against the decision through the courts and continue operating beyond 30 September. That could see Uber carrying on its operations for months to come, the BBC understands. TfL said Uber can ""continue to operate until any appeal processes have been exhausted"". Nigel Mackay, a lawyer at Leigh Day law firm, which has challenged Uber over its working practices, said Uber's appeal ""could go all the way to the Supreme Court"". ""This could be a lengthy process and the timeline is very difficult to predict. Essentially, how long is a piece of string?"" he added. Could passengers in London still legally book an Uber even if the firm lost its TfL operating licence? In theory, yes. In England and Wales, passengers can book a private hire vehicle from anywhere they like - just so long as the driver, the vehicle and the operator are all licensed by the same authority, and the booking is processed in that authority's area. That doesn't need to be the same place the passenger wants to be picked up or dropped off. Uber has lots of licences outside London, and app-based services like Uber can process bookings almost anywhere they like. TfL aren't happy with this state of affairs and say they're lobbying the government to tighten up the rules. But for the time being, even if Uber lost their London licence, a passenger in the capital could book an Uber licensed in, say, Brighton - and it would be completely above board. London's traditional black cab drivers have fiercely opposed Uber's presence in London. And Uber - which was granted a five-year licence in London in 2012 - has proved a big threat to minicab firms too. TfL's decision provides a big opportunity for those minicab firms to win back customers, said Joseph Evans, an analyst at Enders Analysis. ""If they fail at appeal and they can't get a licence to operate in London, obviously it's a huge opportunity for rivals,"" he said. ""Behind the scenes, without many people noticing, minicab firms have rolled out very similar tech at competitive prices,"" he added. They now offer app booking, quicker pick-up, better transparency on where drivers are, and mobile payments. Yes. Uber left the Texas city of Austin last year after it lost a referendum requiring strict background checks on its drivers. The company has since returned after making some changes, and the same could happen in London, predicts BBC North American tech correspondent Dave Lee. Uber has also run into trouble in major European cities, including in Paris, Brussels and Madrid. In June 2014, taxi drivers across Europe went onstrike in protestat what they regarded as a lack of regulation of the mobile taxi-booking service. In September that same year, a court in Frankfurt, Germany, ruled that the firm lacked the necessary legal permits to operate under German law. Uber later withdrew its services from Frankfurt, Hamburg and Dusseldorf after its business was hampered by regulations. New laws for driversintroduced in Denmarkin 2016, including mandatory meters, also saw the company pulling out after less than three years of service in the country. The firm said in a statement that ""regulations need to change"" in order for it to operate. Uber was banned in Italy earlier this year after a court in Rome upheld a complaint by taxi unions that the firm represented unfair competition for traditional taxis. The ban was later annulled following an appeal by the firm.

'Wrong' gun on Kalashnikov statue removed,"The drawing on the base of the statue (on the right) which showed Germany's StG 44 rifle Workers in Moscow have cut out part of a new monument to a Russian creator of the world famous AK-47 assault rifle because a weapon depicted on the statue was actually a German-designed firearm. Mikhail Kalashnikov's monument was opened this week to great fanfare by government officials and members of the Russian Orthodox Church. But arms experts said a drawing on the base of the statue showed the StG 44 rifle used by the Nazis during WWII. It was removed by an angle grinder. The erroneous drawing was cut out on Friday ""A mistake has been made by the sculptor,"" executive director of the Russian Military Historical Society Vladislav Kononov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. This video can not be played The statue's sculptor says the Kalashnikov is a symbol of Russia The society commissioned the 7.5m (25ft) monument, which shows Kalashnikov holding an AK-47 in his arms. A series of modified AK rifles were etched on a metallic plate on the base of the statue, including the wrong drawing. Russian arms historian Yuri Pasholok was the first to point out the error, and several experts later confirmed this was the case. Sculptor Salavat Shcherbakov said earlier on Friday that ""this is something we're correcting"", adding that ""we're trying to avoid mistakes"", Russia's Rossiya-24 TV channel reported. An honour guard was on hand at the ceremony for the statue's unveiling The automatic rifle is one of Russia's most celebrated weapons, with Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky describing it as the country's ""cultural brand"". Designed by Kalashnikov in 1946, it became one of the world's most familiar weapons used in virtually every major conflict. Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. Although honoured by the state, Kalashnikov himself made little money from his gun. He once said he would have been better off designing a lawn mower. He died in 2013 at the age of 94. The StG-44 (Sturmgewehr 44) was invented by Hugo Schmeisser and first used by Adolf Hitler's troops in 1944. Some experts point to the similarity of the StG-44 and the AK-47, and also mention the fact that Schmeisser - together with a group of German engineers - was forced to work in the Soviet Union after World War II. The AK-47 is one of the world's most familiar weapons used in virtually every major conflict By BBC's Jonathan Marcus The AK-47 assault rifle and its variants equipped the Soviet Red army and became the iconic weapon of popular revolt and insurgency throughout much of the world. It was manufactured in huge numbers in several communist countries. The story that it was the brainchild of the lowly Sergeant Mikhail Kalashnikov made great Soviet propaganda, but the origins of the design remain a mystery. The first automatic weapon of this kind - the Sturmgewehr 44 - was developed by the Germans during the latter part of World War Two. It was well known to the Russians who also benefited from the expertise of captured scientists like Hugo Schmeisser, the man who designed the Sturmgewehr. Developed at a time of extraordinary Stalinist secrecy we will probably never know. Many people may have had critical inputs into the weapon's design but it is by the Kalashnikov name that it will always be known. Kalashnikov inventor gets own statue.

Failing Puerto Rico dam sparks evacuation,"This video can not be played Heavy rainfall from Hurricane Maria put stress on the Guajataca Dam A failing dam is causing ""extremely dangerous"" flooding on a Puerto Rico river in the wake of Hurricane Maria, authorities say. The National Weather Service (NWS) said the ""imminent failure"" of the Guajataca Dam was a ""life-threatening situation"". More than 70,000 people live in the nearby areas of Isabela and Quebradillas. At least 13 people have died since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, knocking out power to the whole island. The Guajataca Dam, at the northern end of Lake Guajataca in the north-west, began to show signs of failing at 14:10 local time (18:10 GMT) on Friday, operators said. The NWS warned of flash flooding in Isabela and Quebradillas. All 70,000 residents were initially told to flee but there are reports that the evacuation zone has since been narrowed. Hurricane Maria nears Turks and Caicos Puerto Rico may be months without power The agency urged residents in the area to move to higher ground in an alert posted on its website. Many who live near the dam are being evacuated by buses. Puerto Rico's governor has called Maria the worst hurricane in a century. Ricardo Rossello says it could take months to restore electricity to all 3.4 million of the US island territory's residents. Roofs were ripped off as strong winds battered Puerto Rico's capital city, San Juan. This video can not be played Where has Hurricane Maria hit? Maria, a category three storm with maximum sustained winds of nearly 193km/h (120mph), was about  265km east-north-east of San Salvador, the National Hurricane Center said in itslatest update at 09:00 GMT on Saturday.,external ""On the forecast track, Maria should move away from the Bahamas into the open waters of the western Atlantic today,"" the NHC said. The hurricane has claimed more than 30 lives across the region, and is the second devastating storm to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season. The first was category five Irma earlier in September. Dominica PM details Maria drama live on Facebook In pictures: Maria aftermath on Puerto Rico Maria also caused widespread destruction on the small island of Dominica when it hit on Monday night, leaving at least 15 dead and 20 missing.

Uber stripped of London licence,"This video can not be played Drivers and passengers react to news that Uber's licence in London will be revoked Uber will not be issued a new private hire licence, Transport for London (TfL) has said. TfL concluded the ride-hailing app firm was not fit and proper to hold a London private hire operator licence. It said it took the decision on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". Confirming it would appeal against the decision, Uber said it showed the world ""far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies"". TfL's concerns include Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. What does the ruling mean? Seven things Londoners will miss if Uber goes Now what next for Uberisation? Your views: Uber London loses licence Uber's current licence is due to run until 30 September. It has 21 days to appeal against TfL's decision and can continue to operate while any appeals are ongoing. Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""I fully support TfL's decision - it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety and security."" Taxi drivers have been campaigning against Uber, such as engaging in this ""go slow"" protest in 2014 Fred Jones, head of cities for Uber across the UK and Ireland, told the BBC Uber drivers had to pass the same safety checks as black cab and mini cab drivers in London. There had been growing speculation that the app could be banned from London. Opponents of the firm claim it causes gridlocked roads and does not do enough to regulate its drivers. But one driver with Uber in London said: ""I don't think it is a fair decision. Uber offers a flexible schedule, and a weekly income."" Chief executive Travis Kalanick, who helped found the company in 2009,resigned in Julyfollowing a series of scandals and criticism of his management style In June,20 staff weresacked after a law firm investigated specific complaints made to the company about sexual harassment, bullying, and retaliation for reporting problems At the start of 2017,the firm paid Â£16.2m ($20m) in the US to settle allegationsit gave false promises to drivers over how much they would earn In October 2016 Uber lost a landmarkemployment tribunal in the UK which ruleddrivers should be classed as workers rather than being self-employed A few months later Uber announced it would offer English courses, financial advice and introduce an appeals panel for its UK workers after facing criticism over lack of support and rights for its drivers In 2014 theNew Delhi government banned app-based taxi companiesafter an Uber driver raped a passenger in his vehicle Uber stopped operating in Austin, Texas,when it was told drivers would have to have fingerprint background checks, but it reinstated its services after the requirement was ended Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London Uber's general manager in London Tom Elvidge said: ""By wanting to ban our app from the capital, Transport for London and the mayor have caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice. ""If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport. ""To defend the livelihoods of all those drivers, and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use our app, we intend to immediately challenge this in the courts."" He said Uber operated in more than 600 cities around the world, including more than 40 towns and cities in the UK. Analysis: From BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones Throughout its short, tempestuous life, Uber has clashed with regulators around the world - and more often than not it has come out on top. Its tactic has often been to arrive in a city, break a few rules, and then apologise when it's rapped over the knuckles. Some regulators have backed down, others have run the company out of town. In London, despite protests from angry taxi drivers, the company has had a relatively easy ride until now. But a wave of bad publicity about its corporate culture, its lax attitude to checks on its drivers and its treatment of this freelance army seems to have spurred TfL into action. Make no mistake, Uber will use every legal avenue to fight this ban. It will argue that consumers, in the shape of the millions of mainly young Londoners who rely on its service, will be seriously let down if it can no longer operate. But the courts will have to balance that with the serious concerns about public safety raised by TfL. On social media, a fierce debate has broken out over the decision. An online petition launched by Uber urging Sadiq Khan to reverse the decision to strip its London licence has been signed by tens of thousands of people in the space of a few hours. Twitter user @Gabbysalaza_said,externalthat she was ""annoyed"" at the decision as Uber allowed to her to get out of ""uncomfy"" situations if out at night. Allow Twitter content?

General secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association Steve McNamara said it was the ""right call"" not to re-license Uber in London. ""This immoral company has no place on London's street,"" he said. Across the world, Uber has been pushed out or denied access by local licensing laws. Legislators in Darwin, in Australia's Northern Territory, are debating whether to allow Uber to return after a raft of reforms designed to open up the ride-sharing market were announced. Uber is currently fighting a test case in Denmark after four if its drivers were found to be in violation of the country's laws requiring taxi meters. David Leam, of London First which campaigns for business in the capital, said London needed to be open to new ideas, business and services. He said: ""This will be seen as a Luddite decision by millions of Londoners and international visitors who use Uber, and will also hit London's reputation as a global tech hub."" James Farrar, chairman of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain's United Private Hire Drivers branch, said it was a ""devastating blow"" for the drivers who now face losing their jobs. ""To strip Uber of its licence after five years of laissez-faire regulation is a testament to a systemic failure at TfL,"" he said.

The mystery of the missing airman," Corrie Mckeague's last known journey was recorded by CCTV. The footage shows him alone, in the early hours of the morning, after a night out drinking last September. Clutching a takeaway, he walks and sometimes staggers through the near-deserted streets of Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk. The time is 01:20 BST. He has become separated from his friends after being thrown out of a nightclub. Soon he will sleep for an hour in a shop doorway. At 03:25, he appears again in front of the cameras in Brentgovel Street. He pauses, before disappearing from view into an area known as the Horseshoe. He has not been seen since. Almost a year on, an enormous police search and social media campaign has found no trace of him. Officers have spent months searching a landfill site for his remains without success. His girlfriend has given birth to their baby daughter. His family fear he is dead but remain haunted by unanswered questions about how he died. According to his mother, the 23-year-old RAF airman was a risk-taker whose approach to life was shaped by a shocking experience in his childhood. Did this play a role in his disappearance? Corrie Mckeague's last known journey was recorded by CCTV. The footage shows him alone, in the early hours of the morning, after a night out drinking last September. Clutching a takeaway, he walks and sometimes staggers through the near-deserted streets of Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk. The time is 01:20 BST.

Almost a year on, an enormous police search and social media campaign has found no trace of him. Officers have spent months searching a landfill site for his remains without success. His girlfriend has given birth to their baby daughter. His family fear he is dead but remain haunted by unanswered questions about how he died. According to his mother, the 23-year-old RAF airman was a risk-taker whose approach to life was shaped by a shocking experience in his childhood. Did this play a role in his disappearance? Corrie was a confident young man, popular with the opposite sex. With his good looks and Scottish accent he stood out from the crowd. Even the way he dressed reflected his outgoing nature. On the night he disappeared he was wearing a pink shirt and white trousers, a look that caught the eye in a small town like Bury St Edmunds. He and his friends from RAF Honington - an airbase 10 miles away - were regulars in Bury’s bars and clubs. On 23 September 2016 they had planned a typical night out. However, there had been a mix up. Two of Corrie’s friends had each thought he was getting a lift with the other - and as a result he was left behind. Undeterred, he drove his BMW into town. Once parked, just after 22:00, he spoke to his younger brother Darroch on the phone for 45 minutes while drinking a bottle of rosé wine. Finally, he caught up with his mates at So Bar. Here, local musician Nick Lowe was playing his normal mix of covers. Corrie was not content to merely listen. Instead he went up to him and asked him to play the 1940s hit ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" while he sang along. Musician Nick Lowe performed an impromptu duet with Corrie in So Bar ""He knew all the words, which surprised me,"" he said. ""When we finished, there was the pitter patter of applause, and I was a bit like ‘what the hell was that?’ It was all very random."" The group then hurried on to Wetherspoon's at about 23:30. Once inside the grandiose former Corn Exchange, Corrie moved around, greeting and hugging people he knew. ""He was coming up to loads of different tables, saying 'hello' to everyone,"" said Megan Manning, who was in the bar that night. ""He was chatty, he was nice."" Bouncer James Dilnot, who knew Corrie as a regular, said he was ""happy, bubbly, bouncing about - his normal self"". ""Through the night he came outside for a cigarette two or three times, had a conversation with me each time and gave me a hug. ""When he left he was intoxicated but he was able and capable of knowing what he was doing, where he was going, who he was with."" The door staff at the next venue were less happy about Corrie. As his group arrived at Flex nightclub at about 00:30, he stumbled through the door, before slurring an ""I love you"" to the manager. About 30 minutes later, he stumbled again while walking past a doorman, who tapped him on the shoulder and firmly told him to leave. Corrie held his hands up before walking back outside. It was just after 01:00. He walked down the street towards his favourite takeaway, Pizza Mama Mia. Here he ordered a huge dinner - two burgers, a kebab and some chips. Collecting his food, he walked a short distance around the corner, before sitting in front of Hughes electrical store to eat. Soon, slumped in the doorway, he was sound asleep. The ""heaven stones"", as Corrie and his two brothers used to call them, were dotted between the ruins of the thick cathedral walls. They stand alongside the soaring towers and arches of the medieval St Andrew’s cathedral, which overlooks the North Sea on the east coast of Scotland. As boys, the brothers loved to play among them. They would study the weather-battered names and dates of each lopsided gravestone, imagining the lives of the people buried below. Behind them, an elderly couple would follow close by. Their grandparents, Oliver and Mary, brought them here most weekends. It had become a bit of a ritual. The Mckeague brothers: Darroch, Corrie and Makeyan ""They were always very good with us,"" recalled Mary. ""We used to take them to the chapel for mass, and then I’d give them the choice of what they wanted to do. ""They always wanted to go for a picnic, and it was always through to St Andrews to the old cathedral."" There were just a couple of years in age between each of the Mckeague brothers - Makeyan, Corrie and Darroch. They lived with their mother and father in the small Fife town of Cupar, a place where most people knew each other, a place surrounded by rolling hills and green fields. The boys made full use of their proximity to the countryside, spending days on their bikes, messing about in a stream or building dens with friends. Corrie and Darroch - the two younger boys - were particularly close. They looked alike and were sometimes mistaken for twins. All three enjoyed the macaroni and cheese their grandmother would make for them, or watching The Simpsons on TV. Their home was full of pets - a dog called Homer and a rat called Stuart Little among their number - and it was a short walk to the primary school the boys attended. However, their happy childhood was not to last. Their parents, Nicola and Martin, divorced and the family was split apart. The boys and their mother moved 30 miles away to Dunfermline. Aged 11, Corrie was hit particularly hard. Corrie's grandmother Mary said Corrie was very upset by his parents' divorce ""The break-up of the marriage affected all three of them, but Corrie most of all,"" his grandmother said. ""He couldn’t handle it. He manipulated other people to get what he wanted. It seemed like he needed a little bit more help than the other two."" Academically, he struggled. There was a delay in diagnosing his dyslexia and he left school aged 16 with few qualifications. Then, in the summer holidays that followed, Corrie experienced a devastating trauma. It was early August, and he had been invited to a friend’s birthday party in Springfield, a few miles from Cupar. Things got out of hand and police were called, his mother Nicola Urquhart said. The group decided to continue the party in nearby woods where they would not disturb anyone. The woods were the other side of a railway track. Natalie Mulholland, with whom Corrie had been friends since primary school, was with the group. As they approached a level crossing, a train hurtled past at 70mph. The group heard a bang. Corrie told his friends to stay back. He walked down the track and saw Natalie had been struck. He found her phone, shoe and then her body. ""That changed him so much,"" Nicola said. ""He really did then have the attitude of ‘I won’t waste my life. If I want to do something fun, I will do it. I will take chances because you don’t know what’s around the corner tomorrow'."" It was an outlook that would shape the rest of his life. Nicola was working out at the gym in Dunfermline when she got the phone call from her youngest son, Darroch.Corrie was missing. It was Monday and no-one had seen or heard from him since the night out in Bury St Edmunds. Her job as a family liaison officer for Police Scotland meant she was adept at detaching herself from the emotion of a situation. But she felt uneasy. Her maternal instincts told her something was wrong. Corrie's eight-month-old puppy, Louell, had been shut in his room at RAF Honington. Corrie wouldn't have left him alone. Corrie hadn’t spoken to her, or his brothers, or anyone else from home over the weekend. That was also out of character. Corrie had left his puppy Louell in his room before going out Corrie had joined the RAF aged 19. It had turned his life around. There had been many occasions when his family feared he would never settle down. At 17, he had moved out of the family home into a flat in Dunfermline, where he lived with his older brother Makeyan. The boys would often go on nights out in the town centre. Lourenzos was one of the Dunfermline bars the brothers frequented ""If you asked me what Corrie liked? Corrie liked to party. He was the life and soul,"" said his father Martin. ""He was partying too much, to be honest with you, out in Dunfermline and in the flat."" Corrie dropped out of college, where he was training to be a hairdresser, and moved back in with his mum. He fell into a series of jobs: Working in a clothes shop, at a call centre and as a fitness instructor. His family was relieved when he announced he would follow in his maternal grandfather's footsteps and join the RAF. However, Corrie found it hard and the RAF threatened to throw him out. ""I remember a phone call with him and he said ‘what am I going to do, Dad?’ ""At that time he was out of control, and wasn't sticking to anything, partying all the time. He was never in trouble with the police, but was going out and drinking. ""I said if you want to stay, you have to try - and he did."" This photograph hangs in the living room of Martin McKeague’s bungalow in Cupar, in a spot where everyone coming through the door can see it. On the day of his passing out ceremony, Corrie's family wasreunited for the first time in years. After years of fractious relations and tension, both of his parents were there to celebrate his success. ""For Corrie, that was a proud moment,"" his stepmother Trisha recalled. ""He told us he got his mum and dad speaking again. ""He wanted to change his life and turn it around for everyone - and he did. It was amazing. It was something else."" It had seemed the young man’s life was finally on track. So what had gone wrong? Where was Corrie? After receiving that phone call from her youngest son, Nicola remembered something she’d heard on the news. I knew something was wrong."" There had been an attempted abduction of a serviceman at RAF Marham in Norfolk, about 30 miles away from Corrie’s base at Honington. At the time, police had said they could not discount terrorism as a motive. Nicola telephoned the guard’s office at RAF Honington. The police were already there, trying to establish Corrie’s last known movements. ""I knew something was wrong, but I also knew [there was] only so much I could do,"" she said. ""I knew they needed information, bank details, phone details, all of that. I know what police officers do when they start to search, and that there was nothing I could do by running down there."" A few days later, and her son still had not turned up. Nicola and Darroch decided to travel down to Suffolk. Martin and Trisha also made the long trip by car, and all four arrived in Bury almost exactly a week after Corrie had last been seen. Their destination was the Horseshoe - the bin loading bay CCTV had recorded Corrie walking into. It had been described to them by officers on the phone but they felt they had to see it with their own eyes. Standing in the middle of a semicircle of the shabby backs of buildings, Nicola wondered: What could have happened to Corrie in this place? And how had he managed to leave it unseen? Nicola was working out at the gym in Dunfermline when she got the phone call from her youngest son, Darroch. Corrie was missing. It was Monday and no-one had seen or heard from him since the night out in Bury St Edmunds. Her job as a family liaison officer for Police Scotland meant she was adept at detaching herself from the emotion of a situation. But she felt uneasy. Her maternal instincts told her something was wrong. Corrie's eight-month-old puppy, Louell, had been shut in his room at RAF Honington. Corrie wouldn't have left him alone. Corrie hadn’t spoken to her, or his brothers, or anyone else from home over the weekend. That was also out of character. Corrie had left his puppy Louell in his room before going out Corrie had joined the RAF aged 19. It had turned his life around. There had been many occasions when his family feared he would never settle down. At 17, he had moved out of the family home into a flat in Dunfermline, where he lived with his older brother Makeyan.The boys would often go on nights out in the town centre. Lourenzos was one of the Dunfermline bars the brothers frequented ""If you asked me what Corrie liked? Corrie liked to party. He was the life and soul,"" said his father Martin. ""He was partying too much, to be honest with you, out in Dunfermline and in the flat."" Corrie dropped out of college, where he was training to be a hairdresser, and moved back in with his mum. He fell into a series of jobs: Working in a clothes shop, at a call centre and as a fitness instructor. His family was relieved when he announced he would follow in his maternal grandfather's footsteps and join the RAF. However, Corrie found it hard and the RAF threatened to throw him out. ""I remember a phone call with him and he said ‘what am I going to do, Dad?’ ""At that time he was out of control, and wasn't sticking to anything, partying all the time. He was never in trouble with the police, but was going out and drinking. ""I said if you want to stay, you have to try - and he did."" This photograph hangs in the living room of Martin McKeague’s bungalow in Cupar, in a spot where everyone coming through the door can see it. On the day of his passing out ceremony, Corrie's family wasreunited for the first time in years. After years of fractious relations and tension, both of his parents were there to celebrate his success. ""For Corrie, that was a proud moment,"" his stepmother Trisha recalled. ""He told us he got his mum and dad speaking again. ""He wanted to change his life and turn it around for everyone - and he did. It was amazing. It was something else."" It had seemed the young man’s life was finally on track. So what had gone wrong? Where was Corrie? After receiving that phone call from her youngest son, Nicola remembered something she’d heard on the news. I knew something was wrong."" There had been an attempted abduction of a serviceman at RAF Marham in Norfolk, about 30 miles away from Corrie’s base at Honington. At the time, police had said they could not discount terrorism as a motive. Nicola telephoned the guard’s office at RAF Honington. The police were already there, trying to establish Corrie’s last known movements. ""I knew something was wrong, but I also knew [there was] only so much I could do,"" she said. ""I knew they needed information, bank details, phone details, all of that. I know what police officers do when they start to search, and that there was nothing I could do by running down there."" A few days later, and her son still had not turned up. Nicola and Darroch decided to travel down to Suffolk. Martin and Trisha also made the long trip by car, and all four arrived in Bury almost exactly a week after Corrie had last been seen. Their destination was the Horseshoe - the bin loading bay CCTV had recorded Corrie walking into. It had been described to them by officers on the phone but they felt they had to see it with their own eyes. Standing in the middle of a semicircle of the shabby backs of buildings, Nicola wondered: What could have happened to Corrie in this place? And how had he managed to leave it unseen? The Horseshoe is an unappealing place. An open space, surrounded by the backs of shops, with litter strewn on the floor and cigarette ends clustered in saucers left by workers. Large red and blue bins are lined up on one side, overflowing with sacks of waste, juice cartons, scraps of paper and rotting bits of food. It has a reputation as a haunt for drug users. There are no CCTV cameras on the high walls of the buildings surrounding the bins. Unless someone walks past, it is not monitored. In theory, it is impossible to leave the Horseshoe without being picked up by the cameras on the surrounding streets. Short Brackland, Brentgovel Street and the road towards McDonald's are all covered by CCTV. Corrie's movements on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday were captured, but the trail went cold when he walked into the Horseshoe at 03:25. The only hint of where he was came from his mobile phone signal. It was picked up in the early hours of Saturday where it was to be expected - in Bury town centre. But at 08:00 it was 12 miles away, in Barton Mills. Soon police realised the movements of the phone matched those of a bin lorry which had been to the Horseshoe not long after Corrie was last seen and travelled to a landfill site. It seemed the obvious explanation. Corrie had somehow either got into the lorry or been put there and then travelled to the landfill site. Corrie would take risks that other people wouldn’t."" Police later said he had previously been known to sleep in rubbish after a night out. But his mother disputes that he would have tried to sleep in a bin. She points to his pride in his appearance and the fact he could have easily slept in his car, which was only a short walk away. Talking in general about his character, though, she admits he could be reckless and would not always think of the consequences of his actions. ""Corrie would take risks that other people wouldn’t because he truly believed that he could handle himself,"" she said. ""I have never tried to paint that boy as a saint,"" she added. ""If anything was going to go wrong with any of my boys it was always going to be to him. ""If anyone was going to be in trouble it was always going to be him. ""If anyone was going to have drama, it was always him. ""He is absolutely adored by everybody – every girl he meets falls in love with him, every bloke he meets just thinks he’s the funniest person going."" Many people have questioned why the waste site was not searched earlier. Weight data from the bin lorry indicated it had carried a load of about 11kg - far too light to have included Corrie. As a result, police decided not to search the landfill site. ""You've got a situation where the weight was the only blocking fact to the logical explanation,"" said Colin Sutton, a former detective with the Metropolitan Police. ""They knew he went into the Horseshoe at a certain time, they knew his phone followed the route of the bin lorry - the only thing that prevented that hypothesis was the weight."" However, although Corrie's mobile phone was moving at a similar pace to the bin lorry, police believed his body would have been detected long before it reached the landfill. ""The strongest line of inquiry at that time was that Corrie had tried to walk home,"" said Det Supt Kate Elliott, of Suffolk Police. Was not searching the landfill site the right decision? It was now December. In a misty woodland near RAF Honington, the dull light was beginning to fade. Nicola was using a long stick to search through the undergrowth for any signs of her son. Witnesses had told police after Corrie left the nightclub he had told them he planned to walk the 10 miles back to RAF Honington. To cover as wide an area as possible, Nicola and other members of the public had been allowed to join the official search. Supporters calling themselves ""Corrie's Army"" used Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness of the case all over the world and keep the story in the public eye. One Facebook post, next to a photograph of Nicola searching through woodland, read: ""This mum is searching forest undergrowth for her child. Her baby boy. Though an adult, he's her baby still.... It could be one of us parents looking for our child instead. This photo of Nicola searching through woodland was shared worldwide ""You'd want everyone to help in ANY way. A tweet. A share. A pound. This photo could be you."" The post was shared almost 270,000 times and resonated around the world. Nicola made an emotional appearance on ITV’s This Morning in early January for anyone who might have seen or heard from Corrie to come forward. Media attention ratcheted up another notch when, on 9 January, a 21-year-old fitness instructor called April Oliver revealed she was pregnant with Corrie's child. April Oliver later gave birth to a baby daughter She and Nicola told reporters she had not found out about the baby until mid-October, two weeks after Corrie went missing. Suddenly, pictures of the good-looking couple were splashed across newspapers and websites. Further revelations about Corrie’s sex life were to come, including the couple’s membership of an online swinging site. Soon questions were even beingasked about the case in Parliament. The #FindCorrie hashtag was already trending on social media and the family were being overwhelmed by the amount of information pouring in. After a crowdfunding campaign, a private company was brought in to trawl through it all before passing anything relevant on to police. But the physical searching and scouring of social media failed to turn up any significant new evidence. Theories were raised and discounted. People recorded on CCTV in Bury on the night Corrie went missing were traced and spoken to, but provided nothing in the way of clues. Suffolk Police - one of the smallest forces in the country - was coming under increasing pressure. The investigation had only ever managed to establish one thing: The movement of Corrie’s phone matching those of a bin lorry. But the weight data appeared to make the landfill an unlikely place for Corrie to have ended up. The discovery of a major error in the bin weight data changed all that. The artificial scent of bubblegum was being pumped out over the landfill site to disguise the stench of decomposition. Eight police officers, dressed in white boiler suits and masks, were poking through the rubbish. They were looking for a clue, any clue, as to what happened to Corrie Mckeague. It had emerged the bin lorry that had travelled from the Horseshoe to the landfill site had a load of more than 100kg, rather than 11kg as first thought. It was therefore possible Corrie had been inside. A 26-year-old Biffa employee was arrested in March on suspicion of perverting the course of justice but was later released without charge. It seemed the data error had been accidental. For Corrie’s loved ones, the discovery was a devastating blow. Any last hope he might have gone absent without leave, or chosen to hide away somewhere, seemed to have been extinguished. Their torment grew as the search dragged on for months. Corrie's mother and brothers could not face visiting the landfill site, but his father regularly travelled down from Cupar to be near the search. ""With every lift of the bucket - the jaws of the excavator - there’s every chance Corrie could be lifted in that,"" he said. However, on 21 July, after more than four months, the search was finally called off. Within days, 25,000 people had signed a petition calling for the search to be resumed. Corrie's father even went to the lengths ofblockading it with his motorhome, hoping to persuade police to change their mind. Police insisted the decision to call the search off was not due to the cost, which was more than £1.2m. They said they had exhausted the area where Corrie's body was most likely to be - but there was no evidence to support any theory ""other than that Corrie was in the bin"". However, there has been criticism from several quarters. Corrie's brothers, Makeyan and Darroch, with their mother Nicola Nicola said she was ""angry... beyond devastated"" at being ""misled"" by police, saying: ""They truly had me believing that he’s in there."" ""I can live with Corrie never being found - any parent would just find a way of coping with that - but that’s on the back of knowing that everything has been done to try to find them,"" she added. ""Why waste £1m searching if you’re not going to finish it?"" Former Met officer Mr Sutton said: ""It seems pretty self-evident if you're actually committed to [the search], and you believe you know where he is, then keep looking there. ""We were told that money is not the issue so, if it isn't the issue, then I don't see any good reason for stopping."" Police were arguably facing an uphill battle though. The 120-acre site  takes in 96,000 tonnes of waste each year and - in some places - the rubbish is 26ft (8m) deep. Officers were able to locate the section where waste from Bury St Edmunds would have been deposited, but even this took months to search. The five-month delay between Corrie's disappearance and the start of the search would also have hindered their efforts. Forensic pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton said if Corrie's body had been crushed in the lorry, it would have decomposed at a faster rate. It would also have made it difficult to carry out tests if his remains were found. ""A lot of information will have been lost, and there would be a greater potential for contamination,"" he said. ""Even if a fresh body [was in the landfill], there’s so much DNA going on [in the waste], the potential for contamination is huge."" A scrap of clothing, a shoelace, a mobile phone cover, could all have answered the questions they were asking. But there was nothing. Suffolk Police have said no new rubbish will be disposed of in the area where they have been searching until a review of the investigation has been carried out. Corrie's father Martin and stepmother Trisha Corrie's father said he welcomed this. ""From the leads and the facts the police have, he must be in the landfill,"" he said. ""If it does come back that Corrie’s in the landfill, I fully expect them to search there again. ""That’s my son in there."" April Oliver gave birth to a healthy baby girl in June. She named her Ellie-Louise. During the later stages of her pregnancy she had posted a photo of herself alongside an emotional statement on her Facebook account. She was holding a pair of baby boots, similar in style to the ones Corrie was wearing on the night he went missing. ""Your daddy would be proud of you my little one and would love you as much as I do,"" she wrote. ""Corrie will be a part of both of us forever and no-one can take that away."" They had been in a relationship for five months when he went missing. April with her baby daughter, Nicola's mother Pat Spencer and Nicola When the personal trainer announced her pregnancy, she described her boyfriend as ""just the sweetest and most outgoing person I've ever known"". Thanks to the high profile campaign to find him, his daughter will at least have some sense of who he was. A couple of months after Corrie went missing, Nicola posted a video of him sitting in the back garden singing ""I Want to be Popular"" from the musical Wicked. ""That just sums that boy up completely,"" she said. She has pledged never to give up trying to find out what happened to her son, saying she owed it to the members of the public who had supported her. In August, she also said her granddaughter gave her a strength she never realised she had. Writing on Facebook, next to a photograph of Ellie-Louise, she said: ""Some days are difficult. ""Trying to find something positive in each day always helps. I am sharing a photo with each of you on this page, it was taken this morning while we were all sitting in the Suffolk sunshine. ""This is the hand of one of my sons being held by the daughter of his brother. ""This photo, to me, is simply beautiful. It gives me a strength I never realised I have. ""There are still so many unanswered questions about what has happened to Corrie, but I do feel confident that all these will be investigated and answered. ""So many of you keep asking questions we are also still asking, I just wanted to let you all know my determination to find Corrie is as strong as ever."" Built with Shorthand"
Strictly Come Dancing: Can you predict the winner?,"This video can not be played What can you tell from the scores of previous winners and losers? The BBC's Reality Check team was wondering, after 14 series of Strictly Come Dancing, an extraordinary amount of fake tan and millions of sequins, what can numbers tell us about who might win? We have taken the judges' scores for all the contestants every week for all 14 series of the programme, largely from the fan-siteUltimate Strictly,external, and looked at whether you can predict the outcome using statistics. The Strictly team does not give out the results of the public vote, even to us, so we'll have to go on what the judges said and which couples were ejected from the competition each week. The first series of Strictly, won by Natasha Kaplinsky and Brendan Cole, ran for only eight weeks This is what we discovered. At first glance it looks as if the number of points the couples get from the judges has been increasing, especially in the first six series. In this chart, we've looked at the average number of points given by the judges in each series. If you've really been concentrating, you'll know that in the 14 series there were a total of four weeks when they had five judges - we've adjusted for that. But if you look further into the numbers, it turns out that there is a more important factor than points inflation. The first series of Strictly ran for eight weeks with eight celebrities - series 14 had 15 couples and 13 weeks of competition. It means that the finalists in the last series had almost twice as many programmes to hone their skills as the ones in the first - so no wonder they were getting 40s by the end, while the average score in the final in 2004 was 28. It will be no surprise to regular viewers of the show that the toughest judge to please is Craig. On average, he is about a point tougher on contestants than the other judges are. In the first 14 series, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman served as three of the four judges, with occasional help from guest judges. In series 15, Shirley Ballas is replacing Len Goodman as head judge The fourth spot was taken by Arlene Philips for six series, Alesha Dixon for three and Darcey Bussell for five. But while it is harder to impress Craig, if you get a 10 from him you are almost certain to make it to the last three in the competition. It should be said though that he doesn't give 10s early in the competition. Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna in episode eight of series seven, and Danny Mac and Oti Mabuse in episode nine of series 14 were his earliest. There are all sorts of perceptions about easy and difficult dances, with some striking fear into the heart of competitors. Ed and Katya actually got 26 points for their cha cha cha, their second highest score Some dances do appear to be harder than others - but the effect is small. Each of the samba, rumba, cha-cha-cha and jive has resulted in scores that were 1.5 points lower on average than for other dances (that is, 1.5 points out of 40), which is probably not enough to send a would-be winner to the dance-off. And in case you were wondering, there is no significant impact from where you appear in the show - going first or last won't affect your chances. Viewers may be pleased to hear that you can't predict the winner or the finalists completely reliably. If you look at the situation half way through the competition, it is possible to make predictions of who the last three couples in the competition will be that were about 70% accurate for the 14 series so far. The most important determinant at that stage is how many points the couples get from the judges that week. Whether they have yet been involved in a dance-off makes surprisingly little difference. There is evidence that the judges tend to give slightly higher scores to female celebrities, but it's not enough to influence who gets to the dance-off or indeed who wins the competition, which has been won eight times by men and six times by women. And it's important to stress that it's still all to play for - if a couple reaches the half-way stage, then there is nothing they can have done so far that means they definitely won't get into the final. But that's not to say there isn't a reliable indicator out there that we haven't tested. Could shoe size be the key indicator? Or the number of rhinestones on the costume? Or what the judges had for breakfast? Strictly-obsessed statisticians - we lay down the gauntlet to you.

May speech a 'sympathetic gesture',"The PM aimed to speed up Brexit negotiations ""At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great, we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we have to pay afterwards."" Forgive the delving into my fifth year English homework. (Before you ask: EM Forster, A Room with a View, the homework was rather a long time ago.) But, when someone has said it better before, why try to say it again. Theresa May's speech is indeed, above all else, an attempt at a ""sympathetic gesture"", an admission that the UK government is willing to pay tens of billions of taxpayers' cash to the EU over the next couple of years, and acknowledgement that there will have to be a limited, but extended period of time - a transition period - where the relationship between the UK and the EU might not actually change very much. It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Live: Theresa May's Florence speech PM sets out UK offer to break deadlock Today was not about lavishing detail on the EU side who are eager to understand more about what it is the UK actually wants from them after we leave. It was the notional writing of an undated cheque from us to them, that government insiders hope means next week, when the official talks get back under way, some progress can actually be made. It was also about reassuring business that there will be time for them to get used to the idea of leaving, for new systems and infrastructure to be set up. And reassurance too, the aim was, for the three million or so EU citizens who've made their home in the UK. Politically ministers know they might face a backlash, and there is certainly a range of opinions, shall we say, in Cabinet about the pace of change. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is already accusing the PM of sticking ""two fingers up to the great unwashed"". I'm not sure many of the 17 million people who voted to leave would appreciate being described that way, but it is certainly likely many Leave voters will feel peeved that complete withdrawal might take so long, and might also cost so much. The issue of transition was never much discussed during the referendum campaign, and voters were told they could expect money back, rather than keep paying in. Even though this has been pretty clear in Whitehall for many months, today is the first proper attempt the prime minister has made to communicate that reality more clearly. But beyond that, Friday's speech represents no sudden dramatic breakthrough. She has been more explicit about cash and about transition, but is very far from giving full details of what that might actually mean in practice. Of course whatever the UK wants or asks for is subject to negotiation. But Continental frustration that the UK is being slow to be clear about its wants and desires won't disappear. Theresa May has made no new blinding discoveries in this Renaissance city. But she hopes to have inched forward a process that has many miles to go.

The politician who only showers every three days,"How far would you go to save water? Well, for the head of a provincial government in South Africa, it seems there is no sacrifice too big. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has revealed that she showers only every third day. But it seems that what may appear at first to be a drastic, move is, in fact, a noble one. And her reason? The Western Cape - famed for its winelands, mountains and beaches - has been experiencing severe water shortages which have worsened in the last year because of a drought in the region. ""I shower brieflyâ once every three daysâ and for the rest wash in the hand basin. I used to wash my hair every dayâ but now only when I showerâ with visibly negative consequences,"" Ms Zille wrote in a column. ""Howeverâ I regard oily hair in a drought to be as much of a status symbol as a dusty car."" Still, Ms Zille, the founder of South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), has shocked many with the revelations of her showering schedule. Allow Twitter content?

She caused a storm recently after posting a tweet in which she suggested there weresome positive aspects of colonialism. Who is Helen Zille? Of course, for some South Africans, sacrificing your shower time might seem to be a middle-class problem. Those living in Cape Town's informal settlements have to rely on a communal tap for water and bath out of a basin, while low-income households would usually have running water in the house and a bath. This latest statement, however, has some thinking that her take on water preservation is admirable. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

So how did we end up knowing about the hygiene habits of one of South Africa's best-known politicians? Well, Ms Zille was rebuffing a recent article by TimesLive which raised questions about the provincial department's use oftax-payers' money to install a water purification system,externalat her official residence in Cape Town. Desperate to show that she takes the water crisis seriously, she said: ""As for my husband and Iâ we try to use so little waterâ that I sometimes get worried about the hygienic and aesthetic consequences."" The news might have provided some light relief on social media but for residents of the province, the water shortages are no laughing matter. The average water level of dams across the Western Cape is 35%â a significant drop from the 61% at the same time last year, according to the province's water affairs department. Cape Town residents are only allowed to use 87 litres of water a day As a result, what is known as ""level five restrictions"" on water use are now in place - with each of its six million residents allowed to use no more than 87 litres a day. The average eight-minute shower uses 62 litres, accordingto a 2011 study- 70% of each person's daily allowance. Those who use too much face the possibility of a fine, with harsher measures brought in against certain businesses. But water use is difficult to keep tabs on, and so residents have been implored to ""self-police"". It doesn't appear to be working. Authorities say residents and businesses simply haven't been doing enough to adhere to the new rules. The province is now looking at investing in alternative methods of water supply, including recycling and extraction of ground water.

The biggest jailbreak in UK history,"This video can not be played IRA inmates escaped from the prison Thirty-four years ago, a team of IRA inmates escaped from what was supposed to be the most secure prison in Europe. It was, and remains, the biggest jailbreak in UK history. Despite being on the wrong side of 60, Brendan Mead is still a physically intimidating man. Shaven headed, lean and muscular, he has the air of someone who has known violence up close and personally. He was chosen as the ""tip of the spear"" for one of the most dramatic operations in Northern Ireland's decades of violence. He struck the first blow to start the 1983 breakout from the Maze Prison. Thirty-eight hardened paramilitaries used smuggled guns and knives to take over their block before escaping across the crop-filled fields surrounding the jail, some 12 miles from Belfast. The entrance to H-6 inside the former maximum security prison Republicans, with a sense of pride, hold it up as their Great Escape; Unionists recall how one prison officer was killed and others were so seriously injured or traumatised that their lives were effectively ruined. With its warders backed up by armed soldiers and its distinctively-shaped 'H' blocks, purpose built to house Northern Ireland's feared paramilitaries, HMP Maze became an instantly recognisable feature on the violent landscape of the Troubles. It stood as another reminder of how things in Northern Ireland were not the same as in the rest of the UK. Prison officer James Ferris died of a heart attack after being stabbed while attempting to stop the breakout. Sixteen escapees were later acquitted of his murder after the trial failed to prove the heart attack was caused by the stabbing.

A key organiser of the biggest prison breakout in UK history, he has spoken for the first time about what remains one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Mead reveals: A second escape was planned, this time involving a gun battle, from the Crumlin Road jail in Belfast The Maze escape faltered as IRA prisoners searched for details of informers Details of the shooting of a prison officer moments after a confrontation with future Sinn FÃ©in MLA Gerry Kelly A huge security operation was launched after the escape Mead was chosen to be the first prisoner to overpower a guard. This was because he was regarded by his fellow inmates as ""the fittest man in H7"". This is the first time in 34 years that Mead has spoken on the record about his role in the events. He revealed that the getaway vehicle used in the Maze breakout, a food delivery lorry, was delayed because IRA ""intelligence officers"" were rifling through drawers and boxes of papers after taking control of the wing. This video can not be played Brendan Mead speaks for the first time about his role in the 1983 Maze Escape ""The IRA volunteers, particularly the IOs [information officers] preferred to find out who had been an informer or who was working for the prison staff, or who was working for whomever. ""They needed to get that documentation, but they became more focused on that, going through the information trying to find out if there were informers in the ranks."" Mead says that five-minute delay caused problems for the escapees as their vehicle was still in the yard when prison officers began arriving for the next shift. Some of the Maze escapees He revealed, for the first time, details of a 'sister' escape plan which targeted the Crumlin Road jail. It was to have been put into operation after any Maze escape prisoners, who had been recaptured, had been sent there ahead of a trial. Brendan Mead said: ""It was already set up. This is the escape trial we're talking about. Everything we needed was packed into the mortar tubes and they were to be shot over at an exact time when we were in 'A' wing yard. This video can not be played Brendan Mead says a second jail escape was planned ""We were to open the mortar tubes, take out the equipment, and then breach the Crumlin Road as well. ""But that didn't happen because, the people who were on the mortar tubes, they were caught inside a garage at the back of the prison from where they were going to shoot them over. "" Mead accepts that ""people's lives were destroyed by what happened"" on the day of the Maze escape. People like John Adams, the prison officer shot in the head during the jailbreak. Visitors arriving at the Maze Prison in the 1980s BBC News NI has obtained documents from the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) relating to the subsequent trial of two leading escapees, Brendan 'Bic' McFarlane and Gerry Kelly. They offer a fascinating insight into what went on in the Maze that day. Among those documents, John Adams' account of what happened. In his statement Mr Adams claims Gerry Kelly shot him in the control room. It reads: This video can not be played Prison officer John Adams' statement to the trial of two Maze escapees ""At 2:20 PM prisoner 58, Kelly, appeared at the grille with a gun pointed at me. He told me not to touch any of the controls or warnings. ""He then told me to open the gate which I did do. He said, ""I have nothing to lose; you know what I'm in for."" ""He then told me to lie down on the ground, put my hands behind my head. This was inside the control room. ""Kelly was distracted by something and turned away from me. I jumped up and slammed the door and tried to lock it, but it was forced open. ""Kelly then came back into the control room and fired two shots. The first one missed me and the second hit me above the left eye, entering my head. I collapsed to the floor."" Gerry Kelly had been jailed for life in 1973 - after the Maze Escape he was eventually captured in Holland In a conversation with BBC News NI in 2013, Mr Adams repeated the version of events outlined in his original statement, once again naming the Sinn FÃ©in man as his attacker. Gerry Kelly has never admitted shooting Mr Adams and was found not guilty after his trial in 1987. In his own book about the escape, Kelly refers to the person who shot John Adams only as 'the prisoner.' Some years after the shooting, John Adams was convicted of sexually assaulting a young girl. Mr Adams died on August 16 last year. This video can not be played 'No one was to be hurt,' says Brendan Mead He was buried on August 31, the arrangements having been made by the hospital in which he died. His grave is as yet unmarked. Brendan Mead maintains that, while he was nearby, he didn't see the actual shooting incident. Addressing any allegations that still exist, is, he insists, something that only Gerry Kelly can do. ""John Adams said it was Gerry Kelly who shot him. If that's where Gerry was, then that's his thing. He's to address that, not me. Army at the scene of the Maze escape ""Apparently Gerry was at the control room and, whatever happened between him and John, the shots then went off."" Other documents in the bundle released by PRONI include a handwritten note which was to be read to IRA members who were chosen to take part in the escape. It suggests that the IRA leadership feared the rank and file members would not go along with the plan. It makes it clear that any prisoners told to join the escape would have no option but to go along with it. This video can not be played A note to be read to IRA members who were chosen to take part in the breakout It reads as follows: ""To all POWs (Prisoners of War) chosen by camp staff to go on escape. ""Very few of you are aware of what is now taking place. This is due to security and the possible refusal of some of you to go on this escape. Since it is the duty of all POWs to escape I now instruct you to go to this yard to board the feed lorry. Regardless of your feelings we are taking you with us, we have no time for arguments. Just do as instructed. Any refusals will be met with force."" Another note was apparently intended for prison staff taken hostage: Among the papers held at the Public Records Office is a note apparently intended for prison staff taken hostage ""To all prison staff who have been arrested by Republican POWs on Sunday, September 25. ""What has taken place here today was a carefully planned exercise to secure the release of a substantial number of POWs. The block is now under our control. This video can not be played Jailbreak delayed as 'IRA tried to find out if there were informers' ""If anyone has been assaulted or injured, this has been a result of his refusal to cooperate with us. It is not our intention to settle old scores, ill-treat nor degrade any of you regardless of your past. Though should anyone try to underestimate or wish to challenge our position, he or they will be dealt with severely. ""Anyone who refuses to comply with our instructions now or in the future will feel the wrath of the Republican movement. Should any members of the prison administration ill-treat, victimise or commit any acts of perjury against Republican POWs in any follow-up enquiries, judicial or otherwise, they will forfeit their lives for what we will see as a further act of repression against the nationalist people. This video can not be played A note from IRA members to prison staff taken hostage ""To conclude, we give you our word as Republicans that none of you will come to any harm providing you cooperate fully with us. ""Anyone who refuses to do so will suffer the ultimate consequence - death! ""Let common sense prevail, do not be used as cannon fodder by the prison administration nor the faceless bureaucrats at Stormont and Whitehall."" A film about the escape, entitled simply Maze, goes on general release today. As with all interpretation of our past, whether through drama or documentary, controversy seems inevitable. Asked if it was too soon for a movie about the escape, Mead said he worried that the film makers would glorify it to some extent, but that for him it was just history. ""What do I think about the escape? I don't really think anything of the escape,"" he said. Will he go and see the film? The premiere of the new film MAZE took place in Belfast ""It would be hard to match the reality,"" he said. ""I don't even know if I would watch it, it's not something that drives me. That's not my life anymore. ""It's part of my past. It's something that I participated in. I don't try to glorify that past; it's a reality and I have to acknowledge that I was a full, consenting, participant in it all. ""It's not like I'm saying: 'Oh look at me, look at what we done'. I could have played for Manchester United. That's part of my history that didn't happen. ""I believed in my mindset at that time that it was a necessary thing to do. There was only one negative thing about it and that's that some people were badly injured and their lives were destroyed by it."" Lives were destroyed by the events of that day; that is not in dispute. Thirty-four years may have passed but it's clear that many of the officers taken hostage, hooded and terrorised, are still struggling to come to terms with what they experienced. BBC News NI approached several officers who were working in the Maze at, or around, the time of the breakout. Only one agreed to an interview. As the time to meet neared, though, the now-retired officer pulled out. The enforced reflection had been just too much for him. ""The trauma is incredible,"" he explained. None of his colleagues felt willing or able to contribute to this article. The UK's biggest prison escape.

Election marks shift in German politics,"Merkel looks set to win a fourth term as Chancellor - but in a wholly different German political landscape Rock music blaring, supporters cheering, Angela Merkel sweeps on to the makeshift stage. Under spotlights hastily rigged above what's usually an indoor tennis complex, the chancellor is relaxed and smiling as she acknowledges the applause of her loyal fans. A few exuberant refugees - carefully chosen and given front row seats - wave a huge banner.  Almost unnoticed, security staff quietly hustle a couple of scruffily dressed men out of the hall. Mrs Merkel has been heckled several times on the campaign trail by supporters of the right-wing party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD). No one here is taking any chances. In fact her rallies have been moved to indoor venues during the last week of campaigning. As she launches into a well-rehearsed speech without notes, Angela Merkel knows she will - most likely - win this election. To many Germans she represents strength and stability in the shifting world of global politics. Her carefully stage-managed campaign is designed to reflect her experience; 12 years in the job. Even Mrs Merkel's trademark hand gesture - fingers held together to form a diamond shape while she speaks - has been replicated on the banners held up by the cheering audience. German election: Why this vote matters Angela Merkel has already spent 12 years in the role If the polls are right, a clear majority of German voters will choose Angela Merkel as their leader for the next four years. But then German voters don't have much choice. In the centrist politics of Germany today, commentators note that it can be hard to distinguish the mainstream parties from one another. And Mrs Merkel hasn't had to work particularly hard to see off the diminishing challenge of social democrat Martin Schulz. In the old marketplace of Schwerin, shoppers have mixed views. One woman tells me that ""Mrs Merkel is a bit too soft. She seems easily influenced. I can't decide who to vote for"". Both Mrs Merkel and the AfD divide opinion on issues such as immigration The man selling honey at a nearby stall says: ""I like her a lot. She has very good policies and I particularly like her refugee policy."" But a young woman adds: ""The big parties are already in power and they didn't do that much good. I don't want to support them with my vote."" Around the corner the smashed windows of a shop front tell the real story of this election. The local AfD headquarters has been repeatedly vandalised. Someone has scrawled ""hate Nazis"" on the building.  AfD's anti-Islam, anti-immigrant rhetoric may horrify many Germans but in this region, in Germany's old east, one in five voters are expected to support the party. What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? The moment a famous refugee meets a right-wing nationalist As we walk along the lakeside here, among gulls and swans, Rolf Kronhagel explains why he shifted his allegiance to AfD. He's a teacher who turned his back on the social democrats. It was AfD's opposition to gay marriage that first won him over, he says. He likes their focus on traditional family politics. He also likes their stance on migrants.  Mr Kronhagel teaches new arrivals the German language and explains that, in his experience, whilst many want to work and integrate, too many refuse to assimilate into German culture and society. The AfD has seen a resurgence in the German polls ""In a way,"" he says, ""AfD is already sitting at the table of government. It's the most influential party in Germany because it breathes down the neck of the mainstream parties. ""You can see the concrete results of that in Germany's new asylum laws. People are tired of hearing the same old things."" Nationally, support for AfD surged during the refugee crisis but diminished as migrant numbers fell. But it's climbed back up in the polls, largely thanks to a campaign which focuses on immigration. One shows a pregnant white woman with the slogan ""New Germans? We make them ourselves"". Another shows two bikini clad white women along with the catchphrase ""Burkas? We like bikinis"". The AfD campaign and emphasis on anti-immigration rhetoric has divided Germans AfD is on course to comfortably win seats in parliament. It would be the first time since WW2 that a far-right party is represented in the Bundestag. It Is estimated that around one in 10 Germans support the party. What began life on the political fringe is fast becoming mainstream. The established parties here say they won't do business with AfD but it may yet emerge as the third largest group in the next Bundestag. Polls suggest there may be six parties altogether in the next parliament (there are currently four). A place which prides itself now on compromise and consensus is likely to be a rowdier, more fractious place. Those who describe this election as dull, this campaign as lacklustre, miss the fact that something really significant is happening here. The 2017 election marks an unprecedented shift in both the tone and substance of post-war German politics. What is the political norm in many other European countries was unthinkable here. Not any more.

Was this the BIG SPEECH?,"This video can not be played May on Brexit: ""A two year transition period"" There is a problem with BIG SPEECHES. Yes, BIG SPEECHES in capital letters. They are often postponed, because governments take longer than they had hoped to make their minds up about what they want to say. They are sometimes born out of parties looking for a way out of a dead end - ""there will be a BIG SPEECH on that in the coming months""... ""Don't worry about us not having answers about that right now, it's because we are holding back those really, BIG, BIG serious thoughts for the BIG SPEECH"". ""What big speech?"" ""Ah, you'll see, the REALLY BIG SPEECH"". Cue expectations raised, opponents' appetites whetted, backbenchers hoping their leaders are on the verge of a miraculous solution that will somehow find the resolution to a problem that has plagued their party for years. Yes, this time, the ""REALLY BIG, BIG SPEECH"", will be the one that will provide a never-ending supply of milk and honey to run from the nation's taps and inspire a grateful nation to cleave to their leader, their party, once more full of promise, hope and vigour. Sometimes, former practitioners of what I suppose is, after all, the art of politics would admit now in private that those ""big speeches"" were sometimes - guess what? - a result of that all-too-human instinct: why deal with a problem today what you can possibly put off until tomorrow? Something looks a bit hard? Don't worry, promise a big speech, and you essentially give yourself more time to find a way out of a thorny problem. Cynicism aside, there have, of course, been plenty of occasions where a big speech has indeed been the product of months of new thinking, that in turn has brought about major change. But so often, expectations of the BIG SPEECH spiral out of control. The crashing realisation that the occasion will induce no gasps of shock, no shrieks of horror or cries of joy, leads only to a narrative that the speech ""failed to inspire"", ""fell short"", or was ""snubbed"". This time, for this BIG SPEECH, both things are true. As has been written about so much this week, both here and elsewhere, there is still no friendly concordat in the cabinet over the architecture of our long-term relationship with Europe. Should the ties be closely woven threads, or long, flimsy connectors that hardly bind? They disagree and they haven't decided yet. The speech, therefore, didn't give away any new information on the kind of final deal the government hopes to strike; the agreement that will profoundly shape our relationship with the continent for decades and decades to come. In the current political climate, a cabinet that contains Remainers and Brexiteers both was never going to agree that by today. But beware claims that this big speech was therefore the ultimate political disappointment, the EMPTY SPEECH. It was not. Telling the public that the Brexit that she has chosen means we might be entangled with the EU until 2021 is a big moment for Theresa May. It's been pretty well established in Whitehall for many months; the most eager Brexiteers who wanted short, sharp exit lost that battle some time ago.  And her acknowledgment of that today pulls against her repeated insistence in the election that the public just want politicians to ""get on with it"". And there were new nuggets of information that will influence the talks. The prime minister gave an unconditional guarantee of security co-operation with the rest of the EU, whether you think that is the right thing to do or the loss of a potentially powerful bargaining tool. And Number 10 believe their offer on enhanced legal protections for EU citizens takes them closer to a deal. Business nerves have been somewhat soothed by her promise of transition. And at least for today, the Tory party, riven with divisions over Europe, seems to (almost) be speaking as one. Whether that makes this truly a BIG SPEECH is for you to decide. Did it answer all the questions that Theresa May will need to answer if she stays in Number 10 during this long process? Far from it. But did it make a difference, not just to the talks, but to the politics at home? Yes indeed.

Man in court over Parsons Green attack,"Ahmed Hassan faces charges of attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life An 18-year-old man has appeared in court charged with attempted murder in connection with the bomb attack on a London Tube at Parsons Green. Ahmed Hassan, of Sunbury, Surrey, is also accused of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury on 15 September. Mr Hassan confirmed his name, date of birth and address at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was remanded in custody and is due at the Old Bailey on 13 October. The court heard the bomb, which failed to detonate properly, had been packed with knives and screws. Prosecutors said Mr Hassan had intended to kill innocent people because of his ""warped political view"". A 17-year-old male who was arrested by counter-terrorism officers investigating the attack has been released with no further action, police said on Friday. Two other males had already been released without charge. Two further men, aged 25 and 30, remain in custody. Meanwhile, Suleman Sarwar, of Aladdins chicken shop in Hounslow, said his takeaway has received abuse and threats after an employee was arrested as part of the investigation. Owner Suleman Sarwar said Aladdins Fried Chicken has received abuse and threats Mr Sarwar said abuse began after the arrest of Yahyah Farroukh, who was not named by police but whose name emerged in the media. He has since been released without charge. He said: ""The investigation brought Yahyah, his friends, family, place of employment and the wider Muslim community under scrutiny and indignity. ""Once again, the community has received backlash and animosity from the public.""

BBC One reveals new primetime pop show,"Greg James and A.Dot will be joined by a different guest host every week Greg James and A.Dot have been announced as the hosts of a new, primetime music show on BBC One. Sounds Like Friday Night will be the first regular, mainstream music programme on the BBC since Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006. Broadcast live from Television Centre, it promises to feature ""the hottest bands and artists in the world"", alongside interviews and sketches. Brit Award-winners Royal Blood have written the show's theme tune. ""We always imagined doing something like this one day,"" said the band. ""It's great that a new show celebrating live music is back at the BBC and creating a home for new bands to build a bigger audience. We're excited to be a part of it."" The show will launch in October. Stormzy is among the stars who could perform on the show James, who got his break in student radio, has hosted Radio 1's drivetime show since 2012, and reveals the Official Charts every Friday. A.Dot is the stage name of Ashley Charles, a rapper who has performed with Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliot. Also known as Amplify Dot or Dotty, she currently presents the 1Xtra Breakfast show, where she has become known for herPrank Callsfeature. The two hosts will be joined by a different guest star every week, who will take part in sketches, as well as performing live. The format seems similar to Adele at the BBC - which featured a viral sketch in whichAdele auditioned to play her own lookalike,external. ""We have been missing a primetime music show from our TV screens for far too long so it's fair to say being part of Sounds Like Friday Night is something I'm really, really excited about,"" said James in a statement. ""One thing that's fantastic about the show is being able to provide new and emerging acts a home alongside the megastars, introducing them to a new audience."" Top of the Pops ran for 42 years before being cancelled due to poor ratings The new show is being produced by Fulwell 73, the company behind James Corden's US chat show and Carpool Karaoke sketches. It has been in development since 2014, as the corporation searched for a music show format that worked. ""Pop music has no divine right to be on BBC One,"" BBC Music boss Bob Shennantold Music Week,externalearlier this year. ""The reality is that, if you stick a succession of performances on one after the other, and there's nothing special about it, it's not necessarily going to attract the audience."" ""We want to open [artists] up so you see them for who they are and have fun with them,"" said Gabe Turner of Fulwell 73. ""With the sketches, it's not just presenting a song, but experiencing their world."" ""I'm thrilled to be part of Sounds Like Friday Night,"" added A.Dot. ""Each week I'll be meeting fellow music fans from around the UK, getting the lowdown from the viewers on social media and bringing the best music to you at home. I can't wait!"" A record 20.9 million people watched the BBC's coverage of Glastonbury this year Sounds Like Friday Night has been given an initial run of six episodes - neatly echoing Top of the Pops, which was commissioned for half a dozen episodes in 1964. That programme ended up running for 42 years, registering its highest audience in 1979, when more than 19 million people tuned in to see Dr Hook's When You're in Love with a Beautiful Woman topping the chart. But by 2002, it had lost millions of viewers to 24-hour music channels like MTV. The show was eventually shunted to BBC Two before being cancelled. Music has continued to play a key role on BBC Four, with archive espiodes of TOTP appearing alongside music documentaries and the newLive Lounge show, which compiles the best live acts on BBC Radio 1. On BBC Two, Later... With Jools Holland is celebrating its 25th anniversary, while coverage of Glastonbury, T in the Park and the Reading and Leeds festivals are televised throughout the summer. The music industry has received the new show enthusiastically. ""The BBC is a fantastic supporter of British music across its radio output, and we have been encouraging senior BBC executives over the last few years to step up and do more to showcase Britain's amazing music culture to the nation on television too,"" said Geoff Taylor, head of the BPI, which represents the UK's recorded music industry. ""We are thrilled at this new opportunity for some of this country's unique talent to reach a mainstream TV audience.

Alarm as 'super malaria' spreads,"Malaria is caused by a parasite spread by blood-sucking mosquitoes The rapid spread of ""super malaria"" in South East Asia is an alarming global threat, scientists are warning. This dangerous form of the malaria parasite cannot be killed with the main anti-malaria drugs. It emerged in Cambodia but has since spread through parts of Thailand, Laos and has arrived in southern Vietnam. The team at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok said there was a real danger of malaria becoming untreatable. Prof Arjen Dondorp, the head of the malaria unit, told the BBC News website: ""We think it is a serious threat. ""It is alarming that this strain is spreading so quickly through the whole region and we fear it can spread further [and eventually] jump to Africa."" In a letter,published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases,external, the researchers detail the ""recent sinister development"" that has seen resistance to the drug artemisinin emerge. About 212 million people are infected with malaria each year. It is caused by a parasite that is spread by blood-sucking mosquitoes and is a major killer of children. The first choice treatment for malaria is artemisinin in combination with piperaquine. But as artemisinin has become less effective, the parasite has now evolved to resist piperaquine too. There have now been ""alarming rates of failure"", the letter says. Prof Dondorp said the treatment was failing around a third of the time in Vietnam while in some regions of Cambodia the failure rate was closer to 60%. Resistance to the drugs would be catastrophic in Africa, where 92% of all malaria cases happen. There is a push to eliminate malaria in the Greater Mekong sub-region before it is too late. Prof Dondorp added: ""It's a race against the clock - we have to eliminate it before malaria becomes untreatable again and we see a lot of deaths. ""If I'm honest, I'm quite worried."" Michael Chew, from the Wellcome Trust medical research charity, said: ""The spread of this malaria 'superbug' strain, resistant to the most effective drug we have, is alarming and has major implications for public health globally. ""Around 700,000 people a year die from drug-resistant infections, including malaria. ""If nothing is done, this could increase to millions of people every year by 2050.""

Trump and Kim call each other mad,"Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are trading insults after the US president's UN speech Kim Jong-un has said remarks by ""deranged"" US President Donald Trump have convinced him he is right to develop weapons for North Korea. In an unprecedented personal statement,external, Mr Kim said Mr Trump would ""pay dearly"" for a UN speech where he threatened to ""totally destroy"" the North if the US was forced to defend itself. Mr Trumpresponded,externalthat the ""madman... will be tested like never before"". The two countries have engaged in ever more heated rhetoric in recent months. Mr Kim ended his statement by saying he would ""surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged USdotardwith fire"". China responded to the war of words, warning that the situation was ""complicated and sensitive"". ""All relevant parties should exercise restraint instead of provoking each other,"" said Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang. Russia also urged restraint, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov describing the rhetoric between the two leaders as a ""kindergarten fight between children"". ""We have to calm down the hot heads,"" he told reporters at the UN on Friday. What does Kim's 'dotard' insult mean? What missiles and nuclear weapons does North Korea have? North Korea has been testing missiles at an unprecedented rate, and conducted its sixth nuclear test despite international condemnation. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, who had earlier compared Mr Trump's speech to""the sound of a barking dog""has warned that Pyongyang could test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean in response to the US president's threat. ""It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,"" Mr Ri said,quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency,external. However, he added: ""We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong-un."" North Korea crisis in 300 words What are North Korea's other WMDs? This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? By North Korea analyst Ankit Panda The prospect of a hydrogen bomb being tested in the Pacific raises a terrifying spectre - one that North Korea-watchers have mulled for some time, but which did not seem realistic until this year. Kim Jong-un could conduct an atmospheric nuclear detonation in the Pacific Ocean. This could mean mounting the nuclear device he showed the world before his 3 September nuclear test and firing it over Japan into the Pacific Ocean, demonstrating a credible thermonuclear capability. Presumably, witnessing this feat would ""tame"" Trump into accepting the ""equilibrium"" that North Korea alluded to earlier this week - a state of stable nuclear deterrence. Given the inadequacy of existing US and Japanese ballistic missile defence systems, it is far from a sure thing that such a test could be intercepted. The risks are immense. Civil aviators and mariners in the target area may perish, given that North Korea does not offer international warning of its missile launch plans - unlike other states that routinely test ballistic missiles. The environmental damage and fallout could be catastrophic. Moreover, should the missile fail over Japan - or prematurely detonate - the consequences would effectively guarantee a nuclear war in retaliation. What would a nuclear test in the Pacific mean? Mr Kim said in an English statement carried by state news agency KCNA that Mr Trump's remarks ""have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last"". He said ""now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history"", North Korea would consider the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure"" to make Mr Trump ""pay dearly for his speech"". The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base Experts say this is the first time a North Korean leader has made a direct address to an international audience. The statement came shortly after the country's delegation arrived in New York for the UN General Assembly. Analysts say that for this reason it merits serious and thorough consideration. Hours later, Mr Trump responded in a tweet: ""Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!"" In an interview with news network ABC on Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took a more measured approach. ""We are quite challenged but our diplomatic efforts continue unabated,"" he said, adding that the ""strongest economic sanctions ever"" placed against the country were still being tested. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' Earlier, Mr Kim's comments had prompted swift criticism from the Japanese government. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a news conference on Friday: ""North Korea's remarks and behaviour are provocative to regional and international security, and they are absolutely unacceptable."" North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles over Japan in the past month, raising regional tensions even further. How do you defend against Pyongyang? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Mr Trump on Thursday signed a new orderboosting sanctionsagainst North Korea, where the US treasury would target firms and financial institutions doing business with Pyongyang. He said: ""For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs."" The UN Security Council had approved new rounds of sanctions earlier this month aimed at starving North Korea of fuel and income, which were in response to Pyongyang's much-condemnedsixth nuclear teston 3 September.

Evacuation as Puerto Rico dam bursts,"This video can not be played Heavy rainfall from Hurricane Maria put stress on the Guajataca Dam A failing dam is causing ""extremely dangerous"" flooding on a Puerto Rico river in the wake of Hurricane Maria, authorities say. The National Weather Service (NWS) said the ""imminent failure"" of the Guajataca Dam was a ""life-threatening situation"". More than 70,000 people live in the nearby areas of Isabela and Quebradillas. At least 13 people have died since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, knocking out power to the whole island. The Guajataca Dam, at the northern end of Lake Guajataca in the north-west, began to show signs of failing at 14:10 local time (18:10 GMT) on Friday, operators said. The NWS warned of flash flooding in Isabela and Quebradillas. All 70,000 residents were initially told to flee but there are reports that the evacuation zone has since been narrowed. Hurricane Maria nears Turks and Caicos Puerto Rico may be months without power The agency urged residents in the area to move to higher ground in an alert posted on its website. Many who live near the dam are being evacuated by buses. Puerto Rico's governor has called Maria the worst hurricane in a century. Ricardo Rossello says it could take months to restore electricity to all 3.4 million of the US island territory's residents. Roofs were ripped off as strong winds battered Puerto Rico's capital city, San Juan. This video can not be played Where has Hurricane Maria hit? Maria, a category three storm with maximum sustained winds of nearly 193km/h (120mph), was about  265km east-north-east of San Salvador, the National Hurricane Center said in itslatest update at 09:00 GMT on Saturday.,external ""On the forecast track, Maria should move away from the Bahamas into the open waters of the western Atlantic today,"" the NHC said. The hurricane has claimed more than 30 lives across the region, and is the second devastating storm to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season. The first was category five Irma earlier in September. Dominica PM details Maria drama live on Facebook In pictures: Maria aftermath on Puerto Rico Maria also caused widespread destruction on the small island of Dominica when it hit on Monday night, leaving at least 15 dead and 20 missing. US President Donald Trump has pledged to visit Puerto Rico, saying it was ""totally obliterated"" by the storm. Federal emergency aid has been made available.

Reality Check: Decoding the PM's speech,"Prime Minister Theresa May has used a speech in Florence to set out the UK's position on how to move Brexit talks forward. With further negotiations planned next week, what did her speech tell us about the sort of Brexit deal we might end up with? Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has been scanning the speech. What's the significance?It's worth noting that a lot of Brexit supporters in the UK jumped on Jean-Claude Juncker'sState of the European Union speechlast week - in which he set out an ambitious agenda of greater integration - as an example of why they wanted to leave in the first place. The PM picked up on this - we're getting out of your way while you move in a different direction that we've never felt entirely comfortable with. That's good for both of us she implied. It slightly ignores the fact that many EU leaders wouldn't agree with Mr Juncker's proposals - but it's a point that will go down well on the Tory backbenches. What's the significance?The tone matters here. Urging EU leaders to be creative, ambitious and to share a ""profound sense of responsibility to make this change work"" is a bit of a departure from the language in her last major speech on Brexit at Lancaster House in London in January. It contained warnings of ""an act of calamitous self-harm"" for the countries of Europe if they sought to punish the UK, and the famous assertion that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" for Britain. The rest of the EU will take note of this more collaborative appeal but will also be watching to see whether the tone changes again in the prime minister's speech to the Conservative party conference next month. What's the significance?The prime minister is saying she wants to incorporate an agreement on EU citizens' rights into UK law, and she thinks UK courts should be able to ""take into account"" the judgements of the European Court of Justice. It's a real guarantee, she says: ""We want you to stay."" The trouble is that it's not what the EU is demanding. The chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier insisted in a speech yesterday that the Court of Justice should remain the ultimate guarantor of any agreement. The big difficulty here is that jurisdiction is a pretty black-and-white issue - there are few grey areas. As things stand, the UK view is that British courts should have the final say, and the EU sees that as unacceptable. What's the significance?So the Prime Minister has ruled out a European Economic Area-style solution to a future relationship (this would be like Norway - part of the single market but not part of the EU). Mrs May says it would still be too restrictive for the UK. And she ruled out an ambitious free trade deal like the one the EU has with Canada - it would take too long and would ignore the fact that we start from a position where all our rules and regulations are the same. So she wants a unique solution - a new deep and special partnership. But in this speech she hasn't really given more details of exactly what that solution would be. What's the significance?This is important. It means that during a transition period - the prime minister suggested two years as a possibility - all the rules will remain the same. That means payments into the EU budget, free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would stay in place. That's always been the position of the rest of the EU - it now appears that the UK has accepted that there is no way round this. Mrs May confirmed that there will be no restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK during the transition, but that after Brexit they will be registered as they arrive. That is something that the UK could already do under current EU rules, but it never has done so. What's the significance?The prime minister is trying to reassure other member states that no net contributor will have to pay more, and no net recipient will receive less, during the current seven-year budget period, which runs until the end of 2020. That suggests that the UK will provide the sum of roughly 20bn euros (Â£18bn) in the two-year transition period that it has now proposed. What's not yet clear is whether the UK thinks these payments will also cover some of its outstanding debts - debts that the EU insists have to be settled as part of a withdrawal agreement. The rest of the EU will view the Â£18bn as payment for the UK being allowed to maintain its current role in the single market. A lot depends on what exactly Mrs May meant by this key sentence: ""The UK will honour commitments made during the period of our membership."" Note she didn't say ""all"" our commitments.

Slough named 'best place' to work,"Research from Glassdoor suggests Slough offers ""an increased quality of life for employees"" Slough has come out on top of a survey of the 25 best towns and cities to live and work in, beating Manchester and Cambridge in the top three. It is hailed as a ""prime spot"" for jobs, cost of living and worker satisfaction in research by jobs site Glassdoor. Head offices for brands including Mars and O2 are based there. The town is also the setting for sitcom The Office, about a fictional paper company on a drab industrial estate. Swindon and Stoke-on Trent were fourth and fifth in the study respectively. Slough was the setting for Ricky Gervais's mockumentary about life in a fictional paper company on a drab industrial estate Nancy Lalor from the Slough Chamber of Commerce said she is not surprised by the study: ""We've got so many head offices that are based in Slough, so many 'corporates', and an amazing trading estate with over 350 businesses on it, so I think it's really on the up. ""There's so much new build, so much development going on in the town, every few months the whole look of the town is changing and I think people are inspired by what's going on."" How much for James Bond haul? Police in '80 year' driving ban gaffe The mystery of the missing airman The town's soulless image was also cemented by poet John Betjeman, who wrote the poem Slough in 1937 with the lines: ""Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough! It isn't fit for humans now"". However, Glassdoor's research shows Slough offered a good quality of life for employees, with a median salary of Â£35,000 per annum, the average house costing Â£390,000 and 26,000 vacancies being advertised. Ricky Gervais' character David Brent in The Office quips that 'Slough's a big place' Dr Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor's chief economist, said Slough is in a part of the country which offers ""pleasant environments"" meaning ""an increased quality of life for employees"". He added: ""Although people in London are generally satisfied, it has proven not only to be an expensive place to live, but also an ultra-competitive city in which to find a job.""

Wrong gun on Kalashnikov statue removed,"The drawing on the base of the statue (on the right) which showed Germany's StG 44 rifle Workers in Moscow have cut out part of a new monument to a Russian creator of the world famous AK-47 assault rifle because a weapon depicted on the statue was actually a German-designed firearm. Mikhail Kalashnikov's monument was opened this week to great fanfare by government officials and members of the Russian Orthodox Church. But arms experts said a drawing on the base of the statue showed the StG 44 rifle used by the Nazis during WWII. It was removed by an angle grinder. The erroneous drawing was cut out on Friday ""A mistake has been made by the sculptor,"" executive director of the Russian Military Historical Society Vladislav Kononov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. This video can not be played The statue's sculptor says the Kalashnikov is a symbol of Russia The society commissioned the 7.5m (25ft) monument, which shows Kalashnikov holding an AK-47 in his arms. A series of modified AK rifles were etched on a metallic plate on the base of the statue, including the wrong drawing. Russian arms historian Yuri Pasholok was the first to point out the error, and several experts later confirmed this was the case. Sculptor Salavat Shcherbakov said earlier on Friday that ""this is something we're correcting"", adding that ""we're trying to avoid mistakes"", Russia's Rossiya-24 TV channel reported. An honour guard was on hand at the ceremony for the statue's unveiling The automatic rifle is one of Russia's most celebrated weapons, with Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky describing it as the country's ""cultural brand"". Designed by Kalashnikov in 1946, it became one of the world's most familiar weapons used in virtually every major conflict. Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. Although honoured by the state, Kalashnikov himself made little money from his gun. He once said he would have been better off designing a lawn mower. He died in 2013 at the age of 94. The StG-44 (Sturmgewehr 44) was invented by Hugo Schmeisser and first used by Adolf Hitler's troops in 1944. Some experts point to the similarity of the StG-44 and the AK-47, and also mention the fact that Schmeisser - together with a group of German engineers - was forced to work in the Soviet Union after World War II. The AK-47 is one of the world's most familiar weapons used in virtually every major conflict By BBC's Jonathan Marcus The AK-47 assault rifle and its variants equipped the Soviet Red army and became the iconic weapon of popular revolt and insurgency throughout much of the world. It was manufactured in huge numbers in several communist countries. The story that it was the brainchild of the lowly Sergeant Mikhail Kalashnikov made great Soviet propaganda, but the origins of the design remain a mystery. The first automatic weapon of this kind - the Sturmgewehr 44 - was developed by the Germans during the latter part of World War Two. It was well known to the Russians who also benefited from the expertise of captured scientists like Hugo Schmeisser, the man who designed the Sturmgewehr.

Dave Lee: Facebook can't hide behind algorithms,"If Facebookâs algorithms were executives, the public would be demanding their heads on a stick, such was the ugly incompetence on display this week. First,the company admitted a âfailâwhen its advertising algorithm allowed for the targeting of anti-Semitic users. Then on Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg said he was handing over details of more than 3,000 advertisements bought by groups with links to the Kremlin, a move made possible by the advertising algorithms that have made Mr Zuckerberg a multi-billionaire. Gross misconduct, you might say - but of course you canât sack the algorithm. And besides, it was only doing what it was told. âThe algorithms are working exactly as they were designed to work,â says Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia. Which is what makes this controversy so extremely difficult to solve - a crisis that is a direct hit to the core business of the worldâs biggest social network. Facebook didnât create a huge advertising service by getting contracts with big corporations. No, its success lies in the little people. The florist who wants to spend a few pounds targeting local teens when the school prom is coming up, or a plumber who has just moved to a new area and needs to drum up work. Facebookâs wild profits - $3.9bn (Â£2.9bn) between April and June this year - are due to that automated process. It finds out what users like, it finds advertisers that want to hit those interests, and it marries the two and takes the money. No humans necessary. But unfortunately, that lack of oversight has left the company open to the kinds of abuse laid bare in ProPublicaâs investigation into anti-Semitic targeting. Mark Zuckerberg resembled a ""improbably young leader"", the New York Times wrote âFacebookâs algorithms created these categories of anti-Semitic terms,â says Prof Vaidhyanathan, author of Anti-Social Network, a book about Facebook due out later this year. âItâs a sign of how absurd a human-free system can be, and how dangerous a human-free system can be.â That system will be slightly less human-free in future. In his nine-minute address, a visibly uncomfortable Mark Zuckerberg said his company would be bringing on human beings to help prevent political abuses. The day before, its chief operating officer said more humans would help solve the anti-Semitism issue as well. âBut Facebook canât hire enough people to sell ads to other people at that scale,â Prof Vaidhyanathan argues. âItâs the very idea of Facebook that is the problem."" Mark Zuckerberg is in choppy, uncharted waters. And as the âleaderâ (as he likes to sometimes say) of the largest community ever created, he has nowhere to turn for advice or precedent. This was most evident on 10 November, the day after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. When asked if fake news had affected voting, Mr Zuckerberg, quick as a snap, dismissed the suggestion as a âcrazy ideaâ. That turn of phrase has proven to be Mr Zuckerbergâs biggest blunder to date as chief executive. Since Trump's election win, Facebook's influence has been under question His naivety about the power of his own company sparked an immense backlash - internally as well as externally - and an investigation into the impact of fake news and other abuses was launched. On Thursday, the 33-year-old found himself conceding that not only was abuse affecting elections, but that he had done little to stop it happening. ""I wish I could tell you we're going to be able to stop all interference,â he said. ""But that wouldn't be realistic. There will always be bad people in the world, and we can't prevent all governments from all interference.â A huge turnaround on his position just 10 months ago. âIt seems to me like he basically admits that he has no control over the system he has built,â Prof Vaidhyanathan says. No wonder, then, that Mr Zuckerberg ""had the look of an improbably young leader addressing his people at a moment of crisisâ, as the New York Times put it. This isnât the first time Facebookâs reliance on machines has landed it in trouble - and it would be totally unfair to characterise this as a problem just affecting Mr Zuckerbergâs firm. Just in the past week, for instance,a Channel Four investigation,externalrevealed that Amazonâs algorithm would helpfully suggest the components you needed to make a homemade bomb based on what other customers also bought. US official: Russia 'hacked' 21 US states in election Can US election hack be traced to Russia? US-Russia sanctions: How did we get here? Instances like that, and others -such as advertising funding terrorist material- has meant the political mood in the US taken a sharp turn: Big Techâs algorithms are out of control. At least two high-profile US senators are drumming up support for a new bill that would force social networks with a user base greater than one million to adhere to new transparency guidelines around campaign ads. Mr Zuckerbergâs statement on Thursday, an earnest pledge to do better, is being seen as a way to keep the regulation wolves from the door. He - and all the other tech CEOs - would much prefer to deal with this his own way. But Prof Vaidhyanathan warns he might not get that luxury, and might not find much in the way of sympathy or patience, either. âAll of these problems are the result of the fact Zuckerberg has created and profited from a system that has grown to encompass the worldâ¦ and harvest information from more than two billion people."" ___ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

McCain torpedoes Obamacare repeal again,"Healthcare affects one-fifth of the US economy Senator John McCain has said he cannot support his fellow Republicans' latest effort to repeal Obamacare, dealing it a potentially fatal blow. The Arizona senator, who is battling brain cancer, said he ""cannot in good conscience"" vote for the new plan, which President Donald Trump backs. Mr McCain said it was wrong to pass such far-reaching legislation without input from the Democrats. It is the second time he has thwarted his party leadership on the issue. President Trump, speaking in Alabama late on Friday, condemned Republicans who did not back the new legislation, saying: ""They don't have the guts to vote for it."" Republicans need 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48 to succeed. With Democrats united in opposition, there is little margin for error. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Where Trump went wrong on healthcare Mr McCain's objection could doom conservatives' seven-year campaign to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. In a statement on Friday, the Arizona senator said such a bill demands extensive hearings, debate and amendment. This video can not be played Mr McCain's ""no"" vote in July scuppered the last Republican bid to repeal Obamacare ""That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform,"" he wrote, ""without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority."" Mr McCain said he could not support a rushed bill ""without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect [sic] insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it"". One other Republican senator, Rand Paul, is also against the party's latest bill. Why is Obamacare so controversial? Susan Collins indicated on Friday afternoon she may join the opposition. The Maine senator said she was worried the legislation did not do enough to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. ""I'm leaning against the bill,"" Ms Collins said at a constituency event. At least four other Republican senators are undecided: Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter As several Republican senators explained - ones who were firm ""yesses"" - the main attraction for the plan was that it was the only plan on the table. Now it appears Republicans will have to go back to the drawing board. Although the end of September is the deadline for passing a bill with a simple majority in the Senate for this federal budget, there's no reason the party couldn't start the wheels turning for another vote next year - or, conceivably, simply change the rules, as Donald Trump has suggested. None of that will alter the simple dynamic that made itself clear over the course of the past months, however. The Republican Party, despite campaigning ferociously for Obamacare repeal for nearly seven years, could never agree on how to turn those promises into reality without sending the healthcare industry into a tailspin. Read more from Anthony Follow@awzurcher,external The Republican leadership had evidently hoped South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's authors, might be able to persuade his close friend Mr McCain to back the measure. Undeterred on Friday, Mr Graham vowed: ""We press on."" President Trump has been phoning lawmakers and state governors in a bid to tilt the scales in favour of the bill. But several Republican governors this week also criticised the process as rushed, urging colleagues to abandon the proposal in favour of a slower, cross-party approach. Sixteen major medical groups meanwhile issued a joint statement against the Republican legislation. US Vice-President Mike Pence said on Thursday the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill was their ""last best chance"" to repeal Obamacare. This video can not be played 'Trump not thinking about the little people' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was planning to bring the legislation to a vote next week, but it is unclear now if that will go ahead. Republicans are still reeling from the collapse in July of their efforts to secure Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal Obamacare. US health groups condemn Republican plan A dramatic late-night 'no' vote from Mr McCain - just days after he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour - sunk that bill, too. According to analysis released on Friday, if the Graham-Cassidy bill were to pass, 32 million fewer Americans would have health insurance by 2027. Allow Twitter content?

And the non-partisan Brookings Institution said its findings ""likely understates the reductions in insurance coverage"". The new bill, also drafted by Senator Bill Cassidy, would give states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programmes. But critics say that when left to the states, the money going into the Medicaid programme for people on low incomes would diminish. Republicans have long deplored Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act, as government overreach into the US healthcare system.

Recap: Theresa May Brexit speech,"PM proposes transition period of two years after UK leaves EU Theresa May addressed press and politicians in Florence PM says EU 'never felt to us like integral part of our national story' Theresa May says UK would pay its 'fair share' into the EU budget She says the UK will be 'strongest friend and partner' for the EU Labour says speech left 'questions unanswered' Jackie Storer and Aiden James Here's a round-up of key points in the PM's Florence speech and reaction to it: Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney hailed Theresa May's speech as ""a positive
contribution"" towards making progress on citizensâ rights,
the financial settlement and Irish issues. But he said it was clear ""a lot of work is still required before
European leaders can make a decision that parallel discussions on the EUâs future
relationship with the UK can begin"". He added: Ultimately Ireland wants: the gains of the peace process protected, including avoiding a hard border, an orderly UK withdrawal, a sufficiently long and non-disruptive transition arrangement, and the closest possible EU-UK future relationship, including in trade, which minimises to the greatest extent possible the impact on the Irish economy.â  Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor ""At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great, we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we have to pay afterwards."" Forgive the delving into my fifth year English homework. (Before you ask: EM Forster, A Room with a View, the homework was rather a long time ago.) But, when someone has said it better before, why try to say it again? Theresa May's speech is indeed, above all else, an attempt at a ""sympathetic gesture"", an admission that the UK government is willing to pay tens of billions of taxpayers' cash to the EU over the next couple of years, and acknowledgement that there will have to be a limited, but extended period of time - a transition period - where the relationship between the UK and the EU might not actually change very much. It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Read more Scotland's Brexit Minister and SNP veteran Michael Russell described Theresa May's speech as ""short on detail"", but her acceptance of a transition period within the single market, with freedom of movement, ""shows the UK government has
changed its position"". He said: That is due to the growing consensus of opinion - including leading business voices - that leaving the world's biggest single market is potentially disastrous for jobs, investment and living standards.""  But Mr Russell added that the PM now needs to go further and ""commit to a long-term future in the single market and customs union, not just as a transition arrangement"". Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, says the prime minister's speech included a lot ""for both leavers and remainers"". Giving her reaction to Mrs May's vision for Brexit negotiations, she said: ""Crucially we will be leaving the European Union, this is not an open ended transition,"" adding: ""Also we are looking for a bespoke deal. We are not a Canada and we are not a Norway, we are looking for a British deal."" Former Conservative Cabinet minister tweets... Allow Twitter content?

The proposed transition period post-Brexit ""will protect jobs and investment on both sides of the Channel"", CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn has said. Hailing the PM's ""positive tone"", she said: âFirms
will welcome the proposal of a âstatus quoâ transition period for business that
averts a cliff-edge exit."" Millions
of EU workers and their families in the UK need certainty and vice versa, she said, adding: Negotiators must now move the talks on to trade and transition as soon as possible. More tough choices and compromises await and listening to firms will help ensure agreement on a comprehensive version of what our future economic relationship with the EU will look like.""  BBC News Channel Conservative former business minister Anna Soubry has welcomed Theresa May's speech, saying it was ""absolutely the right step and the right direction"". The pro-EU MP claims the Florence address put the interests of the economy and jobs ""at the heart of Brexit"". ""It will give British business some sort of certainty,"" she tells the BBC, although ""they need a bit more flesh on the bones"". BBC News Channel BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Theresa May's speech was warm, conciliatory and spoke of an exciting future for the UK and EU. He said EU negotiators that were listening might think they can ""cut Mrs May some slack"" and allow the UK to move to the second phase of Brexit negotiations. But he warned there may not be enough yet on the rights of EU nationals to allow the talks to move ahead. He added that Mrs May had gone out of her way to appeal to EU leaders, and if they were listening, they might ""put the squeeze"" on EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Pro-EU campaigner tweets...

Reality Check Prime Minister Theresa May has used a speech in Florence to set out the UK's position on how to move Brexit talks forward. With further negotiations planned next week, what did her speech tell us about the sort of Brexit deal we might end up with? Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has been scanning the speech. Read more. In his statement, Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier also said the EU ""shares the goal of establishing an ambitious partnership for the future"". The fact that the government of the United Kingdom recognises that leaving the European Union means that it cannot keep all the benefits of membership with fewer obligations than the other member states is welcome. In any case, the future relationship will need to be based on a balance of rights and obligations. It will need to respect the integrity of the Union's legal order and the autonomy of its decision-making.""  BBC News Channel Conservative former chancellor Ken Clarke, a staunch Europhile, says British business ""will be considerably reassured"" by Theresa May's speech in Florence. The PM outlined how ""we're going to stay in the single market and customs union for at least the next two years"", he said, commenting that Mrs May had not been playing to any particular gallery in the UK. He added: ""The fact is we're going to have no new barriers... we're going to continue under our present rules.""

The government says it does not want a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic Guy
Lougher, partner at law firm Pinsent
Masons, says the issue of the Irish border remains outstanding following the Florence speech. ""The
three key issues are the rights of EU citizens in the UK post-Brexit, the size
of the UKâs exit bill, and Ireland,"" he says. ""The speech covers two of the three key issues.... However,
the prime ministerâs speech does not contain any concessions on Ireland, which
is the third key filter issue identified by the EU."" He argues: ""It is possible that the EU maintains its view that there has not

Theresa May Brexit speech,"PM proposes transition period of two years after UK leaves EU Theresa May addressed press and politicians in Florence PM says EU 'never felt to us like integral part of our national story' Theresa May says UK would pay its 'fair share' into the EU budget She says the UK will be 'strongest friend and partner' for the EU Labour says speech left 'questions unanswered' Jackie Storer and Aiden James Here's a round-up of key points in the PM's Florence speech and reaction to it: Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney hailed Theresa May's speech as ""a positive
contribution"" towards making progress on citizensâ rights,
the financial settlement and Irish issues. But he said it was clear ""a lot of work is still required before
European leaders can make a decision that parallel discussions on the EUâs future
relationship with the UK can begin"". He added: Ultimately Ireland wants: the gains of the peace process protected, including avoiding a hard border, an orderly UK withdrawal, a sufficiently long and non-disruptive transition arrangement, and the closest possible EU-UK future relationship, including in trade, which minimises to the greatest extent possible the impact on the Irish economy.â  Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor ""At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great, we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we have to pay afterwards."" Forgive the delving into my fifth year English homework. (Before you ask: EM Forster, A Room with a View, the homework was rather a long time ago.) But, when someone has said it better before, why try to say it again? Theresa May's speech is indeed, above all else, an attempt at a ""sympathetic gesture"", an admission that the UK government is willing to pay tens of billions of taxpayers' cash to the EU over the next couple of years, and acknowledgement that there will have to be a limited, but extended period of time - a transition period - where the relationship between the UK and the EU might not actually change very much. It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Read more Scotland's Brexit Minister and SNP veteran Michael Russell described Theresa May's speech as ""short on detail"", but her acceptance of a transition period within the single market, with freedom of movement, ""shows the UK government has
changed its position"". He said: That is due to the growing consensus of opinion - including leading business voices - that leaving the world's biggest single market is potentially disastrous for jobs, investment and living standards.""  But Mr Russell added that the PM now needs to go further and ""commit to a long-term future in the single market and customs union, not just as a transition arrangement"". Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, says the prime minister's speech included a lot ""for both leavers and remainers"". Giving her reaction to Mrs May's vision for Brexit negotiations, she said: ""Crucially we will be leaving the European Union, this is not an open ended transition,"" adding: ""Also we are looking for a bespoke deal. We are not a Canada and we are not a Norway, we are looking for a British deal."" Former Conservative Cabinet minister tweets... Allow Twitter content?

BBC News Channel BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Theresa May's speech was warm, conciliatory and spoke of an exciting future for the UK and EU. He said EU negotiators that were listening might think they can ""cut Mrs May some slack"" and allow the UK to move to the second phase of Brexit negotiations. But he warned there may not be enough yet on the rights of EU nationals to allow the talks to move ahead.

G4S immigration centre boss resigns,"Covert footage was filmed inside Brook House, near Gatwick Airport The head of a G4S-run immigration removal centre which was the focus of a Panorama investigation has resigned. Ben Saunders, the director of Brook House near Gatwick Airport, has left the role with ""immediate effect"". BBC One's Panorama screened footage from the centre which apparently showed officers bullying and abusing people being held there. G4S sacked three staff and seven others remain suspended following the programme being aired this month. The Panorama investigation exposed Brook House as a place where drug use and self-harm were common. What undercover officer saw G4S boss responds to abuse claims Immigration detainees 'mocked and abused' The programme used footage recorded by former custody officer Callum Tulley at the centre, which holds detainees facing deportation from the UK. He began working there at the age of 18 and told the BBC he was ""shocked and disturbed"" by what he was seeing and hearing about. He described seeing people dealing and taking drugs, self-harming and fighting. ""There's a culture of violence at Brook House. It's not just a pocket of officers abusing people behind closed doors. ""People will just speak about it so openly or freely."" This video can not be played WATCH: What Callum Tulley, 21, saw undercover G4S said it ""immediately"" began an investigation following the claims made in the programme. Mr Saunders is also leaving his role at Tinsley House, another immigration removal centre near Gatwick Airport. Documents seen by the BBC suggest G4S has been making significant profits from running the two centres. The Home Office has said it is investigating claimsthe company has given inaccurate financial informationto the department about their costs. An ex-senior manager for the security company made the claims at the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this month. At that same meeting, a G4S executive refused to tell MPs how much profit the company makes from Brook House. G4S said it had never deliberately given false information. In a statement, G4S confirmed Mr Saunders' post would initially be taken by interim director Lee Hanford ""pending the eventual appointment of a replacement"".

How 'the invisible network' poses a major security threat,"If a hacker managed to switch off a life-support machine, the results could be fatal Imagine a hacker remotely turning off a life support machine in a hospital, or shutting down a power station. These are the nightmare scenarios we face because many organisations haven't a clue how many unsecured devices are connected to their networks, cyber-security experts warn. It was an ordinary day at a busy hospital - doctors, nurses and surgeons rushed about attending to the health of their patients. For Hussein Syed, chief information security officer for the largest health provider in New Jersey, it was the health of his IT network that was keeping him busy. And today, he was in for a surprise. He knew he presided over a complex web of connected medical devices, computers, and software applications spread across RWJBarnabas Health's 13 hospitals. This included about 30,000 computers, 300 apps, a data centre, as well as all the mobile phones hooking up to the hospitals' wi-fi networks. Company mergers had only added to the complexity of these sprawling IT systems. Hussein Syed discovered that there were around 70,000 devices connected to his network But when he used a specialist IoT cyber-security program to carry out a full audit, he discovered that there were in fact 70,000 internet-enabled devices accessing the health firm's network - far more than he'd expected. ""We found a lot of things we were not aware of,"" Mr Syed tells the BBC, ""systems that weren't registered with IT and which didn't meet our security standards."" These included security cameras and seemingly innocuous gadgets such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) - units that provide back-up battery power in the event of a power cut. ""These unidentified devices could definitely have been access points for hackers who could have then found high-value assets on our network,"" says Mr Syed. Hack in to a UPS and you could potentially switch off life-critical machines, he explains. Or hackers could steal patient data, encrypt it, then demand a ransom for its safe return. On the black market ""health data is worth 50 times more than credit card data"", says Mr Syed. Hospitals like this RWJBarnabas Health one in New Jersey are also complex IT networks The audit ""helped us protect our network,"" he adds, preferring not to dwell on what might have been. Mike DeCesare, chief executive of ForeScout, the software provider Mr Syed brought in, says: ""Businesses typically underestimate by 30% to 40% how many devices are linked to their network. It's often a shock when they find out. ""With the proliferation of IoT [internet of things] devices the attack surface for hackers has increased massively. ""Traditional antivirus software was designed on the assumption that there were just a few operating systems. Now, because of IoT, there are thousands."" ForeScout's software monitors a company's network and indentifies every device trying to access it, ""not just from its IP [internet protocol] address, but from 50 other attributes and fingerprints"", says Mr DeCesare. The reason for these other layers of security is that it is ""relatively easy"" for hackers to mask the identity of a particular device - known as MAC [media access control] spoofing. So ForeScout's software takes a behavioural approach to monitoring. ForeScout boss Mike DeCesare says his company can spot rogue devices on the network ""We look at the traffic from all those different devices and analyse whether they are behaving like they should,"" he says. ""Is that printer behaving like a printer? So why is it trying to access other devices on the network and break in to the system? ""If we spot aberrant behaviour we can disconnect the device from the network automatically."" Services from network monitoring firms - ForeScout, Solar Winds, IBM, SecureWorks, Gigamon and others - are becoming increasingly necessary in a world where everything - from lamp-posts to lawn sensors - is becoming internet-enabled. According toVerizon's latest State of the Market: Internet of Things report,externalthere are now 8.4 billion connected devices - a 31% increase on 2016 - and $2tn (Â£1.5tn) will have been spent on the technologies by the end of 2017. But as Verizon points out, lack of industry-wide standards for IoT devices is giving businesses major security concerns. This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the internet of things? Stories of cyber-attacks mounted on the back of insecure devices such as video camerashave highlighted the issue. ""IoT security is one of the biggest challenges we're facing right now,"" says Darren Thomson, chief technology officer and vice president, technology services at cyber-security firm Symantec. The difficulty is that IoT devices are generally simple, cheap and low-powered, without the capability of running the antivirus programs operated by traditional computers. ""The challenge with critical infrastructure is that it wasn't built with security in mind,"" says Tom Reilly, chief executive of Cloudera, the IoT and data analytics platform. ""Smart cities are a great playing field for hackers - changing traffic lights, turning elevators on and off - there are many security exposures. ""We need to get ahead of them."" This necessitates a different approach to security, a growing number of experts believe. In April, telecoms giant Verizon launched what it calls its IoT ""security credentialing"" service, whereby only trusted, verified devices are allowed to access a company's network. Meanwhile, Cloudera has formed a strategic partnership with chip maker Intel. Why switching to fully electric cars will take time How to make money the Instagram way Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings? ""Intel makes the chips that are being used in many IoT sensors,"" explains Mr Reilly, ""and all that data being created needs to land in a database like ours residing in a data centre. ""We authenticate all the devices - we're creating an end-to-end platform for the IoT world."" Rival GE Digital, a subsidiary of the global engineering giant GE, has also developed its own IoT and data analytics platform called Predix which it is outsourcing to big clients such as British Airways and oil giant Exxon. IoT sensors are fitted to big machines, from gas turbines to aero engines, and these transmit ""petabytes of data in real time that helps us work out how to optimise their maintenance"", says Bill Ruh, GE Digital chief executive. ""We get all that data back via virtual private networks mostly in a highly secure encrypted fashion."" But if you don't have the resources to commit to an entire IoT ecosystem operated by a major tech company, behavioural network monitoring may be your next best bet. Just bear in mind that your organisation's defences are only as strong as the weakest part. Beware the invisible network.

Simon Jack: Now what next for Uberisation?,"Uber is not just a taxi-hailing app which has been baked into the lives of hundreds of millions of passengers and millions of drivers worldwide. It is the poster child for a form of working that has earned the company its own verb. Uberisation has come to mean the turning of traditional service industries on their head, by providing a technological platform to match users and providers on a massive scale. It is the biggest company in the so called ""gig"" economy, in which short-term contracts or freelance work replace permanent jobs. Depending where you stand, that is either a great flexible working environment or a form of exploitation with little protection for workers. Transport for London's decision not to renew its licence may come as a shock to the 3.5 million customers and 40,000 drivers who have built this model into their urban lives. But there is no shortage of groups who will be punching the air in celebration. Uber has been dogged with a bewildering range of controversies. It's charged with failing to do proper background checks on its drivers and then providing them with poor working conditions, both of which Uber denies. Irate black cab drivers blame it for a rise in congestion and collisions and it's been accused of a failure to report sexual offences, which Uber also contests. And the controversy goes right the way to the top. Its founder was forced to step down as chief executive amid a blizzard of complaints about its sexist corporate culture. Given that rap sheet, no wonder the company didn't pass the ""fit and proper"" test, many will say. But there is also no doubt that millions of people really really like the service Uber provides. It's quick, convenient and many parents feel good knowing their kids can get home safely. For the business community, revoking the licence of a tech giant from a global capital city sends a message that some entrepreneurs have described as unhelpful. Eileen Burbidge, founder of Passion Capital and HM Treasury's own tech special envoy, said: ""It's important that everyone obeys the rules, but it is very disappointing that the regulator and Uber couldn't resolve their issues and we ended up with a ruling that sends the wrong message on London's approach to innovation."" Others will see it as an important halt to a creeping revolution that threatens the pay, conditions and even dignity of work. It is widely thought that human drivers are only a temporary part of Uber's business plan. Uber is a company that is looking towards a driverless future. Don't delete the app just yet. Uber is appealing and will continue to operate throughout that process, which could drag on for months or even years. During that time, it's also possible that it could undertake to address the problems TfL identified. London is not the first city to ban Uber: several countries, states and cities have done the same. But coming from a truly global city and a hub of technology, this is perhaps the biggest red light Uber has been shown.

May urges two-year Brexit transition deal,"This video can not be played May on Brexit: ""A two year transition period"" PM Theresa May has said there should be a transition period of ""about"" two years after Brexit, during which trade should continue on current terms. EU migrants will still be able to live and work in the UK but they will have to register with the authorities, under her proposals. And the UK will pay into the EU budget so member states are not left out of pocket. She hopes this offer, made in a speech in Italy, will unblock Brexit talks. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier described the speech as ""constructive"" and said the prime minister had shown ""a willingness to move forward"". Reality Check: Decoding the PM's speech Time for action, say businesses Will Tory MPs swallow May's Brexit formula? Recap: May speech and reaction A guide to the Brexit negotiations The prime minister also proposed a ""bold new security agreement"" and said the UK would be the EU's ""strongest partner and friend"". On trade, she said the two sides could do ""so much better"" than adopt existing models. There was ""no need to impose tariffs where there are none now"", the prime minister said. She did not mention how much the UK would be prepared to continue to pay into the EU for two years after it leaves in March 2019, but it has been estimated as being at least 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would ""honour commitments"" made while it had been a member to avoid creating ""uncertainty for the remaining member states"". She also suggested that the UK and EU would continue working together on projects promoting long-term economic development and the UK would want to ""make an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved"". UK expats gathered in Florence to protest ahead of the speech When the two-year transition period is up, the UK and EU could move towards a new ""deep and special partnership,"" she said in her speech. But by March 2019, neither the UK or EU would be ready to ""smoothly"" implement new arrangements needed: ""So during the implementation period access to one another's markets should continue on current terms and Britain also should continue to take part in existing security measures."" Such a period should be ""time limited"", she said, as neither the EU nor the British people would want the UK to remain in the EU longer than necessary - with its length being determined by how long it takes to set up new systems. As new immigration systems would take time to introduce, she said ""people will continue to be able to come and live and work in the UK, but there will be a registration system - an essential preparation for the new regime"". It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Today was not about lavishing detail on the EU side who are eager to understand more about what it is the UK actually wants from them after we leave. It was the notional writing of an undated cheque from us to them, that government insiders hope means next week, when the official talks get back under way, some progress can actually be made. Read Laura's full blog But she hoped to build a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" new economic partnership with the EU in the long-term. This should not be based on existing agreements with Canada or European Economic Area membership, she said, but a ""creative solution"" should be found to reflect the existing relationship between the UK and EU. To EU citizens in the UK she offered reassurance that ""we want you to stay, we value you"" and acknowledged differences with the EU over which courts should guarantee their rights after Brexit. She said she wanted UK courts to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice and hoped ""on this basis, our teams can reach firm agreement quickly"". Cabinet ministers were in the front row in Florence to hear the speech Mrs May opened her speech by saying Brexit was a ""critical time in the evolution of the relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union"". ""I look ahead with optimism, believing that if we use this moment to change not just our relationship with Europe but also the way we do things at home - this will be a defining moment in the history of our nation,"" she told the audience of cabinet members, journalists and Italian dignitaries. Responding to the speech, EU Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier, who did not attend, said the prime minister had ""expressed a constructive spirit which is also the spirit of the European Union during this unique negotiation - the speech shows a willingness to move forward, as time is of the essence"". But he added that while her statements on EU citizens were ""a step forward"", they ""must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the UK government"". And he said he would have to examine the ""concrete implications"" of the UK's pledge that no member state would have to pay more as a result of Brexit adding: ""We shall assess ... whether this assurance covers all commitments made by the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union."" The European Parliament's Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt, said the UK's position,externalwas becoming ""more realistic"" but ""a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question"". Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech suggested the PM had ""listened to Labour and faced up to the reality that Britain needs a transition on the same basic terms to provide stability for businesses and workers"". He added: ""There has to be a transition period to protect jobs.

Pair guilty of Domino's pizza shop sex,"Daniella Hirst pleaded guilty to outraging public decency A couple had sex against the counter of a pizza delivery shop as staff worked in its kitchen, a court has heard. Daniella Hirst, 29, and Craig Smith, 31, were captured on CCTV in the Domino's shop in Scarborough in February. Hirst, of Bridlington, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency and Smith, of Bridlington, was found guilty in his absence. Magistrates in Scarborough have adjourned the case until 17 October. However, chair of the bench Angela Beardshall said a custodial sentence could not be ruled out. Scarborough Magistrates' Court was played 18 minutes of video that had been captured by the pizza shop's CCTV. It showed the couple going into the Domino's shop, on Castle Road, and ordering food. It then showed Hirst performing oral sex on Smith. The couple were also seen having sex leaning against the shop counter. Ms Beardshall said: ""This offence was in a public place. It was a lengthy incident. ""Members of the public were present as were staff. ""The shop was on a public thoroughfare and members of the public should not have to put up with this disgusting behaviour."" Hirst, of Gypsey Road, was in court as the video was played but Smith, of Field Road, was not present and the magistrates were told he was in prison for other matters. As she left court Hirst said she was ""fuming"". Scott McLoughlin, Hirst's solicitor, told the court the pair had been drinking and suggested that the sex acts were not ""brazen"".

What does the Uber decision mean?,"Taxi-hailing app Uber is set to lose its London licence at the end of the month after a ruling from regulators at Transport for London. However, the US tech firm has said it plans to appeal against the ruling. That has made it unclear whether Uber will stop being available to its 3.5 million customers in London. Uber also has more than 40,000 drivers in London, who now face an anxious wait to find out the fate of the company's licence. TfL hasruled it will not renew,externalUber's private hire operator licence after it expires on Saturday 30 September. The body, which operates London's public transport network and regulates taxis in the capital, said Uber was ""not fit and proper"" to hold the licence. London mayor Sadiq Khan backed the decision. There were potential public safety and security implications from the way the company is run, TfL said. It pointed to Uber's approach to: reporting serious criminal offences; obtaining medical certificates; and background checks into drivers. Uber's use of secret software - called ""Greyball"" - which could be used to block regulators from gaining full access to the app, was also cited by TfL in its decision. The company rejected TfL's claims that it endangers public safety and said Greyball had never been used in the UK for the purposes cited by TFL. Uber has 28 days to lodge an appeal, and the firm has said it will do just that. Fred Jones, an executive for Uber UK, told the BBC that Uber would appeal against the decision through the courts and continue operating beyond 30 September. That could see Uber carrying on its operations for months to come, the BBC understands. TfL said Uber can ""continue to operate until any appeal processes have been exhausted"". Nigel Mackay, a lawyer at Leigh Day law firm, which has challenged Uber over its working practices, said Uber's appeal ""could go all the way to the Supreme Court"". ""This could be a lengthy process and the timeline is very difficult to predict. Essentially, how long is a piece of string?"" he added. Could passengers in London still legally book an Uber even if the firm lost its TfL operating licence? In theory, yes. In England and Wales, passengers can book a private hire vehicle from anywhere they like - just so long as the driver, the vehicle and the operator are all licensed by the same authority, and the booking is processed in that authority's area. That doesn't need to be the same place the passenger wants to be picked up or dropped off. Uber has lots of licences outside London, and app-based services like Uber can process bookings almost anywhere they like. TfL aren't happy with this state of affairs and say they're lobbying the government to tighten up the rules. But for the time being, even if Uber lost their London licence, a passenger in the capital could book an Uber licensed in, say, Brighton - and it would be completely above board. London's traditional black cab drivers have fiercely opposed Uber's presence in London. And Uber - which was granted a five-year licence in London in 2012 - has proved a big threat to minicab firms too. TfL's decision provides a big opportunity for those minicab firms to win back customers, said Joseph Evans, an analyst at Enders Analysis. ""If they fail at appeal and they can't get a licence to operate in London, obviously it's a huge opportunity for rivals,"" he said. ""Behind the scenes, without many people noticing, minicab firms have rolled out very similar tech at competitive prices,"" he added. They now offer app booking, quicker pick-up, better transparency on where drivers are, and mobile payments. Yes. Uber left the Texas city of Austin last year after it lost a referendum requiring strict background checks on its drivers. The company has since returned after making some changes, and the same could happen in London, predicts BBC North American tech correspondent Dave Lee. Uber has also run into trouble in major European cities, including in Paris, Brussels and Madrid. In June 2014, taxi drivers across Europe went onstrike in protestat what they regarded as a lack of regulation of the mobile taxi-booking service. In September that same year, a court in Frankfurt, Germany, ruled that the firm lacked the necessary legal permits to operate under German law. Uber later withdrew its services from Frankfurt, Hamburg and Dusseldorf after its business was hampered by regulations. New laws for driversintroduced in Denmarkin 2016, including mandatory meters, also saw the company pulling out after less than three years of service in the country. The firm said in a statement that ""regulations need to change"" in order for it to operate. Uber was banned in Italy earlier this year after a court in Rome upheld a complaint by taxi unions that the firm represented unfair competition for traditional taxis. The ban was later annulled following an appeal by the firm.

UK to be EU's strongest friend - May,"This video can not be played May on Brexit: ""A two year transition period"" PM Theresa May has said there should be a transition period of ""about"" two years after Brexit, during which trade should continue on current terms. EU migrants will still be able to live and work in the UK but they will have to register with the authorities, under her proposals. And the UK will pay into the EU budget so member states are not left out of pocket. She hopes this offer, made in a speech in Italy, will unblock Brexit talks. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier described the speech as ""constructive"" and said the prime minister had shown ""a willingness to move forward"". Reality Check: Decoding the PM's speech Time for action, say businesses Will Tory MPs swallow May's Brexit formula? Recap: May speech and reaction A guide to the Brexit negotiations The prime minister also proposed a ""bold new security agreement"" and said the UK would be the EU's ""strongest partner and friend"". On trade, she said the two sides could do ""so much better"" than adopt existing models. There was ""no need to impose tariffs where there are none now"", the prime minister said. She did not mention how much the UK would be prepared to continue to pay into the EU for two years after it leaves in March 2019, but it has been estimated as being at least 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would ""honour commitments"" made while it had been a member to avoid creating ""uncertainty for the remaining member states"". She also suggested that the UK and EU would continue working together on projects promoting long-term economic development and the UK would want to ""make an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved"". UK expats gathered in Florence to protest ahead of the speech When the two-year transition period is up, the UK and EU could move towards a new ""deep and special partnership,"" she said in her speech. But by March 2019, neither the UK or EU would be ready to ""smoothly"" implement new arrangements needed: ""So during the implementation period access to one another's markets should continue on current terms and Britain also should continue to take part in existing security measures."" Such a period should be ""time limited"", she said, as neither the EU nor the British people would want the UK to remain in the EU longer than necessary - with its length being determined by how long it takes to set up new systems. As new immigration systems would take time to introduce, she said ""people will continue to be able to come and live and work in the UK, but there will be a registration system - an essential preparation for the new regime"". It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Today was not about lavishing detail on the EU side who are eager to understand more about what it is the UK actually wants from them after we leave. It was the notional writing of an undated cheque from us to them, that government insiders hope means next week, when the official talks get back under way, some progress can actually be made. Read Laura's full blog But she hoped to build a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" new economic partnership with the EU in the long-term. This should not be based on existing agreements with Canada or European Economic Area membership, she said, but a ""creative solution"" should be found to reflect the existing relationship between the UK and EU. To EU citizens in the UK she offered reassurance that ""we want you to stay, we value you"" and acknowledged differences with the EU over which courts should guarantee their rights after Brexit. She said she wanted UK courts to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice and hoped ""on this basis, our teams can reach firm agreement quickly"". Cabinet ministers were in the front row in Florence to hear the speech Mrs May opened her speech by saying Brexit was a ""critical time in the evolution of the relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union"". ""I look ahead with optimism, believing that if we use this moment to change not just our relationship with Europe but also the way we do things at home - this will be a defining moment in the history of our nation,"" she told the audience of cabinet members, journalists and Italian dignitaries. Responding to the speech, EU Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier, who did not attend, said the prime minister had ""expressed a constructive spirit which is also the spirit of the European Union during this unique negotiation - the speech shows a willingness to move forward, as time is of the essence"". But he added that while her statements on EU citizens were ""a step forward"", they ""must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the UK government"". And he said he would have to examine the ""concrete implications"" of the UK's pledge that no member state would have to pay more as a result of Brexit adding: ""We shall assess ... whether this assurance covers all commitments made by the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union."" The European Parliament's Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt, said the UK's position,externalwas becoming ""more realistic"" but ""a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question"". Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech suggested the PM had ""listened to Labour and faced up to the reality that Britain needs a transition on the same basic terms to provide stability for businesses and workers"". He added: ""There has to be a transition period to protect jobs. ""Our whole point throughout this whole process has been a Brexit that damages employment and jobs is very, very dangerous for everybody in this country.""

Trump supersizes Air Force One,"A Boeing handout image of what the next set of Air Force Ones could look like Trump's Air Force One looks similar to the one that Obama flew. But plans for a bigger one are now under way. The US president walked down the stairs of Air Force One at an airport in Morristown, New Jersey. He gave a thumbs-up to journalists standing on the tarmac and as he walked past the cameras, he straightened the lapel of his jacket. An image-conscious businessman, he brags about the size of his hands and his ability to make a deal. For the new presidential aircraft, he wants both - a big machine that'll save the taxpayer money. Trump tweeted after the election that he wants to cut costs for the presidential aeroplane, but he's also said enviously that another head of state, the emir of Kuwait,has a bigger one,external. Air Force personnel are scrambling to make the new aeroplane happen - and meet the president's demands. They're looking at ways to ensure that the aircraft will be as cost-efficient as possible while at the same time embodies the heft that Trump wants. Boeing executives said last week that they'd been awarded a contract for the aeroplane's redesign. ""We'll do our best to drive down costs,"" said Caroline Hutcheson, a Boeing spokeswoman. The Nixons arrive at Heathrow in 1970 The president is tinkering with an icon, a symbol of ""the global reach of American diplomacy and power"", as Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with a Virginia-based consultancy, the Teal Group, described it. The first Air Force One jet flew in 1959 with President Dwight D Eisenhower on board. It was red and gold. President John F Kennedy changed the colours to blue and white, the distinctive look it still has today. Hope Hicks named Trump media chief How did Trump fare in Hurricane Harvey? Five ways Trump's Washington is more secretive A fleet of presidential aircraft are kept in a hangar at an Air Force base in Maryland. Trump went on a tour of the base before flying to New Jersey. He walked past an array of different-sized, blue-and-white aircraft emblazoned with the words: ""United States of America"". Any of them could serve as Air Force One, which is an air traffic control designation that's given to a plane when the president is on board. Aside from ferrying the president, the aircraft have several important traits - they have encrypted communications, for example, and they can withstand electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear explosion. Inside a cramped Air Force One in 1994 The most famous is a jumbo jet built on a Boeing 747-200B airframe. Trump flew on the jet to Paris in the summertime: it has several different cabins, one with thick carpets, powder blue melting into cobalt; chairs that swivel; and a table reserved for senior White House officials. Another one, a 757, or ""Baby Air Force One"", as it's known, has the same safety features built to scale. People were crammed into their seats on Friday on the flight from Maryland to New Jersey. Still the trip had luxurious aspects. Where is Trump's new country of 'Nambia'? Hillary Clinton memoir becomes bestseller Why Trump's UN rhetoric was a game-changer Butternut squash and linguine was served for dinner. Afterwards a flight attendant brought me two boxes of M&Ms as souvenirs from the journey. Decades ago passengers were given cigarettes and playing cards - along with other small items. ""They used to have barf bags,"" a military official said. There are only a few differences between his aeroplane and the one that Obama flew. The boxes used to have Obama's signature, and during his administration an overhead screen played CNN. Under Trump, it's Fox News. Otherwise the plane looks the same. Trump can make small changes - he's complained about the softness of the hand towels and could replace them. At this point, though, they're the same (in my opinion, they have a nice, fleecy texture). Bigger changes would have to undergo a vetting process for safety. That's what military personnel are doing now while they look at a redesign - and try to keep costs low. Weeks after the election, Trumptweeted,externalthat Boeing was making a new presidential aircraft ""but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!"" Since that time, Air Force officials and Boeing executives have tried to make it seem as though they're acting in a frugal manner. The air force recently bought two Boeing 747-8s at a bargain price. That's what they say - they haven't revealed the cost, though, so it's hard to know. The new aircraft will replace the older model, the 747-200B, but it won't be ready for several years. ""When it's time for a president to buy a new Air Force One, you buy it for the next president,"" said Aboulafia. The new plane will have the same features - medical facilities, defence safeguards, and other perks. And it's bigger - the wingspan is nearly 30 feet longer than the old one. By any measure, that's likely to please the boss.

Man charged over Parsons Green attack,"Ahmed Hassan faces charges of attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life An 18-year-old man has appeared in court charged with attempted murder in connection with the bomb attack on a London Tube at Parsons Green. Ahmed Hassan, of Sunbury, Surrey, is also accused of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury on 15 September. Mr Hassan confirmed his name, date of birth and address at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was remanded in custody and is due at the Old Bailey on 13 October. The court heard the bomb, which failed to detonate properly, had been packed with knives and screws. Prosecutors said Mr Hassan had intended to kill innocent people because of his ""warped political view"". A 17-year-old male who was arrested by counter-terrorism officers investigating the attack has been released with no further action, police said on Friday. Two other males had already been released without charge. Two further men, aged 25 and 30, remain in custody. Meanwhile, Suleman Sarwar, of Aladdins chicken shop in Hounslow, said his takeaway has received abuse and threats after an employee was arrested as part of the investigation. Owner Suleman Sarwar said Aladdins Fried Chicken has received abuse and threats Mr Sarwar said abuse began after the arrest of Yahyah Farroukh, who was not named by police but whose name emerged in the media. He has since been released without charge. He said: ""The investigation brought Yahyah, his friends, family, place of employment and the wider Muslim community under scrutiny and indignity. ""Once again, the community has received backlash and animosity from the public.""

And he said he would have to examine the ""concrete implications"" of the UK's pledge that no member state would have to pay more as a result of Brexit adding: ""We shall assess ... whether this assurance covers all commitments made by the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union."" The European Parliament's Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt, said the UK's position,externalwas becoming ""more realistic"" but ""a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question"". Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech suggested the PM had ""listened to Labour and faced up to the reality that Britain needs a transition on the same basic terms to provide stability for businesses and workers"". He added: ""There has to be a transition period to protect jobs. ""Our whole point throughout this whole process has been a Brexit that damages employment and jobs is very, very dangerous for everybody in this country."" The speech was broadly welcomed by pro-EU Conservative MPs Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry, but pro-Brexit former cabinet minister Owen Paterson expressed concern about a two-year period during which ""we are still bound in by European rules"". The speech was called ""positive, optimistic and dynamic"" by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -  who was in the audience days after publishing a 4,000-word article outlining his vision for leaving the EU, which had led to him being accused of being a Brexit ""back-seat driver"". He said: ""We are going to have a transition period and after that, of course, we are going to be taking back control of our borders, of our laws, of our destiny."" Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was an ""excellent speech"", and a ""decisive intervention"" that had given ""great clarity to business and to our EU partners about our ambitions for an interim period, and our plans for the long-term relationship with the European Union"". He was confident ""we're now going to be able to move the negotiations forward"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""Theresa May's vision is that we leave the European Union but we do it in name only. ""We have a transitional period, that begins for a two year [period] and it could go on of course much longer than that, in which case we effectively don't leave anything.""

'Dotard' Trump? The story of 'rocket man' Kim's insult,"Mr Trump turned 71 in June On Friday the English-speaking world was startled to find itself suddenly reacquainted with the 14th-Century term ""dotard"", thanks to an unlikely source - Kim Jong-un. The North Korean leader used the ancient word to describe Donald Trump several times ina fiery statementdenouncing the US President's recent UN speech. North Korea crisis in 300 words (dotard is not one of them) The statement was an unprecedented first person address to Mr Trump and as the diplomatic communitydigested its meaning,many others rushed to look up this unique insult.

Mr Kim used ""dotard"",externalnot once, but twice, to refer to Mr Trump. ""Action is the best option in treating the dotard who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say,"" Mr Kim wrote, displaying a keen sense of the original meaning of the word. But he ended his screed with the ominous line: ""I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire."" TheOxford English Dictionary defines it,externalas ""an old person, especially one who has become weak or senile"". Its US brethren, Merriam-Webster,further clarified,externalthat the word initially meant ""imbecile"", and stems from the Middle English word ""doten"" which means ""to dote"". Academics uncover 30 words 'lost' from English The word has made guest appearances in literature over the years but rarely with kind intent: it's there in Shakespeare, inworks by Herman Melville,externalabout the menace of a shark and in an angry poeticstream of consciousness,externalby Alfred, Lord Tennyson, for example. This wasn't the first time North Korea used the term (we'll get to that in a minute), but it certainly was the first instance it garnered so much attention. Unsurprisingly the word has spawned its own hashtag #dotard, which has since trended worldwide. The Twitterverse sprang into action. Allow Twitter content?

North Korea's rhetoric has its own special brand of bombast, and it particularly excels in epithets and ad hominem insults. The US, for instance, is never just an enemy, but a ""hooligan"", ""scoundrel"", and a ""gangster"". Never one to shy from misogyny and racism, North Korea has called former president Barack Obama a ""wicked black monkey"", while the dress sense of Mr Kim and Mr Trump's common enemy, Hillary Clinton, has been mocked as resembling both a ""primary schoolgirl"" and ""a pensioner gone shopping"". But it perhaps reserved its most colourful insults for former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, known for her hardline stance against the North and popularly known as ""the bitch"" in Pyongyang. What's so bad about being called a 'bitch'? Ms Park was not best pleased about the labels Revealing its penchant for animal-themed comparisons, North Korea has over the years called her ""an ugly female bat-disgrace"", ""matchless dragon lady"", ""a tailless crazy old bitch"", and an ""old cat groaning in her sickbed"". It also appears to have form, as she has even been called - wait for it -a ""dotard"".,external Trump and Kim call each other mad North Korea crisis in 300 words University uncovers 'lost' English words At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Kim: 'Deranged' Trump will pay for speech,"Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are trading insults after the US president's UN speech Kim Jong-un has said remarks by ""deranged"" US President Donald Trump have convinced him he is right to develop weapons for North Korea. In an unprecedented personal statement,external, Mr Kim said Mr Trump would ""pay dearly"" for a UN speech where he threatened to ""totally destroy"" the North if the US was forced to defend itself. Mr Trumpresponded,externalthat the ""madman... will be tested like never before"". The two countries have engaged in ever more heated rhetoric in recent months. Mr Kim ended his statement by saying he would ""surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged USdotardwith fire"". China responded to the war of words, warning that the situation was ""complicated and sensitive"". ""All relevant parties should exercise restraint instead of provoking each other,"" said Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang. Russia also urged restraint, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov describing the rhetoric between the two leaders as a ""kindergarten fight between children"". ""We have to calm down the hot heads,"" he told reporters at the UN on Friday. What does Kim's 'dotard' insult mean? What missiles and nuclear weapons does North Korea have? North Korea has been testing missiles at an unprecedented rate, and conducted its sixth nuclear test despite international condemnation. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, who had earlier compared Mr Trump's speech to""the sound of a barking dog""has warned that Pyongyang could test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean in response to the US president's threat. ""It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,"" Mr Ri said,quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency,external. However, he added: ""We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong-un."" North Korea crisis in 300 words What are North Korea's other WMDs? This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? By North Korea analyst Ankit Panda The prospect of a hydrogen bomb being tested in the Pacific raises a terrifying spectre - one that North Korea-watchers have mulled for some time, but which did not seem realistic until this year. Kim Jong-un could conduct an atmospheric nuclear detonation in the Pacific Ocean. This could mean mounting the nuclear device he showed the world before his 3 September nuclear test and firing it over Japan into the Pacific Ocean, demonstrating a credible thermonuclear capability. Presumably, witnessing this feat would ""tame"" Trump into accepting the ""equilibrium"" that North Korea alluded to earlier this week - a state of stable nuclear deterrence. Given the inadequacy of existing US and Japanese ballistic missile defence systems, it is far from a sure thing that such a test could be intercepted. The risks are immense. Civil aviators and mariners in the target area may perish, given that North Korea does not offer international warning of its missile launch plans - unlike other states that routinely test ballistic missiles. The environmental damage and fallout could be catastrophic. Moreover, should the missile fail over Japan - or prematurely detonate - the consequences would effectively guarantee a nuclear war in retaliation. What would a nuclear test in the Pacific mean? Mr Kim said in an English statement carried by state news agency KCNA that Mr Trump's remarks ""have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last"". He said ""now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history"", North Korea would consider the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure"" to make Mr Trump ""pay dearly for his speech"". The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base Experts say this is the first time a North Korean leader has made a direct address to an international audience. The statement came shortly after the country's delegation arrived in New York for the UN General Assembly. Analysts say that for this reason it merits serious and thorough consideration. Hours later, Mr Trump responded in a tweet: ""Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!"" In an interview with news network ABC on Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took a more measured approach. ""We are quite challenged but our diplomatic efforts continue unabated,"" he said, adding that the ""strongest economic sanctions ever"" placed against the country were still being tested. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' Earlier, Mr Kim's comments had prompted swift criticism from the Japanese government. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a news conference on Friday: ""North Korea's remarks and behaviour are provocative to regional and international security, and they are absolutely unacceptable."" North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles over Japan in the past month, raising regional tensions even further. How do you defend against Pyongyang? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Mr Trump on Thursday signed a new orderboosting sanctionsagainst North Korea, where the US treasury would target firms and financial institutions doing business with Pyongyang. He said: ""For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs."" The UN Security Council had approved new rounds of sanctions earlier this month aimed at starving North Korea of fuel and income, which were in response to Pyongyang's much-condemnedsixth nuclear teston 3 September.

Murder charge over burned body in garden,"The body was found in a rear garden of a house in Southfields A man and a woman have been charged with murder after a badly burned body was found in a back garden. Ouissem Medouni, 40, and Sabrina Kouider, 34, were arrested in Southfields, on Thursday evening. The pair, of Wimbledon Park Road, appeared at Wimbledon magistrates. They are due at the Old Bailey next Tuesday. Reports suggest the victim worked as ananny at the address,external, but the Met said the person's remains were too charred to work out their gender and age. Det Insp Richard Leonard said detectives were ""doing everything we can to identify the deceased"". A post-mortem examination will be carried out in due course. The person's remains are too charred to work out their gender and age, the Met said Neighbours reported a burning smell and seeing ""light smoke"" coming from the garden of a property. One, Mario Riccio, said he was ""shocked"" to hear of the news. ""It's a good area"", he said. ""We are busy people around here - it's not often something like this happens."" He told the BBC he knew mostly of the nanny who lived at the address. ""The nanny would be in and out, in and out - to the parks and to the shops with the children so I used to see the nanny very very often"", he said. One local man, who asked not to be named, said his daughter came home with a letter from school as a result of the police activity.

New antibody attacks 99% of HIV strains,"Scientists have engineered an antibody that attacks 99% of HIV strains and can prevent infection in primates. It is built to attack three critical parts of the virus - making it harder for HIV to resist its effects. The work is a collaboration between the US National Institutes of Health and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi. The International Aids Society said it was an ""exciting breakthrough"". Human trials will start in 2018 to see if it can prevent or treat infection. Our bodies struggle to fight HIV because of the virus' incredible ability to mutate and change its appearance. These varieties of HIV - or strains - in a single patient are comparable to those of influenzaduring a worldwide flu season,external. So the immune system finds itself in a fight against an insurmountable number of strains of HIV. But after years of infection, a small number of patients develop powerful weapons called ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" that attack something fundamental to HIV  and can kill large swathes of HIV strains. Researchers have been trying to use broadly neutralising antibodies as a way to treat HIV, or prevent infection in the first place. 'Mind-blowing' cows hold clue to beating HIV Antibody helps keep man's HIV at bay for 10 months The study,published in the journal Science,external, combines three such antibodies into an even more powerful ""tri-specific antibody"". Dr Gary Nabel, the chief scientific officer at Sanofi and one of the report authors, told the BBC News website: ""They are more potent and have greater breadth than any single naturally occurring antibody that's been discovered."" The best naturally occurring antibodies will target 90% of HIV strains. ""We're getting 99% coverage, and getting coverage at very low concentrations of the antibody,"" said Dr Nabel. Experiments on 24 monkeys showed none of those given the tri-specific antibody developed an infection when they were later injected with the virus. Dr Nabel said: ""It was quite an impressive degree of protection."" The work included scientists at Harvard Medical School, The Scripps Research Institute, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Clinical trials to test the antibody in people will start next year. Prof Linda-Gail Bekker, the president of the International Aids Society, told the BBC: ""This paper reports an exciting breakthrough. ""These super-engineered antibodies seem to go beyond the natural and could have more applications than we have imagined to date. ""It's early days yet, and as a scientist I look forward to seeing the first trials get off the ground in 2018. ""As a doctor in Africa, I feel the urgency to confirm these findings in humans as soon as possible."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was an intriguing approach. He added: ""Combinations of antibodies that each bind to a distinct site on HIV may best overcome the defences of the virus in the effort to achieve effective antibody-based treatment and prevention.""

What will happen to the Iran nuclear deal?,"The fate of the nuclear agreement between Iran and the major world powers is in the balance. The deal, which came into effect in October 2015, (known by the cumbersome title of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), imposed constraints on Tehran's nuclear activities, in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions. It is easy to forget that the deal came about in an atmosphere where there was growing talk about the possibility of a military strike against Iran. Israel and many of Washington's Gulf allies were alarmed by Iran's growing assertiveness in the region and - despite Tehran's denials - believed that it had an active nuclear weapons research programme. It also had a sophisticated ballistic missile effort that might one day be used to carry such a weapon. Iran - they feared - could eventually have been where North Korea is today. And, for the nuclear agreement's advocates, the JCPOA - while not ideal - deferred any crisis. It imposed physical constraints on Iran - the number of centrifuges it could operate and the amount of low-enriched uranium it could have stockpiled. In return, some sanctions were relaxed or lifted: it got access to international financial markets and could sell its oil. The whole deal was bolstered by an intrusive verification regime operated by the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA). But Donald Trump opposed the deal on the campaign trail and earlier this week he signalled that its fate was still very much in the balance. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, he described it as ""one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly,"" he went on, ""that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it, believe me."" This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil? The next few weeks will be critical. President Trump is due to certify that the deal is still in US interests in mid-October. If he decides not to do so, then the issue is automatically referred to the US Congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to resume the sanctions that were in effect at the time of the adoption of the original agreement. Doing so requires only a majority vote. If Congress passed such a bill, it would go back to the president for his signature. Once signed, the US would be turning its back on the JCPOA, effectively sealing its fate. Iran nuclear deal: US 'sunset clause' concern remains - Tillerson Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why has Trump been so harsh on Iran? Iran's leader Hassan Rouhani slams Donald Trump in UN speech But there is a slight problem for President Trump. All parties to the agreement (including the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson) have just re-affirmed that the JCPOA is being implemented properly. The EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini chaired a meeting of the foreign ministers of the countries that had promoted the agreement - China, Russia, the US, France, Germany Britain and Iran - on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. And all accepted that its terms are being honoured fully and there are no violations. Indeed, some US experts believe that, since President Trump's election victory, Iran has been bending over backwards to honour the letter of the agreement, so as not to give the Trump administration any excuse to abandon the deal. Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, says the world cannot afford to dismantle the deal So what is President Trump's concern? Well it is two-fold: partly opposition to the agreement per se but also to the role Iran is playing in the wider Middle East region. His difficulty is that the JCPOA is quite specific. As Federica Mogherini noted: ""The scope of the nuclear deal is related to the nuclear program of Iran. There are other issues that are out of the scope of the agreement."" And, with so many other problems in the world, she concluded that the international community ""cannot afford to dismantle an agreement that is working and delivering"". President Trump is clearly not happy with this. There are suggestions that his administration is exploring the possibility of re-drafting the deal or seeking a follow-up agreement that would extend its timescale and tackle the related problem of Iran's ballistic missile programme. Re-drafting, though, is probably a non-starter. A follow-up deal might be more feasible but clearly Iran would want something in return if - and it is a big if - it was willing to countenance the idea at all. But Washington's most pressing problem with Iran is its regional behaviour. The Obama administration struggled with the same issues. Part of its answer was to back the nuclear accord, at least removing that issue from the table for the immediate future. The US military is a constant presence in the Gulf The paradox here is that, to an extent, the US is the author of its own misfortunes. Having knocked out the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, it amplified Tehran's role as a major strategic player in the region and subsequent events have only enhanced its position and influence. The flashpoints between Washington and Tehran are numerous: Iraq Tehran is a close ally of the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad and an important power-broker in the country. In the past Iran gave considerable support to Shia groups opposed to the US occupation. Indeed, many of President Trump's closest advisors are former military men who hold Tehran responsible for the loss of many US and allied lives. Syria Here Iran is both ""fireman and arsonist"" in the words of one notable US Iran-watcher, Karim Sadjadpour. Iran is one of the few close allies of the Syrian regime. Its own military advisers and pro-Iranian militias have been active on Syria's battlefronts. It shares responsibility with the Syrian regime for the catastrophe that has befallen the country's civilian population. On the other hand, Iran is a sworn enemy of the so-called Islamic State. But as the latter loses more and more ground, so the likelihood of friction between pro-Iranian and US-backed groups is increasing. Israel Iran's growing influence in Syria (along with that of its Lebanese militia ally, Hezbollah) is causing unease in Israel, which now sees a lengthy frontline developing, extending from its border with Lebanon on the Mediterranean, all the way to the point where Syria, Jordan and Israel meet. Any future war involving Israel and Hezbollah would almost inevitably involve Iran. Tehran is also reported to be setting up arms factories in both Lebanon and Syria to supply its regional allies. And there is unease in Israel that Moscow, Syria's other ally, will not be able to constrain Iran's influence, even if it wanted to. Yemen Iran has given some support to Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are engaged in a conflict against Saudi-backed local forces. For the Saudis this is very much the sharp end of Iran's growing regional role, but it probably has a lower priority in Tehran. The Iranians are probably just pleased that the Saudis have their coats caught in the mangle of an open-ended military adventure which is delivering little gain. The Gulf In the waters of the Gulf, US and Iranian naval forces confront each other on an almost daily basis. Tensions are frequently high with small vessels belonging to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Force goading the Americans and the possibility of a misunderstanding leading to a wider crisis is real. All of these potential flashpoints underscore the problem that even if President Trump chooses to honour the nuclear agreement, it could easily fall victim to a broader crisis prompted by wider regional tensions. Some would say that this is a point that argues in favour of the JCPOA's retention. If Iran was free of the nuclear constraints and facing greater US hostility might it not seek to pursue the path followed by the North Korean regime, they ask? How might that make the situation any better? So how much threat is the nuclear deal really under? The showman in President Trump hints that his mind is already made up. But he has committed to many things - a move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem for example - and once in office has failed to follow through. Might he reluctantly stick with the JCPOA after all? Iran's President Rouhani defended the agreement in his speech to the UN Well, walking away from it is not going to be easy just as long as all the other parties believe it is working. It could prompt a huge diplomatic row, not just with China and Russia, but also with three of Washington's closest western European allies. He would have a hard time re-forming the broad coalition needed to back renewed economic sanctions. It is hard to see this as a winning formula. Part of the Trump administration's problem is its absence of a wider, more coherent approach to the region as a whole. Iran is a growing problem for the US and its allies and will remain so. Perhaps - as hinted at by the EU's foreign policy chief - there could be separate talks with Iran on its place in the region. Even if Mr Trump reluctantly decides to back the nuclear deal there's no danger that his administration is going to go soft on Iran. Too many of its senior figures have seen Iran's activities in the region first-hand. But it is by no means clear that abandoning the nuclear agreement will serve anyone's interests, and in private that is what some of them at least, may be telling the White House. And what of the Iranian voice in all of this? They have made clear that they will not walk away from the deal. Though they feel that some of the economic benefits have been less than expected or are being delivered more slowly, there is no pressing reason for Tehran to abandon the agreement. It can sit on the sidelines and watch the Trump administration struggling with the issue. Over time might they be tempted to test the international community's resolve? Might they seek to restart banned activities? If the agreement is to last its full term then it will depend upon vigilance from the IAEA inspectors, but they in turn will depend upon good intelligence that can only come from countries like the US. The JCPOA may well be tested in the future. But for now, some of its supporters say, why add another problem to the already crowded diplomatic agenda?

Fake news worries 'are growing',"There is growing concern among global net users about fake news online, according to a BBC World Service poll. It also indicates mounting opposition to governments stepping in with regulation. In the survey of 18 countries, 79% of respondents said they worried about what was fake and what was real on the internet. But in only two countries, China and the UK, did a majority want their governments to regulate the internet. The BBC carried out a similar survey in 2010. Only 15 countries were covered by both polls. From this subset of respondents, 58% said the internet should never be regulated in the latest survey, up from 51% when the same question was asked seven years ago. When it came to regulation, 67% of Chinese respondents now liked the idea, while opinion was more finely balanced in the UK, with 53% in favour. The countries where people were most hostile to regulation were Greece with 84% and Nigeria, where 82% of people opposed the idea. The survey of more than 16,000 adults was conducted by Globescan between January and April. Concerns about what is real and what is not on the internet have mounted after a year in which the term fake news has become both commonplace and profitable, with false stories shared on Facebook earning their creators hefty sums through advertising. Brazilians were most worried about the hazy line between the real and the fake, with 92% reporting some concern.  In a number of other developing countries there was a high level of unease, with figures of 90% in Indonesia, 88% in Nigeria and 85% in Kenya. Germany was the only nation surveyed where a narrow majority - 51% - said they were not worried about this issue. In the run-up to the country's election there have been determined efforts in Germany to root out fake news. Globescan's chairman Doug Miller said: ""These poll findings suggest that the era of 'fake news' may be as significant in reducing the credibility of on-line information as Edward Snowden's 2013 National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance revelations were in reducing people's comfort in expressing their opinions online."" There is growing anxiety about expressing opinions online. In the 15 countries that have been regularly tracked in this poll, 53% felt unsafe doing this, compared to 49% in 2010. But there was a marked difference between attitudes in the developed and developing world. In Nigeria, Peru and China there were big majorities confident about expressing opinions,  but in Europe and North America there was far more anxiety, with the French and the Greeks least likely to want to speak freely. As global use of the internet grows, there also appears to be mounting enthusiasm for it to be seen as something to which everyone should be entitled. 53% of those questioned agreed that access to the internet should be a fundamental right, with much bigger majorities agreeing in Brazil, Greece and India. The survey highlights some differences between men and women in attitudes to the internet. Men are still more likely to use it, with 78% saying they had been online in the last six months, compared to 71% of women. And women were somewhat less likely than men to feel safe expressing their views online. That anxiety was most pronounced in developed countries. In France just 14% felt safe, whereas in the UK the figure was 36%, and in the USA 35%. British women were also more concerned about fake content than men, and were more keen to see some regulation of the internet.

Banks to carry out immigration checks,"This video can not be played Former TSB board member Philip Augar warns Today of problems with government's bank immigration checks Resolving mistakes made when new rules come into force to freeze or close the bank accounts of illegal immigrants could be an ""absolute nightmare"",  a former board member of TSB has warned. Banks and building societies will carry out checks from January to see if account holders are legally in the UK. MPs backed the move in 2016, but Philip Augar said mistakes would be made and ""poor individuals"" would suffer. The Home Office said the system was ""fair"" but ""firm"". Financial institutions will be provided with a list from anti-fraud organisation Cifas on people who are liable for removal or deportation from the UK or who have absconded from immigration control. The organisations will then have to report any names they discover and freeze or close the accounts. According tothe Guardian,external, 70 million accounts will be looked at quarterly to check the immigration status of the holders. Mr Augar, who also previously worked at the Home Office, said it was reasonable for ""law breakers to expect the full weight of enforcement"", but raised concerns about how mistakes would be addressed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is in the hands of the Home Office and the banks, neither of which are exactly known for flawless execution. ""What happens when something goes wrong - if a bank account is frozen and the owner is entirely legal or if they've simply got the wrong name? ""Resolving those situations will be, in some cases, smoothly done, but I can imagine it being an absolute nightmare for some poor individuals. ""The problem is going to be multiple names will come up, the wrong names and bank accounts will be frozen, and it is how this is resolved, that will be the difficulty."" The rules were approved by parliament in December 2016, but will not come into force until January 2018 The checks form part of a series of measures in the Immigration Act 2016 aimed at encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the UK voluntarily. It follows on from rules passed in 2014 intended to check the immigration status of anyone opening a new bank or building society account. The Home Office said it would only share details of immigrants who were in the UK unlawfully. This would include those who had exhausted all appeal rights and who should be denied access to banking services, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said. Ms Rudd added migrants in the UK legally would ""of course"" be able to continue using their accounts. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants criticised the action saying migrants ""with every right to be here"" will be affected. Chief executive Satbir Singh told the Guardian: ""The government's own record shows that it cannot be trusted even to implement this system properly. ""Immigration status is very complex, and the Home Office consistently gives out incorrect information and guidance."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are developing an immigration system which is fair to people who are here legally, but firm with those who break the rules. ""Everyone in society can play their part in tackling illegal migration."" The plans also include a crackdown on landlords and employers if either knowingly provide a service to anyone who has no right to be in the UK.

'Dotard' Trump? The origins of 'rocket man' Kim's insult,"Mr Trump turned 71 in June On Friday the English-speaking world was startled to find itself suddenly reacquainted with the 14th-Century term ""dotard"", thanks to an unlikely source - Kim Jong-un. The North Korean leader used the ancient word to describe Donald Trump several times ina fiery statementdenouncing the US President's recent UN speech. North Korea crisis in 300 words (dotard is not one of them) The statement was an unprecedented first person address to Mr Trump and as the diplomatic communitydigested its meaning,many others rushed to look up this unique insult.

Mr Kim used ""dotard"",externalnot once, but twice, to refer to Mr Trump. ""Action is the best option in treating the dotard who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say,"" Mr Kim wrote, displaying a keen sense of the original meaning of the word. But he ended his screed with the ominous line: ""I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire."" TheOxford English Dictionary defines it,externalas ""an old person, especially one who has become weak or senile"". Its US brethren, Merriam-Webster,further clarified,externalthat the word initially meant ""imbecile"", and stems from the Middle English word ""doten"" which means ""to dote"". Academics uncover 30 words 'lost' from English The word has made guest appearances in literature over the years but rarely with kind intent: it's there in Shakespeare, inworks by Herman Melville,externalabout the menace of a shark and in an angry poeticstream of consciousness,externalby Alfred, Lord Tennyson, for example. This wasn't the first time North Korea used the term (we'll get to that in a minute), but it certainly was the first instance it garnered so much attention. Unsurprisingly the word has spawned its own hashtag #dotard, which has since trended worldwide. The Twitterverse sprang into action. Allow Twitter content?

North Korea's rhetoric has its own special brand of bombast, and it particularly excels in epithets and ad hominem insults. The US, for instance, is never just an enemy, but a ""hooligan"", ""scoundrel"", and a ""gangster"". Never one to shy from misogyny and racism, North Korea has called former president Barack Obama a ""wicked black monkey"", while the dress sense of Mr Kim and Mr Trump's common enemy, Hillary Clinton, has been mocked as resembling both a ""primary schoolgirl"" and ""a pensioner gone shopping"". But it perhaps reserved its most colourful insults for former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, known for her hardline stance against the North and popularly known as ""the bitch"" in Pyongyang. What's so bad about being called a 'bitch'? Ms Park was not best pleased about the labels Revealing its penchant for animal-themed comparisons, North Korea has over the years called her ""an ugly female bat-disgrace"", ""matchless dragon lady"", ""a tailless crazy old bitch"", and an ""old cat groaning in her sickbed"". It also appears to have form, as she has even been called - wait for it -a ""dotard"".,external Trump and Kim call each other mad North Korea crisis in 300 words University uncovers 'lost' English words At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Wolf Alice: 'Our album is like hummus',"Wolf Alice (L-R): Theo Ellis, Joff Odie, Ellie Rowsell, Joel Amey Wolf Alice have won the 2018 Mercury Music Prize for their second album, Visions of a Life. Speaking to the BBC on its release in 2017, they discussed their eclectic sound, panic attacks and why Craig David should be prime minister. ""It's crazy, Los Angeles,"" says Wolf Alice's bassist, Theo Ellis. ""It's like a fictitious city."" ""You can go skiing and then come back down to the ocean,"" adds singer Ellie Rowsell, ""or go to the desert and then into town."" The band spent the start of 2017 in the city, recording Visions of a Life - their follow-up to the Mercury-nominated debut My Love Is Cool. Like that record, it tears up the indie-rock rule book, merrily flitting between wild-eyed punk (Yuk Foo), dreamy pop (Beautifully Unconventional,external) and chiming indie melodies (Planet Hunter). ""We're easily influenced,"" laughs Rowsell. ""But I think the thing we've learned the most is that you have to trust your gut."" The band landed in LA on the day of Donald Trump's inauguration, noting that ""everyone seemed really angry"". But the political situation didn't overwhelm the record, most of which was written before Donald Trump's surprise victory. Instead, the lyrics are deeply personal, talking about departed friends, blossoming love affairs and, on Sky Musings, a panic attack Rowsell suffered 40,000 feet in the air. The band took a prime slot on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2016 The first single, Yuk Foo, is two minutes of unbridled rage, but you wrote it in a dressing room at a TV show. Didn't the other guests get scared? Ellie: I've mastered this by having, unfortunately, lived with my parents my whole life. When you're supposed to be being quiet, but you want to write a song where you're shouting, I have my technique. It sounds a little bit like this. [Makes a sound uncannily like a chipmunk]. I promise it actually sounds like shouting if you layer it up and put enough effects on it! Theo: That might be the reason for our unique sound, is you trying to record angry songs very quietly. Was Yuk Foo targeted at anything in particular? Had someone left the M&Ms off your rider? Ellie: Yes, someone decided to put sun-dried tomatoes in my hummus. Theo: Scum! It's funny you bring up hummusâ¦ The first time I interviewed you,in 2014, you told me it was the only item on your rider. Ellie: Haha! We're very low maintenance. The band's tour rider is hand-delivered by artisanal chefs by midday, or the gig is cancelled (NB: Not true) What's your favourite variety: Red Pepper, Moroccan, traditional? Ellie: I like anything with garlic in it. But yeah, probably just traditional. Theo: To be fair though, maybe we should get different varieties... Marks and Spencer does a selection pack. Theo: Too posh! Too bougie! Ellie: I think hummus is quite a good analogy for our album. You get all these different varieties but at the end of the day they're all hummus. Yuk Foo is a spicy hummus,Don't Delete The Kisses,externalis beetroot. That's one of the things that impresses me about the album - You have a different sound, and even vocal style, from one track to the next. Is that something you considered in the writing process? Ellie: Not really the songwriting, but maybe the recording. We're all quite easily influenced. I'll watch one band and be like, ""I want to be in that band"" and then I'll watch another completely different band and be like, ""actually, no, I want to be inthatband"". But why do I have to be in one or the other? I can go and write like a stoner rock dude, and then write a sugary folk song - and adopt the role of each singer without doing anything that feels unnatural to me. What band do you want to be in today? Theo: I want to be in Outkast, but played by the members of Drenge. OutDrenge. It feels like the lyrics on this album are more revealing than the first record... Ellie: I held back less on this record. It's something you grow into with confidence. If you were to write a diary and you held things back, when you went back to look at it when you were older, you'd be annoyed because you want to know how you truly felt. So I didn't want to do that. Musically, as well, we didn't do that. People often say guitar solos are embarrassing, but if they're working it's not embarrassing. Just do it. Speaking of which - did I hear a saxophone solo onHeavenward,external? Ellie: No! That's Joff's guitar. Theo: I really like it. It's a very specific guitar pedal that he bought. Ellie: It's called a Miku. Theo: The nature of the pedal is quite bizarre. It's supposed to emulate the singing voice of multiple Asian women. It's really, really weird. He just bought it on a whim, because he's always exploring how to make his guitar sound different. My mum thought it was bagpipes when I played it to her. St Purple and Green is a really personal lyric. It's about your grandmother, right? Ellie: Yes. My grandma, she was always a big talker but her mind slowly began to deteriorate. I remember I went to her house one day and she was saying: ""I want to go there, purple and green."" I was like, ""What is she going on about?"" but I also liked the way she was talking. One of the most inspiring things about her was she was always quite excited by the prospect of death. She always said, ""Why would you be scared of it? It's the next big adventure."" I guess Purple and Green is about that - don't be scared, you get to go to this new place. The group formed as a folk duo in 2012, but spent several years touring to refine their sound And the song Sky Musings sounds like a panic attack in three minutes. What inspired those lyrics? Ellie: I've had quite a few moments on long haul flights where I've had a couple of drinks and watched some rom-com and felt like I had a thousand million thoughts swimming around my head. Apparently it's a thing that happens on flights: Because its one of the only opportunities you get to do nothing, you start to have lots of thoughts which you'd normally push aside. And also, your life is in the hands of someone else, so people get very emotional. So Sky Musings is kind of the journey of that panic attack, which I had on lots of different flights, but rolled into one for the sake of a song. You've recently done some work with the Labour party. What's your view on Corbyn-mania? Theo: He's been adopted by a generation even younger than us, I reckon. He's the meme lord! The older media were a little reluctant to endorse him. Ellie: And it didn't stop himâ¦ or it did for a bitâ¦ Theo: Yeah, it stifled him but social media and a lot of youth-leaning outlets championed him. It's really interesting to see that - especially with Brexit being voted for, largely, by the older generation. But then, he's pro-Brexit. Theo: Yeah, I don't necessarily agree with him on Brexit. Ellie: But I think lots of people were for Brexit, when it wasn't really laid out to us what Brexit would mean. Theo: Politics is for everyone, and I don't feel everyone was given the right information on what was going on. People were ringing up the next day and saying, ""Can I change my vote?"" Will Brexit affect you as a band? Theo: It does directly affect touring in Europe. We have to get all the right pieces of information and documentation. Ellie: So many bands can't get to America because of Visa issues. If we're going to have to start needing Visas around Europe, it's the end of low-level touring. Visions of a Life is set to be one of the year's biggest rock records You built your career on touring. Why don't more bands do that? Ellie: It's expensive to tour. You have to remember that. We did it on a shoestring but we were lucky that we had a mate that would drive us, and we had jobs that would let us go. You're a big, formidable presence on stage now. Was that true at the beginning? Theo: No. We had no idea who we were at all! Ellie: I was probably more confident, in a way, because I thought no-one was paying attention. One thing I've noticed is that your influences are much broader than most guitar bands. Wasn't Craig David's Born To Do It the first record Theo bought? Theo: How the heck did you know that?! But, yeah, he's such a good performer. He's the Judi Dench of garage now. He's like a British icon. A hero. He went away for 10 years, moved to Miami, got massive, came back and started shelling it down at every festival on earth. He is also exceptionally polite in real life. Theo: I know! Craig David for next Labour leader. Ellie [singing]:Oh, Cra-i-ig David. What was your first record, Ellie? Ellie: I think mine was Missundaztood by Pink. That was Dua Lipa's first record, too. Ellie: Really? That's funny. I think Pink's like a rock star making pop music. Theo: Everyone likes Pink. And Dua Lipa leans her chair back very far on flights. It feels like there's a story there... Theo [in a strained voice]: ""I need some wine, Dua Lipa is crushing me."" Listen, Dua Lipa has no idea who I am. But shout out to her, I really like her. She's totally wicked. She's just really bad at flying. Wolf Alice's second album, Visions of a Life, is out on 29 September.

Loneliness: The cost of the 'last taboo',"This video can not be played Derek Taylor, 90, wrote tips on tackling loneliness, which have now been published Researchers have put a financial price on an ""epidemic of loneliness"" - estimating it costs Â£6,000 per person in health costs and pressure on local services. But the London School of Economics study of older people says for every Â£1 spent in preventing loneliness there are Â£3 of savings. Deborah Moggach, author of the novel adapted for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel films about retired people from the UK going to India, said: ""Loneliness really is the last taboo."" She said old age must not be an ""inevitable descent into despair"" and more efforts had to be made to stop people becoming isolated and lonely. ""We have to stop thinking of this as someone else's problem. As a society, we need to recognise loneliness as an issue, and put something in place that enables older generations to flourish - not flounder,"" said Moggach. The research from the LSE has been published alongside theCampaign to End Loneliness,external, a group set up by charities and local authorities. Deborah Moggach says people will talk about anything without embarrassment, except loneliness There are an estimated 1.2 million people in the UK who have ""chronic"" loneliness, with links to poorer physical and mental health and increased use of GPs, hospitals and social services. The campaign says it should be seen as a problem in public health terms, like obesity and smoking. For a decade of an older person's life, the extra economic cost of loneliness is calculated as Â£6,000. Over five years, preventing loneliness could see a saving of Â£3.6m, say the researchers. Loneliness is also linked in the study to earlier death and higher risks of dementia. The study says there have been a variety of attempts to tackle loneliness - such as befriending schemes, healthy living initiatives and better ""signposting"" to show the elderly where they can get help or meet other people. This week, Guides in Manchester launched a new badge to tackle loneliness in old people, with young people visiting the elderly. But the LSE research also shows that there is a ""stigma"" around admitting to loneliness. ""It implies that there's something wrong with us,"" said Moggach. ""We talk about everything else - death, sex and money."" She said the proliferation of technology could make people feel even more isolated in public places. ""Everyone's on their phones, they're closed off."" She said the ""last bastion"" for old people of chatting to people at the supermarket checkout was being taken away by the increase in automated machines. People in later life could become ""hugely cut off,"" she said, describing the loss of friends and independence as ""chronic, low-level bereavement"". Laura Alcock-Ferguson, executive director of the Campaign to End Loneliness, said:  ""There is much to do to overcome loneliness. ""The huge stigma surrounding it is clear, which is slowing down efforts to combat it. This is isolating millions of older people - and with our ageing population, the epidemic of loneliness is growing fast."" ""It can be hard,"" says June, a 76-year-old widow living near Peterborough. ""I have to push myself."" She looks forward to a tea party once a week, on a Sunday, which she says can feel ""like the loneliest day of the week"". Loneliness can be ""hard to put in words"", particularly when she is in touch with family and neighbours. She has ways to keep in contact - ""my iPad is my friend"" - and likes to talk to people in Facetime video calls. But she says she wishes there were more places for elderly people such as herself to go to have some company. She has volunteered with a local church project making meals for people in need, such as the homeless, and she likes the sense of giving something back. But she misses the lack of places to go and chat to people - made worse by local shops and post offices shutting down. And there are other older people she worries are even more isolated and who might go days and weeks without talking to anyone. 'This is how it feels to be lonely' Loneliness tips from 90-year-old.

UK's terror fight 'puts strain on police',"This video can not be played Chief Constable Sara Thornton: Police will ""always prioritise"" terror fight The UK's counter-terrorism effort is putting an unsustainable strain on policing, the head of the National Police Chiefs' Council has said. Chief Constable Sara Thornton said resources were being diverted from mainstream policing in England and Wales, leading to backlogs in control rooms and slower response times. She said the strain was ""causing real problems"" and ""frankly unsustainable"". The Home Office said it was working with police on the demands they faced. So far in 2017 there have been five terror attacks in the UK, killing 36 people. Four people remain in police custody, including a 17-year-old boy,following last week's explosion at Parsons Green Tube stationin which 30 people were injured. What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? Reality Check: How terror threat levels work Earlier this year, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley wrote to the home secretary warning that the counter-terrorism policing network was not able to operate at ""full strength"". He added thatother areas of policing would be at ""significant"" riskif resources had to be diverted. Ms Thornton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When we respond to the sorts of attacks we saw only a week ago, it's not just our counter-terrorist police units, but the whole system of policing that responds. ""The current level of terrorism, added to the strain and stress the force is already under, is causing real problems and is frankly unsustainable."" She said having officer numbers at 1985 levels and crime figures up 10% in the last year created additional pressures. ""After Manchester attack, of the officers and staff that responded, three-quarters were paid for out of mainstream policing."" A response will ""never be as good as preventing"" attacks in the first place, Ms Thornton says The current funding for forces across England and Wales is ""no longer enough"" and the counter-terrorism policing budget will be cut by 7% in the next three years, Ms Thornton added. She warned a response would ""never be as good as preventing"" attacks in the first place. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said her force would ""have to make hard choices in the future"". Ms Dick, who is in talks with thegovernment over securing more fundingfor the Met, told LBC: ""This is a shifting threat, not a spike, that puts a strain not just on counter-terror police but neighbourhood officers. ""This is not sustainable for my police service,"" she added. In an earlier blog post,external, Ms Thornton wrote: ""Fewer officers and Police Community Support Officers will cut off the intelligence that is so crucial to preventing attacks. ""Withdrawal from communities risks undermining their trust in us, at a time when we need people to have the confidence to share information with us."" Protecting the public from terrorism may require ""difficult and unpalatable"" decisions, she added. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was Sara Thornton's ""most significant intervention"" in the debate about police funding since the terror attacks in London and Manchester. The Home Office says the government will do what is needed to keep the public safe. A spokesman said: ""We are increasing funding for counter-terrorism by Â£3.4bn and the home secretary announced Â£24m in extra support for CT [counter-terrorism] policing in addition to the Â£707m already committed for this year. ""We have also protected overall police funding in real terms since 2015 and we are sensitive to the pressures on police forces across the country. ""We are engaging with them on the demands they are currently facing."" What powers do police have to deal with terrorism?

'Deranged' Trump hardens Kim's will,"Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are trading insults after the US president's UN speech Kim Jong-un has said remarks by ""deranged"" US President Donald Trump have convinced him he is right to develop weapons for North Korea. In an unprecedented personal statement,external, Mr Kim said Mr Trump would ""pay dearly"" for a UN speech where he threatened to ""totally destroy"" the North if the US was forced to defend itself. Mr Trumpresponded,externalthat the ""madman... will be tested like never before"". The two countries have engaged in ever more heated rhetoric in recent months. Mr Kim ended his statement by saying he would ""surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged USdotardwith fire"". China responded to the war of words, warning that the situation was ""complicated and sensitive"". ""All relevant parties should exercise restraint instead of provoking each other,"" said Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang. Russia also urged restraint, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov describing the rhetoric between the two leaders as a ""kindergarten fight between children"". ""We have to calm down the hot heads,"" he told reporters at the UN on Friday. What does Kim's 'dotard' insult mean? What missiles and nuclear weapons does North Korea have? North Korea has been testing missiles at an unprecedented rate, and conducted its sixth nuclear test despite international condemnation. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, who had earlier compared Mr Trump's speech to""the sound of a barking dog""has warned that Pyongyang could test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean in response to the US president's threat. ""It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,"" Mr Ri said,quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency,external. However, he added: ""We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong-un."" North Korea crisis in 300 words What are North Korea's other WMDs? This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? By North Korea analyst Ankit Panda The prospect of a hydrogen bomb being tested in the Pacific raises a terrifying spectre - one that North Korea-watchers have mulled for some time, but which did not seem realistic until this year. Kim Jong-un could conduct an atmospheric nuclear detonation in the Pacific Ocean. This could mean mounting the nuclear device he showed the world before his 3 September nuclear test and firing it over Japan into the Pacific Ocean, demonstrating a credible thermonuclear capability. Presumably, witnessing this feat would ""tame"" Trump into accepting the ""equilibrium"" that North Korea alluded to earlier this week - a state of stable nuclear deterrence. Given the inadequacy of existing US and Japanese ballistic missile defence systems, it is far from a sure thing that such a test could be intercepted. The risks are immense. Civil aviators and mariners in the target area may perish, given that North Korea does not offer international warning of its missile launch plans - unlike other states that routinely test ballistic missiles. The environmental damage and fallout could be catastrophic. Moreover, should the missile fail over Japan - or prematurely detonate - the consequences would effectively guarantee a nuclear war in retaliation. What would a nuclear test in the Pacific mean? Mr Kim said in an English statement carried by state news agency KCNA that Mr Trump's remarks ""have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last"". He said ""now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history"", North Korea would consider the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure"" to make Mr Trump ""pay dearly for his speech"". The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base Experts say this is the first time a North Korean leader has made a direct address to an international audience. The statement came shortly after the country's delegation arrived in New York for the UN General Assembly. Analysts say that for this reason it merits serious and thorough consideration. Hours later, Mr Trump responded in a tweet: ""Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!"" In an interview with news network ABC on Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took a more measured approach. ""We are quite challenged but our diplomatic efforts continue unabated,"" he said, adding that the ""strongest economic sanctions ever"" placed against the country were still being tested. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' Earlier, Mr Kim's comments had prompted swift criticism from the Japanese government. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a news conference on Friday: ""North Korea's remarks and behaviour are provocative to regional and international security, and they are absolutely unacceptable."" North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles over Japan in the past month, raising regional tensions even further. How do you defend against Pyongyang? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Mr Trump on Thursday signed a new orderboosting sanctionsagainst North Korea, where the US treasury would target firms and financial institutions doing business with Pyongyang. He said: ""For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs."" The UN Security Council had approved new rounds of sanctions earlier this month aimed at starving North Korea of fuel and income, which were in response to Pyongyang's much-condemnedsixth nuclear teston 3 September.

Mealtimes reflect UK family life,"The definition of a family can range from a traditional household unit to multi-generational living and single parenting. Sian Davey has travelled the UK showing that there is no ""typical"" family by photographing people at mealtimes. One such family are the Chadwicks. Tom, the father of Roo and Peter, was working as an actor in London before he moved to Devon six years ago. ""I'd started to yearn for a more simple life,"" Tom says. He bought a caravan and rented out his family home for the summer. From where the caravan is now parked, it's a short walk down to the beach. ""You wake up, you get breakfast. You go to the beach and learn to surf, then you come home, clean up and think about dinner,"" he says. Chishamiso Mkundi grew up on a farm in Zimbabwe. He studied to be an engineer, married and had three sons and a daughter. The political party that Chishamiso belonged to was outlawed by Robert Mugabe. ""My presence in Zimbabwe threatened my family. So I left to claim asylum in the UK,"" he says. ""My family would join me once I got my refugee status. That was 16 years ago."" For the first two years of life in Britain, Chishamiso slept on the streets in Southampton. ""When you get wet,"" he says, ""there's no way of getting dry again."" He now helps to run a local food bank and assists other asylum seekers. His family remain in Zimbabwe. ""I was 18 when I gave birth to Holly,"" Rebecca says. ""To become a mother at such a young age was a big shock for me. The pregnancy wasn't planned."" After she was born, Rebecca was told to sit down. ""The specialist said it was highly likely our baby had Down's syndrome. ""At first I thought the diagnosis would change how I felt towards Holly. It did, but not in the way I expected. I felt this overwhelming feeling of protection towards her."" Rebecca and Holly live close to Holly's grandparents, Carol and Stuart. ""There's a lot of love between us,"" she says. Jim grew up in Portsdown Hill, overlooking Portsmouth. He was married to Joyce for 63 years. She died three years ago, and Jim still lives in their home. Jim now has dementia. Every weekend either his son Richard or his brother drives the 150-mile round trip to stay and care for him, or bring him to stay with the rest of the family in Beckenham, Kent. ""He will burst into song, making up little ditties as he goes along,"" Richard says. ""He has a smile for everyone and wants to talk to whoever will listen. He has helped form this family and it means everything to us."" Kate and Iain Morrison have known each other since they were children, and now have two of their own. They work as crofters, the sustainable farming practice that uses the Hebridean islands' salty peat. ""It's a way of life,"" Iain says. ""It's something you're born with."" But as well as farming, Iain works nights as a nurse at the local hospital. On sunny days, Kate takes Niall and Amelia and friends down to the private stretch of beach by their croft. ""We are here to nurture Niall and Amelia, to help them grow into the next generation,"" Kate says. ""They can either go out into the wider world or work the land we have handed over to them."" ""There isn't a schedule or time for anything really in our home,"" Denise says. ""It's usually a case of when it happens it happens, so be grateful."" Denise is a single mum to four children, ranging from 12 to 23 years old. She works full-time as a teaching assistant, supporting children with special educational needs in Birmingham. ""In the mornings, you have breakfast if you want it, which most of the time results in none of us having breakfast,"" she says. She has taught her children to be honest, open and supportive of each other. Each has their own talent, in music, acting and dance. Her youngest boy, Remar, is on trial with Leicester City FC. ""We stick together,"" she says. ""We're a unit of individuals."" After past marriages, Tom and Anna met through friends. ""We just had a feeling we were meant to be together,"" Tom says. Billy, their son, was born eight years ago with Down's syndrome. He has suffered life-threatening seizures throughout his life. ""His smile allows him to get away with a whole lot of mischief,"" Anna says. Christina was born on Uist in the Outer Hebrides and owns a little house in a hamlet near the sea. She was 26 when she had Sebastian. His father was in the military, on the island for training but now mostly absent. She works as a cashier in the supermarket across the road and then, in the evenings, as a chef at a local hotel. While she works, Sebastian is taken over to his grandmother's or to stay with friends. ""We always eat breakfast together,"" she says. ""It tends to be the only time we're always together."" ""We're content,"" she says. ""We're a real team. We love to be together.""

Neanderthal brains 'grew more slowly',"The skeleton of a boy that shattered our view of Neanderthal brain development A new study shows that Neanderthal brains developed more slowly than ours. An analysis of a Neanderthal child's skeleton suggests that its brain was still developing at a time when the brains of modern human children are fully formed. This is further evidence that this now extinct human was not more brutish and primitive than our species. The research has been published in the journal Science,external. Until now it had been thought that we were the only species whose brains developed relatively slowly. Unlike other apes and more primitive humans,Homo sapienshas an extended period of childhood lasting several years. This is because it takes time and energy to develop our large brain.Previous studies of Neanderthal remains indicated that they developed more quickly than modern humans,external- suggesting that their brains might be less sophisticated. But a team led by Prof Antonio Rosas of the Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid found that if anything, Neanderthal brains may have developed more slowly than ours. ""It was a surprise,"" he told BBC News. ""When we started the study we were expecting something similar to the previous studies."" The remains were discovered inside the El SidrÃ³n cave in Asturias, Spain. Prof Rosas and his team believe they are right and the previous studies are wrong because for the first time they were able to study a relatively complete skeleton of a child at a crucial stage in their development. It was of a boy, who was nearly seven-and-a-half years old when he died. His bones were found in the 49,000-year-old site of El SidrÃ³n, in Spain. The boy's remains are exceptionally well preserved and include a mix of baby and adult teeth, which enabled the team to accurately determine his age. This brain is estimated to have been 87.5% of the size of an average adult Neanderthal brain upon death. A modern human child at the same general age would have, on average, a brain that was 95% the size of an adult's. The researchers also found that some of the small bones forming the boy's backbone were not fused. In modern humans, these bones tend to fuse by the time children reach the age of six. The researchers were surprised to discover that Neanderthal brains develop more slowly According to Prof Rosas, the finding reinforces the idea that Neanderthals were not that different from us. The brutish picture of Neanderthals is an old one. In the last few years there has been growing evidence to suggest that they were a distinct human species with some small differences. Now we can say that their growth pattern is similar to ours, too. The finding raises the intriguing possibility that the Neanderthals' slightly slower brain development meant that their brains might have been more advanced than ours. But Prof Rosas prefers a more prosaic interpretation. ""Neanderthals have a larger brain and larger body and so it is logical to think that the brain of the Neanderthal continues to grow for a little longer to allow their brains and bodies to get to their adult size,"" he explained. Before this finding, scientists believed that modern humans were the slowest growing species. Now we know that Neanderthals took slightly longer, suggesting that both species inherited this growth pattern from a now extinct common ancestor.

Epilepsy drug warnings 'not reaching women',"This video can not be played The dangers of taking an epilepsy drug during pregnancy are ""not taken seriously"" says Susan Cole Almost 70% of women surveyed about a powerful epilepsy drug have not received new safety warnings about the dangers of taking it during pregnancy, the BBC has been told exclusively. Sodium valproate, known as Epilim, carries a 10% risk of physical abnormalities in unborn babies. About 20,000 children have been harmed by valproate medicines in the UK since the 1970s. The medicines regulator said the drug had been kept under constant review. Babies exposed to the drug in the womb have a 40% risk of developing autism, low IQ and learning disabilities. The survey of 2,000 women and girls with epilepsy under 50 was commissioned by three charities - Epilepsy Society, Epilepsy Action and Young Epilepsy. Of the 475 currently taking the drug, 68% said they had not received the new warnings known as the Valproate Toolkit. The toolkit was launched in February 2016 and included printed warnings for patients in GPs' surgeries, hospitals and pharmacies, containing up-to-date information on the risks for neuro-developmental disorders in children of women taking the drug. The toolkit was created after the European Medicines Agency told all national watchdogs to improve information for patients. The survey also showed that one in six women taking sodium valproate did not know the drug could ""negatively affect the development and/or physical health of children born to women taking this medication"". Twenty-one per cent said they had not had a discussion initiated by a healthcare professional about the risks of taking the drug during pregnancy. Three-year-old Alfie Mason has been affected by the epilepsy drug Sodium Valproate has been prescribed since the 1970s but it was only last year that warnings were put on packets, as part of the new warning system. Many mothers of some of the 20,000 children harmed by the drug in the UK since that time insist they were never told about the harm it could do. Natasha Mason's son Alfie, who is three years old, has only just learned to walk. He has been severely harmed by the drug. Natasha said: ""I wasn't aware it could cause any problems to the unborn child. ""It wasn't until I went to see a paediatrician with my son when he was 10 months old, that it began to clickâ¦ ""He mentioned foetal valproate syndrome and that was when I started to panic."" The Epilepsy Society is now calling on the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to make immediate changes to prevent GPs issuing repeat prescriptions to women for more than 12 months without face-to-face consultations with them. It also wants routine checks at family planning clinics to include discussions about the risks of sodium valproate in pregnancy. Its chief executive Clare Pelham, said the survey showed that the number of women who had never had a conversation with their doctor about the risks of the drug was ""stubbornly high, hovering around 20%"". She added: ""Thousands of babies have been born with disabilities whose mothers were totally unaware of the risks - and will continue to be, if nothing is done. ""Politicians don't very often get the chance to do something as important as this for mothers and babies; and even less often is it so simple and so inexpensive."" The results of the survey will be presented next week to the European Medicines Agency, which will examine whether current warnings are adequate. The Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK says valproate had been, ""kept under constant review and as new data have become available, the warnings have been updated"". The MHRA said: ""The results of the survey are important in helping us understand the effectiveness of the measures taken to date in the UK.  We want to encourage all women to have access to the valproate toolkit materials that we made available in February 2016. ""We constantly monitor the safe use of valproate and support this latest review by the European Medicines Agency on the use in pregnancy and women of childbearing age."" Its advice is that patients should not stop taking the medicine without consulting their doctor. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""Any incidences in which valproate has been prescribed with pregnant women are a cause for concern. ""We call on all agencies to redouble efforts to ensure that the most up to date warnings are widely distributed to all healthcare professionals and patients - and the RCGP will continue to play our part in ensuring we achieve this. ""Patients should never hesitate to raise any concerns they have about valproate, or any other medication, with their GP or other health professional."" The Association of British Neurologists said it was working closely with the MHRA to ensure that any young woman who is taking sodium valproate is fully aware of - and reminded of - the risks of becoming pregnant while taking this treatment.
