How Terriers & Royals gatecrashed final,"Sky Bet Championship play-off final: Huddersfield Town v Reading Date:Monday, 29 MayKick-off:15:00 BSTVenue:Wembley Stadium Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Radio Leeds & BBC Radio Berkshire; live text and radio commentary on the BBC Sport website and app from 11:00 BST Saturday, 7 May 2016 is not a date that will hold particularly great memories for either Huddersfield or Reading. The Terriers ended the 2015-16 Championship season in 19th place after a crushing 5-1 home defeat by Brentford, while the Royals lost 3-1 at Blackburn - their sixth defeat in seven matches - to finish 17th. Just over a year on, it could scarcely be more different. The teams will meet in the play-off final at Wembley on Monday, in a match worth at least Â£170m to the winner. How did they turn their fortunes around? Huddersfield Town - David Wagner This video can not be played Huddersfield will be bouncing - Wagner Terriers chairman Dean Hoyle was clearly delighted with his newest appointment whenWagner took charge in November 2015. He told the club website: ""David's football philosophy is directly in line with ours; he fits for what we need. He will be head coach. He is the club's first from outside the UK and Ireland and he brings a new approach and new ideas."" Hoyle had grown weary of British managers delivering short-term results without a long-term plan and what he believed to be short change on his considerable investment into the club. The former Borussia Dortmund II boss lost three of his first four matches, but Championship survival was attained while Wagner set about evolving every aspect of the way the team operated both on and off the field. To the dismay of some players, he moved training sessions in line with when games started and asked the squad to meet for pre-match meals even for home games. Wagner added 13 new players as he sought to build a side able to play the style of football he had had success with in Germany. The results were miraculous. Town won eight of their first 11 league matches, finished in the Championship play-off places for the first time and are one win away from ending a 45-year absence from the top flight. Reading - Jaap Stam This video can not be played Stam excited by Premier League opportunity FollowingBrian McDermott's rather low-key departureafter a second spell in charge of the club that lasted just six months, Reading decided to go Dutch for his successor. Former defender Stam was the man picked for his first full-time foray into management, having most famously been part of Manchester United's treble-winning side of 1999. ""Reading are very ambitious, like I am, and want to get back to the Premier League,"" he said in June 2016. ""Hopefully we can have a good partnership and get there."" His appointment was not initially warmly welcomed by everyone, as co-chairman Sir John Madejski revealed at Stam's first news conferencehe had not been behind the decision to sack McDermott. Stam gave a conservative estimate of how his side might fare in his first season. ""There are teams in there who will make it hard to be in the top 10,""he said in pre-season.""You can't expect us to end up in the top six."" After winning only one of their first four league games, a few boos could be heard from the home fans as Reading, who have not been in the Premier League since 2013, bedded into Stam's possession-based approach. Fast forward nine months through a season of just two home defeats and the reality is beyond Stam's and probably many supporters' expectations. ""We never dreamed of getting to this game,"" Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire. ""But I've always had the belief in what I can do. It's not just about me, it's about my staff as a manager can't do it on his own. ""I'm happy we've achieved this in the first season, but it's going to build the expectation for next season as well. So we need to be realistic. ""Let's enjoy it for now and work towards getting that result on Monday."" Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner shares a joke with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp before a pre-season friendly between the two teams Huddersfield Much like great friend and former Borussia Dortmund colleague Jurgen Klopp, Wagner favours a high pressing 4-2-3-1 formation but it would be overly simplistic to say his team are just aboutgegenpressing. Wagner puts a great deal of emphasis on quick transitions all around the pitch and there is a lot of onus on all players to put in performances high in both energy and tactical discipline. The tireless work of the front four in both attacking and defensive situations is often at the expense of personal glory. Town's top scorer this season is Elias Kachunga with 13 goals in 47 appearances. However, it is this work-rate that often creates the platform for full-backs Chris Lowe and Tommy Smith to advance beyond the forwards and get behind opposition defences. Wagner is not completely tied to his pressing philosophy and notably changed tactics for August's trip to Newcastle. Huddersfield beat the Magpies 2-1, having spent the majority of the game sitting back and allowing the hosts to dominate possession. Reading Possession, possession, possession has defined Stam's Reading this season. His side have averaged 57.4% in the Championship. As already mentioned, the Dutchman's philosophy has not appealed to everyone. It attracted critics after a2-0 defeat by Leeds in Decemberwhen, despite having 77% of the ball, the Royals registered just two shots on target. Although Stam has not necessarily departed from the approach, there has been a sense of it being sacrificed in pursuit of getting results. Yann Kermorgant has spent much of the season as a sole striker, but Lewis Grabban - on loan from Bournemouth - has partnered him in attack in recent matches to offer an additional outlet. Even before the play-off semi-final against Fulham, pundits refused to back Reading's chances of progressing. In both legs, Reading saw considerably less of the ball, but took their opportunities. Huddersfield Almost all of the 13 new players signed last summer have played a major part in Town's success, as well as their two January additions. Aaron Mooy, on loan from Manchester City, was included in the Championship's team of the year after an outstanding season in midfield. Key to the way Town break teams down are the overlapping runs made by full-backs Lowe and Smith, a player who has been reinvented by Wagner, and the duo have chipped in with 13 assists and six goals between them. Perhaps most impressively given their achievements this season, Town's record signing is the Â£1.8m they paid 1860 Munich for centre-half Christopher Schindler in June 2016. For context, that fee made Schindler the 43rd most expensive signing in the Championship last summer. Reading The biggest success of Stam's squad has undoubtedly been a player who was already at the club before his arrival. French striker Yann Kermorgant, at the age of 35, has weighed in with 19 goals. Another consistent performer has been goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi. The former Wigan player was man of the match in the play-off semi-final second leg, pulling off a string of saves to deny Fulham an equaliser. The Oman international was named player of the season for a second successive year in recognition of his 16 clean sheets. This video can not be played No final pressure on Reading - Swift John Swift, who joined last summer from Chelsea, has contributed eight league goals from midfield and was namedEFL Young Player of the Month for January. ""The gameplan's been the main thing this season, everyone working together to get a result,"" said the 21-year-old. ""After the season, I think we'll all look back on how well we've done. But it's a huge game ahead of us and we can't think too much about that."" Paul Ogden, Huddersfield Town commentator for BBC Radio Leeds: I would use the two regular season meetings between the teams as a fairly solid indicator for how Monday's game will go. With both teams having won one apiece - and both by a margin of 1-0 - it would not surprise me remotely if this game were to go beyond the 90 minutes. Neither team gives much away and neither defence is particularly vulnerable, so I could envisage a game that may not be the most exciting to the neutral. Should we need extra time, there is no concern that Town's high-energy approach could leave them at a disadvantage on what could be a hot May day at Wembley. Wagner is a meticulous planner and, straight after beating Sheffield Wednesday, the players went to Portugal for a warm weather training camp. Tim Dellor, Reading commentator for BBC Radio Berkshire: Anyone who says they know who will win this game is guessing - it's far too tight to call. With only four points separating the two teams over the 46 games, the stats back that up. The two teams have reached the most valuable game in football in a similar manner. Statistically, tactically, and managerially there is little difference, leaving us with the mental toughness of the players. The team that best copes with the stress of the big occasion, the huge crowd and the enormous consequences of success or failure will inevitably be the ones playing in the Premier League next season.

'I'm running for Manchester',"This video can not be played Great Manchester Run started with silence... and ended with defiant cheers For a few horrifying hours on Monday night Mancunians were stunned into silence as we learnt that 22 people went to a pop concert and never came home. But today, as tens of thousands of runners and spectators packed the city centre for its annual Great Run, Manchester roared. There was no escaping the jarring new addition to this year's Great Manchester Run: armed police. By the start line, down side streets, even on rooftops. Their presence was felt everywhere. Indeed, early arrivals into the city were greeted with more officers than runners, their black uniforms standing stark against the sea of balloons and colour on Portland Street, where the annual 10k race begins. But we knew why they were necessary. The UK terror threat may just have beendowngraded from critical to severebut the terrible events of Monday are still too raw, too close for anyone in Manchester to object to armed police on our streets. Armed police were out in force during the race If runners were anxious by the presence though, few showed it. The smiles of anticipation were still there on the faces of those determined to enjoy the day. Laughter among groups of friends and running clubs still rang out above the general buzz of the start pens. Earlier, as the crowd built and more and more runners streamed off Metrolink trams to head to the start line - and their upcoming battle with the road and clock - some admitted to lingering nerves. ""It crosses your mind about something happening,"" says Kathryn, from Chorlton in south Manchester, who was running in memory of her parents and also to honour the victims of the attack. ""However, if it's going to happen there's nothing you can do about it. So we just have to keep going - and that's what we will do."" Carmel Jacobs said she was ""really pleased"" she decided to bring her children to the run Carmel Jacobs, from Bolton, brought her children Dhilan, eight, and four-year-old Sahana to take part in the junior run - and cheer on husband Marcus in the earlier half marathon. ""Earlier on in the week we weren't going to bring these two,"" she says, gesturing to the children. ""But actually in the end we thought 'no, we're going to come'. And I'm really pleased we did."" Rhys Jacob, 36, from Marple Bridge, also ran the half but decided not bring his wife and daughter to cheer him on, admitting to a ""little bit"" of nervousness about the security situation. ""It was quite emotional at the start. There was a minute's silenceâ¦ and then we got going and everyone got it into it - and it felt good,"" he says, describing the level of security as reassuring. For many, running is the ultimate solitary sport. You versus the road with just your mind and body to propel you forward. This video can not be played Brothers Patrick and Brian Leigh said they were taking part as ""proud Mancunians"" But events like these are more than that. The power of thousands of people competing against themselves, together, can be a humbling experience. And the Great Manchester Run is more than a run, it's a celebration of people. Every year, you see it in the faces of the spectators roaring their loved ones to the finish line on Deansgate, one of the main thoroughfares through the city centre. You see joy, belief. Above all, pride. You see it on the thousands upon thousands of ""I'm running for"" signs on the backs of runners to celebrate the lives of loved-ones they've lost, or the people who've helped them in their darkest hours. Today was different. Most simply read: ""Manchester"". This determination to celebrate the city was echoed by many of those taking part. They included Brian Leigh, 47, from Sale, who was clear on what he wanted from the day. ""Just to soak the atmosphere up, feel the love from the crowd,"" he beams. ""We're proud Mancunians so we just want to be here for the day really and show our solidarity."" Young athletes show their solidarity with the people of Manchester ahead of the junior boys' race Foremost in everyone's minds as we anxiously waited to cross the start line was honouring the victims of Monday, and thinking of those who continue to lie in hospital beds across this city and its surrounding boroughs. Another Chorlton runner, Claire, 34, says she was running for Manchester Children's Hospital because it's ""more important than ever to support them"". ""And I think it's important for those of us in Manchester that we're carrying on with life as normal and getting [out there] together,"" she adds, before heading to the start line to join the first wave of runners. In that first group there was a new addition to proceedings from previous years - poet Tony Walsh, aka ""Longfella"", whose This is the Place recital folded even the hardest of hearts at the vigil for victims earlier in this difficult week. As pre-run nerves turned inevitably to thoughts of those affected by the arena attack, he had more inspirational words in new poem, ""Do Something"". And as he urged all of us to ""do something to show them what you're made of, beat something you're afraid of"", I looked around and saw determination in the faces of those listening. Most of us, I'm sure, found an extra reserve of energy to take on those personal battles. And then we were off, a horn sending thousands of people forward down Portland Street and out towards Chester Road and Manchester United's Old Trafford Stadium, the thoughts now on finishing the race. The crowds were noticeably thinner, both on the way out to Salford Quays and the home straight up Deansgate. That was perhaps inevitable, given what this city has just been through. But their power was not diminished. Personally, I was struggling in the last few hundred metres with heavy legs and a rapidly escaping target time when a man running for the Alzheimer's Society shouted, suddenly: ""Come On Manchester, get us home."" The roar was simply deafening. This video can not be played Great Manchester Run: Whatâs it like to cross the finish line of your first 10k?

Five questions for BA over IT crash,"BA says that: ""The root cause was a power supply issue which our affected our IT systems - we continue to investigate this."" The airline said it could not add anything further at this stage, but it is understood that all systems are not fully up and running yet. John Strickland, air transport expert and director at JLS Consulting, says:  ""The problem has affected multiple parts of the business which are not only customer-facing, but also operational-facing, and without which the airline could not do many tasks, for example completing load sheets [which are needed for fuel calculations] for aircraft."" BA flights chaos continues at Heathrow The GMB union has suggested the BA computer systems failure was ""another example of the shortcomings of BA IT systems since they made a number of staff redundant, and outsourced their work to India in 2016."" Mick Rix, GMB national officer for aviation said: ""BA made hundreds of dedicated and loyal IT staff redundant and outsourced the work to India. BA have made substantial profits in for a number of years, and many viewed the company's actions as just plain greedy"". And BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott said: ""Yes, the union has a big axe to grind, but still, people will want to know if BA made its IT systems more vulnerable by scaling back computer support to save money."" Meanwhile aviation expert Mr Strickland, added: ""Surely a business should be able to make an outsourcing decision without any problems, if it is done in a quality-controlled way. ""But this issue is part of the analysis that will have to be done by BA."" But the airline says: ""We would never compromise the integrity and security of our IT systems. IT services are now provided globally by a range of suppliers and this is very common practice across all industries and the UK government. ""British Airways employs around 35,000 people in the UK providing high skilled and well paid jobs. It hires 1,000 people a year and has a strong apprenticeship programme."" BA says: ""Customers on flights that have been cancelled can claim a full refund or rebook to a future date for travel up until the end of November 2017. Customers are urged to keep any food, transport or accommodation receipts and can make a claim in due course through our Customer Relations teams. ""We are refunding or rebooking customers who suffered cancellations on to new services as quickly as possible and have also introduced more flexible rebooking policies for anyone due to travel on Sunday and Monday who no longer wishes to fly to/from Heathrow or Gatwick. ""We have provided customers with hotel accommodation. ""The best channel for customers to use to get information about their flight is Manage My Booking on ba.com. This is now updated regularly. ""We have also been using social media to communicate, and airport communication channels. Our CEO video which was posted on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook... has received more than 175,000 views. ""We are extremely sorry for the disruption caused to customers and understand how much frustration this is causing."" Delayed travellers will also be able toclaim financial compensation under EU law,external, unless the disruption has been caused by factors outside the airline's control. In 2014 two UK Supreme Court judgements stated airlines should have to pay out when a delay was caused by a technical fault. BA passengers 'trying not to cry' BA says: ""We have been doing everything possible to provide as much information to customers as possible, but it has been challenging. ""Many of the systems our staff usually use have not been functioning properly which has meant we were slower than usual to give customers accurate information at the airports. ""In addition, unfortunately the systems that we use to send emails and texts to individual customers about their flights have also been affected by the IT problems, so we haven't been able to communicate with customers in our usual ways."" There had been complaints from passengers on Saturday that they had not been informed their flights were cancelled until after the airline had put out a media statement announcing the decision. Passenger Terry Page, 28, from London told the Press Association: ""There's no such announcement here. The boards are showing go to gate, and no mention of cancellations."" Communications complaints continued at Heathrow on Sunday, with one passenger telling the BBC they had ""no idea how much longer we'll be here and we're getting no communication from the staff"". Aviation expert John Strickland was at Heathrow on Saturday to collect a friend flying in from Mexico, and says : ""Communications have been a challenge. ""There were BA people there on Saturday doing what they could, but the tools usually at the disposal of staff were not available. ""We are becoming more and more reliant on automation, even in things like communications, and less on actual people.  It means it is a challenge for businesses when things go wrong."" John Strickland says: ""They will have to sit down in the cold light of day and analyse the causes and how to eliminate them in future. ""There will need to be in-depth planning in terms of managing any similar potential situation again. ""BA is used to things like bad weather, or air traffic control issues, and other challenges, but this is different.  By its very nature they did not have the information available that they would have liked to have had."" But he also added: ""This could have happened to any other airline, including a low-cost one.""

"Music helps Manchester remember, and forget","The Courteeners singer Liam Fray started the show with a poem about the attack Five days after the Manchester attack, 50,000 people turned out for one of the city's biggest concerts of the year. It was a chance for music fans to unite and remember the victims - but also to get lost in music for a while. There were a few signs that The Courteeners' show at Old Trafford cricket ground on Saturday was not an ordinary gig. There were the armed police outside the ground, the flags at half mast over the pavilion, the regular proud chants of ""Manchester, la la la"" from the crowd, the smattering of ""I heart MCR"" T-shirts and #WeStandTogether stickers. There were also the home-made signs, like the one held aloft by a girl teetering on the shoulders of a friend who was sitting on the shoulders of someone else. It read ""Hate won't tear us apart"" - a reference to the song Love Will Tear Us Apart by another Manchester band, Joy Division. This was one of a number of home-made signs responding to the past week's events Music has always brought people together, especially in this city. This gig was booked months ago. But since the bombing that killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday, and especially with such a big crowd and an all-Manchester line-up, it became about more than just having a good night - it became about unity, defiance and release. It was the biggest gig of The Courteeners' careers, but the indie band's frontman Liam Fray told BBC News before the show it was ""not about us any more"". He said: ""It's about everybody else. It's not just even about the fans that come into the gig, but the city as a whole."" So before his band played a note, Fray appeared alone on stage to read a poem written by Ryan Williams in response to the attack, celebrating the ""city of tracksuits and bibles and burkas"". It ends with the lines: So come at us again, and again if you must. Time after time, we'll rise from the dust. And you'll never prevail, not against us. Because this is our Manchester, our Manchester, and the bees still buzz. The roar that greeted that last line would surely have drowned out any cheer the ground has ever heard in response to any Ashes-winning wicket. These signs including ""Mancs never scared 2 B proud"" referred to the city's bee emblem As the gig went on, Fray referred to the week's events again. ""Never stop doing what you enjoy,"" he told the crowd between songs. Later, he said to them: ""I just want to say how incredibly proud I was to be Mancunian this week. ""Hearts were broken on Monday. And what I've seen of this city and you lot will stay with me for the rest of my life."" He recalled a woman who sang Oasis's Don't Look Back In Anger after the one-minute's silence in St Ann's Square on Thursday, with the rest of those present gradually joining in. Inspired by that woman, Fray played the song that has now become an anthem of the city's resilience. Fifty-thousand voices joined him and echoed around the ground. Armed police guarded the venue and fans were searched on their way in The Courteeners were supported by The Charlatans, Blossoms and Cabbage - all guitar bands. Their fans are a bit older than Ariana Grande's, and have probably never willingly listened to one of the US pop diva's songs in their lives. But Saturday's crowd had lots in common with those at Manchester Arena five days earlier. As well as mostly being from the same city, they know well the thrill of seeing their favourite act live, and the sense of belonging that comes from singing every word at the top of your voice with thousands of other like-minded souls. And, like everyone in the city, they have felt the shock, pain and incomprehension that spread after Monday's attack. Manchester music fans try to carry on Take That hail spirit of Manchester Ariana Grande plans Manchester benefit gig ""After what happened this week, the timing for a Manchester gig couldn't be better really to pull the city together,"" said one Courteeners fan, Matt O'Connor, 37, from Rossendale, Lancashire, before the show. Seventeen-year-old Amber Clarke from Droylsden wore a top bearing the city's bee emblem. She said: ""I feel more proud, and I feel less scared actually. The city's reaction to what happened has just given people so much courage and so much hope."" Most fans refused to let the week's events dampen their spirits Another fan in the queue, Cliff Challenger from Stalybridge, said: ""There's more defiance, more than anything - just to show that you can't scare us off. ""Plus we've paid for the tickets,"" he added with a laugh. ""So you can't not turn up, let's be honest. That's the proper northern spirit coming through."" Not everyone took the decision over whether to go to the gig lightly. Liam Wilks has seen every Courteeners gig in Manchester since 2011 - but sold his ticket for Saturday. ""I just know I wouldn't enjoy it,"" he said beforehand. ""I wouldn't be focusing on the music, I'd be focusing on if I saw anything suspicious or... I wouldn't be listening to the music. I'd be watching everything else."" CCTV shows bomber before arena blast Hate crimes 'double' after arena attack Defiant attack poem to become book Others undoubtedly stayed away, but it was hard to tell how many. There was a huge crowd, though, and those that did attend were determined to enjoy it and let off steam as well as showing solidarity and respect. The best gigs are the ones where you lose yourself in the music and retreat from reality for a couple of hours. Despite the reminders of the recent events, this was no different. So while the armed guards kept watch outside and the flags flew at half mast, fans inside sat on their friends' shoulders, put their arms around their neighbours' necks, drank lots, moshed, laughed, took off their T-shirts and whirled them above their heads, and sang at the tops of their voices. Just like they always have done, and hopefully always will. Additional reporting by Colin Paterson.

The rave that changed the law,"Ravers knew they could 'just turn up' to the festivals held by New Age Travellers On a hot bank holiday weekend 25 years ago, 20,000 people descended on land in the shadow of the Malvern Hills. The word was spread by an answering machine message: ""Right, listen up revellers. It's happening now and for the rest of the weekend, so get yourself out of the house and on to Castlemorton Common... Be there, all weekend, hardcore."" To say the event spiralled out of control is an understatement. What started out as a small free festival for travellers not only went down in history as the biggest illegal rave ever held in the UK, but resulted in a trial costing Â£4m and the passing of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. The resulting publicity also had drastic consequences for the ""alternative"" lifestyle of the so-called New Age Travellers who started the event and for the underground rave movement who gate-crashed it. Thousands of people heard about the event through word-of-mouth, media coverage and the infamous telephone message The travelling community had been intent on holding the latest in a series of small events, having successfully held the so-called Avon Free Festival at Inglestone Common in Gloucestershire in the 1980s and early 90s. In the weeks leading up to that fateful May bank holiday in 1992, they had tried and failed to stage festivals in both counties and in Somerset, where the police had repeatedly moved them on. Retreating, they considered their options in a lay-by on the A38 in Gloucestershire, where it was decided to take their 10-mile long convoy out of the county, into Worcestershire and on to Castlemorton Common, near Malvern. Libby Spragg was in one of the first vehicles to arrive at the site on the 22 May. The 24-year-old joined the New Age Travellers in 1987 and had been to previous events across the West Country, including Inglestone. She said the festivals were a chance ""for networking, finding new work opportunities and just meeting friends that you couldn't really see at any other time"", after a winter spent living and working on farms. ""Ingleston Common [had] one small stage, no dance music, and was part of the small free festival scene that had been bubbling along since the 60s."" This video can not be played The answering machine message that started the Castlemorton Common rave Castlemorton should have continued that theme, she said, a low-key gathering for roughly 400 travellers. What they hadn't banked on was the thousands of people who had heard about the event through word-of-mouth, media coverage and the infamous telephone message. Carl Hendrickse, whose band Back to the Planet played at the festival, said a large number of people had been regularly travelling up and down the M25 to raves. ""People were not being given the right to gather,"" he explained. ""There were no facilities for people to come and dance, gather with like-minded people, and that is why they started happening illegally, because there were no proper facilities for people to have these kind of events."" New Age Traveller Libby Spragg was interviewed by TV on her way to the site Carl Loben, editor of DJ magazine, said in a world before mobile phones, the answering machine messages were key to spreading word about the raves. ""There was often just a message left on a party [phone] line that people could call after a certain time in the evening,"" he said. ""And it would say the rave is at [some location], meet at [this] junction of the motorway, or meet in the service station, and you'd go in convoy."" People would travel to festivals like Castlemorton in convoy Ravers remember it as a positive atmosphere with like-minded people Mrs Spragg believes the combination of a gloriously sunny bank holiday and the promise of a ready-made party was what drew ravers to Castlemorton. ""You were getting [sound system collectives like] Spiral Tribe and the big [underground] DJs of the time latching onto the idea to take it out doors and the free festival scene was a real ""no brain"" way to do that,"" she said. ""They could see what was happening with the travellers and [knew] they could turn up. ""[It wasn't] helped by the media to be honest - if they hadn't said anything it would have just stopped as it was. ""But as soon as you start putting it out on the television that there's this huge party everyone jumps in their car and just turns up."" The 392-acre Castlemorton Common was made a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1986 The music went on until the early hours and started again at midday And so the underground warehouse rave scene arrived, with its big sound systems in tow. Mrs Spragg says there was ""some resentment"" among the travellers who felt their event had been ""taken over"" and part of the festival was declared a ""raver free zone"". But while the travellers felt surrounded, so did those living on the common, such as Mary Weaver. ""On the bank below the hills it was tightly compacted, and as you went down by our [farm] pond there were double-decker buses lined up all along there,"" she remembered. ""It was very disruptive because no-one could get in or out - not with a vehicle. ""They had some very loud sound systems and they played very loud music, but in actual fact the music didn't worry me that much, because I like music. ""But it did other people, it drove [them] mad. It stopped about five o'clock in the morning and it started up about midday."" Travellers used festivals as a way to network, find new work opportunities and meet friends News of the festival spread locally, helped by the volume of the music, which could easily be heard in Malvern 10 miles (16km) away - a fact former resident, Tim Holloway, can attest. ""I was coming back from an all-night party in Malvern and walking back at about five in the morning I could hear this booming beat - I had no idea what it could be,"" he said. ""Later someone told me there was this massive rave on Castlemorton Common. ""We rode through on motorbikes and I was stunned, it was just enormous. We took it all in, soaked up the atmosphere - it was just an enormous party - a gift when you're 21."" Clare Buchanan, who was on a gap year, heard about the festival when some of those en route stopped at the supermarket in Malvern where she worked. ""They looked like full-on hippies, which is what I wanted to be,"" she recalled. ""My and a friend went along to investigate what was going on. We were dropped off and there were two policemen at the end of the road across the common. ""There was a very chilled atmosphere."" Back To The Planet played at Castlemorton Common in 1992 But by Saturday night, West Mercia Police had arrived and put up a cordon. Officers were stationed with Ms Weaver and fellow resident Audrey Street who said she ""never went out once"" the whole week. She described how the single track road across the common was completely blocked in places by the encampment and the complete absence of toilets had another unwanted effect. ""Every time I went out there were people in the field toileting - every time you looked out there were men with their trousers down,"" she said. Mary Weaver's farm, pictured now, was taken over by festival-goers The encampment stretched up the hill from the farm near her house The ravers drifted off once the weekend was over but the travellers remained at Castlemorton until the Friday, partly to try and clear up, Mrs Spragg claims. ""I think a lot of people were depressed about the mess and the waste, that's why so many [of us] stayed behind and tried to clear up. ""Although people don't think it, the traveller ethos at free festivals was ""leave no trace"" - you went there, you had a party you cleaned up. ""In fact I was one of the many people who used to take wild flower seeds, and that would be the only thing I left - that sounds like I'm a real hippy but that was the vibe,"" she said. But there was no chance revellers would ever again have the opportunity to ""leave no trace"". As the festival wound down, police faced angry questions at a public meeting in Castlemorton village about how they had responded. The fallout of the festival had an impact on the travelling scene In a press conference on the Friday after the common had been cleared, then Chief Constable, David Blakey, defended his ""softly softly"" approach. ""Faced with... the number of people that were there, there was no way I'm going in with riot shields, with public order gear, to move them off,"" he said at the time. Officers arrested about 50 people over the course of the festival - mainly for drug offences - and 10 were taken to court for public order offences. The case cost millions and saw all the defendants acquitted, though one other person did plead guilty to the same offence. The force later admitted they had been ""caught off guard"" by the sudden arrival of so many people. An exclusion zone was set up banning convoys from the area Determined not to have history repeat itself, the following year they set up roadblocks across the area, with 300 officers being fed from a special kitchen set up in the village hall. The Malvern Hills Conservators - the charity set up to look after the hills and commons -  obtained an injunction which enforced a five-mile ""exclusion zone"" for convoys of vehicles around Castlemorton during the bank holiday weekend. Others called for long-term powers to stop raves and free festivals, including Castlemorton's then-Conservative MP Sir Michael Spicer, who even raised the matter in Parliament. Then in 1994, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act was passed, giving police the powers to stop vehicles anywhere within five miles (8km) of a rave and turn them away. It also included rules targeting gatherings of more than 100 people listening to music at night and even went as far as delving into genres, said Prof Robert Lee from Birmingham Law School. ""One of the most bizarre things is that they tried to define what music was, including wholly or mainly repetitive beats played time and time again,"" he added. Police faced angry questions at a public meeting in Castlemorton village Mrs Spragg, who gave up travelling in 1995, says what happened at Castlemorton had an adverse effect on the community she belonged to. ""The travelling scene did carry on but it was a very different change of lifestyle for people - they moved onto farms instead of living on free sites so much, and people were a lot more scared. ""If it had been a big event, [which] had been staged [and] had cost thousands of pounds it would have been all right. ""But because it was poor people, with no money, doing something they haven't been granted permission for, suddenly it was the crime of the century. ""It did mean the end of the travelling scene in a lot of respects.""

Cannes: The critics' verdicts,"After 10 days of films, frocks and fizz, the 70th Cannes Film Festival has come to an end. The prestigious Palme d'Or has been handed out, having been chosen from a selection of 19 films in competition. The jury, headed by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, selected winners for acting, writing and directing too. But did the jury get it right? Film critics gave the BBC their views on the hits and misses from the festival. Jon Frosch, reviews editor atThe Hollywood Reporter,external, said: ""My favourite was French filmBPM (Beats Per Minute), about Aids activists. It's a really no-nonsense drama - both a group portrait of activists and a love story. It is really unsentimental, beautifully done, and would be my choice for the Palme d'Or."" He also had praise forGood Time- a heist film set in New York about a man trying to free his brother from jail - andThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), starring Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Ben Stiller, about a dysfunctional family coming together amid a crisis. Robert Pattinson (left) has won praise for his performance in Good Time ""I also really, really liked the Safdie brothers film Good Time,"" said Frosch. ""It's a very dynamically shot crime thriller with a great performance from Robert Pattinson, who has a really good Queens accent - he's fantastic. He's magnetic and doesn't have any of those methody mannerisms that pretty actors can sometimes do when playing low-lifes. Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler play half-brothers in The Meyerowitz Stories ""And I really liked Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories, which I thought was his most mellow film in a long time. Another surprise, other than Pattinson, was Adam Sandler in that movie - he was just really funny and tender."" Finn Halligan, chief film critic atScreen Daily,external, said this year's offering was not up to the standard of last year - which saw the Palme d'Or go to Ken Loach for I, Daniel Blake, with Oscar nominated Elle also debuting. ""Having seen all the competition titles, I'd say it hasn't been a banner year - although there were some good fun films in there, like the Safdie brothers' Good Time and Francois Ozon'sL'amant Double,"" she said. The latter film is a thriller about a model who is in a love triangle with twin brothers - and involves one of Cannes'most explicit sex scenes,externalever seen. Joaquin Phoenix stars in You Were Never Really Here She also had praise forYou Were Never Really Hereby Briton Lynne Ramsay, about a man - played by Joaquin Phoenix - trying to save a kidnapped girl, describing it as ""the flip-side of Sofia Coppola's delicate sensibilities inThe Beguiled"". That film, one of four works shown at Cannes featuring Nicole Kidman, is about an injured soldier taken in by a girls' boarding school in the American Civil War. But Halligan was more taken by Kidman's role inThe Killing of a Sacred Deer, where she plays the wife of a surgeon who brings a teenage boy into their home, with dangerous repercussions for the family. ""When she's great, she's amazing. She's completely unadorned and playing, and looking, her age - which is not a bad thing, but done in a really realistic way. It's her at her absolute best."" Jason Solomons,external, critic forRadio 4's Front RowandThe New European,external, said: ""It was an average, quite conservative selection this year - not a vintage year. They could really do with a bit more variety and a bit more looking forward. ""It all felt too white, too male and too Western and looking at the past. I still think we need to see more African cinema, more Chinese cinema and more Indian cinema."" Loveless was directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev He singled out Russian filmsLoveless- about a warring couple searching for their missing son - andGentle Creature, which tells the story of a woman visiting her husband in jail. ""Russian cinema was very strong this year, particularly the film Loveless which I thought was tremendous and powerful but also very funny and is a film meaty enough to win the Palme d'Or - it had that heft. ""Its director, Andrey Zvyagintsev, has been at the top of his game for a long time so it's time to recognise that. He's bold and brave and takes on Russia. ""Sergei Loznitsa's Gentle Creature was rather divisive - it has two good hours, then a half hour I'd cut, with a terrible rape scene which is rather brutal, and a dream sequence that doesn't make sense."" Happy End has been inspired by the themes explored in Michael Haneke's award-winning Amour He added that BPM was ""terrific"", adding: ""I found The Meyerowitz Stories sweet and funny, and it could see a supporting Oscar nomination for Dustin Hoffman."" But of Michael Haneke filmHappy End- about a bourgeois family living in Cannes - he said: ""I don't know if it's a bad film or absolute genius."" Freelance critic Damon Wise, contributing editor atEmpire,external, described it as a ""funny year"" which left people ""feeling a bit short-changed"". He said: ""I certainly know that some are wondering whether planning a starry 70th birthday party was a bigger priority for the festival."" He said Netflix's other filmOkja- Bong Joon-ho's work telling the story of a young girl's battle to save her pet superpig from an evil corporate giant - along with The Beguiled and The Killing of a Sacred Deer were among his favourites. Okja is produced by Netflix, which has been a controversial brand at Cannes He said BPM hit him ""in the gut"", adding: ""My favourite film came right at the last minute - Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here - it's so brutal and at the same time so subtle. ""I had to see it twice, just to make sure what I thought of it. It sounds obvious - a hitman wants to get out of the game - but Ramsay crafts something unexpectedly fantastic from a really familiar story. There's a terrific, totally unnerving score from Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood that kept me glued to my seat.""

Pub-lic service,"Jim Collins says his regulars do not seem particularly interested in May versus Corbyn Real ale-loving Derby North was England's narrowest won seat in the last general election when just a handful of votes changed its political makeup. Can the men and women behind the beer pumps shed any light on how punters will vote this time? Derby is a city that takes its beer seriously. There are 200 different real ales available at its countless watering holes, in addition to its 14 breweries. Its reputation for a decent pint has earned it the seal of approval from the Campaign for Real Ale, which describes Derby as the ""UK's capital of real ale"" - though Sheffield and Norwich may beg to differ - and the city also hosts the group's national winter beer festival. Quality beverages aside, it is also home to the most marginal parliamentary seat in the country, Derby North, where Conservative Amanda Solloway won in 2015 by a tiny majority of 41 votes. So as we try to work out how the constituency's drinkers and thinkers will vote this time round, who better to ask than the pub landlords with little choice but to listen in on nightly political discussions between their regulars? Some punters settle their political differences over a pint Derby North is home to the sprawling Royal Derby Hospital, which opened in 2010 and treats an estimated 180,000 patients a year. About two miles away sits city pub The Golden Eagle, where landlord Jim Collins believes healthcare is a major concern for his regulars. ""The biggest sensitive issue that a lot of our customers have mentioned is the NHS - specifically the pressure being put on the NHS by immigration,"" he said. ""That's what people think, whether it's an informed opinion or not. ""From my side of things, I'm just here to be a sounding board."" Jim, whose favourite drink is Titan Brewery's Action Man, believes most customers are still making up their minds on who to vote for. ""I'd say the majority of people who come in are open to someone changing their mind with a reasoned argument,"" he said. ""We've got some people who are pro-Tory and pro-Labour but we've got a massive majority in the middle who don't really care which party gets in as long as it gives them a better quality of life. ""They would prefer to have whoever's best rather than stick to a specific party."" Election questions, answered Poll tracker: See how the parties are lining up More on the Derby North parliamentary constituency Michael Vickers says he regularly hears regulars debating Brexit In the exotically-named New Zealand area of Derby, punters are pre-occupied with the topic guaranteed to divide opinion - the EU referendum. The city voted to leave by 57.2%. Michael Vickers, landlord of The New Zealand Arms - favourite tipple Bass - said: ""We're still talking about Brexit in here. It's a big issue. ""I'd say it's a 50/50 split here, pretty much in line with the national vote. It's a very mixed pub due to the fact we've got students here that are really going to be voting Labour I would think, and retired people who are leaning more towards the Conservatives. ""I hear a lot of debating going on and as a landlord I try to stay out of it but it's all good natured."" Graham and Janette Browett said people were ""fed up with being squeezed"" Across town, the Five Lamps pub is run by husband and wife Graham and Janette Browett. They have supported the Conservatives for the past four decades but a sharp increase in business rates has seen them reconsider where their votes should go. Janette, who doesn't have a favourite drink, said: ""I've always voted Conservative but to be honest at the moment I really don't know what I'm going to vote. ""I don't want to vote Conservative because since we've been [running the Five Lamps], corporation tax has gone up, rates have gone up. I'm amazed they haven't put VAT up."" Graham, who favours Harvest Pale Ale, said talking to Labour-supporting regulars had got him thinking. He said: ""Certainly there are people in here who are very strong Corbyn fans. If it wasn't forthe nuclear thingI would vote Labour this year, definitely. ""I think [that is what] is going to shoot him in the foot. Otherwise I think he could have come out on top. That's the feeling I get. ""[Regulars] like his talk and think he's a true man but he's not really a leader is he? ""Not in my mind."" Richard Swanwick says people seem ""passionate"" about the election Pint-sized micropub The Little Chester Ale House is situated in the fashionable Chester Green neighbourhood. Owner Richard Swanwick, favourite drink Hartshorne Brewery's Shakademus, said he tends to keep his nose out of political debates. He said: ""The main thing I've noticed is how split people are. They seem to be one way or the other. There are mixed emotions and it's quite a charged atmosphere if you start talking about it. ""We do find that if everyone's on one particular side, then we all get on. But if they're not then it can become quite heated, so there's quite a lot passion there. ""We've got a school teacher who comes in and talks about education but I'd say crime, the NHS and taxation are the main themes."" Paul and Tommy Keating said a U-turn on the smoking ban in pubs would win votes with customers The last stop is The Mile, named after an infamous pub crawl route into Derby city centre along Ashbourne Road. It is run by father and son team Paul and Tommy Keating - favourite tipples Strongbow Dark Fruits and Budweiser respectively - who said they thought quite a few of their regulars would not bother voting. Paul said: ""They're not very politically minded in here to be honest, they're more sports-minded, although a lot of people moan about the smoking ban.""

Why St Nicholas works wonders for Russians,"The Soviet Union turned its back on religion but modern Russia, under Vladimir Putin - the former KGB officer - has made religion, nationalism, patriotism and conservatism cornerstones of the Russian state, reports BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. One hundred years ago, the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin dismissed religion as an ""abomination"". ""Any religious idea, any flirtation with a god,"" he wrote, ""is the most inexpressible foulness, the most shameful infection."" Ironically, after Lenin's death, his successors turned him into a god-like figure, with Lenin portraits and statues, and his embalmed body enthroned in a temple-like mausoleum on Red Square. Encouraged by this dizzying personality cult, for decades Soviet citizens flocked to Moscow from across the USSR to pay homage to the late great Bolshevik. They would spend up to eight hours queuing outside the mausoleum, waiting for their chance to file past Lenin's wax-like corpse. Tourists wait outside Lenin's mausoleum I wonder what Mr Lenin would make of events this week in Moscow? Once again Russians have been queuing for hours. But this time, not to get into the mausoleum.  They've been lining up outside Christ the Saviour, the cathedral that the Communists once destroyed, but which was rebuilt from scratch after the collapse of the USSR. The queues have stretched for more than a mile. Christ the Saviour Cathedral, where one of the saint's ribs is being displayed It's here that I meet pensioner Natalya. It's taken her six hours to reach the front of the queue. Natalya clearly has the patience of a saint. Which is just as well, for it is a saint she has come here to see - and to venerate. Saint Nicholas the Wonder Worker was a Greek bishop in Asia Minor in the 4th Century. He was famous for his kindness to children and would later inspire the legend of Santa Claus. He is the patron saint of children, sailors, and of prisoners who've been wrongly condemned. And he is the saint most cherished by Russian hearts. For according to the Church here, it is Nicholas who has saved Russia many times from catastrophe. For more than 900 years, his bones have lain in a crypt in the Italian city of Bari. But now, after an historic agreement between the Catholic Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch, one of St Nicholas' ribs is on loan to Russia. ""I am so excited,"" Natalya tells me, ""I have butterflies in my stomach. St Nicholas means so much to us."" From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST In the cathedral, I spot the golden ark, which was transported here from Italy amid great pomp and ceremony. The rib is inside, and I can see it through the glass cover. A long line of Orthodox believers is filing past. As the visitors approach, they make the sign of the cross and bend over the ark. Some place their foreheads on the casket's transparent top, then kiss the glass and move on. As they walk away, they're handed free mini icons of St Nicholas, which have been blessed by the Russian Patriarch himself.  Many of the visitors are here with babies and young children. I watch one woman lay her daughter down ever so carefully on her back on top of the ark - as if the mother is hoping that St Nicholas' miraculous powers will seep into the child's body from head to toe. Svetlana with baby Vanya, who has been brought from hospital Svetlana is with her little son Vanya, who is rather poorly right now. His arm is hurting. ""I've brought Vanya here from the hospital,"" Svetlana tells me. ""I want to give this a chance. Because I really believe in miracles."" And so, it seems, does Russia's president. For Vladimir Putin, too, has visited Christ the Saviour this week to venerate the relics of St Nicholas. President Putin approaches the ark The Kremlin leader placed his forehead on to the glass, then, rising, crossed himself three times. It is remarkable to think that back in Soviet times President Putin worked for an organisation - the KGB - which tried to suppress religion and which persecuted the religious. And yet, today, the Kremlin leader very openly embraces Russian Orthodoxy. He is said to have his own spiritual adviser, Father Tikhon. What's more, under Vladimir Putin's rule, the Orthodox Church in Russia has grown in power and influence. That's partly because the loyal Church has helped to strengthen the Russian state and those in power. And, partly, because the Kremlin knows that people need something in which to believe. For a time, that was communism and socialism, but those ideas proved shortlived. So, today, the authorities here are constructing a new ideology for Russia - it's a mixture of nationalism and patriotism, conservatism and loyalty to the state - and all of it underpinned by religious belief. Which brings us back to St Nicholas and his rib. By displaying this bone in Moscow, Russia is not only honouring its most beloved saint. It is trying to excite and enthuse and unite the tens of millions of Orthodox Christians in Russia behind a common idea.

BA passengers 'trying not to cry',"There were tears as passengers were cleared from the British Airways check-in hall which now stands empty The British Airways check-in hall at Gatwick Airport is eerily empty. Elsewhere people are milling around with luggage, gazing hopefully at information boards not knowing if they will be going on holiday. The emotion came earlier with the first announcement thata major IT system failuremeant flights had been cancelled, both here at Gatwick and at Heathrow until 18:00 BST. BA would later announce no flights would be leaving from either airport for the rest of Saturday. People were in tears as staff started to clear a crowded check-in queue. Some holidaymakers have been here all day, others have just turned up hoping to catch a flight. BA staff are on hand to help explain the situation as some passengers try to rethink their plans. Among the usual security warnings to stay with your bags there have been announcements apologising for the disruption. Many people are waiting calmly and patiently to see what happens. Fiona Lancaster feels it is ""unlikely"" she will be able to book a flight to Sicily later where she plans to spend her 50th birthday Fiona Lancaster, 49, from Braintree, Essex, was due to fly to Sicily and has been in the airport for four hours. ""They don't automatically rebook you. You have to try to rebook yourself...and if you book with another airline there is no refund. I've been deciding whether to sleep in the car,"" she said. ""There have been a lot of people in tears. I'm trying not to cry. I was going on holiday for a week and am a bit upset. I was supposed to be on Mount Etna for my 50th birthday next Friday, I was on a tour."" Mariah McIntyre says it was ""wishful thinking"" after arriving at the airport with her children Mariah McIntyre, 39, who is with her two children Sloane, three, and Ellie, seven, were supposed to be flying to Portugal for a half-term holiday. Ms McIntyre said: ""We knew the situation but we still turned up. It was wishful thinking. We are going to check other flights. ""We'll give it several hours and will await the next update, we are looking at other airlines and we're trying to be resourceful and we are going to look at other routes via Lisbon and Seville. ""I had a feeling about the refunds. We're kind of out of luck but we have to be positive and we have to try and not get frustrated until we've tried every which way."" Paul Quinney and his family have spent Â£15,000 on a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" holiday Paul Quinney said: ""We arrived at 07:45. We are going to Orlando for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Disney. ""We were waiting to board the plane at the gate when we got told. We got turned back to departures and told to book a flight and stay in a hotel and pay for everything again. ""It didn't help us in any way. They're not putting us in a hotel. They didn't tell us what was happening - we just found ourselves in the baggage hall. ""We saved for a year for this. it's a Â£15,000 holiday and we have probably lost three days of it."" Kujdes Duraku said there was ""no information"" Builder Kujdes Duraku, 31, said: ""The website's crashed. I just got here I don't know much about what's happening. I'm trying to fly if I can. But they said there is no information. I talked to one of the managers. ""He said that the system had crashed I had to wait until 18:00 and and there is no more information. I'm flying to Albania for a holiday. I just got here I don't know what's happening I don't even know whether I've got to rebook."" Dr Babatunde Tikare said he was still ""feeling optimistic"" Dr Babatunde Tikare had been due to fly to Malaga with his family and said they were feeling ""pretty anxious"". ""We're coming back on Thursday, so it's not a long trip.  I couldn't get any information on the BA site, so I've been checking the BBC for possible updates."" He said passengers had been speculating over whether the problems had stemmed from a cyber attack although BA has said there is no evidence that is what caused it. Dr Tikare, who works as a paediatric doctor, said he had heard about people being stuck on planes ""for hours"". ""We are just hoping it will have cleared up and feeling optimistic,"" he added.

Hamilton beat Dundee Utd in play-off final,"FT: Premiership play-off final, second leg: 1-0 Docherty fires in shot from 20 yards on 64 mins Goalless first leg at Tannadice on Thursday Accies stay for fourth season in top flight Keir Murray FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton fans won't want to miss the highlights going out tonight on Sportscene on BBC One Scotland at 10.35pm and online at midnight. Greg Docherty is the Accies hero, thanks to his match-winning goal, but there were great performances by both goalkeepers, Remi Matthews and United's Cammy Bell. Thank you very much for joining us on the BBC Sport website today. We hope you enjoy your evening. FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton manager Martin Canningtalking to BBC Radio Scotland: ""Every season we're tipped to go down and that's the last three we've managed to stay in the league. It's a record for the club to stay in the league this long. The league doesn't lie - so many times we've been in a similar position and haven't been able to see it through and it's ironic that our downfall through the season has been our greatest achievement today, that we kept a clean sheet after going a goal up. You know the first goal is going to be so important. ""The club tries to get players in with the right appetite, that they want to work. You saw the team spirit today. The fans gave us great backing and I'm delighted for them. The budget is important but the majority of our work for next season is done. The club has a model that they stick to. Everybody works so hard. We'll be in tomorrow and we'll get a wee chat. I've told them to enjoy tonight."" Canning celebrates Hamilton's play-off success with goal hero Greg Docherty FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0)  It's a real shame for Ray McKinnon. There has to be a winner and a loser. The play-offs have been brilliant...unless you're involved in them. Allan Preston, BBC Scotland football pundit FT: Hamilton 1-0 Dundee Utd (agg 1-0) Dundee United manager Ray McKinnontalking to BBC Radio Scotland: ""The six games has taken its toll, no doubt about it. ""It was an evenly contested game but you could see the legs were gone in the second half. We didn't have the same intensity to our pressing. ""We were running on empty and unfortunately we've just come up short at the final hurdle. ""We have to work hard over the summer to attract better quality than we've got. We've started the recruitment process well with James Keatings and Billy King. If we can maintain that standard, we'll give ourselves a great chance next season."" United boss Ray McKinnon consoles midfielder Willo Flood at full-time FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) BBC Scotland football pundit Craig Paterson:""Falkirk will be there or thereabouts again next season. Peter Houston will have them organised. And St Mirren will be challenging under Jack Ross and Jim Duffy at Morton will be hoping to get a couple of impact players to get that little bit closer. Whoever lost today was going to go home dejected - can the chairman produce the cash, will the manager get the cash to have a real run at it? Dundee United will have to take stock and find a way to get a squad together."" FT: Hamilton 1-0 Dundee Utd (agg 1-0) Dundee United will be due a percentage if relegated Hull City cash in on Scotland full-back Andrew Robertson. The 23-year-old has been heavily linked with Liverpool and won't go cheap. A slice of any transfer fee for Andrew Robertson would be a real lifeline for Dundee United Allan Preston, BBC Sportsound pundit FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) BBC football pundit Allan Preston points out that United will be Â£250,000 worse off next season as the parachute payment for being relegated last season is cut from Â£500,000 to quarter of a million. FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) BBC Sportsound pundit Craig Paterson:""Dundee United are going to be the scalp, the team everyone wants to beat next season and they've got to deal with that. Players who would have come to play in the Premiership might think they have a better offer elsewhere. When the budget does diminish it gets harder and harder to get up. Do they gamble, making sure, like Hibs did, that they have the best squad in the league."" FT: Hamilton 1-0 Dundee Utd (agg 1-0)  Over the two games, Hamilton were the better side, no doubt about it. Dundee United just didn't do enough Allan Preston, BBC Sportsound pundit FT: Hamilton 1-0 Dundee Utd (agg 1-0) The play-offs, eh? How else could a season, when you finish second bottom of the table, one point off last place, end up with your fans dancing a conga? FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton assistant manager Guillaume Beuzelin:""It was very stressful, the two legs, but me managed to do it and we are over the moon. We will try to improve. We were not as good as last year but we know what areas we need to work on. Greg stays on at training, shooting and shooting. I stay on with him and he is always working, working, working."" FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton midfielder Ali Crawford:""Greg was outstanding all day. He had to mark Tony Andreu and he didn't give him a sniff all game. Thanks to the fans who have stuck with us. Season after season the pundits tip us to go down and yet again we have proved them wrong. I have a year left on my contract so until I'm told otherwise I'm still a Hamilton player."" Ali Crawford congratulates scorer Greg Docherty FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) You have to feel for Dundee United. They battled so well against Morton and Falkirk in the earlier rounds of the play-offs but have fallen just short at Premiership strugglers Hamilton. You can see the pain in their fans' faces. FT: Hamilton 1-0 Dundee Utd (1-0) Dundee United club captain Sean Dillon is led away by backroom staff after an angry confrontation with some supporters of the Tayside club behind the goals. The big defender is fizzing with fury... FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton goalscorer Greg Docherty:""It was a dark time for me at the turn of the year when I broke my foot. I was in the team, it was mentally tough. Finally one dropped for me and it's a goal... I'm so speechless. I'm so happy for the club. They deserve to be here (in the Premiership)."" FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) That win for Accies means they retain their record of being the only team to be promoted by way of the play-offs, when they beat Hibernian on penalties in 2014. Dundee United striker Simon Murray could not profit from a couple of late glimpses at goal Hamilton stay in the Premiership Accies boss Martin Canning is close to tears as he hugs members of his coaching team. Greg Docherty's goal keeps Hamilton in the top tier and consigns United to another season in the Championship. Greg Docherty celebrates the only goal of the two-legged tie Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Thomas Mikkelsen's overhead kick from 12 yards floats into the arms of Remi Matthews and surely now Accies are safe. Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Louis Longridge and Paul Dixon get involved in a tussle for the ball at a throw-in and are booked. One player wasn't in a hurry and one was. Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) We are into three minutes of injury-time. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The day started with a comebackvictory for Petra Kvitovaand ended with adefeat for Dan Evanswhile sandwiched in the middle was ashock loss for world number one Angelique Kerber. We'll be back tomorrow from 10:00 BST when British number three Alijaz Bedene will be in action. Defending champions Garbine Muguruza and Novak Djokovic also start their 2017 campaigns on Monday - the latter playing his first match under the watchful eye of Andre Agassi - while Rafael Nadal begins has quest for La Decima. See you then. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans In the end the heat, that pesky clay and an ageless Tommy Robredo proved too much for British number four Dan Evans. The British challenge in Paris goes from five to four. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris He described it as ""like torture"" and right now Evans will just be pleased to get back into the air-conditioned (presumably) locker room. An ice bath might actually feel like a treat for once. Robredo is something of a marvel at 35 years old, clearly still a class act on the clay, while Evans can look forward to more success - and  less punishing matches - on the grass courts next month. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans All over. Tommy Robredo knocks Britain's Dan Evans out of the first round of the French Open. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 5-1 Evans* Evans tries a couple more drop shots for good measure, one successful, one not so much. 30-30. Another drop shot goes wide from the Evans racquet.Match point Robredo.  Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 5-1 Evans* And Robredo seals the game. From a set and a break behind Tommy Robredo is a game away from the second round. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans I doubt this match will do much to increase Dan Evans' love for a clay court but he shouldn't forget he played well in the early stages of this match. He shows a glimpse of that form as another forehand winner whizzes beyond Robredo. The scoreline looks to have freed Evans up a little. He slices a backhand winner down the line now but true to type Robredo refuses to give in and takes us to deuce. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans That won't improve Dan Evans' mood. Robredo guesses right and stands still, allowing him to return the Briton's smash before Evans puts the follow-up in the net. This shot is a little bit special though. Evans legs may be failing him but he shows great hands to put away a half volley. More brutal stuff from Robredo. He's doing what he does best, taking his opponent's energy away. He breaks Evans again and the Briton's race looks run. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris Heather Watson is the latest player to drop by the reserved seats and her compatriot needs all the help he can get. ""Keep your head up!"" screams one British voice. Easier said than done from the shady seats in between sips on a carbonated drink. Evans has played very well at times but his game, and mentality, aren't suited to a lengthy clay-court grind in searing heat. Robredo, on the other hand... Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 3-1 Evans* Evans is trudging along the baseline after losing a point, looking very fatigued. Robredo is using all of his experience from his 19 years on tour in making his opponent work as he wraps up another game. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 2-1 Evans This could be over very quickly now as Evans falls 15-40 behind. The heat seems to have taken sapped out all of the excellent play of the first set from the British player. ""Keep your head up. Come on,"" shouts someone in the crowd in Evans direction as he pulls it back to deuce. A second ace of the match and Evans just about keeps himself in it. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 2-0 Evans* Robredo wraps up another service game in a blink of an eye. A bit of sweat on the t-shirt aside the Spaniard is looking fresh. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 1-0 Evans Evans has it all to do now against his vastly experienced opponent. Remember Robredo reached the quarter-finals at the French Open five times between 2003 and 2013 while Evans is in the main draw for the first time. The Briton is persisting with the serve and volley tactic but Robredo is putting every ball at his shoe laces. Clay court experience counts again as the Spaniard breaks serve right at the start of this fourth set. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 Evans If you're late joining this match, Evans started strongly but the unforced error count is creeping up and has now overtaken the number of winners the Briton has hit. The Brummie has nipped off the court again for some respite from the heat. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 Evans I had given up predicting what would happen at the end of that set. Unforced errors from both players led to a host of service breaks but it is the Spaniard who closes out for a two sets to one lead. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris The latest courtside update from Evans - ""This has got to be like torture."" Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka, the two-time Australian Open champion, is now alongside the Robredo support team. Not sure who she's supporting as she's shared a few funnies with Evans on Twitter recently. Azarenka is watching now, but is preparing to return to the grass courts next month following the birth of her first child. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 5-3 Evans That was shaky stuff in the last game from Tommy Robredo. Can Evans put the pressure on by holding serve here. He is coming to the net, a tactic that served him well in the early stages, but not so much here. 0-30. Backhand winner for Evans. 15-30. Robredo misses a great opportunity for a passing shot. 30-30. No mistake second time around though as Robredo advances to break point with the help of a net cord. And he takes it. Robredo will serve for the third set. Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-3 Evans* Remarkable! Another double fault from Robredo and we have our third break of serve in a row. Two to Evans, one to Robredo. Back on serve. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-2 Evans What do I know?! A double fault, a forehand winner and an effective chip and charge from Dan Evans and he hasthree break points... *Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-2 Evans This will be a big mental blow to the Briton.

Campaigning too soon for Manchester?,"The queue to lay flowers at St Ann's Square stretched to about 260ft (80m) in length On the first weekend since the Manchester attack, many people are carrying flowers and balloons around the city centre and heading in just one direction. The queue at St Ann's Square to lay tributes to those killed and injured in the attack stretches back about 260ft (80m) from the church to the Royal Exchange Theatre, as people wait patiently to quietly reflect on what had happened in a place so familiar and ""close to home"". Elsewhere in the city centre though, it is like any other Saturday, with bustling shoppers on Market Street, children playing in Piccadilly Gardens' fountains and people gathering to listen to street performers. It is a city in flux and one which is now, as with the rest of the nation, back in the grip of general election campaigning, following the three-day pause in the wake of the terror attack. But is Manchester ready to move on and talk politics? Kelly and Donna said people are ""not ready"" to think about politics Kelly, 38, from Manchester and Donna, 37, from Rochdale came to St Ann's Square to pay their respects after the attack, which was ""beyond belief"". For Kelly, it is ""too soon"" to restart campaigning. ""I think it's become all about this. I think it's become all about religion and I think they should hold off a bit longer frankly. ""It's become too personal."" Donna agrees that people are not ""ready"". ""People are still reeling from all this. It's the last thing on anybody's mind. ""People have died. People are angry about it, they're making the wrong choices because they're angry. ""I don't think people are going to have the time to sit and think 'what is right for them in their votes' with a clear head. ""People are in shock, still."" Anik and Swapna said life must continue but politicians should not take advantage of what has happened Swapna and Anik Kali, 28, live round the corner from the Manchester Arena and believe life must go on, even if that means political campaigning. However, Anik warns that ""politicians should not take advantage by commenting on anything... that's the only thing we can think about, whether it's early or not - it should not be a political issue"". Swapna adds that what happened ""should not stop us doing anything"". ""After everything that happened, everything was so sad, but [we] are definitely still here and enjoying and... holding up."" Hundreds of flowers, cards and balloons have been left in tribute at St Ann's Square Emma came to the city to offer people hugs and show support Emma, 27, from Runcorn says the city centre ""is exactly the same as it always is"". ""We can't be afraid [and] we can't let it stop us. ""[The election] is coming up so close now and it's such an important one this year. ""There are so many young people who have registered to vote now. It's really important to carry on."" James and Danielle said Manchester should be left to mourn before ""thinking about politics"" James and Danielle Yates arrived in Manchester from the West Midlands alongside more than 100 other bikers to ""pay tribute"" to the victims of the attack. James, 35, said it felt ""very soon"" to start campaigning again. ""There are other things to be doing than thinking about politics at the minute. ""I don't think it'll change anything in the election campaign, [but] let people get over it a bit first. People have written in chalk on the pavement to express their sorrow and show support Chris and Chris said the election campaign had to begin again because it is ""really important"" But 33-year-old Chris, who lives in Salford Quays, disagrees, saying that ""it needed to start again, because they are running out of time"". ""I think they've done well and not used it, but I think it is the right thing to do, because this is a really important election. ""I think security, police, a lot more stuff about online snooping will be coming up."" He adds that seeing Manchester ""nice and busy was reassuring"". ""There is a really nice atmosphere. Like 'no, it doesn't get to us, we're still living'. ""Life still goes on [and] I think the city is moving on. It is defiance. ""All my friends have started going out again.

What next for Arsenal and Wenger?,"This video can not be played Archive: Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea - watch 2017 FA Cup final highlights Arsene Wenger revealed his historic seventh FA Cup final success was so special he would be keeping his medal to remind him of the thrilling Wembley victory over Chelsea. The 67-year-old Arsenal manager is clearly not sentimental about his keepsakes - but the sub-plots surrounding this unlikely2-1 victorymeant it was impossible for him to disguise his pride and elation among the celebrations. Wenger complained in the build-up that the criticism he has received this season was""a disgrace""and something he will ""never forget"". And there was even more intrigue in the aftermath as his future after more than 20 years at Arsenal was stillshrouded in uncertaintybefore a board meeting on Tuesday. Watch: FA Cup Catch-Up: Goals & funnies from the final This video can not be played Lack of respect towards me a disgrace - Wenger Wenger was a contrast in moods in his post-match media briefing, heaping praise on his players while clearly bristling at his treatment from a section of Arsenal's support this season - with protest marches before matches, and banners calling for him to leave seen both inside and outside Emirates Stadium. The man who has now brought a seventh FA Cup win of his tenure - as well as three Premier League titles, including two domestic Doubles - clearly believes he should have been afforded more faith, respect and support given his work and commitment. It is a fanciful notion that, as he said, supporters should simply support once matches start but he has clearly been wounded by the discontent aimed in his direction this season. Wenger confirmed his future would be clarified this week, with the smart money on an extension of his stay but still an air of uncertainty after a triumph that was fully deserved as Arsenal produced a magnificent display to overpower the Premier League champions. He insisted he would never accept the ""very hostile"" environment Arsenal have faced at home this season, and there was a lingering sense that even if he stays, there will be something about his relationship with some supporters that will never quite be the same again. Wenger was right to assert that an Arsenal career of more than 20 years, and effectively the immediate future of the club, should not come down to one game - but there is no escaping the significance of this FA Cup final win. Had Arsenal lost, and lost heavily as many expected, the mood could have been so dark that even Wenger's most fervent supporters might have wavered after failure to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in two decades. Instead, this was a win and a performance that demonstrated Wenger can still win major trophies, can still produce a gameplan to beat the best in the Premier League, and can still provide some sort of answer to those who believe he is the man who changed the face of English football but is reluctant to change himself. When Arsenal's board meet on Tuesday, he can produce the FA Cup as tangible evidence to strengthen his hand in what he says will be a joint discussion about whether he and the club's decision-makers believe he is the man to take the club forward. What Arsenal's board must decide is whether they can find anyone who is more likely to be successful than Wenger. And he may have to decide whether he can accept certain structural changes as Arsenal, as they have to do, look ahead to the post-Wenger years. The joyous scenes at the final whistle, with Wenger arms aloft in triumph in front of Arsenal's ecstatic support, were a far cry from the tension aroundGander Green Lane in February,when there was the whiff of an FA Cup shock in the air as the Gunners took on non-league Sutton United on the back of a 5-1 Champions League humiliation at Bayern Munich. Amid the questions, one thing is certain - this victory, and the manner in which it was achieved, with the sort of aggression, commitment and attractive attacking football that is the Wenger hallmark, at least provides a highly satisfactory basis for discussions this week. This video can not be played Wenger proud of 'outstanding' Arsenal Arsenal's third FA Cup win in four years is the sort of problem plenty of teams in the Premier League would love to have - but this does not mean serious matters can be ignored in a huge summer for the Gunners. Aside from the pressing issue of Wenger's situation, Arsenal must also resolve the futures of their two most marketable and talented players - Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil. Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown, a cornerstone of Wenger's early successes,believes the pair have been indulged,,externaland there is plenty of evidence to suggest he has a point. At Wembley, though, Sanchez and Ozil were in the sort of form that suggests their manager is right to afford them a little special treatment. Sanchez, alongside the tireless Danny Welbeck, was Arsenal's spearhead. He scored their opening goal after four minutes, was a direct, aggressive, pacy threat and was a danger every time he got on the ball. This video can not be played Arsenal take controversial FA Cup lead Ozil was at his graceful best - although he should have scored in the first half - and raised gasps of surprise and joy from Gunners fans with a tackle of such weight it left Eden Hazard writhing in agony in a moment that summed up Arsenal's ferocity. For all their high maintenance, this pair give Arsenal an extra dimension when firing and need to be kept. Granit Xhaka also finally looks like the player who cost Â£29m from Borussia Monchengladbach last summer. And what of the future for men like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott? Once again, they have not produced consistently. Will Wenger continue to show patience with obvious, but often frustrating, talents? Wenger insists Arsenal only need one or two players of the highest quality, but they must be mentally as well as physically strong because, while he pointed at a blip in March, Arsenal's problem is that blip usually occurs when the Premier League pressure is on, hence no title challenge for 13 years. And yet, most of all, it comes back to clarity over Wenger's future. He is clearly unhappy at theuncertaintyand hostility this has caused, but he must share - with Arsenal's board - the blame for allowing the situation to drag on unresolved, and for discontent to fester in some quarters. This is a summer of great significance for Arsenal - and the next few days will produce the most significant moment of all. They say fortune favours the brave - and Wenger's willingness to take a chance with his team selection was rewarded with what he will regard as one of the sweetest triumphs of his career. Injuries to Gabriel and Shkodran Mustafi, as well as the suspension of Laurent Koscielny - Arsenal's best central defender, meant Per Mertesacker had to blow away the cobwebs caused by having only 37 minutes of action this season. The popular 32-year-old proved there was no substitute for experience, with a virtuous display of defending. No matter that he was short of game time, match sharpness and has never possessed serious pace - he was faultless. Wenger was effusive in his post-match praise, saying: ""Per Mertesacker is a perfect example for any young professional football player. What he did today was the consequence of an unbelievable attitude every day even when he was not selected. ""When he was not selected, he worked even harder and that is why I will pay a special tribute to him."" Mertesacker, a World Cup winner with Germany in 2014, used every piece of knowledge, every mile on his football clock, to compensate for a season of inaction to be in the right place at the right time every time. It was his first start for Arsenal in 392 days - and yet it was arguably his finest performance since he joined the club in August 2011. Wenger also took a big risk in playing goalkeeper David Ospina ahead of Petr Cech in what is likely to be his final appearance for Arsenal before a summer move. Cech figured in the semi-final and will have been disappointed to miss out. And Wenger's decision looked in danger of backfiring when Ospina's weak attempt at a save resulted in Diego Costa's equaliser. This video can not be played Archive: Costa's FA Cup final goal against Arsenal Ospina was Wembley's most relieved man when Aaron Ramsey headed Arsenal back in front, then the Colombian redeemed himself with a crucial save from Costa to ensure the FA Cup was on its way back to Emirates Stadium. This was Wenger's day. He got everything right and the FA Cup is his prize. The FA Cup has faced the usual questions about whether it still retains its old glamour - but this was a final befitting what has been an outstanding competition this season. Sutton United and Lincoln City, beaten by Arsenal in the fifth and sixth rounds respectively, provided the old-fashioned magical element, while the two semi-finals at Wembley were testimony to how seriously the FA Cup is taken by the heavyweights and how precious it remains on our sporting calendar. Arsenal beat Manchester City, and Chelsea beat Spurs to set up a final that was a thriller from start to finish, with a controversial opening as Sanchez's goal was initially ruled out for offside then given, a contest flowing with chances and attacking football and a late twist when Costa's equaliser was answered instantly by Ramsey's winner. This video can not be played Ramsey heads Arsenal back in the lead Chelsea were not at their best, Arsenal did not allow them to be. Antonio Conte's side looked leg-weary and were overrun for long and painful periods, as if they had climbed the mountain once bywinning the titleand could not find the strength for a second assault on the summit. Arsenal, in contrast, continued their recent upturn with an exuberant, fiercely competitive display and should have won more convincingly, with Welbeck and Ozil hitting the woodwork and Chelsea's Gary Cahill clearing off the line in the first half from Ozil and Ramsey. The sun shone. Wembley basked in glorious sunshine. The final itself was close to a classic. The FA Cup proved once again the old magic lingers on.

French Open: GB's Evans v Robredo,"GB's Dan Evans loses to Tommy Robredo in four sets Spaniard won 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 in hot conditions in Paris Angelique Kerber loses 6-2 6-2 to Ekaterina Makarova Kerber first women's top seed to lose in French Open first round Petra Kvitova wins 6-3 6-2 against American Julia Boserup Kvitova's first match since being stabbed during a burglary in December Matthew Henry That's all from us today. The day started with a comebackvictory for Petra Kvitovaand ended with adefeat for Dan Evanswhile sandwiched in the middle was ashock loss for world number one Angelique Kerber. We'll be back tomorrow from 10:00 BST when British number three Alijaz Bedene will be in action. Defending champions Garbine Muguruza and Novak Djokovic also start their 2017 campaigns on Monday - the latter playing his first match under the watchful eye of Andre Agassi - while Rafael Nadal begins has quest for La Decima. See you then. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans In the end the heat, that pesky clay and an ageless Tommy Robredo proved too much for British number four Dan Evans. The British challenge in Paris goes from five to four. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris He described it as ""like torture"" and right now Evans will just be pleased to get back into the air-conditioned (presumably) locker room. An ice bath might actually feel like a treat for once. Robredo is something of a marvel at 35 years old, clearly still a class act on the clay, while Evans can look forward to more success - and  less punishing matches - on the grass courts next month. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans All over. Tommy Robredo knocks Britain's Dan Evans out of the first round of the French Open. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 5-1 Evans* Evans tries a couple more drop shots for good measure, one successful, one not so much. 30-30. Another drop shot goes wide from the Evans racquet.Match point Robredo.  Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 5-1 Evans* And Robredo seals the game. From a set and a break behind Tommy Robredo is a game away from the second round. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans I doubt this match will do much to increase Dan Evans' love for a clay court but he shouldn't forget he played well in the early stages of this match. He shows a glimpse of that form as another forehand winner whizzes beyond Robredo. The scoreline looks to have freed Evans up a little. He slices a backhand winner down the line now but true to type Robredo refuses to give in and takes us to deuce. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans That won't improve Dan Evans' mood. Robredo guesses right and stands still, allowing him to return the Briton's smash before Evans puts the follow-up in the net. This shot is a little bit special though. Evans legs may be failing him but he shows great hands to put away a half volley. More brutal stuff from Robredo. He's doing what he does best, taking his opponent's energy away. He breaks Evans again and the Briton's race looks run. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris Heather Watson is the latest player to drop by the reserved seats and her compatriot needs all the help he can get. ""Keep your head up!"" screams one British voice. Easier said than done from the shady seats in between sips on a carbonated drink. Evans has played very well at times but his game, and mentality, aren't suited to a lengthy clay-court grind in searing heat. Robredo, on the other hand... Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 3-1 Evans* Evans is trudging along the baseline after losing a point, looking very fatigued. Robredo is using all of his experience from his 19 years on tour in making his opponent work as he wraps up another game. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 2-1 Evans This could be over very quickly now as Evans falls 15-40 behind. The heat seems to have taken sapped out all of the excellent play of the first set from the British player. ""Keep your head up. Come on,"" shouts someone in the crowd in Evans direction as he pulls it back to deuce. A second ace of the match and Evans just about keeps himself in it. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 2-0 Evans* Robredo wraps up another service game in a blink of an eye. A bit of sweat on the t-shirt aside the Spaniard is looking fresh. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 1-0 Evans Evans has it all to do now against his vastly experienced opponent. Remember Robredo reached the quarter-finals at the French Open five times between 2003 and 2013 while Evans is in the main draw for the first time. The Briton is persisting with the serve and volley tactic but Robredo is putting every ball at his shoe laces. Clay court experience counts again as the Spaniard breaks serve right at the start of this fourth set. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 Evans If you're late joining this match, Evans started strongly but the unforced error count is creeping up and has now overtaken the number of winners the Briton has hit. The Brummie has nipped off the court again for some respite from the heat. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 Evans I had given up predicting what would happen at the end of that set. Unforced errors from both players led to a host of service breaks but it is the Spaniard who closes out for a two sets to one lead. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris The latest courtside update from Evans - ""This has got to be like torture."" Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka, the two-time Australian Open champion, is now alongside the Robredo support team. Not sure who she's supporting as she's shared a few funnies with Evans on Twitter recently. Azarenka is watching now, but is preparing to return to the grass courts next month following the birth of her first child. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 5-3 Evans That was shaky stuff in the last game from Tommy Robredo. Can Evans put the pressure on by holding serve here. He is coming to the net, a tactic that served him well in the early stages, but not so much here. 0-30. Backhand winner for Evans. 15-30. Robredo misses a great opportunity for a passing shot. 30-30. No mistake second time around though as Robredo advances to break point with the help of a net cord. And he takes it. Robredo will serve for the third set. Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-3 Evans* Remarkable! Another double fault from Robredo and we have our third break of serve in a row. Two to Evans, one to Robredo. Back on serve. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-2 Evans What do I know?! A double fault, a forehand winner and an effective chip and charge from Dan Evans and he hasthree break points... *Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-2 Evans This will be a big mental blow to the Briton. Right after Evans broke serve, Robredo repeats the trick. Evans is bent over, looking out of breath again. Â© 2025 BBC.

FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton assistant manager Guillaume Beuzelin:""It was very stressful, the two legs, but me managed to do it and we are over the moon. We will try to improve. We were not as good as last year but we know what areas we need to work on. Greg stays on at training, shooting and shooting. I stay on with him and he is always working, working, working."" FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton midfielder Ali Crawford:""Greg was outstanding all day. He had to mark Tony Andreu and he didn't give him a sniff all game. Thanks to the fans who have stuck with us. Season after season the pundits tip us to go down and yet again we have proved them wrong. I have a year left on my contract so until I'm told otherwise I'm still a Hamilton player."" Ali Crawford congratulates scorer Greg Docherty FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) You have to feel for Dundee United. They battled so well against Morton and Falkirk in the earlier rounds of the play-offs but have fallen just short at Premiership strugglers Hamilton. You can see the pain in their fans' faces. FT: Hamilton 1-0 Dundee Utd (1-0) Dundee United club captain Sean Dillon is led away by backroom staff after an angry confrontation with some supporters of the Tayside club behind the goals. The big defender is fizzing with fury... FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Hamilton goalscorer Greg Docherty:""It was a dark time for me at the turn of the year when I broke my foot. I was in the team, it was mentally tough. Finally one dropped for me and it's a goal... I'm so speechless. I'm so happy for the club. They deserve to be here (in the Premiership)."" FT Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) That win for Accies means they retain their record of being the only team to be promoted by way of the play-offs, when they beat Hibernian on penalties in 2014. Dundee United striker Simon Murray could not profit from a couple of late glimpses at goal Hamilton stay in the Premiership Accies boss Martin Canning is close to tears as he hugs members of his coaching team. Greg Docherty's goal keeps Hamilton in the top tier and consigns United to another season in the Championship. Greg Docherty celebrates the only goal of the two-legged tie Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Thomas Mikkelsen's overhead kick from 12 yards floats into the arms of Remi Matthews and surely now Accies are safe. Hamilton 1-0 Dundee United (agg 1-0) Louis Longridge and Paul Dixon get involved in a tussle for the ball at a throw-in and are booked. One player wasn't in a hurry and one was.

French Open: World number one Kerber suffers shock defeat - radio & text,"GB's Dan Evans loses to Tommy Robredo in four sets Spaniard won 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 in hot conditions in Paris Angelique Kerber loses 6-2 6-2 to Ekaterina Makarova Kerber first women's top seed to lose in French Open first round Petra Kvitova wins 6-3 6-2 against American Julia Boserup Kvitova's first match since being stabbed during a burglary in December Matthew Henry That's all from us today. The day started with a comebackvictory for Petra Kvitovaand ended with adefeat for Dan Evanswhile sandwiched in the middle was ashock loss for world number one Angelique Kerber. We'll be back tomorrow from 10:00 BST when British number three Alijaz Bedene will be in action. Defending champions Garbine Muguruza and Novak Djokovic also start their 2017 campaigns on Monday - the latter playing his first match under the watchful eye of Andre Agassi - while Rafael Nadal begins has quest for La Decima. See you then. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans In the end the heat, that pesky clay and an ageless Tommy Robredo proved too much for British number four Dan Evans. The British challenge in Paris goes from five to four. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris He described it as ""like torture"" and right now Evans will just be pleased to get back into the air-conditioned (presumably) locker room. An ice bath might actually feel like a treat for once. Robredo is something of a marvel at 35 years old, clearly still a class act on the clay, while Evans can look forward to more success - and  less punishing matches - on the grass courts next month. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans All over. Tommy Robredo knocks Britain's Dan Evans out of the first round of the French Open. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 5-1 Evans* Evans tries a couple more drop shots for good measure, one successful, one not so much. 30-30. Another drop shot goes wide from the Evans racquet.Match point Robredo.  Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 5-1 Evans* And Robredo seals the game. From a set and a break behind Tommy Robredo is a game away from the second round. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans I doubt this match will do much to increase Dan Evans' love for a clay court but he shouldn't forget he played well in the early stages of this match. He shows a glimpse of that form as another forehand winner whizzes beyond Robredo. The scoreline looks to have freed Evans up a little. He slices a backhand winner down the line now but true to type Robredo refuses to give in and takes us to deuce. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans That won't improve Dan Evans' mood. Robredo guesses right and stands still, allowing him to return the Briton's smash before Evans puts the follow-up in the net. This shot is a little bit special though. Evans legs may be failing him but he shows great hands to put away a half volley. More brutal stuff from Robredo. He's doing what he does best, taking his opponent's energy away. He breaks Evans again and the Briton's race looks run. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris Heather Watson is the latest player to drop by the reserved seats and her compatriot needs all the help he can get. ""Keep your head up!"" screams one British voice. Easier said than done from the shady seats in between sips on a carbonated drink. Evans has played very well at times but his game, and mentality, aren't suited to a lengthy clay-court grind in searing heat. Robredo, on the other hand... Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 3-1 Evans* Evans is trudging along the baseline after losing a point, looking very fatigued. Robredo is using all of his experience from his 19 years on tour in making his opponent work as he wraps up another game. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 2-1 Evans This could be over very quickly now as Evans falls 15-40 behind. The heat seems to have taken sapped out all of the excellent play of the first set from the British player. ""Keep your head up. Come on,"" shouts someone in the crowd in Evans direction as he pulls it back to deuce. A second ace of the match and Evans just about keeps himself in it. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 2-0 Evans* Robredo wraps up another service game in a blink of an eye. A bit of sweat on the t-shirt aside the Spaniard is looking fresh. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 1-0 Evans Evans has it all to do now against his vastly experienced opponent. Remember Robredo reached the quarter-finals at the French Open five times between 2003 and 2013 while Evans is in the main draw for the first time. The Briton is persisting with the serve and volley tactic but Robredo is putting every ball at his shoe laces. Clay court experience counts again as the Spaniard breaks serve right at the start of this fourth set. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 Evans If you're late joining this match, Evans started strongly but the unforced error count is creeping up and has now overtaken the number of winners the Briton has hit. The Brummie has nipped off the court again for some respite from the heat. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 Evans I had given up predicting what would happen at the end of that set. Unforced errors from both players led to a host of service breaks but it is the Spaniard who closes out for a two sets to one lead. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris The latest courtside update from Evans - ""This has got to be like torture."" Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka, the two-time Australian Open champion, is now alongside the Robredo support team. Not sure who she's supporting as she's shared a few funnies with Evans on Twitter recently. Azarenka is watching now, but is preparing to return to the grass courts next month following the birth of her first child. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 5-3 Evans That was shaky stuff in the last game from Tommy Robredo. Can Evans put the pressure on by holding serve here. He is coming to the net, a tactic that served him well in the early stages, but not so much here. 0-30. Backhand winner for Evans. 15-30. Robredo misses a great opportunity for a passing shot. 30-30. No mistake second time around though as Robredo advances to break point with the help of a net cord. And he takes it. Robredo will serve for the third set. Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-3 Evans* Remarkable! Another double fault from Robredo and we have our third break of serve in a row. Two to Evans, one to Robredo. Back on serve. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-2 Evans What do I know?! A double fault, a forehand winner and an effective chip and charge from Dan Evans and he hasthree break points... *Robredo 5-7 6-4 4-2 Evans This will be a big mental blow to the Briton. Right after Evans broke serve, Robredo repeats the trick. Evans is bent over, looking out of breath again. Â© 2025 BBC.

Trump's normal-ish foreign trip,"Just before Donald Trump left Washington to come on this gruelling trip, the word was he would have given anything to get out of it or anything to shorten it. One, he likes his home comforts - not that Air Force One is exactly slumming it - and two, he knew that all his critics were waiting for him to do something gauche or stupid in some faraway foreign clime. But that simply hasn't happened. He has navigated his first foreign trip with aplomb. Yes, there have been odd little moments that have caused eyebrows to arch and social media to fizz. Melania batting his hand away when he tried to hold it. There was the moment that Bibi introduced them in Israel as ""the President Donald Trump and the first wife"". Well, close. He could have either said the president and third wife; or the president and first lady. Then there was the press release put out by the White House with a spelling mistake, which read: the purpose of Donald Trump's Israel trip is to lay the groundwork for a lasting peach. And who can forget the Montenegrin manoeuvre in Brussels at the Nato summit? The poor prime minister of that country barged out of the way so that Donald Trump could get to the front of the pack for the cameras. I thought the best bit was after he'd muscled the poor man, the way the president pulled his jacket together, as if to say ""job done"". This video can not be played In May 2017 Donald Trump pushed aside Montenegro's prime minister and dressed down Nato leaders But this is all froth. The more important take-out is that he walked tall and didn't fall over. The low bar that the naysayers had set he jumped over easily. In Saudi he delivered a well thought-out, bold, and optimistic speech on how the fight against extremism and religious intolerance could be won. Yes, you might disagree with the policy of siding so closely with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states - but he made a lot of friends, and generated a great deal of excitement about the possibilities ahead. The orb: Odd moments from Trump's first foreign trip The pope has one, Trump wants one too In Israel there were no missteps either. But let's just raise the bar a little higher. He had said before leaving Washington that peace between Israelis and Palestinians would not be that difficult. But did the president move the peace process on during his visit? Well, in his speech at the Israel museum there was nothing about next steps, talks, confidence-building measures. On that score, it's hard to see what has changed. Did he win the Pope over? Didn't much feel like it. And for all that he gave his fellow Nato members as they stood beside him a tongue-lashing (it was so much like a headmaster lecturing an unruly class, I half expected him to turn to the French president who had an ironic smile on his face and say, ""Macron, stop smirking you cheese eating surrender monkey""), did he get the pledges of extra cash that he wanted? But one other striking thing about this trip. The president and his team stayed as far away from us - the press - as possible. What future for Nato? European angst over Trump visit Trump avoids diplomatic disaster When I travelled with President Obama, there would be quite a lot of social interaction at each location - cocktail parties where you would have a chance to talk to some of the key policymakers. It may not have given you a news story, but you got context. There has been no interaction this time round. And one other thing: he's barely tweeted. We started wondering whether he didn't have data roaming on his mobile phone package. The only tweets have been to say how much he enjoyed meeting this one or that. And the net effect? He hasn't fuelled any of the fires burning about Russia and the FBI, leaving the army of US correspondents travelling with him with nothing to do but report on the trip - the Pope, Saudi, the visit to the Western Wall. Exactly what the White House would have wanted. The focus has been on his agenda. The takeaway, as Americans are fond of saying? Maybe tweet a good deal less and travel abroad a lot more. Imagine how boring that would be for us!

See you then. Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 6-1 Evans In the end the heat, that pesky clay and an ageless Tommy Robredo proved too much for British number four Dan Evans. The British challenge in Paris goes from five to four. Piers NewberyBBC Sport in Paris He described it as ""like torture"" and right now Evans will just be pleased to get back into the air-conditioned (presumably) locker room. An ice bath might actually feel like a treat for once. Robredo is something of a marvel at 35 years old, clearly still a class act on the clay, while Evans can look forward to more success - and  less punishing matches - on the grass courts next month.

From a set and a break behind Tommy Robredo is a game away from the second round. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans I doubt this match will do much to increase Dan Evans' love for a clay court but he shouldn't forget he played well in the early stages of this match. He shows a glimpse of that form as another forehand winner whizzes beyond Robredo. The scoreline looks to have freed Evans up a little. He slices a backhand winner down the line now but true to type Robredo refuses to give in and takes us to deuce. *Robredo 5-7 6-4 6-3 4-1 Evans That won't improve Dan Evans' mood. Robredo guesses right and stands still, allowing him to return the Briton's smash before Evans puts the follow-up in the net. This shot is a little bit special though. Evans legs may be failing him but he shows great hands to put away a half volley. More brutal stuff from Robredo. He's doing what he does best, taking his opponent's energy away. He breaks Evans again and the Briton's race looks run.

Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea,"This video can not be played Archive: Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea - watch 2017 FA Cup final highlights Arsene Wenger secured his record seventh FA Cup final win as Arsenal produced a magnificent display to win a Wembley thriller against 10-man Chelsea. Alexis Sanchez gave Arsenal the lead in contentious fashion after only four minutes, when referee Anthony Taylor overruled his assistant after he had flagged for offside against Aaron Ramsey. The Premier League champions also claimed Sanchez handled in the build-up. And their task became even harder when Victor Moses was correctly sent off by Taylor in the second half after receiving a second yellow card for diving. Diego Costa revived Chelsea's hopes of a repeat of their league and FA Cup double in 2010 when Arsenal keeper David Ospina failed to keep out his deflected shot with 14 minutes left. Arsenal, outstanding throughout, refused to be denied and were back in front inside three minutes when Ramsey, who scored theFA Cup final winner against Hull City in 2014,did it again with a header from substitute Olivier Giroud's cross. Wenger pumped his fists in delight at the final whistle, as a season that has brought so much criticism for the 67-year-old ended in Wembley glory with a record 13th FA Cup win for the Gunners - and a record seventh for the Frenchman. Relive the thrilling game from Wembley Wenger: Future will be clear next week Best performance in a Gunners shirt? How the players rated Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC Radio 5 live: Arsene Wenger was right when he said the season has been a tough one for the players and fans, but they turned up today. They had one mindset, to walk off as winners, and that was clear to see. They played the better football and wanted it more. The Chelsea players were hanging their heads but they had an unbelievable season. On the day, not enough players turned up, they did not deserve to win. Arsenal defender Rob Holding had a fantastic semi-final too and he was under the spotlight, as was Per Mertesacker. Both players put on a huge display. What a performance Mesut Ozil put in too. Man for man, they were much better than Chelsea. I cannot believe how ordinary Arsenal made Chelsea look. The Premier League champions could not handle Arsenal's footballing ability in the middle of the pitch. They could not get any rhythm or get on the ball. It was their best display of the season. This video can not be played Watch Arsenal lift record 13th FA Cup Wenger finally gave full vent to his feelings about the criticism he received this season in the Wembley build-up -describing it as ""a disgrace""he will ""never forget."" And here at Wembley he answered the critics eloquently as Arsenal delivered an outstanding performance in an enthralling final to secure a win they fully merited. It was all done in front of Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, a staunch supporter of his manager in the face of mounting criticism, and with a decision still pending on Wenger's future. Wenger's stock has fallen in the eyes of Arsenal fans as the team have struggled at times this season, failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. Here however, Wenger coaxed and cajoled an inspired 90 minutes out of his Arsenal side in a performance that can rank alongside their finest in recent seasons. Jenas: Arsenal made Chelsea look ordinary Football Daily Podcast: 'Wenger deserves this success' 90 years of FA Cup commentaries on BBC Radio Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey both hit the woodwork in a matter of seconds in the first half and Ozil struck it deep in the second half. Chelsea defender Gary Cahill also made two excellent clearances as Arsenal created enough chances to win comfortably. Wenger, watching throughout in shirtsleeves, looked remarkably calm given the prize on offer and how much was riding on this Wembley final for him and his reputation. Arsenal were sharper, more aggressive and more creative than Chelsea - their only anxiety coming when they led by just one goal after a first 45 minutes they dominated completely. And The Gunners even refused to be knocked off course when Chelsea, reduced to 10 men after Moses' sending off, were gifted an equaliser when Ospina pushed feebly at Costa's deflected shot in the 76th minute. If Wenger needed to produce evidence that he can still win the big prizes and still get his Arsenal side to produce the big performance, then this was it. Man of the match Mertesacker was making his first start of the season Wenger was effectively forced to plunge veteran German defender Per Mertesacker into action after only 37 minutes playing time this season as he wrestled with a defensive crisis - and how the 32-year-old rewarded him. The Gunners were without suspended Laurent Koscielny, injured Gabriel and Shkodran Mustafi, who was suffering from concussion. It meant a call-up for Mertesacker against the most demanding Premier League opponents of all. He was faultless throughout, giving a masterclass in positioning, timing and making crucial interceptions time after time in a display that made a mockery of his lack of action. Mertesacker made experience count as he subdued Costa, apart from a moment when he got a slight deflection on his equaliser, but the embrace he received from his manager at the final whistle told the story. Chelsea went into this final as firm favourites to claim theleagueand cup double against an Arsenal side who have been their inferior this season. But in the end it was just one game too far for Antonio Conte's men. They looked leg-weary and slow and key men such as Eden Hazard and N'Golo Kante were unable to exert their usual influence. The Blues threatened to demonstrate their durability and resilience once more when, even at a numerical disadvantage, Costa put them back in the game. It was not to be - and the brutal truth is that on the day they were outplayed by a resurgent Arsenal. This has still been an outstanding season for Conte's side. Anthony Taylor was refereeing in his one and only FA Cup final The referee was presented with two big FA Cup final decisions - and he was certainly not found to be lacking in conviction. He overruled his linesman for Sanchez's opening goal after the offside flag had been raised, although Chelsea were left nursing a serious sense of injustice as they believed the Chilean had handled. There was no question he got his second decision right, giving a second yellow card to Moses as he clearly dived in a desperate attempt to win a penalty as Chelsea chased an equaliser. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:""We had an outstanding performance from the first minute onwards. This team has suffered. They've united and responded. They showed strength and unity and played spectacular football today. ""I'm proud to have won seven of these cups. I'm proud having done this - winning the championship without losing and winning seven FA Cups."" Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:""I think the first goal was very strange. The first half we didn't start well, we didn't have the right approach and we suffered in first 25 minutes. We started to play better in the second half and the red card was decisive. ""There is disappointment for the final result but it can happen and there was a lot of pressure. Victor Moses has been good and played an important season. ""Our season was incredible to win the league in this way, it was great but now it's important to look forward and to restart"". The two sides meet again in the Community Shield on Sunday, 6 August, before the new season. Arsenal have beaten Chelsea twice in a season [in all competitions] for the first time since 2003-04. Per Mertesacker started his first game for Arsenal since 30 April 2016 [against Norwich], 392 days ago. At three minutes 49 seconds, Alexis Sanchez's opening goal was Arsenal's fastest ever in an FA Cup final. Sanchez has scored in five successive games for Arsenal in all competitions for the first time. The Chilean has been directly involved in 45 goals in 51 appearances for Arsenal this season [30 goals, 15 assists]. Victor Moses is the fifth player to be sent off in an FA Cup final after Chris Smalling [Manchester United in 2016], Pablo Zabaleta [Manchester City in 2013], Jose Antonio Reyes [Arsenal in 2005], Kevin Moran [Manchester United in 1985]. Diego Costa netted his 22nd goal of the season for Chelsea in all competitions - his best-ever return in a single campaign for the Blues. Olivier Giroud has had a hand in four goals in his past four games for Arsenal in all competitions [three goals, one assist].

Could you live totally off-grid?,"This video can not be played Freda and Andy Power decided to build an entirely eco-friendly house created with recycled material An advert on an online message board asks: ""Anyone interested in living in an off-grid straw bale house?"" It adds: ""No rent, all I'm asking is taking care of the house, and my two donkeys, two pigs (pets!), five hens, two cats and two dogs."" It's not your average property listing, but the owners, by their own admission, are not your average couple. Both originally from Munich, Andy and Freda Power met in Ireland, by chance, when he was hitchhiking in the rain on holiday in County Kerry. They married, and after two years of fruitlessly searching for a cottage to renovate, the pair decided to build an eco-friendly house themselves. Their home is situated on the Roscommon and Galway County border in Ireland and there are no neighbours for almost a mile. The nearest village is eight miles away. But it's not just the remote location that makes the property special - almost everything inside is made from recycled or salvaged material. The cottage furniture is either recycled or welded by Andy in a horse-box workshop in the garden A small window reveals the straw insulation behind the wall's plaster The couple, who have 16 pets, grow all their fruit, vegetables and herbs, and the house is powered by solar panels and a wind turbine. Andy explains: ""We have no USB connections, no water, no sewage, no bin service. We do everything ourselves."" A tree, rooted in the earth, grows in the middle of the guest bedroom. The structure itself is made of salvaged timber beams, lined with small stone walls. Straw bales are then stacked on top, and the walls coated with lime plaster. Remarkably, Andy is a social worker without a background in construction. ""The main thing is we are a little bit crazy and brave - lots of people tell me: 'I couldn't do that,'"" he says. ""But when I ask them if have they ever tried - they say: 'No'."" The whole process took three-and-a-half years. ""I bought some good books but, to be honest, the whole thing wouldn't be possible without the internet. We get so many ideas from websites all around the world,"" he says. Many of the cottage's quirks are not immediately visible. The oak in the kitchen is from an abandoned lock-keeper's house in Dublin. Feature windows in the hallway are actually converted washing machine doors, installed after the motor was used for a wind turbine. ""The whole house sits on a layer of wine bottles,"" he said. ""Under the floor there are between 4,000 and 5,000 bottles. But I didn't drink them all, I collected them from my colleagues over three years. ""Insulation is nothing else but trapped air, so the empty bottles sit in a four-inch cavity. Don't ask me if it works, but we tried it!"" A tree grows in the middle of the guest bedroom, with a stool and bed frame made from branches While not being totally self-sufficient, the couple grow all their fruit, vegetables and herbs Even the couple's bed was soldered by Andy from leftover iron and timber. ""With a house like this you can't go to Ikea - it just doesn't fit,"" he says. ""The fridge is a bit of an issue, because it needs electricity all of the time."" He explains that instead of a traditional fridge, a bucket is buried beneath the ground on a hoist system made from old farm equipment. ""It is always between eight and nine degrees. Milk lasts for a few days. Meat could be tricky, but I'm a vegetarian."" Sewage is treated in an on-site septic tank, with the overflow going into a reed bed in a nearby field. And it is totally odourless. Bits of plastic and driftwood from Irish beaches are refashioned by Frieda into the cottage's artwork. The kitchen stool is a welded tractor chair with spanners for foot rests. ""Some people call it rubbish, but I call it material with potential,"" says Andy. Wood pallets are refashioned into garden furniture, even a swinging chair Lawn chairs made out of sawn-off baths are among their garden furniture The Powers have decided to go travelling and have been looking for someone to maintain their property and animals while they are away. They plan to go to Ecuador to teach in a school in the jungle, which is only reachable by canoe. It's a way of life most would not be able to adapt to, but a young couple from Dublin have answered the Powers' advertisement and are willing to try the off-grid life for themselves. Asked about the appeal of such simple living, the Powers say:  ""You have to be a little bit different. It can be lonely, and people either hate it or love it - there's nothing in between. ""It's quite practical living - there is a lot of work involved in the daily routine. But we love the freedom to do whatever."" The animal paddock is built with 270 recycled doors bought in bulk The cottage has several outbuildings and a teepee, which Andy uses for his social work with children LA firefighters give update as wildfires destroy buildings and force thousands to flee Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?
