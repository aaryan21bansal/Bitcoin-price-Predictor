"Trump to N Korea: Be very, very nervous","This video can not be played Trump says his earlier warning to North Korea ""wasn't tough enough"" President Donald Trump has warned North Korea it should be ""very, very nervous"" if it does anything to the US. He said the regime would be in trouble ""like few nations have ever been"" if they do not ""get their act together"". His comments came after Pyongyang announced it had a plan to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam. US Defence Secretary James Mattis warned that armed conflict with North Korea would be ""catastrophic"" and said diplomacy was bearing fruit. ""The American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results,"" he said. This video can not be played Who's in Trump's good and bad books? Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country is fully prepared to join a war against North Korea, were it to launch an attack on the US. ""If there's an attack on the US, the Anzus Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States,"" he said in a radio interview, ""as America would come to our aid if we were attacked."" Tensions have escalated in recent weeks after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme. Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation US stocks slide on North Korea fears Can the US defend itself against North Korea? N Korea: The possible solutions President Trump also said he was close to revealing his keenly awaited decision on the number of troops he plans to keep in Afghanistan. He said he had ""taken over a mess"", but was going to make it ""a lot less messy"". Speaking on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Mr Trump suggested his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, despite his threat this week to rain ""fire and fury"" upon the regime. North Korea has dismissed his dire warnings as ""nonsense"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' Mr Trump railed against previous US administrations for being too weak on North Korea and also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"". He said: ""I will tell you this, if North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us they can be very, very nervous. ""I'll tell you whyâ¦ because things will happen to them like they never thought possible."" However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations. This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" He added: ""I will tell you this, North Korea better get their act together or they're gonna be in trouble like few nations have ever been."" North Korea said on Wednesday itplanned to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. However, there has been no indication that any attack on the Pacific island is imminent. Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Seoul This video can not be played The BBC's Robin Brant asks those in the South Korean capital, Seoul: ""Are you scared?"" On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual. Mr Trump meanwhile denied there were any mixed messages from his administration. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson played down the rhetoric between the two sides. This video can not be played Don't listen to Tillerson - White House But in an interview with the BBC on Thursday, White House Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka dismissed the top diplomat's comments. ""You should listen to the president,"" he said. ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical."" Mr Gorka recalled a quote from a Holocaust survivor he often refers to when lecturing on grand strategy, saying: ""When a group of people repeatedly says they want to kill you, sooner or later you should take them seriously"". ""North Korea has said they wish to annihilate the United States and use nuclear weapons. Sooner or later, somebody should take them seriously,"" he said. The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits.

Bus-push jogger suspect arrested,"This video can not be played CCTV footage of a jogger who appeared to push a woman in front of a bus A man has been arrested by police after footage emerged of a jogger appearing to push a woman into the path of a bus on Putney Bridge. The 50-year-old was held at a residential address in Chelsea on Thursday morning on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. He was later released while inquiries continue, police said. The CCTV footage showed the woman, 33, narrowly avoiding serious injury due to the bus driver's quick reactions. On Wednesday, the Met said it had received a ""huge response"" to its appeal for information. CCTV of the incident, which happened on 5 May, was issued earlier in the week in an effort to trace the jogger after police attempts to establish his identity had failed. The footage shows a man barging the woman to the ground and off the pavement, into the road. The bus can then be seen swerving to avoid the woman's head. Afterwards the driver stopped the bus, at which point several passengers got off and went to help the victim. About 15 minutes later the jogger came back the other way across the bridge. The woman, who received minor injuries, tried to speak to him but he did not acknowledge her and carried on jogging. The Met said the man officers arrested was still the subject of investigation but had not been released on official police bail.

Wandering shaman 'mistaken' for Bigfoot,"MacGregor says his shaman suit led to the 'mistaken identity' A self-described shaman says a strange creature reportedly spotted in the hills of North Carolina last week was actually him dressed in animal skins. The ""Bigfoot"" sighting happened last Friday in the Appalachian mountains, but the story took an even weirder twist with a mistaken identity claim. Gawain MacGregor says it was him wandering through the forest on the night in question, 4 August. But a local group claims the cryptid they saw could not have been him. Bigfoot 911, a Facebook group of more than 5,700 members that investigates sightings of the mythical Bigfoot in McDowell County, western North Carolina, said photos displayed on Mr MacGregor's website look nothing like the thing they saw. John Bruner, who runs the group, says the creature he and eight other members encountered last Friday night in Pisgah National Park stood at around 8ft (2.4m) tall, had a different facial appearance, and ""moved with speed unmatched by any human"". However, Mr MacGregor said he was participating in a ""sacrament"" of ""wearing of hair-covered animal skins and wandering in the forest"". The 36-year-old, who was on holiday from Minnesota, writes on his blog about his personal belief in Bigfoot, or ""the divine nature of sasquatch"", as he calls it. He writes that by dressing in sewn animal skins, and by reciting a ""sasquatch prayer"", he has had several encounters with the beast. ""It feels like it brings me closer to nature,"" he told the BBC after returning from holiday. Police in South Carolina issued this humorous warning after watching a 2015 video from the area After seeing the sighting reported on the news, he felt obliged as an ""honest citizen"" to come forward, he told the BBC. ""If someone caused you to have an experience that meant something to you, but wasn't genuine, wouldn't you want them to tell you?"" he said. Hundreds of sightings of Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, have been reported in western North Carolina and the Appalachian mountains along the East Coast. On Tuesday, police in neighbouring South Carolinaadvised citizens not to shoot at Bigfoo,externalt, since ""you'll most likely be wounding a fun-loving and well-intentioned person, sweating in a gorilla costume"". It is not the only mythical creature to make headlines this week in the region. Emergency officials in South Carolina said on Wednesday they do not know whether this month's US solar eclipse will make the so-called Lizardman become more active. But the state emergency management division advised citizensto be vigilant,externalfor any sign of the swamp thing, which was first sighted in 1998.

Flea-bitten officer gets Â£12k payout,"West Midlands Police said the flea bites occurred in ""an office environment"" A police officer was awarded more than Â£12,000 in damages after being bitten by fleas at work, a Freedom of Information request revealed. The payout, which also cost Â£4,185 in legal fees, was one of 14 claims settled by West Midlands Police in 2016/17 at a total cost of Â£61,131.30. The officer was bitten in an office space at a police station. The force said it has liability insurance which covers compensation claims made as a result of injury. See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Therequest revealed,externalthe officer received Â£12,127 in damages while the case cost a further Â£4,185 in legal fees. There were five other payouts in excess of Â£5,000, the request showed. Of the other personal injury payouts, there were two for falls at work and two for what is described as ""manual handling"". Another constable was handed Â£7,274 in damages for defective equipment used while at work. In a statement West Midlands Police said: ""A police officer received a settlement after receiving a flea bite at work that resulted in emergency surgery. ""Compensation payouts are only made following the assessment of appropriate medical evidence by insurers and solicitors who then make a recommendation to the force as to what the pay-out should be. ""The force does have liability insurance in place which operates in respect of compensation claims made as a result of injury."" Tom Cuddeford, from West Midlands Police Federation, said compensation payouts ""aren't flippantly made"". He added: ""You don't get Â£12,000 for a simple flea bite.

Tower block evacuation over safety fears,"This video can not be played Ledbury estate residents say they are ""angry and confused"" Hundreds of residents are to be evacuated from four tower blocks over safety fears. Residents of the Ledbury estate in south-east London have been told they will have to move out after structural problems were found. A survey, ordered in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, found cracks in the walls leaving it vulnerable to ""collapse"" if a gas explosion occurred. Southwark Council said it was doing ""all it could"" to help residents. Gas supplies have been turned off and residents offered temporary hotplates to cook meals. Southwark Council has written to residents of the estate near the Old Kent Road saying officials have arranged for them to use the shower facilities at any of the leisure centres in the borough if they provide proof of address. Cllr Stephanie Cryan, deputy leader and cabinet member for housing, said: ""At every stage of this investigation, we have put residents' safety first, and acted on the best information available. ""We are doing all we can to provide residents with alternatives while the gas is turned off, and are working up a plan to permanently replace the gas with electric ovens, boilers etc. as part of the wider works, should that be necessary."" The blocks' gas supply was installed when they were built between 1968-1970. Soon after a gas explosion at the similarly constructed Ronan Point block killed four people. The council confirmed that ""strengthening works"" - carried out on estates under government order across the UK in the wake of Ronan Point - may never have happened on the Ledbury. Since 19 July the council has been offering Â£5,800 to move tenants to new flats by placing them at the head of the housing waiting list.

Inside Europe's sexcam capital,"Interactive webcamming is the fastest-growing sector of the global pornography business.  In Romania, thousands of women work as ""cam-girls"" from studios and from home.  It is a 24/7 market, the majority of clients logging in from North America and Western Europe. In the heart of Bucharest on the pavement outside a tall apartment building a group of young women smoke, talk and laugh. It is an unremarkable scene. Except that in the bright morning sunlight, their heavy makeup, sky-high heels and shiny, revealing clothes contrast with the sensible, summer dress of passers-by. Inside the building, Studio 20 occupies the first and second floors. Forty rooms open off pristine, white corridors, their walls adorned with pictures of women in states of glamorous undress.  A closed door means business.  Inside that room a woman is live and direct via webcam with international clients - and as long as she is alone in the room, it is entirely legal.  In this world of virtual relationships and cybersex, those in front of the camera are ""models"" and the men who watch are ""members"". Inside Studio 20 - a closed door means a model is entertaining a client Lana works in Room 8. It is dominated by a circular bed with cushions.  There is a wardrobe containing some of her clothes. ""I usually go for dresses, lingerie, or leather,"" she says. In a corner of the room there is a large computer screen, an expensive camera and behind them, professional photographers' lights.  Dozens of pairs of eyes may view Lana in her room online in real time via dedicated adult websites.  But she does not make any money until a member asks her to ""go private"" in a one-to-one webcam session. Lana works at Studio 20 Working an eight-hour day, she earns close to 4,000 euros (Â£3,600) per month - nearly 10 times the Romanian average wage.  As Lana's employer, Studio 20 also makes 4,000 euros per month from her online sessions.  And at the top of the video chat money-making pyramid, LiveJasmin - the online cam site that streams Studio 20's content and is responsible for collecting payment from the credit cards of clients - takes double that: 8,000 euros. Listen toRomania's Webcam BoomonCrossing Continentsat 11:00, BBC Radio 4 LiveJasmin is the largest internet cam host in the world.  Between 35 and 40 million users visit it daily, and at any given moment, there are 2,000 models live online.  It is not hard to understand how the web-cam industry, overall, generated an estimated $2-3bn in 2016. A cam-girl gets ready to entertain in a bathroom setting - complete with chandelier Lana is a graduate who worked in real estate until the global economic crash of 2008 plunged Romania into recession.  That is when she first took up video-chat.  Her first day in front of the camera has stayed with her. ""I was alone in the room, and it felt like there were hundreds of people around me.  And I couldn't keep up with what they were all saying, and what they were asking of me.  It was quite shocking.  But then I learned to be perceptive about which member was a potential paying customer and not to waste time with all of them in the free online space."" So what happens in a private, webcam one-to-one? ""Mostly it's conversation.  I do role-play sometimes, and a small part of it is nudity and masturbation,"" she says. While the members sometimes try to push her to do things she doesn't want to do, she is able to set the pace. ""It's up to you as a woman to lead, and that's quite empowering."" The important thing is to keep a paying client online for as many minutes as possible. ""You have 10 minutes of being cute and sexy, and then you better have something to talk about because otherwise the member will not stay,"" says Andra Chirnogeanu, Studio 20's PR manager. ""You better have something to talk about otherwise the member will not stay"" says Andra Chirnogeanu, Studio 20's PR manager To this end, Studio 20 employs trainers, a psychologist and an English teacher. Most of the clients are North American and European, so it is essential the models can communicate with them. But the English teacher, Andrea, has a remit that goes far beyond language skills. ""I teach them about fetishes - what a fetish is, why a person has oneâ¦ We study Freud and a lot of psychology.  And we study a book of gestures because women must be sensual, smart and beautiful."" Models are encouraged to message clients every day Geography is important too, so the models can talk about where the members are from. ""That or exotic places,"" says Andrea. ""This is not only a sex business as some people think - models have to speak with a member as if they are in a normal, online relationship. Being able to discuss many subjects brings comfort to both parties."" Studio 20 is the largest studio webcam franchise in the world.  It has nine branches in Romania, including one employing ""cam-boys"" who service the gay market.  Its other branches are in the Colombian city of Cali, Budapest and Los Angeles. Not all models work from a studio. Sandy Bell - a graduate with two university degrees - is one of a small army of women who webcam from home. She makes about 100 euros (Â£90) a day when she goes online to supplement her income as an interior designer.  One advantage of being independent - and dealing directly with a web-hosting company - is that she earns a larger percentage of members' fees. ""Mostly they're nice guys, not crazy men,"" she says. ""There are a lot of members looking for love. They want the connection. Some members want you to call their name. Or to talk to them while you dance and strip.  I'm very honest with them - they know I have a boyfriend, and they know we are not going to have sex in real life."" This video can not be played ""They don't touch you. They are thousands of miles away""- Sandy Bell, a 'cam-girl', describes her work. Sandy Bell's partner lives with her in their high-rise flat on the outskirts of Bucharest.  He knows what she does, but her parents do not.  It is not uncommon in this industry - even for studio owners - to hide their occupations from family and friends. This accounts for the fact that those who talked to the BBC in Bucharest preferred to use their cam name, or just a first name. Unlike many who work in the sex industry, Sandy Bell does not worry about her own security. ""What can a member do to me?  If he crosses a line or even if he is rude to me, I just click the mouse and stop it.  And I can talk to the administrator on the website and they ban the IP address, so the guy can never enter again even if he changes his nickname.  I mean, those people are thousands of miles away from me.  They don't touch you - nobody touches you.  You go online alone and you work online alone.  This has nothing to do with prostitution."" Is Sandy Bell a victim?  She says she is not, though feminists such as Irina Ilisei say the question is more complicated than it seems. ""Do we talk about women who are forced to do this? Are they women who choose it?  Or perhaps they do it because they are psychologically manipulated, or they have a lack of economic stability.  Probably, it's a combination of all these factors."" Ilisei believes the push factors include Romania's high rate of teenage pregnancy, and the fact that 30% of those who finish higher education cannot find a job. Irina Ilisei believes some women are pushed into the industry The webcam industry also does its best to entice young women into the business. ""There are advertisements on university campuses,"" says Ilisei.  ""Students get direct Facebook messages with offers of work.  And the studios are very corporate - exactly like an entry-career job in other fields.  The language is all about empowering young women, being independent, learning skills, even getting bonuses if you convince your friends to try it too."" For Lana, 31, webcamming has provided enough money for her to bring up her daughter alone, and to think about investing money in something ""that will bring money to the country"". She plans to give up in two years' time. But some women are not free to make the choices Lana has.  Oana, 28, counts herself as an escapee from the sex industry.  At 16 - a minor - she fell in love with a boyfriend who persuaded her to do video chat. ""He told me I just had to talk.  That's all.  But he was in the room with me, and we made pornography there."" It is illegal in Romania for a man and woman to webcam together, but it is impossible to say how commonly the law is flouted in the way Oana describes.  She went on to work as a prostitute in Germany, until she found the courage to return to Bucharest and a new life.  Now she works in sex work prevention - talking to young women about her experiences, and trying to persuade them of the danger of video chat. ""There are girls who think they will just stay in front of the camera and make money.  But all the things they do there will affect their minds. The next step is prostitution. I see that now."" Lana disagrees. ""It's about selling your brain, not your body,"" she says.  ""I see it like a performance, like a show.  But this is not a job for everybody - a lot of girls quit after a few weeks or even days, because they have this mindset that they're selling their body.  Your mindset is what matters in this job. I have my limits, and I truly do not feel exploited."" Andra Chirnogeanu, Studio 20's PR Manager, also rejects the idea that this is risky or psychologically damaging work. ""It's psychologically damaging to stay 12 hours in an office getting paid a minimum wage,"" she says. But the fact that models often seek to conceal their job is, perhaps, telling. If Lana and Sandy Bell could have made a good living using their qualifications and other work experience, would they still have chosen to undress for clients in New York, Frankfurt and London?

Restaurant expels mayor dressed in shorts,"The mayor's shorts broke a local Italian fashion rule A waiter in a seaside restaurant in northern Italy told the local mayor to leave because he turned up for dinner wearing cargo shorts. The mayor of Viareggio, on the Tuscany coast, described his embarrassment on Facebook. Giorgio Del Ghingaro said he had not been told about the dress code. ""As it wasn't an official dinner, but one with some true friends, I felt free to dress casually,"" he wrote. The Club Nautico says it regrets the incident and will give him membership. Mayor Del Ghingaro posted a photo of his shorts in theFacebook post,external. He said he was sitting at a table on the terrace with his friends when a waiter approached and ""looking embarrassed he told me that, as I wasn't wearing long trousers, I couldn't remain there"". The mayor said he finally had a nice dinner elsewhere with his friends, but was hurt by the ""minor assault"" over his shorts. ""I admit it was a bit humiliating,"" he said. Mayor Del Ghingaro took to Facebook to tell the world he was upset Muzio Scacciati, a representative of Club Nautico's management, said there were two notices about the dress code - at the main entrance and by the stairs. The daily Corriere della Sera said he defended the rule about long trousers, to be worn in the restaurant after 7pm. ""I'm sorry about what happened and I hope we can clarify things with the mayor, to whom I intend to give a membership card,"" he said. Saudia Airlines: What to wear on board?

"700,000 eggs came to UK from tainted farms","About 700,000 eggs have been sent to the UK from potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an early estimate of 21,000, the food watchdog has said. The Food Standards Agency (FSA)said,externalit was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health. However, 11 products containing egg - including sandwiches and salads - have been withdrawn from supermarkets. Dutch police have now arrested two people suspected of using the insecticide fipronil. The FSA said the 700,000 figure represented 0.007% of eggs eaten in the UK each year. What do we know about the Europe egg scare? It added that in the UK, the Dutch eggs were not sold as shell eggs but used in foods with many other ingredients - mostly sandwich fillings or other chilled foods. It said traces of fipronil - which can be harmful to humans - were mixed with other eggs so chemical residues would be ""highly diluted"". The British Egg Industry Council said shell eggs on sale to consumers in the UK were not affected. It said: ""All major UK retailers stock British Lion shell eggs and tests have shown that there is no risk from British eggs."" Sainsbury's ham and egg salad (240g) use by 9-14 August 2017 Sainsbury's potato and egg salad (300g) use by 9-14 August Morrisons potato and egg salad (250g) use by up to 13 August Morrisons egg and cress sandwich (sold in Morrisons Cafe only) use by up to and including 11 August Morrisons cafe sandwich selection (sold in Morrisons Cafe only) use by up to and including 11 August Waitrose free range egg mayonnaise deli filler (240g) use by 13 and 16 August Waitrose free range reduced fat egg mayonnaise deli filler (170g) use by 14 August Waitrose free range egg and bacon deli filler (170g) use by 14 and 16 August Asda baby potato and free range egg salad (270g) use by 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 August Asda spinach and free range egg snack pot (110g) use by 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 August Asda FTG ham and cheddar ploughman's salad bowl (320g) use by 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 August Source:FSA,external(10 August) Twenty tonnes of insecticide-tainted eggshave been sold in Denmark, the country's food safety authority says. Denmark is believed to be the tenth country to be affected, with Romania and Luxembourg among the latest to report finding contaminated products. Supermarkets in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany have withdrawn millions of eggs from sale. In the UK, processed foods containing eggs, including sandwiches and salads, have been recalled from Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda. The FSA initiallythought far fewer eggs- 21,000 - had been distributed to the UK from implicated farms between March and June this year. Prof Chris Elliott, of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen's University Belfast, said it was not surprising that the figure had increased by so much - and warned ""the scandal isn't over yet"". ""Often when these food scandals start to break, you start to get dribbles of information,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""And as the authorities in Belgium and Holland get more information they pass that onto our own Food Standards Agency. ""The potential is that number of 700,000 could increase quite a bit yet,"" he added. By James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Fipronil should not be allowed anywhere near food. But the risk from eggs is thought to be low, because the number of contaminated eggs is also low. While 700,000 eggs sounds like a lot, it is worth remembering we eat 34 million every single day in the UK. It is why the Food Standards Agency says it is ""very unlikely"" there is any health risk. Many of the affected eggs will have already passed through the food chain before anyone was aware of the scandal. And the FSA has now pulled egg sandwiches and egg salads off the shelves that were made while contaminated eggs were still being imported. It insisted there is ""no need"" for people to stop eating eggs. Fipronil, which is used to kill lice and ticks on animals, can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities. Heather Hancock, FSA chairwoman, said it was not ""something to worry about"" and that any health impact was unlikely. ""These aren't eggs that are in people's fridges in the UK, these are eggs that have gone into the food chain and the level of risk to public health is very low,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. This video can not be played How safe are Dutch eggs to eat? In an update on Thursday, the FSA said: ""Some of the products made from these eggs will have had a short shelf life and will have already been consumed, however, we identified some that were still within the expiry date."" The FSA said decision to withdraw the products was not due to food safety concerns but based on the fact that the pesticide is not authorised for use in food-producing animals. It added: ""While in some European countries eggs containing fipronil residues have been sold as fresh eggs, in the UK this is not the case."" Aldi and Lidl stores in Germany are among the supermarkets to remove eggs from their shelves, in a move Aldi described as ""purely precautionary"". Eggs sold in its UK stores were British, Aldi said. It follows a joint investigation by Dutch and Belgian police of several premises thought to be using the substance, which can harm humans and is banned in food production. The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world. The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when Aldi withdrew all its eggs from sale in Germany. It has since emerged Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public. More than 100 poultry farms have been closed during the investigation, and 26 suspects identified and evidence seized from their companies. It is thought that fipronil was added to disinfectant used on some chicken farms. The UK produces 85% of the eggs it consumes but imports almost two billion annually, the FSA said.

Slavery 'affecting every city' in UK,"This video can not be played Aurel was forced to work and felt he couldn't escape Modern slavery and human trafficking in the UK is ""far more prevalent than previously thought,"" the National Crime Agency has said. The NCA said there were more than 300 live policing operations currently, with cases affecting ""every large town and city in the country"". The agency estimated that there were tens of thousands of victims. It said previous estimates of 10,000-13,000 victims in the UK were found to be the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The more we look, the more we find,"" the NCA's vulnerabilities director Will Kerr said. Mr Kerr said he had been shocked by what he had seen during this year's intensive efforts to break up gangs, with almost every major operation triggering even more investigations. He warned that trafficking into modern slavery was now so widespread that ordinary people would be unwittingly coming into contact with victims every day. The NCA said the growth in modern slavery was being driven by international gangs increasingly recognising the amount of money they could make by controlling people within a huge range of economic sectors, rather than just dealing drugs. It warned that the key sectors for slavery now included food processing, fishing, agriculture, construction, domestic and care workers and car washes. Mr Kerr said: ""We have been shocked by the scale of what we have seen... This video can not be played We need 'greater education', says a member of the government's modern slavery taskforce ""As you go about your normal daily life there is a growing and a good chance that you will come across a victim who has been exploited and that's why we are asking the public to recognise their concerns and report them."" The NCA said that signs of abuse included anything that suggested someone was being controlled or coerced into work, such as: the manner of their dress visible signs of injuries signs of stress the manner in which they had come to work in a particular area Modern slaves in the UK, often said to be hiding in plain sight, are working in nail bars, construction sites, brothels, cannabis farms and in agriculture. Traffickers are using the internet to lure their victims with hollow promises of jobs, education and even love. Albania, Nigeria, Vietnam, Romania and Poland are the most likely countries of origin, but some victims are from the UK itself. There is no typical victim. They can be men, women or children of all ages but it is normally more prevalent among the most vulnerable, minorities or socially-excluded groups. Many believe they are escaping poverty, limited opportunities at home, a lack of education, unstable social and political conditions or war. But their slave masters are usually out to make financial gain. Sexual exploitation is the most common form of modern slavery reported in the UK, followed by labour exploitation, forced criminal exploitation and domestic servitude. Sources:Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner Strategic Plan 2015-2017,externalandModernslavery.co.uk,external People from Eastern Europe, Vietnam and Nigeria were the most common victims brought to the UK, Mr Kerr said. He gave one example of a 12-year-old Roma girl who was stopped at border control and had been bound for a life as a domestic slave. He said: ""She was being brought in to work for a family in part of the UK, where she had effectively been sold by her father - or it had been facilitated by her father - and she was being brought in to take this family's children to school and pick them up every day, and clean the house in between. ""Twelve years old, same age as my youngest son."" Mr Kerr said criminal charges were pending against those involved in the case. He added that the problems authorities are facing are further complicated by the fact some people do not realise they are a victim of slavery. This video can not be played What has the National Crime Agency found in investigating modern slavery? BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani This stark assessment of the growing scale of modern slavery is a story of our times: Criminal gangs looking to maximise the profits from globalisation by coercing and controlling people, as they move them around the world like commodities. It is obviously impossible to fully assess a hidden problem. And while the NCA says it has been shocked by what it has seen over the last six months, there are also criticisms. On Wednesday the anti-slavery commissioner questioned in aninterview with the Evening Standard,externalwhether the NCA had previously failed to act quickly enough on its own existing intelligence. In its defence the agency says there has been a ""sea change"" in response across the board. Four years ago the former home secretary, now Prime Minister Theresa May, said it was time for a tougher response. The question remains whether this extraordinary modern crime has grown because too little has been done since then. The Modern Slavery Act wasintroduced into law in 2015. It states an offence is committed if someone holds another in slavery or servitude or requires them to perform forced or compulsory labour. The legislation also increased the maximum jail term for people traffickers from 14 years to life. Cherie Blair, the human rights barrister and anti-slavery campaigner, said the revelations came as ""no surprise whatsoever to anyone who's been working is this area"". ""Modern slavery's always been a hidden problem and what's happened since we passed the Modern Slavery Act in 2015 is more and more light is being thrown onto this problem, and rather like child abuse in the past, it's always been there but people were not aware of it, and as they become more aware of it, we uncover the true extent of the problem."" Figures released earlier this year by the NCA showed the number of suspected victims of slavery and human trafficking had more than doubled in three years. It said there were 3,805 people reported as potential victims in 2016 - an increase from 1,745 in 2013. A Home Office spokesman said the government had taken ""world-leading action"" to tackle modern slavery, including toughening up sentences and increasing support and protection for victims. ""We continue to support the work of the National Crime Agency to leave criminal networks of traffickers and slavers nowhere to hide. ""Earlier this year we launched the Joint Slavery and Trafficking Analysis Centre to provide high quality intelligence analysis to assess the threat posed by modern slavery, and to support an increased operational response to this horrendous crime.""

Trump warns N Korea 'be very very nervous',"This video can not be played Trump says his earlier warning to North Korea ""wasn't tough enough"" President Donald Trump has warned North Korea it should be ""very, very nervous"" if it does anything to the US. He said the regime would be in trouble ""like few nations have ever been"" if they do not ""get their act together"". His comments came after Pyongyang announced it had a plan to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam. US Defence Secretary James Mattis warned that armed conflict with North Korea would be ""catastrophic"" and said diplomacy was bearing fruit. ""The American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results,"" he said. This video can not be played Who's in Trump's good and bad books? Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country is fully prepared to join a war against North Korea, were it to launch an attack on the US. ""If there's an attack on the US, the Anzus Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States,"" he said in a radio interview, ""as America would come to our aid if we were attacked."" Tensions have escalated in recent weeks after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme. Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation US stocks slide on North Korea fears Can the US defend itself against North Korea? N Korea: The possible solutions President Trump also said he was close to revealing his keenly awaited decision on the number of troops he plans to keep in Afghanistan. He said he had ""taken over a mess"", but was going to make it ""a lot less messy"". Speaking on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Mr Trump suggested his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, despite his threat this week to rain ""fire and fury"" upon the regime. North Korea has dismissed his dire warnings as ""nonsense"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' Mr Trump railed against previous US administrations for being too weak on North Korea and also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"". He said: ""I will tell you this, if North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us they can be very, very nervous. ""I'll tell you whyâ¦ because things will happen to them like they never thought possible."" However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations. This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" He added: ""I will tell you this, North Korea better get their act together or they're gonna be in trouble like few nations have ever been."" North Korea said on Wednesday itplanned to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. However, there has been no indication that any attack on the Pacific island is imminent. Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Seoul This video can not be played The BBC's Robin Brant asks those in the South Korean capital, Seoul: ""Are you scared?"" On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual. Mr Trump meanwhile denied there were any mixed messages from his administration. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson played down the rhetoric between the two sides. This video can not be played Don't listen to Tillerson - White House But in an interview with the BBC on Thursday, White House Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka dismissed the top diplomat's comments. ""You should listen to the president,"" he said. ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical."" Mr Gorka recalled a quote from a Holocaust survivor he often refers to when lecturing on grand strategy, saying: ""When a group of people repeatedly says they want to kill you, sooner or later you should take them seriously"". ""North Korea has said they wish to annihilate the United States and use nuclear weapons. Sooner or later, somebody should take them seriously,"" he said.

N Korea promises Guam strike plan in days,"This video can not be played It's not the first time North Korea has made threats against Guam North Korea says a plan that could see it fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam will be ready in a matter of days. State media said Hwasong-12 rockets would pass over Japan and land in the sea about 30km (17 miles) from Guam, if the plan was approved by Kim Jong-un. It denounced Donald Trump'swarnings of ""fire and fury""and said the US leader was ""bereft of reason"". The US has warned the North its actions could mean the ""end of its regime"". US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in any war against the US and its allies. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, who is in Guam, says there is a sense that the North Korean threat is rhetorical, as most people feel that if they really did strike with missiles it would be suicidal for the North Korean regime. Separately, the European Union said it was freezing the assets of nine more people and four more entities, including North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank, in line with fresh sanctions approved by the UN Security Council on Saturday. The North first announced on Wednesday that it had been drawing up plans for a missile strike against Guam, a Pacific island which is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people. A later statement carried by state media said the military would ""finally complete the plan"" by mid-August and send it to leader Kim Jong-un for his approval. This video can not be played The BBC's Robin Brant asks those in the South Korean capital, Seoul: ""Are you scared?"" ""The Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA [Korean People's Army] will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi [Kochi] Prefectures of Japan,"" state news agency KCNA said, quoting army chief General Kim Rak Gyom.

Read more about North Korea's missile programme ""They will fly 3,356.7km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30-40km away from Guam."" The Hwasong missiles are North Korea's domestically produced medium and long-range weapons. The governor of Guam addressed the North's new statement on Thursday, telling Reuters news agency that North Korea usually likes to be unpredictable and has fired surprise missiles in the past. ""They're now telegraphing their punch, which means they don't want to have any misunderstandings. I think that's a position of fear,"" said Governor Eddie Calvo. This video can not be played North Koreans rally to denounce 'gangster' US Meanwhile Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Pyongyang's actions were ""provocative to the region including Japan as well as to the security of the international community"". ""We can never tolerate this,"" he added. Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told MPs Japan could legally intercept a North Korean missile headed for Guam because such a move would threaten Japan's existence as a nation. Recent legislationalso allows Japan to defend the US and other allies from attack. Previously Japan's position was only to shoot down missiles headed for its own territory. South Korea's military said it was prepared for swift action. ""If North Korea conducts provocation in defiance of our military's grave warning, it will confront the strong and firm response of our military and the US-South Korea alliance,"" Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said. The foreign ministry in Seoul, meanwhile, urged Pyongyang to respond to its recent offer of new dialogue. China has urged calm, describing the situation as ""complex and sensitive"". North Korean state media said President Trump's remarks on Tuesday that the North risked ""fire and fury"" for threatening the US were ""a load of nonsense"". ""Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,"" it added. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Residents of Guam feel 'caught in the crossfire' Amid escalating rhetoric, Mr Mattis issued a strongly worded statement on Wednesday calling on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme. This video can not be played Trump will use ""any appropriate measures"" - adviser Sebastian Gorka ""While our state department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth,"" he said.

Guam profile from BBC Monitoring US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has sought to reassure Americans that North Korea does not pose an imminent threat. On Wednesday, he said the situation had not dramatically changed over the past few days, and that Americans ""should sleep well at night"". South Korea's military says it has not seen any unusual action in the North that might indicate a provocation. Despite rounds of UN sanctions, Pyongyang carried out two nuclear tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July. Various reports recently have suggested the North has now achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. But this remains unconfirmed, and most analysts doubt the country would launch a pre-emptive attack on the US. North Korea's missile programme What damage can North Korea do?

Tonnes of tainted eggs sold in Denmark,"Millions of eggs have now been withdrawn from shops in several European countries Twenty tonnes of insecticide-tainted eggs have been sold in Denmark, the country's food safety authority says. The boiled and peeled eggs were mainly sold to cafeterias, cafes and catering firms, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said in a statement. Denmark is the latest European country to discover eggs contaminated with fipronil in its food chain. Two managers at a Dutch company have been arrested during joint raids by Dutch and Belgian authorities. The company - named as Chickfriend by local media - allegedly used fipronil at poultry farms, prosecutors in the Netherlands said. The eggs have come mainly from the Netherlands with some originating in Belgium and Germany. The insecticide can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities. However, the Danish food administration urged calm, saying the eggs bought by DanÃ¦g Products posed no risk to human consumption. Eggs scandal: 700,000 distributed in UK What do we know about the Europe egg scare? ""Samples analysed in the Netherlands show traces of fipronil in the eggs, but not as a health hazard,""the agency said,external[in Danish]. ""Because the content is illegal, DanÃ¦g Products must withdraw the eggs from their customers."" Twenty tonnes is the equivalent weight of two-and-a-half African elephants. Denmark is believed to be the tenth country affected by the widening scandal, with Romania and Luxembourg among the latest to report finding contaminated products. Romanian authorities said on Thursday that one tonne of liquid egg yolk contaminated with fipronil had been found in a warehouse in the west of the country. This video can not be played How safe are Dutch eggs to eat? The product was imported from Germany but had not been sold to consumers, food safety officials said. Fipronil is banned from use in the food industry under EU rules. In a statement, the prosecutors said investigators were also focused on a Belgian supplier, and another Dutch company ""that colluded with the Belgian supplier"". They added: ""They are suspected of putting public health in danger by supplying and using fipronil in pens containing egg-laying chickens."" Chickfriend, a poultry farm cleaning company, is yet to comment. Belgian firm Poultry Vision is alleged to have sold chemicals to Dutch company Chickfriend Investigators in Belgium have also carried out several raids and identified 26 people or companies as suspects, AFP news agency reports. Some 6,000 litres of ""prohibited products"" were seized in Belgium. In the UK, the Food Standards Agency now says about 700,000 eggs have been imported from potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an early estimate of 21,000, But itsaid,externalit was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health. However, 11 products containing egg - including sandwiches and salads - have been withdrawn from supermarkets. The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world. Some 180 farms - which produce millions of eggs a week - have been temporarily shut down while further tests are carried out. It is thought that fipronil was added to an allowable treatment for red mites. The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when Aldiwithdrew all its eggs from salein Germany. It has since emerged Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public because of a fraud investigation. But Belgium has in turn accused the Dutch of knowing about the problem as far back as November 2016, which they deny. 700,000 eggs came to UK from tainted farms What we know about the egg scare Belgium kept Dutch egg concerns secret Aldi pulls Germany eggs over poison fear At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Racism fear 'perpetuates abuse culture',"This video can not be played Operation Sanctuary: Newcastle community leaders react A fear of being called racist is preventing authorities investigating the reasons behind child abuse cases, an MP has claimed. Rotherham MP Sarah Champion was speaking after 17 men wereconvicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex. Mostly British-born, they are from Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish communities. Ms Champion said asking if there were ""cultural issues"" was simply ""child protection"". Northumbria Police said society ""can't be afraid to have this discussion"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme, Ms Champion, Labour's shadow women and equalities minister, said gang-related child sexual exploitation involves ""predominately Pakistani men"" who were involved in such cases ""time and time and time again"". MP Sarah Champion says it is not racist to ask questions about race ""The government aren't researching what is going on. Are these cultural issues? Is there some sort of message going out within the community?"" she said. Ms Champion said the ""far right"" would attack her comments for ""not doing enough"" and the ""floppy left"" would call her racist. ""This isn't racist, this is child protection,"" said the MP for Rotherham, whereat least 1,400 childrenwere found to have been exploited between 1997 and 2013. The issue was not being dealt with because ""people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse"", Ms Champion said. Mohammed Shafiq from the Ramadhan Foundation said the debate needed putting in context. ""Amongst these criminals there is a mindset that they think that white girls are worthless,"" he said. ""They don't have any regard for their standing within society and therefore they think they can be used and abused in that way. ""But the vast majority of child sex abuse carried out in this country is carried out by white men - through the home, through family networks and through the internet."" Chief Constable Steve Ashman said the police treated suspects ""without fear or favour"" Northumbria Police Chief Constable Steve Ashman said the force did not ask about religious background on arrest. As those arrested under Operation Sanctuary were from a number cultural backgrounds, ""who do I point that finger towards to say you have an issue here, culturally?"" he said. Some communities' attitude to ""women, principally white women"" needed addressing, he said. ""But the discussion has to take place beyond policing."" Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald said there had been a reluctance in the past to investigate gangs from some Asian communities targeting vulnerable white girls. ""Some recognition that this is a problem"" was needed, he said. All communities needed to address it, ""not pretending it's something else, not shying away from it, recognising it for what it is, which is profoundly racist crime"", he said.

Swift confronts DJ in groping trial,"US singer Taylor Swift has described in court the moment she says she was groped by radio DJ David Mueller during a meet and greet. ""It was a definite grab. A very long grab,"" said the 27-year-old, who is suing Mr Mueller, 55, over the alleged incident, which he denies. ""It was intentional,"" she told the court in Denver, Colorado. ""I felt him grab on to my ass cheek under my skirt. He grabbed my ass underneath my skirt."" The singer, who was responding to questions from Mr Mueller's lawyer, added: ""He stayed latched on to my bare ass cheek as I lurched away from him. [His hand] didn't let go. ""It was a very shocking thing. I had never dealt with something like this before."" Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court Taylor Swift trial: What you need to know Swift (left in the court sketch) said it was ""shocking"" The alleged assault is said to have occurred in 2013, during a Denver stopover on Taylor Swift's Red tour. Mr Mueller, then a host on the top-rated radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show. Ms Swift complained to KYGO and the station fired Mr Mueller two days later. Mr Mueller sued the singer, saying that Ms Swift's allegation cost him his job. She countersued one month later, describing the groping incident as ""completely intentional"". When Mr Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, asked why her bodyguard did not interfere when the alleged incident happened, she said: ""No-one could have expected this to happen... It had never happened before. It was horrifying and shocking."" She also rejected the assumption that she misidentified Mr Mueller, saying:  ""I'm not going to allow you or your client to say I am to blame."" Andrea Swift says her ""trust was shattered"" by the incident The 55-year-old denies any inappropriate behaviour. Earlier in court, when asked if he had grabbed her, he said: ""No, I did not."" Ms Swift took the stand the day afterher mother gave her testimonyand described how she wanted to ""vomit and cry"" when her daughter told her about the alleged incident.

'WW2 bomb' at Fukushima nuclear site,"The Fukushima Daiichi plant suffered a series of meltdowns following an earthquake and tsunami A suspected unexploded bomb has been found at the site of the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. The US is thought to have dropped the 89cm-long (3ft) device during WW2. It was found by workers building a car park at the site where a four-decade-long decommissioning process is under way. Tens of thousands of residents had to evacuate the area after a reactor meltdown in 2011 following an earthquake and tsunami. The incident at the Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) site was the world's most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. No-one died directly in the meltdown but three formerTepco executives are facing trialon charges of negligence because of deaths related to the area's evacuation. Fukushima disaster response failed Workers have been decommissioning the site Tepco said construction work was immediately suspended after the object was found and a temporary exclusion zone put in place while bomb disposal experts were deployed. It is not uncommon for unexploded WW2 devices to be found in Japan over 70 years on from the end of the war. The Fukushima area was previously home to a Japanese military base.

Is anything left of this city?," The brutal fight to rid Mosul of so-called Islamic State has left the northern Iraqi city in ruins, thousands dead and survivors scattered far and wide. Just how much devastation was caused by the battle between Iraq’s forces - backed by US-led air strikes - and the militant group, and what will happen now? While the battle for Mosul is over after nine months of fighting, its people are facing a humanitarian crisis on a catastrophic scale. Satellite images show entire neighbourhoods destroyed Death toll estimates vary widely, from thousands to tens of thousands, and more than one million - equivalent to the population of Dublin - have fled their homes since the offensive started in October last year. Whole neighbourhoods have been flattened, bodies remain under rubble and streets are littered with unexploded weapons, landmines and booby-traps. Much of Iraq’s second city, controlled by IS since June 2014, has been reduced to rubble. The mission is now regarded as the single largest urban battle since World War II. All parts of Mosul have experienced some kind of damage, according to thelatest UN assessment. However, the western half of the city, retaken in July, has suffered more than in the east - won back from IS six months earlier. More than half of Mosul's 54 western residential districts have been significantly affected. The UN describes 15 as “heavily damaged,” meaning most buildings are uninhabitable. A further 23 districts are “moderately damaged,” meaning up to half of the buildings have been destroyed or are structurally unsound, and 16 districts are “lightly damaged”. While UN satellite analysis suggests about 10,000 buildings have been severely damaged or completely destroyed, the real level of destruction is believed to be higher. Taking into account damage to multiple floors of buildings, not seen via satellites, the UN now estimates the real number of damaged buildings to be more than three times greater - about 32,000. Lise Grande, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, says it will take years for affected areas to return to normal. Reconstructing the city and returning civilians to their homes will be ""extremely challenging"", she has warned, costing an estimated $1bn (£760m). Before the offensive, many public buildings were damaged - including al-Ghazlani military camp, Mosul Airport and the city's university. Strategic targets, such as roads and factories, were hit during the first phase of the battle. All five bridges crossing the Tigris were hit. Just under half the damaged buildings were homes. In the three months from March to June this year, the number of buildings damaged nearly quadrupled - from 1,240 to 4,356. Seven in 10 of these were people’s homes. In the final weeks of battle, more than 5,000 sites were destroyed. About 98% of these were residential buildings - largely in the Old City. The iconic Great Mosque of al-Nuri was also destroyed. Source: UN Habitat The UN's initial satellite analysis suggests housing has been the most heavily hit, with at least 8,500 residential buildings severely damaged or completely destroyed, most of them in the Old City. This figure is sure to increase when comprehensive damage assessments are conducted on the ground. About 130km of roads have also been damaged overall - 100km of those are in the west. Coalition air strikes also destroyed all bridges linking the east and west of the city across the Tigris river, with the aim of limiting the jihadists' ability to resupply or reinforce their positions in the east. The city’s airport, railway station and hospital buildings are also in ruins. Iraqi officials estimate that nearly 80% of Mosul’s main medical hub has been destroyed. The area was the largest health facility in the Nineveh governorate, housing several hospitals, a medical school and laboratories. Source: UN Habitat In the last weeks of the battle to liberate the city from IS, the Old City in particular was hit hard. IS forces were pushed back into the densely built-up area after being encircled by pro-Iraqi government forces. As the battle raged, many of the area’s residents became trapped inside their homes. When they were finally able to emerge, many were malnourished, injured and traumatised. Amira, aged 10, was among them. After mortar fire hit her house, injuring her legs and killing her mother, she was left alone. “I kept on calling out for my mother, shouting for her to help me, but she never answered me… I could not move.” With her father gone, trying to escape with her sisters and younger brother, Amira remained where she fell for three days. “I had no food or water,” she said. “All three days and nights I was alone, shouting to anyone, but no-one heard me. ‘Mama’ I kept on calling, but no answer. I didn’t know she was dead until they rescued me.” Now receiving treatment for her injuries, she doesn’t yet know what has happened to her father and other siblings. But Amira and her family are not alone. Satellite imagery suggests that more than 5,500 of the 16,000 residential buildings in the Old City - about one in three - have been severely damaged or completely destroyed. An estimated 490 homes were destroyed in the final weeks of the offensive. The real figures, again, are likely to be higher. Source: Data from UN Habitat, image from Planet Among the city’s iconic buildings to be destroyed was the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where in July 2014 IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance following an IS declaration of its “caliphate”. The mosque was Mosul's most famous landmark It was blown up by IS in June 2017, according to Iraqi forces. IS claimed the mosque was destroyed in a US air raid, but there was no evidence of this. The mosque’s leaning 12th Century al-Hadba minaret, one of the Old City’s most famous landmarks, had survived more than eight centuries of invasion and conquest. It finally succumbed on 22 June 2017. But it is Mosul’s people who have suffered the greatest tragedy. It is not yet known how many have been killed. The last UN estimate in January put the figure at 2,463, but since then Amnesty International has said 5,805 have been killed by air strikes alone. Meanwhile, a Kurdish intelligence report revealed to the Independent newspaper claims as many as40,000 have lost their lives. But with bodies still being recovered, the full death toll may not be known for some time. In addition, one million civilians have left the city - about half the pre-war population - since the beginning of the Mosul offensive last October, according to UN estimates. More than half are children and about 700,000 are from western Mosul, the area worst affected by the battle. It has been the largest managed evacuation in modern history. By the beginning of August,more than 800,000 were still regarded as displacedby the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than half of those housed in camps or emergency sites. Others have returned to the city, are renting elsewhere, staying with friends or families or living in war-damaged buildings. Source: International Organization for Migration The most significant exodus from the city was during the last months of the offensive. In the eight months from mid-October last year to the middle of June, 7,000 families fled their homes in Mosul, according to IOM figures. In the month following, that figure grew to more than 125,000 families - equivalent to a city the size of San Francisco. The number now stands at almost 140,000. However, the recent large rise is, in part, down to the IOM merging its figures with those from local groups after the city became safer to enter. While many have fled Mosul’s boundaries, most people whose homes have been destroyed haven’t actually left the city. More than 100,000 families remain displaced within Mosul itself. The population of the east of the city has doubled, according to UN partner organisations, with families from western Mosul choosing to move in with relatives or friends in the east, rather than move to displacement camps. Among those to make this move was Jumana Najim Abdullah, a 35-year-old hairdresser, who fled the fighting in the west to stay with family in the east. Jumana, a divorced mother, was banned from practicing her trade under IS rule, but managed to earn some money by cutting the hair of known and trusted clients within the safety of their homes. Now, with the militants gone, she has moved into a rented apartment and started her own business, Jumana Salon. “I was the first person to open”, she says. “I felt very proud. People warned me it could be dangerous and said I might face consequences, but luckily I had no problems.” And, she says, with her daughter now back in school, she intends to stay put in the east of the city. “Even though this is not my original home, I will stay here now,” she says. “Our former house in west Mosul is destroyed.” Unlike Jumana, many families chose to flee the city entirely to escape the fighting. Of those families who left, nearly 3,000 have headed for the capital, Baghdad. Irbil, an-hour-and-a-half drive to the east of Mosul, is host to 2,000 displaced families, while a further 1,000 have headed south to the Salah al-Din district, a shorter journey than to Baghdad. Source: UNHCR When the offensive to recapture Mosul began in October, IS still controlled large swathes of northern Iraq, so those who managed to flee during the early parts of the battle headed far south. As the Iraqi army closed in on the Old City, it became safer for families to resettle in nearby towns, such as Irbil, and the southern suburbs of Mosul. The full scale of the damage became clear in July when the city was recaptured. 126,000 families had been displaced over the nine month conflict. About five in six remain in Mosul or its surrounding towns. Now the city has been retaken, Iraqi government officials and their partners are turning their attention to getting the once bustling metropolis up and running again. But the challenge is immense - especially in the west. While rebuilding is likely to take years and billions of dollars, the Iraqi authorities are, for now, focussing on making the city safe enough for residents to go back. That means removing bodies, eliminating IS sleeper cells, criminal gangs and militias, reinstating essential services and clearing explosive devices. Months of heavy combat and air strikes have littered the city with unexploded ordnance, including artillery shells and hand grenades. Large sections of Mosul have also reportedly been mined and booby-trapped by militants. Since clearing operations began last October, about 1,700 people have been killed or injured by such explosives, according to the UN’s Mines Action Service, which co-ordinates the mission to remove them. Nina Seecharan, Iraq director for the British charity Mines Advisory Group (MAG), said in a statement in July that the organisation had not seen landmines used on this scale in 20 years. In three weeks in just one village east of Mosul, MAG cleared 250 improvised landmines. Most were powerful enough to rip apart a car, but sensitive enough to be triggered by a child’s footstep. A team from the IOM, the UN Migration Agency, visiting Mosul’s now-destroyed medical city, said explosive devices littered hospital floors, while several cars containing undetonated bombs remained parked outside. But, many point out, that it is not just Mosul’s physical needs that need addressing. The city is majority Sunni and, with a Shia-led government in Baghdad with a reputation of favouring its own sectarian interests, there will be issues of trust, accountability and inclusiveness to tackle while rebuilding takes place. The fear of retributive acts is preventing people from returning home to restart their lives, say agencies working on the ground. And the absence of such a “meaningful political dialogue” could lead to new violence, UN special representative Jan Kubis warned when speaking to the UN Security Council last month. ""To turn the gains of the military victory into stability, security, justice and development, the government will have to do everything possible to give the people back their lives in society and dignity."" There are small signs that people are starting to come together to get the city up and running again. Projects to get hospitals and schools open quickly, backed by the UN Development Programme, are employing residents to help clear the rubble and clean buildings ready for re-use. Ibrahim Mustafa, who has been helping to clean a roundabout near the al-Zuhur neighborhood, believes this could be the city’s salvation. “Here in Mosul, everything is gone - our jobs, our homes, our livelihoods - but we still have our souls. All our neighbours help each other. Rebuilding our city is one way to do that.” Design by Joy Roxas, development by Rosie Gollancz. Uncredited imagery of Mosul devastation by Getty.

Why Amazon's UK tax bill has dropped 50%,"Amazon has seen a 50% fall in the amount of UK corporation tax it paid last year, while recording a 54% increase in turnover for the same period. This snippet of news raised eyebrows this morning when it was revealed. So what's going on? The answer is simple on the face of it. Taxes are paid on profit not turnover. It paid lower taxes because it made lower profits. Last year it made Â£48m in profit - this year it made only Â£24m so it paid Â£7m tax compared to Â£15m. What is more interesting is WHY its profits were lower. Part of the reason is the way it pays its staff. Amazon UK Services is the division which runs the fulfilment centres which process, package and post deliveries to UK customers. It employs about 16,000 of the 24,000 people Amazon have in the UK. Each full-time employee gets given at least Â£1,000 worth of shares every year. They can't cash them in immediately - they have to hold them for a period of between one and three years. If Amazon's share price goes up in that time, those shares are worth more. Amazon's share price has indeed gone up over the past couple of years - a lot. In fact, in the past two years the share price has nearly doubled, so Â£1,000 in shares granted in August 2015 are now worth nearly Â£2,000. Staff compensation goes up, compensation is an expense, expenses can be deducted from revenue - so profits are lower and so are the taxes on those profits. But surely this extra income for the staff is taxed? Probably not. HMRC rules allow employees to receive Â£3,600 worth of shares from their employer tax free every year. Most of these awards are below that threshold. The employee wins through a tax-free windfall, Amazon wins because it hasn't got to pay any cash out, which leaves HMRC as the big loser. This is not just allowed by UK tax law - it is required by it. So, weirdly, the more valuable Amazon becomes, the less tax this particular bit of its business pays. There is heightened sensitivity around the tax affairs of technology giants such as Amazon, Google and Apple. The challenge of adapting a tax code written for a bygone era to work effectively on technology multinationals who have socked billions away in low tax jurisdictions remains. But the practice of giving staff shares is widespread, generally seen as a good way to promote loyalty and engagement - and is 100% legal.

Facebook Watch and TV's reinvention,"Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg: transferring more power to users Ok, perhaps today is the day that Mark Zuckerberg finally abandons the pretence that Facebook isn't a media company. It was a year ago that, on a visit to Rome to see the Pope, he said""We are a tech company, not a media company"".,external Then, in December, he appearedto soften his language,external, saying ""It's not a traditional media company. You know, we build technology and we feel responsible for how it's used."" In a blog postin December I argued that Zuckerberg's firm was indeed a media company, because it is funded by advertising, creates vast amounts of stories (or content), and is the main source of news for millions - if not billions - around the world. Today, with the launch of Facebook Watch, a video service that will incentivise the creation of a new industry in original programming, the tech giant is moving into broadcasting in a big way. Facebook: Users will soon see a new Watch tab that will offer a range of shows It is becoming a destination for viewers of programmes. That, of course, makes it a media company; but qualifying for that label isn't a matter for pedants alone. This is about more than semantics: it's about Facebook's ambition, social obligations, and the future of media itself. It is actually quite hard to fathom the financial power of Facebook today. Despite warnings last year about a limit to how many ads users will tolerate on their news feed, the company is able to charge brands ever more for the privilege of appearing there. Its market capitalisation now nudges $500bn; advertising revenues are up 47%; and earnings by GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) have hit $4bn - growing by a scarcely comprehensible 70% in a year, from a very strong base. Mix that kind of growth and wealth with the Silicon Valley mindset - ""move fast and break things"" - and you get a sense of why Facebook has decided to move into original programming, giving the makers of videos that appear on its platform a juicy 55% of ad revenues - for now at least. This is all about making the Facebook experience ever more sticky: making users want to spend more and more, and more and more time within the walled garden - or echo chamber or filter bubble if you will - of the social network. With more than two billion users now, Facebook wants to do ever more to retain the interest of those logged on. High quality videos will do that, as will the company's eventual move into live sports, which has long been rumoured, but is yet to materialise. Power brings responsibility, and there have been times when Facebook has seemed uncomfortable with its social obligations. For instance, on the issue of fake news, despite hiring thousands of new moderators, the company is determined not to be an arbiter of what is true or false, preferring its community of users to make such judgements - or outsourcing them to fact-checkers. At base, firms such as Facebook and Google are just ad companies. New ones, of course; unusually technical, too; and astonishingly powerful - but ultimately, they are companies who sell a product to advertisers. That product is our personal data. Just as it is hard to fathom the financial firepower of some of these Silicon Valley firms, so it is hard to grasp the amount of personal data they now control. This data is vulnerable, because lots of people (including foreign powers and cyber-criminals) may want it; valuable, as these companies' wealth proves; and often handed over by people who are not fully clear about what they are doing. Two excellent recent articles show that the social obligations created by Facebook's possession of this personal data are now receiving the kind of scrutiny and debate they deserve. The Financial Times' John Thornhill has argued that this data is akin to the oil in Alaska, which was used to fund a version of the universal basic income idea (UBI) that has gained traction in recent years, as a way of addressing the rapidly diminishing share of wealth making it to the labour force in advanced economies. Thornhill suggests Facebook should use its wealthto fund a UBI experiment.,external Meanwhile, in his latest brilliant piece for The London Review of Books, John Lanchester explains howFacebook has made products of us all.,external ""Facebook is in essence an advertising company which is indifferent to the content on its site except insofar as it helps to target and sell advertisements"", Lanchester argues - though Facebook would deny the charge of being indifferent. He goes on: ""For all the talk about connecting people, building community, and believing in people, Facebook is an advertising company."" Indeed it is. And now that it is selling adverts in programmes that will be broadcast through its platform, via Facebook Watch, an interesting question arises. Should such shows be regulated by Ofcom? If not, why not? Yes, the likes of Facebook are a new kind of media company. But we must believe that broadcasters have a social responsibility, because we have a regulator for them; and perhaps, if the broadcasts are taking place in the UK, the platform on which they appear, and the provenance of that platform, is secondary to the content. Across media, power is shifting to audiences. The idea of editors determining what you can read, or commissioners determining what you watch, is weakening. Schedules are becoming obsolete, albeit slowly. Facebook Watch will accelerate this trend. With a user base massively bigger than YouTube and Netflix combined, the social interactions you conduct when logged onto Facebook - meticulously recorded by the social network's algorithms, of course - will now help drive the promotion and distribution of content. How this works for users is impossible to know just now, of course. It could mean that we lose the serendipity of switching on and seeing what's occurring. But the loss in serendipity is, for most users under 35 at least, easily outweighed by the gain in being able to see what you want, where you want, when you want. Convenience is king, and Facebook is making it more convenient to enjoy viewing experiences without leaving its platform. Zuckerberg would justifiably argue this is a way of transferring more power to his users. Lanchester is right: you are the product. With Facebook Watch, you are the programmers, too.

Premier League at 25: Ruling the world - 2007-2012," The Premier League is 25 years old on 15 August 2017. To mark the anniversary, BBC Sport has produced five pieces, each covering a five-year period in the competition's history. This is the fourth piece, focusing on the span from 2007-08 to the end of the 2011-12 campaign. Scroll down for written insight, a visual timeline, Mark Lawrenson's team of the era, a tailored tactics board and tables, before testing yourself with our Merlin sticker quiz. Fifteen years into its existence, life appeared to be accelerating for the Premier League: more money from more television deals; bigger stadiums and a vastly larger global audience; club owners showing less patience with their managers, supporters showing less patience with their club’s owners. A year after winning consecutive titles with Chelsea, a few months after beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final, Jose Mourinho was gone from Stamford Bridge. His rehabilitation would not take long; at Inter Milan, he would win both Serie A and the Champions League. The club he left behind would get through another three managers in two years before finding their own way back to the title. This was an era when, having conquered the sport’s commercial markets, Premier League teams would go tilting at the continent’s big trophies too. A run of seven years out of eight with an English team in the final of the Champions League included the appearance of both champions (Manchester United) and runners-up (Chelsea) in the final of 2008, John Terry’s penalty slip giving United their second European Cup under Alex Ferguson. Barcelona’s peerless tiki-taka would deny them two more over the next three years. The balance of power could change quickly. On the last day of the 2007-08 season, Manchester City lost 8-1 at Middlesbrough. On 1 September, taken over by the Abu Dhabi Group, they were instantly the richest club in England. The noisy neighbours had arrived, flaunting their wealth with the £32.4m signing of Robinho and a billboard featuring former United star Carlos Tevez and the slogan ‘Welcome to Manchester’ on the city centre’s Deansgate. Rolando Bianchi and Gelson Fernandes would not be long for the Etihad. As a sign of the way the future fortunes of the respective sides, Manchester City beat Portsmouth 6-0 on 21 September 2008 With the wealth of the big boys at the top of the table it was a contest between the haves and the have mores. Elsewhere the football and the finances were not adding up in the same happy way. Portsmouth, big spenders, FA Cup winners, went into administration in 2010 with debts of £60m and would fall all the way to League Two. Derby were relegated in 2008 with a record low of 11 points. While Ferguson fought on at United, seemingly reinvigorated by City’s fresh challenge, the other old stagers lost their touch and began to be moved on. Sven-Goran Eriksson, supposedly lined up as Ferguson’s successor when retirement had been mooted a few years before, instead came in at City and was then usurped himself by the younger charms of Mark Hughes and then Roberto Mancini. Kevin Keegan’s second spell at Newcastle ended just the way all had feared. Paul Ince, Roy Keane and Tony Adams, all playing stars of the Premier League’s first burst, found managerial posts harder to hang on to. You couldn’t fault the entertainment. Before disappearing down the leagues, Portsmouth beat Reading 7-4. Sunderland beat Liverpool with the help of a beach ball and a confused referee. When Chelsea, having experimented with Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Guus Hiddink, finally settled on Carlo Ancelotti, they won the Double in 2010 by scoring a record-breaking average of 2.71 goals a game. Didier Drogba powered in 29, Frank Lampard contributing 22 from midfield on his way to becoming the club’s all-time top scorer. His team scored seven or more goals in four Premier League matches. Clearly in need of goals, they then spent £50m to bring Fernando Torres from Liverpool, just as the Spanish striker went from unstoppable to unrecognisable. Flush with funds, Liverpool then spent 50% more on Andy Carroll than they had on Luis Suarez earlier on the same day. Neither Torres nor Carroll would score for three months, which was one of the reasons Ancelotti found himself sacked having taken Chelsea to first and second place in his only two seasons there. He also left with the third best win-loss record in the league’s history, a one-two-three made easier to bear by the £6m severance payment he received. More money, less patience. Totems kept toppling. Newcastle United were the next great old club to be relegated – just months before the football world mourned the loss of their former manager and servant of England Sir Bobby Robson. Technology kept moving the game along, match reports being challenged by live text commentaries and then social media, even if not everything stuck - 3D filming arrived on Sky to a fanfare and slipped away to shrug. When Ferguson’s United won their 19th top-flight title in 2011 to surpass the mark of their traditional rivals Liverpool, their hegemony seemed safe. Liverpool had lost patience with their own Champions League winner Rafa Benitez. Chelsea kept hiring and firing, Andre Villas-Boas succeeding Ancelotti, Roberto di Matteo succeeding in Europe and then getting the heave-ho too. Chelsea's bosses between 2007-08 and 2011-12: (Right to left) Jose Mourinho, Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti, Andre Villas-Boas and Roberto di Matteo How rapidly it changed. In October 2011 United lost 6-1 at home to a rampant City. Losing again to Mancini’s men as the season reached its climax, this time by the far narrower margin of 1-0 but with just as much impact, they were still champions elect with 92 minutes gone on the season’s final day. Then came Edin Dzeko, and then came Sergio Aguero. In three added-on minutes, Premier League supremacy had shifted again. Everything in higher definition, everything speeding up. 20 September 2007:Jose Mourinho, who had guided Chelsea to two Premier League titles, two League Cups and an FA Cup triumph in three years, shocks football and resigns as manager after falling out with the club’s billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. 29 September 2007:Eleven goals, two of them scored by players into their own net and one of them a penalty, and a hat-trick for striker Benjani Mwaruwari. There would have been more but for David James saving Nicky Shorey’s penalty. Portsmouth 7-4 Reading remains the highest-scoring Premier League game. 29 March 2008:Derby County's relegation is confirmed when they can only manage a 2-2 draw at home to fellow Premier League strugglers Fulham - the earliest relegation to be confirmed in all 25 seasons of the Premier League to date. They finish the season on 11 points - a record low. 1 September 2008:Manchester City are taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group to become the richest club in England overnight and change the Premier League landscape. They cap the most exciting of transfer deadline days by paying a record £32.4m for Real Madrid and Brazil striker Robinho. 1 July 2009:After helping Manchester United win a hat-trick of Premier League titles and the Champions League between 2006 and 2009, scoring 118 in 292 appearances, Cristiano Ronaldo moves to Real Madrid for a world record fee of £80m. 26 December 2008:With his team 4-0 down, Hull manager Phil Brown decides to give his half-time team-talk to his players on the pitch at Manchester City. Hull end up losing 5-1. The following season, Hull midfielder Jimmy Bullard replicates the team-talk as a celebration after scoring to earn a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium. 18 July 2009:Manchester City taunt rivals United with a city-centre billboard “welcoming” Carlos Tevez to the city after he signs for them following his rejection of the chance to extend his two-year stay at Old Trafford. 17 October 2009:The strangest assist in Premier League history. Sunderland beat Liverpool 1-0 at the Stadium of Light after Darren Bent's shot is deflected in to the net off a beachball that had been thrown on by a fan. The goal should have been ruled out and a drop ball awarded. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez leaves the club at the end of the season. 26 February 2010:After running up debts of £60m, Portsmouth go into administration - the first Premier League club to do so.

Reality Check: Are Trump's N Korea assumptions right?,"With the rhetoric reaching fever pitch over North Korea's nuclear missile programme, BBC Beijing correspondent John Sudworth turns to Twitter - where else? - to put US President Donald Trump's key messages to the test. Among the avalanche of tweets that have so far defined Mr Trump's presidency, one foreign policy issue stands out - North Korea. When ranking the number of mentions by country, North Korea (31) comes second only to Russia (90, although most Russia tweets relate to the US domestic political debate) and it beats China (27) into a close third place. With the president now warning of ""fire and fury"", we thought it was time for a Reality Check on this constant and evolving insight into his thinking. What does his Twitter feed@realDonaldTrump,externaltell us about the assumptions and beliefs behind his approach to one of the most pressing security issues of our time? So we're training our reality radar on four of his key North Korea messages since being elected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On 5 August 2017, President Trump declared the UN had agreed a sanctions package that would cost North Korea $1bn. Thislatest set of sanctions,external, agreed unanimously by the UN Security Council, was heralded by Mr Trump as a diplomatic victory - the culmination of months of work to try to get China on side. There is no doubt that the measures are considerably tougher. They include, for example, the removal of the civilian ""livelihood"" exemption in theprevious sanctions package,externalthat allowed North Korea and China to continue trading coal and iron ore in large volumes. But $1bn of difference? Although the figure was supported by at least two other Security Council members (France and Japan,external), as always the extent of the economic pain inflicted will depend entirely on the willingness of China, North Korea's biggest trading partner, to enforce the new sanctions. Reality Check Verdict:Close enough. The $1bn figure is a best-case scenario, for President Trump, but the sanctions do represent a significant shift, on paper at least. Allow Twitter content?

Since his inauguration, President Trump's tweets on China's performance regarding North Korea have veered from high optimism to angry pessimism, and back again. In July 2017, his frustration was front and centre as he tweeted: ""Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!"" This goes right to the nub of the issue of China's enforcement of sanctions. There are some signs that China is beginning to bow to pressure when it comes to general trade, such as commodities. Earlier this year, it did finally stop buying North Korean coal, a major source of foreign currency for Pyongyang, and for the first half of this year, China said itstotal imports of all goods fell by 13.2%,external, as reported in the Chinese state newspaper the Global Times. But North Korea is still a long way from being squeezed until its pips squeak. Mr Trump was (almost) right about the 40% increase in total two-way trade with China in the first quarter. The actual figure, according to the Global Times, was37.4%,external, although it added that this figure bucked an overall downward trend since 2014, and by May the increase for 2017 so far had dropped to 13.7%. But the same state media editorial makes it clear that pushing Pyongyang to the limit is ""not what the UN resolutions are intended to do, nor what the Chinese public wants"". President Trump's statements that China could do more are backed up by the views of many other observers. A2017 UN report,externallinked North Korean rocket components to Chinese companies. There are other credible claims, includingone by C4ADS,external, about the continuing transfer of technology via China. Reality Check Verdict:Spot on. China's stated priority is stability in North Korea, not regime collapse. It is never going to push its old ally too hard. Mr Trump's suspicious barbs are justified. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump's tweet in April that if China ""want to solve the North Korean problem, they will"" is another aspect of his thinking/tweeting that needs testing - his basic premise that, if properly applied, economic pressure might persuade North Korea to give up its weapons programme. Going by North Korea's own words, this seems unlikely. Pyongyang makes it clear via itsstate news agency KCNA,externalthat it sees nuclear weapons as an issue of regime survival. It has learned lessons from the toppling of Saddam Hussein in the non-nuclear armed Iraq, and of Col Muammar Gaddafi after he had given up his weapons programmes in Libya. And it has shown it is nothing if not resilient, enduring a devastating famine during the 1990s throughout which it continued developing its missiles and rockets. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of North Koreans died of famine in the 1990s, but the country's missile programmes continued The more that sanctions can be made to push North Korea to the brink, and the more alarming and believable the hints of regime change from Washington, the more compelling becomes the logic of a credible nuclear deterrent by which to gain strategic leverage. Reality Check Verdict:Wide of the mark. While sanctions may delay and frustrate North Korea's attempts to gain nuclear-tipped missiles, they are unlikely on their own to stop them.

Mr Trump's first tweet about North Korea after his election in November last year set it out as his key foreign policy priority. After North Korea said, in January, that it had successfully miniaturised nuclear warheads that could reach the US, he said ""it won't happen"". It goes hand in hand with his claim that, in the mission to disarm North Korea, his administration will succeed where his predecessors have failed. What is certainly the case is that North Korea's decades-old nuclear weapons programme has been significantly ramped up under Kim Jong-un and is now at a critical phase. North Korea's Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, which many believe could travel as far as the US It has startled experts with the speed of its progress, with many now saying it has recently proved it has long-range missiles capable of reaching major US cities. According to information leaked to theWashington Post,external, US intelligence officials now believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. Japan's defence ministry has also recently stated this is a possibility. And the varied geographical spread of its test firings has also led to concerns. TheNuclear Threat Initiative,externalhas analysed the locations of the tests, and says they could indicate that North Korea is now working in earnest towards rolling out its weapons to missile units around the country in preparation to deploy them. The stakes couldn't be higher, and yet the messages coming from the Trump administration are confusingly mixed. Just a week before Mr Trump spoke of""fire and fury""his Secretary of State,Rex Tillerson, told a press conference:""We're trying to convey to the North Koreans, 'We are not your enemy, we are not your threat.'"" Mr Tillerson has also been suggesting that the door to dialogue with North Korea might have been left open a crack. That latter road, of course, would lead to the same set of imperfect choices that has bedevilled every US president since the first George Bush. In the end, all administrations have had to deal with the realities as they find them - a reluctant China, a determined and resilient North Korea and the incalculable cost in human life of any kind of military solution. Many seasoned North Korean observers are hoping that Mr Trump too comes to realise that the reason his predecessors have failed is precisely because there are no easy solutions. Reality Check Verdict:Failed. As for not allowing a nuclear North Korea on his watch, our radar detects that for this particular Trump tweet, it is already too late.

Can ice cream vans stage a comeback?,"Ed Whitby's vans sell ice cream in 60 countries For many of us, the distinctive chimes of an ice cream van conjure up happy childhood memories of British summers and dripping ice lollies. But the number of ice cream vans has been falling for years, leading some to believe that those bells may mean nothing to future generations of children. A crop of small, family-run businesses is determined to keep the industry alive however. These ice cream entrepreneurs have found business models that enable them to thrive in a market dominated by large retailers. And some have even dipped their toes in the export market. One such success story is Londoner John Bonar, 53, who started selling ice cream when he was just 11. Making the most of the sun in St James's Park, Central London ""We would get on a lorry in the East End, fill barrows full of ice cream, get dropped off around Hyde Park or Madame Tussauds and just sell ice cream,"" he tells me. He launched his own business at the age of 21, selling ice cream from a van with a hole in the floor and windscreen wipers that didn't work. Today his firm Piccadilly Whip operates 20 ice cream vans in London and Essex, and has fixed stands at Tower Bridge. Despite these achievements, Mr Bonar says that conditions have got much tougher for ice cream vans since they first became popular in the UK in the 1950s. ""When I was a kid, there was four or five ice cream vans who would come round our streets and they would all earn a living. An ice cream van keeps selling despite the rain on Clapham Common, South London ""But there are less and less over the years, because people can buy ice cream cheaply in supermarkets and everybody has got a freezer in their house."" Britain's ice cream market is worth about Â£1bn each year, according to trade group the Ice Cream Alliance, but there is no concrete data on the number of ice cream vans in operation. The Guardian, however, estimated,externalthat there were 2,500 vans on UK roads in 2013, when falling numbers ledThe Sunday People,externalto launch a campaign to save the industry. Changing tastes may have led to less work for vans on the streets, but there has been a rise in opportunities at festivals, weddings and corporate events. The standard price for a ""99"" cone with a flake is Â£1.50, although it can be higher at events This has become a key source of revenue for Piccadilly Whip, whose vans will sometimes be at seven events at the same time. Piccadilly Whip's vans are made byWhitby Morrison,external, a Crewe-based firm employing 50 staff, fronted by operations director Ed Whitby. His grandfather Bryan started the business in 1962, taking on vehicle conversions that ""everyone else said were impossible"" and succeeding, Ed says with pride. The firm became the ""market leader"" in the 1980s after its main competitor went bust, and today sells around 100 new vans each year, exporting about 20% of them. Katy Alston, left, runs Pinks Vintage Ice Cream with her daughter Georgia Its vans sell ice cream in more than 60 countries, including Kazakhstan, Malawi and Guyana - although despite its global ambitions, Whitby Morrison still prides itself on its local roots. ""We look to take people on from school, put them through their apprenticeships, suffer all the girlfriend problems, the first mortgage, the first child,"" Mr Whitby says over the phone. ""We're founded on real family values."" More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at quirky or unusual business topics from around the world: The businesses capitalising on 24-hour sunlight Do you have to avoid huggers at work? The homeowners hiring out their houses as film sets Is humour the way to keep an office happy? Putting the fun back into dance classes Mobile ice cream vans have not always had a good reputation, with some arguing that they promote obesity and create pollution. Glasgow's ""Ice Cream Wars,external"" of the early 1980s, in which rival gangs sold drugs and stolen goods from ice cream vans, didn't help either. Katy Alston, the founder of Pinks Vintage Ice Cream, adds that a high level of competition has made it a tough market for newcomers. ""When I started 15 years ago, there were a couple of other ice cream van operators who didn't seem to be particularly fond of someone new, someone who was female."" She struggled as a result and ""had to become stronger"", but says that operators like herself have become a modernising force in the industry. Natasha Laws launched Ice Baby 11 years ago Mrs Alston launched her business after her husband gave her an ice cream van as a surprise present - although at first she was disappointed by the gift. ""People see the vans now and they think 'oh you were so lucky, they're lovely', but that first van was an absolute heap."" Pinks Vintage Ice Cream, based in Bognor Regis, has since grown to two vans and a vintage-style ice cream tricycle. Mrs Alston's daughter Georgia has also dropped out of university to join the business, despite her mother's initial reservations. ""I had to do a whole business plan, it was 20 pages long. It was like Dragons' Den but to your mum,"" Georgia says. For the last 11 years, Natasha Laws has been serving ice cream at events around Hertfordshire from her vanIce Baby,external, named after the rap song by Vanilla Ice. However, her route into the industry owes something to luck. She had been prepared to pay Â£1,000 for the van on eBay, but someone outbid her. However, with encouragement from a colleague she put on a Â£1,050 bid at the last moment and won the auction. Like Mrs Alston, the 42-year-old faced some intimidation from old-school Mr Whippy men when she first started. But she has gone on to build a thriving business, partly by using social media to publicise Ice Baby. She has some 26,000 followers on Instagram where she posts pictures of her ice creams. These days nostalgia is an important trend in the industry, and Ice Baby and Pinks Vintage both see it as a crucial part of their brands. But will nostalgia be enough to provide a secure future for mobile ice cream sellers on our streets? Mrs Alston is optimistic: ""I think there is a future for mobile ice cream vans. Direct contact with the community is really important."" Mr Bonar agrees. ""It's a British institution and our vans are the best in the world. They'll always have a place.""

Three jailed for 'dirty look' killing,"(l-r) Mukeh Kawa, Donald Davies and Ali Tas were all given jail terms Three men have been jailed for stabbing a student to death near Wembley Stadium over a row about a dirty look. Djodjo Nsaka collapsed outside his halls of residence in north-west London after being attacked on 20 January. Donald Davies and Mukeh Kawa, both 21 from Colindale, were found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey and jailed for life with a minimum of 26 years. Ali Tas, 21, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison. Tas, also from Colindale, was cleared of murder. Djodjo Nsaka was a student at Middlesex University Mr Nsaka had returned home with two friends after a night out when they were set upon by Kawa, Davies and Tas. The jury heard the students were attacked after they had earlier asked a female friend of Kawa's why he had given them a ""screw-face"" expression when they saw him at Middlesex University on 18 January. After one of them told her that Kawa should ""be humble"", she said she would pass on the message - and the defendants later wentin search of the three students. ""It had gone from pulling a face to 'I am going to kill him, bring him outside', within the course of a day,"" prosecutor William Boyce QC told the court. Mr Nsaka's friends were able to flee when the group were attacked but the father of one was stabbed in the heart and died in the street. In an impact statement, Mr Nsaka's father said the 19-year-old's death had ""left an enormous void in our lives"". ""Every day I get up with a heavy heart and look into the faces of my wife and children and watch as they struggle to get through life without their beloved Djodjo,"" Tuna Nsaka said.

Rogue Dickens apostrophe costs council,"The BBC understands the rogue apostrophe came at a cost of about Â£1,200 A Northern Ireland council has made an apostrophe gaffe costing the taxpayer more than Â£1,000. Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council's grammatical error appeared on an advert for a performance of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations in July.. The council chose to reprint its promotional material at a cost, the BBC understands, of about Â£1,200. A spokesperson said it was the right thing to do as the event was a celebration of a ""literary giant"". Tesco said it would brush up on its spelling and grammar after making two mistakes in a single pack of baby clothes last year ""To promote our outdoor theatre production of 'Great Expectations' by Charles Dickens, we produced a variety of advertising and publicity materials to maximise public awareness of this exciting free event,"" they continued. ""Unfortunately, due simply to human error, a misplaced apostrophe was not picked up."" Some Â£140 was spent on correcting 48 sheets, Â£95 on delivering additional leaflets, Â£295 on reprinting advertising boards, Â£332 on flyers and posters and Â£290 on a window vinyl. Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council is by no means alone in falling into the rogue apostrophe trap. In February last year, Tesco apologised after makingtwo grammatical gaffes in one two-pack of baby clothing. And in April, the BBC reported on aself-proclaimed ""grammar vigilante""in Bristol who goes out at night correcting street signs and shop fronts which display misplaced apostrophes.

Housing market lull 'spreads from London',"A slowdown in the housing market is spreading from London to other parts of the South East of England, surveyors suggest. While the region is pulling down activity and average price growth in the UK, other areas saw price rises. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said Northern Ireland, the West Midlands and the South West of England posted increases in July. Overall, 1% more UK surveyors reported prices rising rather than falling. House prices remained ""quite firmly on an upward trend"" in some areas, RICS said. But the balance of UK surveyors reporting price rises in July was down from 7% in June, partly owing to more surveyors in the South East reporting house price falls than the number reporting increases - a welcome move for many potential first-time buyers struggling to buy in this area. The most expensive homes are particularly likely to have seen cuts in the asking price before being sold. The July survey also found that, over the previous two months, there had been a particular gap between the original asking price and the agreed selling price for these homes. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said: ""Sales activity in the housing market has been slipping in the recent months and the most worrying aspect of the latest survey is the suggestion that this could continue for some time to come. ""One reason for this is the recent series of tax changes but this is only part of the story. Lack of new build in the wake of the financial crisis is a more fundamental factor weighing on the market. And there are some very real consequences for the economy from all of this including the impact on the ability of people to be mobile when looking for work."" The regional disparities are evident from estate agents asked for their views in the RICS survey. In the South West, James McKillop, of Knight Frank, said: ""Some minor price reductions have triggered a good level of viewings and offers with an increasing number of deals as a result."" Many still point to a lack of supply as maintaining house price growth. In the South and South East one estate agent said ""real change is in the air"" with many pointing to the questionable expectations of sellers. Anthony Webb, from Trenchard Arlidge in Surrey, said: ""Many asking prices are still at levels never seen and are too high."" Mark Everett, based in Epsom in Surrey, said: ""The market is desperately price sensitive and too much stock is unrealistically overpriced."" High-end estate agent Savills flagged a slowing residential market, despite reportinga rise in first-half profits.,external Separately, Savills updated the picture for commercial transactions in the UK, in which 78% of its business went to buyers from outside of the UK. Investors from overseas saw the UK as ""comparatively secure"", it said. However, it pointed to potential changes that could affect one of the major sources of overseas investment. ""Additional controls over the export of capital from China are likely to reduce current levels of international real estate investment from that region,"" it said.

Widow shocked over husband's 'avoidable' death,"Father-of-two Stefanos Vavalidis died after a private GP failed to monitor the effects of a prescribed drug Barbara Vavalidis had been planning a carefree retirement after decades of hard work and a busy family life. Instead she is mourning the loss of her partner of 45 years, the father of her two sons. Stefanos Vavalidis died in London in January 2016, aged 69. He had fallen ill while on holiday abroad in May 2015, and spent the last eight months of his life in hospital. His widow is suing Dr Peter Wheeler, a private GP who was the family's trusted doctor for more than 30 years, alleging he was poisoned through negligence. Mrs Vavalidis's lawyer from Leigh Day solicitors said it was one of the worst cases he had known in more than 30 years. Dr Wheeler was the doctor of Diana, Princess of Wales, and was the man who identified her body after she died in a car crash 20 years ago. In his defence to Mrs Vavalidis's civil claim, due to be heard at the High Court next year, Dr Wheeler has admitted he was in breach of his duty by failing to properly monitor his patient by arranging the full blood tests, recommended in the standard medicines reference book for all doctors. BBC News has established that Dr Wheeler is under investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), which regulates the UK's doctors. And the Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is looking into a complaint received about the case. Mr Vavalidis' elder son Alex and widow Barbara want answers about his death Dr Wheeler continues to practise medicine at Sloane Street Surgery in west London without any conditions. An inquest last November found Mr Vavalidis died from liver failure and this was ""most probably associated with toxicity"" from methotrexate, a drug prescribed for his psoriasis. Mrs Vavalidis, 66, told me: ""My husband took methotrexate once a week without fail. But he suffered an almost insidious build-up of health problems like colds and poor sleep. ""That was the nature of being poisoned - drip by drip by drip - over this very long period. ""It's heartbreaking enough to lose your partner of 45 years - but a complete shock and horror when we found it had been totally avoidable. ""We would caution people to think carefully about their choices of medical care and who is giving it to them."" The family had to have Mr Vavalidis flown back by air ambulance from Greece to University College London Hospital in July 2015. They have praised his NHS care. Mrs Vavalidis added: ""He was a very intelligent person and had been a great reader. ""But by that time it was clear his brain function had slowed considerably."" She and her elder son Alex accused Dr Wheeler of ""arrogance, prolonged carelessness and negligence"". Alex, 32, said: ""The duty of a doctor is to protect patients from harm. That's not what we got. ""It begs the question of whether the regulators are doing their job. This was not just a one-off - it happened over a considerable period of time. ""That last period of his life was horrifying. We'd like to prevent this happening to other people."" The Medical Defence Union, which is representing Dr Wheeler, said he was unable to comment ""due to his duty of patient confidentiality and the ongoing legal proceedings"". Mr Vavalidis was first prescribed the drug by another doctor in 1999 and in 2003 Dr Wheeler took over prescribing it from him. Dr Wheeler states that Mr Vavalidis, who was obese and diabetic, would still have died of liver failure. But Dr Wheeler admits that if the full tests had been carried out, his patient could have lived up to two years longer. The papers also acknowledge that Dr Wheeler and the surgery did not have any system for flagging up the need for these regular tests. His defence states that Mr Vavalidis, who was a successful banker, had wanted to reduce the number of clinicians involved in his care ""given the nature of his professional lifestyle"". Dr Wheeler's defence states that when he took over prescribing the methotrexate, he was aware that Mr Vavalidis was established as stable on a dosage which was effective in controlling his psoriasis without side-effects. Leigh Day's head of clinical negligence, Russell Levy, told BBC News: ""I've been specialising in healthcare since 1985, and I'm clear that this is the worst case of repeated, persistent, negligent care that I've ever come across. ""This case also demonstrates the GMC should proceed much more quickly. ""It's quite wrong that 18 months after the death, the family still don't know whether any fitness to practise proceedings will be brought against Dr Wheeler."" Sloane Street Surgery was deemed to meet all five essential standards when it was last inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) four years ago. The CQC said: ""To date, we have not received direct notifications from the GMC, the practice, its patients, or others that give cause for concern about the safety and quality of care within the surgery as a whole. ""We have contacted the GMC regarding Dr Wheeler. ""Also, we have contacted the practice for assurance of how it monitors patients who are on high risk medication. ""We will ascertain whether the practice should have notified us of the unexpected death of the patient, in line with their duties as a regulated body.""

Race 'possible issue' in child sex abuse,"This video can not be played Operation Sanctuary: Newcastle community leaders react A fear of being called racist is preventing authorities investigating the reasons behind child abuse cases, an MP has claimed. Rotherham MP Sarah Champion was speaking after 17 men wereconvicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex. Mostly British-born, they are from Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish communities. Ms Champion said asking if there were ""cultural issues"" was simply ""child protection"". Northumbria Police said society ""can't be afraid to have this discussion"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme, Ms Champion, Labour's shadow women and equalities minister, said gang-related child sexual exploitation involves ""predominately Pakistani men"" who were involved in such cases ""time and time and time again"". MP Sarah Champion says it is not racist to ask questions about race ""The government aren't researching what is going on. Are these cultural issues? Is there some sort of message going out within the community?"" she said. Ms Champion said the ""far right"" would attack her comments for ""not doing enough"" and the ""floppy left"" would call her racist. ""This isn't racist, this is child protection,"" said the MP for Rotherham, whereat least 1,400 childrenwere found to have been exploited between 1997 and 2013. The issue was not being dealt with because ""people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse"", Ms Champion said. Mohammed Shafiq from the Ramadhan Foundation said the debate needed putting in context. ""Amongst these criminals there is a mindset that they think that white girls are worthless,"" he said. ""They don't have any regard for their standing within society and therefore they think they can be used and abused in that way. ""But the vast majority of child sex abuse carried out in this country is carried out by white men - through the home, through family networks and through the internet."" Chief Constable Steve Ashman said the police treated suspects ""without fear or favour"" Northumbria Police Chief Constable Steve Ashman said the force did not ask about religious background on arrest. As those arrested under Operation Sanctuary were from a number cultural backgrounds, ""who do I point that finger towards to say you have an issue here, culturally?"" he said. Some communities' attitude to ""women, principally white women"" needed addressing, he said. ""But the discussion has to take place beyond policing."" Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald said there had been a reluctance in the past to investigate gangs from some Asian communities targeting vulnerable white girls. ""Some recognition that this is a problem"" was needed, he said. All communities needed to address it, ""not pretending it's something else, not shying away from it, recognising it for what it is, which is profoundly racist crime"", he said.

"Eggs scandal: 700,000 distributed to UK","About 700,000 eggs have been sent to the UK from potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an early estimate of 21,000, the food watchdog has said. The Food Standards Agency (FSA)said,externalit was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health. However, 11 products containing egg - including sandwiches and salads - have been withdrawn from supermarkets. Dutch police have now arrested two people suspected of using the insecticide fipronil. The FSA said the 700,000 figure represented 0.007% of eggs eaten in the UK each year. What do we know about the Europe egg scare? It added that in the UK, the Dutch eggs were not sold as shell eggs but used in foods with many other ingredients - mostly sandwich fillings or other chilled foods. It said traces of fipronil - which can be harmful to humans - were mixed with other eggs so chemical residues would be ""highly diluted"". The British Egg Industry Council said shell eggs on sale to consumers in the UK were not affected. It said: ""All major UK retailers stock British Lion shell eggs and tests have shown that there is no risk from British eggs."" Sainsbury's ham and egg salad (240g) use by 9-14 August 2017 Sainsbury's potato and egg salad (300g) use by 9-14 August Morrisons potato and egg salad (250g) use by up to 13 August Morrisons egg and cress sandwich (sold in Morrisons Cafe only) use by up to and including 11 August Morrisons cafe sandwich selection (sold in Morrisons Cafe only) use by up to and including 11 August Waitrose free range egg mayonnaise deli filler (240g) use by 13 and 16 August Waitrose free range reduced fat egg mayonnaise deli filler (170g) use by 14 August Waitrose free range egg and bacon deli filler (170g) use by 14 and 16 August Asda baby potato and free range egg salad (270g) use by 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 August Asda spinach and free range egg snack pot (110g) use by 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 August Asda FTG ham and cheddar ploughman's salad bowl (320g) use by 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 August Source:FSA,external(10 August) Twenty tonnes of insecticide-tainted eggshave been sold in Denmark, the country's food safety authority says. Denmark is believed to be the tenth country to be affected, with Romania and Luxembourg among the latest to report finding contaminated products. Supermarkets in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany have withdrawn millions of eggs from sale. In the UK, processed foods containing eggs, including sandwiches and salads, have been recalled from Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda. The FSA initiallythought far fewer eggs- 21,000 - had been distributed to the UK from implicated farms between March and June this year. Prof Chris Elliott, of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen's University Belfast, said it was not surprising that the figure had increased by so much - and warned ""the scandal isn't over yet"". ""Often when these food scandals start to break, you start to get dribbles of information,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""And as the authorities in Belgium and Holland get more information they pass that onto our own Food Standards Agency. ""The potential is that number of 700,000 could increase quite a bit yet,"" he added. By James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Fipronil should not be allowed anywhere near food. But the risk from eggs is thought to be low, because the number of contaminated eggs is also low. While 700,000 eggs sounds like a lot, it is worth remembering we eat 34 million every single day in the UK. It is why the Food Standards Agency says it is ""very unlikely"" there is any health risk. Many of the affected eggs will have already passed through the food chain before anyone was aware of the scandal. And the FSA has now pulled egg sandwiches and egg salads off the shelves that were made while contaminated eggs were still being imported. It insisted there is ""no need"" for people to stop eating eggs. Fipronil, which is used to kill lice and ticks on animals, can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities. Heather Hancock, FSA chairwoman, said it was not ""something to worry about"" and that any health impact was unlikely. ""These aren't eggs that are in people's fridges in the UK, these are eggs that have gone into the food chain and the level of risk to public health is very low,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. This video can not be played How safe are Dutch eggs to eat? In an update on Thursday, the FSA said: ""Some of the products made from these eggs will have had a short shelf life and will have already been consumed, however, we identified some that were still within the expiry date."" The FSA said decision to withdraw the products was not due to food safety concerns but based on the fact that the pesticide is not authorised for use in food-producing animals. It added: ""While in some European countries eggs containing fipronil residues have been sold as fresh eggs, in the UK this is not the case."" Aldi and Lidl stores in Germany are among the supermarkets to remove eggs from their shelves, in a move Aldi described as ""purely precautionary"". Eggs sold in its UK stores were British, Aldi said. It follows a joint investigation by Dutch and Belgian police of several premises thought to be using the substance, which can harm humans and is banned in food production. The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world. The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when Aldi withdrew all its eggs from sale in Germany. It has since emerged Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public. More than 100 poultry farms have been closed during the investigation, and 26 suspects identified and evidence seized from their companies. It is thought that fipronil was added to disinfectant used on some chicken farms. The UK produces 85% of the eggs it consumes but imports almost two billion annually, the FSA said.

Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court,"Andrea Swift says her ""trust was shattered"" by the incident Taylor Swift's mum has given emotional testimony about the moment her daughter first told her she had been groped backstage at a concert. ""I went into the dressing room and I saw her face,"" Andrea Swift told jurors in Denver. ""I could see that there was something horribly wrong. ""She said, 'Mom, a guy just grabbed my ass,'"" she continued. ""I wanted to vomit and cry at the same time."" Swift is suing radio DJ David Mueller over the incident, which he denies. Taylor Swift 'certain' she was groped Taylor Swift trial: What you need to know The alleged assault occurred in 2013, during a Denver stopover on Taylor Swift's Red tour. Mueller, then a host on the top-rated radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet the star before the show. As they posed for a photo, Swift claims, ""he put his hand under my dress and grabbed my bare ass"". Taylor Swift (left) and her mother (second right) have been present throughout the trial Recalling the night, Andrea Swift said her daughter expressed bewilderment that she had ""thanked"" Mueller and his then-girlfriend after the incident. ""It was just destroying her that she said that,"" she testified. ""As a parent it made me question why I taught her to be so polite."" Wiping away tears, she added: ""She was really shaken. She was humiliated."" Andrea Swift, who is part of the star's management team, said she did not report the incident to police because: ""I did not want this event to define her life."" ""I did not want her to have to life through the endless memes and gifs that tabloid media and internet trolls decided to come up with - doctoring the picturesâ¦ and making her relive this awful moment over and over again."" Asked whether she had sought witnesses, Ms Swift - who was not present at the encounter - she said she had no reason to doubt her daughter. ""He sexually assaulted my daughter,"" claimed Andrea Swift in court, pointing her finger at the broadcaster. ""Right there, that guy,"" ""I heard it from my daughter's mouth. I know that it happened."" Fans have been turning out to support Swift during the trial Two days after the concert, Mueller lost his $150,000-a-year job at KYGO, after Swift's radio liaison [radio representative] Frank Bell alerted the station to the alleged assault. Taking the stand on Wednesday, Bell said he asked the broadcaster to investigate the encounter but had not requested that Mueller be fired. Following his dismissal, Mueller sued Swift for defamation, seeking $3m (Â£2.3 million) in damages. An eight-member jury, comprised of six women and two men, is weighing both claims in a single trial at the US District Court in Denver. Testimony began on Tuesday and is expected to last nine days. Mueller was the first to take the stand, describing his encounter with Swift as ""weird and awkward"". ""I know my hand was touching her rib or her skirt,"" he testified. ""And it went behind her, and her hand, or arm, went behind my arm."" Asked by his own lawyer whether he had grabbed Swift's bottom, Mueller said flatly, ""No, I did not."" Mueller, now 55, denies the accusations and is suing Swift for loss of earnings Concluding his testimony on Wednesday, he said:  ""I'm here to prove that I'm innocent. I had a good reputation in radio and I would like to get it back."" Swift's mother said the incident had ""absolutely shattered our trust"", and that the star now took many more precautions when meeting fans. ""Our meet-and-greets are much smaller,"" she said. ""We now have metal detectors. We wand people. We now do background checks. It scared us really badly."" The pop star, whose hits include Shake It Off, Love Story and I Knew You Were Trouble, has been present for every day of the trial. She listened closely and took notes during Mueller's testimony; and is expected to take the stand herself in the coming days.

Paying rapist informant 'was right',"Steve Ashman said the informant was a jumping off point for the investigation A police chief has said paying a child rapist Â£10,000 as part of an investigation into a grooming gang was the ""right thing"". Northumbria Police's Steve Ashman said the information provided by the man led to theconviction of 17 men and a womanfor abusing girls in Newcastle. Charities have criticised the force for paying the criminal. Mr Ashman told BBC News he was as ""certain as I can be"" that it was ""morally"" right. ""What we've ended up doing here is putting dangerous men behind bars and protecting vulnerable women and girls that we simply wouldn't have been able to do if we didn't have that jump off point we got [from the information],"" he said. Left to right, row by row, starting top left: Eisa Mousavi, Mohammed Ali, Nashir Uddin, Monjur Choudhury, Taherul Alam, Habibur Rahim, Badrul Hussain, Carolann Gallon, Saiful Islam, AbdulHamid Minoyee, Prabhat Nelli, Abdul Sabe, Jahanger Zaman, Nadeem Aslam, Mohammed Azram, Yassar Hussain, Redwan Siddquee, Mohibur Rahman Mr Ashman also dismissed claims that the informant, known as XY, was asked by police to take vulnerable girls to sex parties. He said the claim made by XY was ""100%"" a lie and had been rejected by a judge. Mr Ashman said: ""We absolutely did not task him to go to parties with vulnerable women and girls. ""The use of the informant was principally about finding out who might be involved, the cars they were using, the addresses they were living at. ""This was a starting point, it never resulted in XY being exposed to offending."" The informant had himself served a prison sentence for rape. The last of four trials, spread across two years, ended on Wednesday and in total 18 people were convicted of sexual exploitation and drugs offences. Those prosecuted were from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities and mainly British-born, with most living in the West End of Newcastle. The court heard how vulnerable girls and women were abused at parties or ""sessions"" in Newcastle. Newcastle child sex network convicted 'Vile crimes committed by evil men' Northumbria Police asked a previously convicted child rapist if he could get them more information about the parties. The NSPCC said that using him in this way was a decision that ""crossed the line"". Jim Gamble, former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said: ""Personally, I can't envisage circumstances where I would have authorised payment to someone convicted of rape. ""I can't imagine how you could have control mechanisms in place with an informant of that type that you were going to task that would give reassurance that they still didn't represent a risk to young and vulnerable women."" The defendants were convicted of abusing girls who were plied with alcohol and drugs before being forced to have sex. A court heard the vulnerable victims, some as young as 14, were exploited by a ""cynical organisation"". Over the course of the four trials, 20 young women gave evidence covering a period from 2011 to 2014. Mohammed Azram, 35, of Croydon Road, convicted of conspiracy to incite prostitution, sexual assault, supplying drugs to a victim Jahanghir Zaman, 43, of Hadrian Road, convicted of conspiracy to incite prostitution, rape, supplying drugs to a victim Nashir Uddin, 35, of Joan Street, convicted of conspiracy to incite prostitution, supplying drugs to a victim Saiful Islam, 34, of Strathmore Crescent, convicted of rape.

Calls to save 'storm crazed' dog,"Northamptonshire Police has applied for a Civil Destruction Order for Muppet A police force has come under fire for plans to put down a dog that bit four people after it escaped from a garden during Storm Doris. Northamptonshire Police has applied for a Civil Destruction Order for Muppet - seized from Ingleborough Way, Duston, near Northampton, on 23 February. The force announced the move on its Facebook page and has had 129 comments to date, most attacking the decision. Police said letting the dog live was not a ""safe option"". The dog's owner has refused to sign a destruction order, so a hearing will take place at Wellingborough Magistrates' Court on 10 October. In total, four people were bitten and needed medical treatment. Sgt Liam O'Neil said: ""Letting the dog back was not an option. There were too many victims for this to be considered a safe option."" On the Facebook page, one man said: ""Hardly the dogs fault when the fence blows down in a storm, the dog was probably fearing for itself. ""[The] way things are at the minute, I'd probably bite someone through fear of getting harmed. ""Poor dog, and as for putting a picture of it up that's just stupid, (like saying) 'this is the cute dog we're going to kill'."" One woman said: ""Why not try to find an animal sanctuary that would take the dog."" Another woman wrote: ""Such a shame for the dog to have to die."" Another man wrote: ""I assume that during a storm the dog was frightened to death. Poor dog. Looks like it needs a cuddle not killing!"" Other posters were more supportive of the police. One woman said: "" I must say I am in agreement with the destruction order, much as I am sorry for the dog. I don't believe a dog which has gone on the rampage like this can be retrained.""

Morrisons to rein in 'fake-farm brands',"Supermarket group Morrisons has pledged not to sell own-label ""fake-farm"" food. It defines this as brands that can give a misleading impression that food comes from a British farm, market or farming town which may not even exist. It said a meat brand it had created called Hemsley was a play on the name of the sound-a-like North Yorkshire farming town, Helmsley. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) is unhappy about fake-brands, particularly when it implies the food is British. Fruit and veg from Tesco's ""Redmere"" and ""Rosedene"" farm brands may not actually have been grown on them The NFU's deputy president, Minette Batters, said: ""In our view it is important that product names and descriptions on packaging are clear, accurate and do not mislead consumers. ""We would always encourage shoppers to look out for the Red Tractor logo to ensure the food is produced to the highest welfare standards, and can be traced back to a British farm."" A number of big supermarkets, including Morrisons, have come under fire for using farm-like labels for some of their produce. The issue came to a head in 2016, when market leader Tesco created a range of brand names for its own produce, including Rosedene Farm and Boswell Farms. At the time, Tesco told the BBC that some of these were indeed fresh produce suppliers but conceded that not all the items sold under those brand names came from those farms. It told the BBC this was not misleading to customers, since they understood Tesco was a large organisation which could not stock its stores from one farm. The Hemsley brand, which Morrisons dropped last year, had been criticised by the NFU. The union said that Hemsley used poultry imported from abroad, which was produced to less exacting welfare standards than those met by British suppliers. Morrisons said on Wednesday that 70% of UK adults it polled in a survey objected to the use of fake farm brands. Instead, consumers wanted products to use real place names on packaging and branding. A Morrisons spokesman said that its pledge not to use fake farm names would not apply to the third-party brands it stocks. Should supermarkets sell more British food?

Two trapped as bus crashes into shop,"This video can not be played Footage from bus crash A double-decker bus crashed into a shop in south London leaving two women trapped on the top deck. One eyewitness said he felt the bus drifting before it crashed into the front of the Poggenpohl Kitchen Design Centre in Lavender Hill, causing the shop front to collapse. Another said the driver told her he had ""blacked out"", adding a paramedic thought he had had ""some kind of fit"". The women were rescued by fire crews and the driver was taken to hospital. London Ambulance Service said a total of 10 people had been treated by paramedics, three of whom had been taken to hospital. It said it had sent five ambulance crews, two paramedics and an incident response officer to the scene at about 06:55 BST, along with an air ambulance. Emergency services were called at 06:55 BST Andrew Matthews, 34, from Wandsworth, was one of about a dozen passengers on the bus. ""I was on the top floor at the back, fortunately,"" he said. ""I noticed the bus drifting. I heard a smash and saw the roof of the shop going through [the bus] from the front left. It went to the fourth or fifth row. ""I wedged myself in, bracing myself. As soon as the bus came to a stop there was yelling, screaming. ""I noticed a lady wedged in the front right-hand side. She was screaming for help. There was a lot of blood."" Another passenger, nurse Amy Mullineux, 40, from Wandsworth, said the driver told her he had lost consciousness before the crash. ""I spoke to him. He said he blacked out before the bus hit the shop. He doesn't remember hitting anything. ""The paramedic told me they think he had some kind of fit."" The driver of the bus has been taken to hospital A witness said smoke could be seen coming from underneath the bus. Solange Morin, 33, who lives nearby, said: ""I saw this woman shouting and banging on the glass. Everybody shouted 'fire, fire'. ""I went on to the bus. I talked to her and was holding her hands. ""She was pinned. I wouldn't have been able to get her out. ""She was so scared because people were shouting fire. There was a lot of smoke."" Two women were trapped on the top deck of the number 77 bus Another local resident, Brendan Pfahlert, said the crash ""sounded like a large amount of glass being dropped"". ATransport for London (TfL),externalspokeswoman confirmed the crash involved a route 77 double-decker bus and said an investigation was under way. Poggenpohl UK managing director Simon Richmond said: ""We are relieved that no-one from our team was injured as the showroom had not yet opened for the day, but our thoughts are with the driver and passengers on the bus as we understand there have been casualties."" He said he hoped business would return to normal soon, but that the showroom had been severely damaged. Police have appealed for any witnesses to contact them with information. Detectives are particularly keen to hear from anyone with dash or helmet camera footage who was passing either prior to or during the crash.

Cam-girls: Inside the Romanian sexcam industry,"Interactive webcamming is the fastest-growing sector of the global pornography business.  In Romania, thousands of women work as ""cam-girls"" from studios and from home.  It is a 24/7 market, the majority of clients logging in from North America and Western Europe. In the heart of Bucharest on the pavement outside a tall apartment building a group of young women smoke, talk and laugh. It is an unremarkable scene. Except that in the bright morning sunlight, their heavy makeup, sky-high heels and shiny, revealing clothes contrast with the sensible, summer dress of passers-by. Inside the building, Studio 20 occupies the first and second floors. Forty rooms open off pristine, white corridors, their walls adorned with pictures of women in states of glamorous undress.  A closed door means business.  Inside that room a woman is live and direct via webcam with international clients - and as long as she is alone in the room, it is entirely legal.  In this world of virtual relationships and cybersex, those in front of the camera are ""models"" and the men who watch are ""members"". Inside Studio 20 - a closed door means a model is entertaining a client Lana works in Room 8. It is dominated by a circular bed with cushions.  There is a wardrobe containing some of her clothes. ""I usually go for dresses, lingerie, or leather,"" she says. In a corner of the room there is a large computer screen, an expensive camera and behind them, professional photographers' lights.  Dozens of pairs of eyes may view Lana in her room online in real time via dedicated adult websites.  But she does not make any money until a member asks her to ""go private"" in a one-to-one webcam session. Lana works at Studio 20 Working an eight-hour day, she earns close to 4,000 euros (Â£3,600) per month - nearly 10 times the Romanian average wage.  As Lana's employer, Studio 20 also makes 4,000 euros per month from her online sessions.  And at the top of the video chat money-making pyramid, LiveJasmin - the online cam site that streams Studio 20's content and is responsible for collecting payment from the credit cards of clients - takes double that: 8,000 euros. Listen toRomania's Webcam BoomonCrossing Continentsat 11:00, BBC Radio 4 LiveJasmin is the largest internet cam host in the world.  Between 35 and 40 million users visit it daily, and at any given moment, there are 2,000 models live online.  It is not hard to understand how the web-cam industry, overall, generated an estimated $2-3bn in 2016. A cam-girl gets ready to entertain in a bathroom setting - complete with chandelier Lana is a graduate who worked in real estate until the global economic crash of 2008 plunged Romania into recession.  That is when she first took up video-chat.  Her first day in front of the camera has stayed with her. ""I was alone in the room, and it felt like there were hundreds of people around me.  And I couldn't keep up with what they were all saying, and what they were asking of me.  It was quite shocking.  But then I learned to be perceptive about which member was a potential paying customer and not to waste time with all of them in the free online space."" So what happens in a private, webcam one-to-one? ""Mostly it's conversation.  I do role-play sometimes, and a small part of it is nudity and masturbation,"" she says. While the members sometimes try to push her to do things she doesn't want to do, she is able to set the pace. ""It's up to you as a woman to lead, and that's quite empowering."" The important thing is to keep a paying client online for as many minutes as possible. ""You have 10 minutes of being cute and sexy, and then you better have something to talk about because otherwise the member will not stay,"" says Andra Chirnogeanu, Studio 20's PR manager. ""You better have something to talk about otherwise the member will not stay"" says Andra Chirnogeanu, Studio 20's PR manager To this end, Studio 20 employs trainers, a psychologist and an English teacher. Most of the clients are North American and European, so it is essential the models can communicate with them. But the English teacher, Andrea, has a remit that goes far beyond language skills. ""I teach them about fetishes - what a fetish is, why a person has oneâ¦ We study Freud and a lot of psychology.  And we study a book of gestures because women must be sensual, smart and beautiful."" Models are encouraged to message clients every day Geography is important too, so the models can talk about where the members are from. ""That or exotic places,"" says Andrea. ""This is not only a sex business as some people think - models have to speak with a member as if they are in a normal, online relationship. Being able to discuss many subjects brings comfort to both parties."" Studio 20 is the largest studio webcam franchise in the world.  It has nine branches in Romania, including one employing ""cam-boys"" who service the gay market.  Its other branches are in the Colombian city of Cali, Budapest and Los Angeles. Not all models work from a studio. Sandy Bell - a graduate with two university degrees - is one of a small army of women who webcam from home. She makes about 100 euros (Â£90) a day when she goes online to supplement her income as an interior designer.  One advantage of being independent - and dealing directly with a web-hosting company - is that she earns a larger percentage of members' fees. ""Mostly they're nice guys, not crazy men,"" she says. ""There are a lot of members looking for love. They want the connection. Some members want you to call their name. Or to talk to them while you dance and strip.  I'm very honest with them - they know I have a boyfriend, and they know we are not going to have sex in real life."" This video can not be played ""They don't touch you. They are thousands of miles away""- Sandy Bell, a 'cam-girl', describes her work. Sandy Bell's partner lives with her in their high-rise flat on the outskirts of Bucharest.  He knows what she does, but her parents do not.  It is not uncommon in this industry - even for studio owners - to hide their occupations from family and friends. This accounts for the fact that those who talked to the BBC in Bucharest preferred to use their cam name, or just a first name. Unlike many who work in the sex industry, Sandy Bell does not worry about her own security. ""What can a member do to me?  If he crosses a line or even if he is rude to me, I just click the mouse and stop it.  And I can talk to the administrator on the website and they ban the IP address, so the guy can never enter again even if he changes his nickname.  I mean, those people are thousands of miles away from me.  They don't touch you - nobody touches you.  You go online alone and you work online alone.  This has nothing to do with prostitution."" Is Sandy Bell a victim?  She says she is not, though feminists such as Irina Ilisei say the question is more complicated than it seems. ""Do we talk about women who are forced to do this? Are they women who choose it?  Or perhaps they do it because they are psychologically manipulated, or they have a lack of economic stability.  Probably, it's a combination of all these factors."" Ilisei believes the push factors include Romania's high rate of teenage pregnancy, and the fact that 30% of those who finish higher education cannot find a job. Irina Ilisei believes some women are pushed into the industry The webcam industry also does its best to entice young women into the business. ""There are advertisements on university campuses,"" says Ilisei.  ""Students get direct Facebook messages with offers of work.  And the studios are very corporate - exactly like an entry-career job in other fields.  The language is all about empowering young women, being independent, learning skills, even getting bonuses if you convince your friends to try it too."" For Lana, 31, webcamming has provided enough money for her to bring up her daughter alone, and to think about investing money in something ""that will bring money to the country"". She plans to give up in two years' time. But some women are not free to make the choices Lana has.  Oana, 28, counts herself as an escapee from the sex industry.  At 16 - a minor - she fell in love with a boyfriend who persuaded her to do video chat. ""He told me I just had to talk.  That's all.  But he was in the room with me, and we made pornography there."" It is illegal in Romania for a man and woman to webcam together, but it is impossible to say how commonly the law is flouted in the way Oana describes.  She went on to work as a prostitute in Germany, until she found the courage to return to Bucharest and a new life.  Now she works in sex work prevention - talking to young women about her experiences, and trying to persuade them of the danger of video chat. ""There are girls who think they will just stay in front of the camera and make money.  But all the things they do there will affect their minds. The next step is prostitution. I see that now."" Lana disagrees. ""It's about selling your brain, not your body,"" she says.  ""I see it like a performance, like a show.  But this is not a job for everybody - a lot of girls quit after a few weeks or even days, because they have this mindset that they're selling their body.  Your mindset is what matters in this job. I have my limits, and I truly do not feel exploited."" Andra Chirnogeanu, Studio 20's PR Manager, also rejects the idea that this is risky or psychologically damaging work. ""It's psychologically damaging to stay 12 hours in an office getting paid a minimum wage,"" she says. But the fact that models often seek to conceal their job is, perhaps, telling. If Lana and Sandy Bell could have made a good living using their qualifications and other work experience, would they still have chosen to undress for clients in New York, Frankfurt and London?

Killer Noye 'should stay behind bars',"This video can not be played Jimmy Cable says his daughter's safety is more important than Noye's transfer The father of a woman who gave evidence against M25 road-rage killer Kenneth Noye has said he should ""stay behind bars"" and not move to an open prison. In 2000 Noye, 70, wassentenced to life,externaland told to serve at least 16 years for the murder of Stephen Cameron in 1996. Mr Cameron, 21, was stabbed in front of fiancee Danielle Cable, who was given a new identity and has been living under a witness protection scheme ever since. Jimmy Cable said her safety was more important than Noye's transfer. Noye is expected to be moved to an open prison within about six weeks after the justice secretary accepted aParole Board recommendationthat he be transferred to ""open conditions"". Kenneth Noye fled to Spain after he murdered Stephen Cameron in 1996 Mr Cable said he was angered by the decision. ""Why give him [Noye] the opportunity to go in an open prison. He can have a day out and walk around. Why?"" His daughter identified Noye after he fled to Spain and subsequently gave evidence at his trial. Stephen Cameron was 21 when he was stabbed to death by Noye Mr Cable told BBC South East that her life had been destroyed. ""If you take a life, you should serve life,"" he said. Profile: Kenneth Noye The electrician was stabbed to death on a slip road of the M25 at Swanley in Kent. Noye later claimed he killed Mr Cameron in self-defence during a road-rage fight. He went on the run after the killing, but was arrested in Spain in 1998 and was extradited back to the UK.

Facebook introduces new video service,"Social media giant Facebook has made a move into dedicated video, pitting it against YouTube and TV networks. Users will soon see a new Watch tab that will offer a range of shows, some of which have been funded by the social network Watch will be personalised so that users can discover new shows, based on what their friends are watching. Viewers will also be able to see comments and connect with friends and dedicated groups for shows. Ads will be key to Facebook's efforts to take on video giant YouTube ""Watching a show doesn't have to be passive,"" said the company's founder Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post. ""It can be a chance to share an experience and bring people together who care about the same things."" Video has been available on Facebook for some time, but until now, it has mostly been dominated by amateur clips or short segments from news organisations. The world's largest social network added a video tab last year, and has hinted for some time that it might make the move to producing original content. Watch could open up new revenue potential for both Facebook and programme makers, while users can expect to see targeted advertising before and during the shows. Facebook says it hopes its selection of shows will address both niche and broad interests. If the choice at launch is anything to go by, its focus will be factual entertainment - cookery, fitness and travel-themed programmes that play well on a smartphone screen, rather than flagship dramas like House of Cards or Game of Thrones, which are both more expensive to produce and better suited for playback on TVs. Product director Daniel Danker - an ex-BBC iPlayer executive - told me that his goal was for anyone to be able to make shows for Watch. For now, only a small set of approved publishers can include ad breaks, but he said the list would broaden over time, although it was too soon to say if it would extend to all. That could prove critical to wooing content-makers away from YouTube. For the moment, Google's video streaming site still offers an easier way for popular vloggers and others outside the mainstream media industry to make money from their efforts. But Mr Danker signalled that Facebook is willing to take its time exploring what works on Watch and would not even commit to it being rolled out beyond the US before the end of the year. Facebook is entering an increasingly complex and crowded market, and will face competition from traditional TV networks as well as other online services like YouTube and Netflix. Disney yesterday announced that from 2019, it will scrap its existing deal with Netflix and create its own direct-to-consumer streaming-video services. It will also set up a sports-themed ESPN streaming service next year. Watch will be available on mobile, laptop, desktop and via TV apps Facebook already has content lined up, including Major League Baseball, Women's basketball, parenting shows and a safari show from National Geographic. According to Reuters news agency, it has also inked deals with millennial-oriented media groups Vox Media, BuzzFeed, ATTN, Group Nine Media and others to produce shows. Watch will have a limited release in the US before it is rolled out more broadly.

What damage could North Korea do?,"This video can not be played North Korea's recent missile tests have escalated tensions in the region North Korea is an isolated, impoverished but highly militarised state. Its leadership has one essential goal - survival. That is why they have placed huge resources in their nuclear and missile programmes as the ultimate insurance policy for the regime. Any use of its nuclear capability would be catastrophic - especially so for North Korea itself. The regime would not survive the ensuing conflict. But this awful prospect is not necessarily the immediate worry. It is the threat of the escalating war of words between Washington and Pyongyang moving from rhetoric to reality. North Korea is a country that has episodically resorted to the use of force in the past and could do so again. In March 2010 it is believed to have sunk a small South Korean warship. In the same year its artillery shelled a South Korean island and if this current crisis does go hot, it is likely to be South Korea that is on the receiving end of the North's anger. North Korea's missile programme Can the US defend itself against North Korea? North Korea's military has the numerical advantage over the South and is deployed close to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) marking the boundary between the two Koreas. It is frequently suggested that North Korean artillery and rocket forces (its strongest card) could level the South Korean capital Seoul within hours of the outbreak of a conflict. This is not actually so. Seoul is some 40km (24 miles) from the DMZ and can only be reached by the North's longest range artillery pieces. Their firing would betray their positions - many of them are not very mobile - and this would leave them vulnerable to attack by the South. South Korea has by far the qualitative edge and it is of course backed up by the extensive strike power of the US military. Any reprise of the Korean War of the 1950s - the movement of the North's forces southwards - would create huge numbers of civilian casualties (indeed among them would be many Chinese students and businesspeople resident in Seoul) but would inevitably end in a catastrophe for the North Korean regime. This video can not be played ""You can feel the ground shake"": A rare live report from a N Korean military parade Such a Korean War Mark II is hopefully unlikely. But the danger is that the North might seek to use its military forces for provocations or other steps that might precipitate a more generalised conflict. Quite apart from the reach of its artillery and rocket forces, the North has an extensive chemical arsenal. It may also have biological weapons. It has large numbers of highly trained special forces and other units designed to infiltrate the South. And it has developed a cyber attack capability as well. So it has many means by which it might seek to take military action. But any attack against the US or its allies in the current context risks a more generalised war. And assuming that the Pyongyang regime is not suicidal  - and despite many of the rhetorical claims to the contrary, this is not an irrational regime - then the North Korean leadership must be aware of the risks they run. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? Can North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? From the North Korean perspective, having a nuclear weapon and an intercontinental missile capability to hold at risk the territory of the continental United States is entirely rational. The demise of the dictatorships in Iraq and Libya, the North Koreans would argue, was in large part because they did not have recourse to the ultimate weapon. Risking an all-out war with the United States though that could only end in the regime's demise makes no sense. Any war on the Korean peninsula would play to Washington's advantages. North Korean forces would be channelled southwards into limited avenues of advance due to the topography and the Pentagon could employ the classic concepts of its air-land battle to defeat them. Such a war though is unthinkable. It is in neither side's interests. The risk now is entirely of mistake, miscalculation and actions taken on the basis of clumsy and confused rhetorical signals. The North Koreans usually broadcast at full volume. The US now needs to be cautious about the tone of its own messaging.

Police chief defends informant payment,"Steve Ashman said the informant was a jumping off point for the investigation A police chief has said paying a child rapist Â£10,000 as part of an investigation into a grooming gang was the ""right thing"". Northumbria Police's Steve Ashman said the information provided by the man led to theconviction of 17 men and a womanfor abusing girls in Newcastle. Charities have criticised the force for paying the criminal. Mr Ashman told BBC News he was as ""certain as I can be"" that it was ""morally"" right. ""What we've ended up doing here is putting dangerous men behind bars and protecting vulnerable women and girls that we simply wouldn't have been able to do if we didn't have that jump off point we got [from the information],"" he said. Left to right, row by row, starting top left: Eisa Mousavi, Mohammed Ali, Nashir Uddin, Monjur Choudhury, Taherul Alam, Habibur Rahim, Badrul Hussain, Carolann Gallon, Saiful Islam, AbdulHamid Minoyee, Prabhat Nelli, Abdul Sabe, Jahanger Zaman, Nadeem Aslam, Mohammed Azram, Yassar Hussain, Redwan Siddquee, Mohibur Rahman Mr Ashman also dismissed claims that the informant, known as XY, was asked by police to take vulnerable girls to sex parties. He said the claim made by XY was ""100%"" a lie and had been rejected by a judge. Mr Ashman said: ""We absolutely did not task him to go to parties with vulnerable women and girls. ""The use of the informant was principally about finding out who might be involved, the cars they were using, the addresses they were living at. ""This was a starting point, it never resulted in XY being exposed to offending."" The informant had himself served a prison sentence for rape. The last of four trials, spread across two years, ended on Wednesday and in total 18 people were convicted of sexual exploitation and drugs offences. Those prosecuted were from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities and mainly British-born, with most living in the West End of Newcastle. The court heard how vulnerable girls and women were abused at parties or ""sessions"" in Newcastle. Newcastle child sex network convicted 'Vile crimes committed by evil men' Northumbria Police asked a previously convicted child rapist if he could get them more information about the parties. The NSPCC said that using him in this way was a decision that ""crossed the line"". Jim Gamble, former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said: ""Personally, I can't envisage circumstances where I would have authorised payment to someone convicted of rape. ""I can't imagine how you could have control mechanisms in place with an informant of that type that you were going to task that would give reassurance that they still didn't represent a risk to young and vulnerable women."" The defendants were convicted of abusing girls who were plied with alcohol and drugs before being forced to have sex. A court heard the vulnerable victims, some as young as 14, were exploited by a ""cynical organisation"". Over the course of the four trials, 20 young women gave evidence covering a period from 2011 to 2014. Mohammed Azram, 35, of Croydon Road, convicted of conspiracy to incite prostitution, sexual assault, supplying drugs to a victim Jahanghir Zaman, 43, of Hadrian Road, convicted of conspiracy to incite prostitution, rape, supplying drugs to a victim Nashir Uddin, 35, of Joan Street, convicted of conspiracy to incite prostitution, supplying drugs to a victim Saiful Islam, 34, of Strathmore Crescent, convicted of rape.

The Maldives: Political turmoil on the 'island paradise',"Are you dreaming of a holiday in the Maldives? You may want to choose another fantasy destination after the British Foreign Office told tourists to be aware thatsome political demonstrations in the capital, MalÃ©, have led to violence.,externalIt did add, though, that most trips there are trouble-free. At the end of last month the Maldives celebrated its birthday, 52 years since independence from Britain. But the festivities were marred when the government ordered troops to storm the country's parliament and prevent opposition MPs from entering. It was the latest dramatic attempt by President Abdulla Yameen to maintain his grip on power, and the latest twist in a tale of tropical intrigue worthy of a thriller. The story is certainly set against a suitably exotic backdrop. The Maldives is justifiably famous for its breathtakingly beautiful beaches and breathtakingly expensive luxury hotels. But while the water of the coral reefs that surround them may be crystal clear, politics in the so-called ""island paradise"" has always been very murky indeed. The political drama is centred, not on the beaches but on MalÃ©, the tiny, urbanised island where all of the Maldives' major institutions are based and which is one of the most densely populated cities on Earth. Former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed is one of the leaders of the country's opposition For 30 years the country was a corrupt autocracy, ruled with the proverbial ""iron fist"" by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. President Gayoom shrugged off numerous coup attempts during his three decades in power, but the wily tactician could not resist forever the growing demand for democratic reform. In 2008, a charismatic young progressive, Mohamed Nasheed, swept to power in the country's first democratic elections. He rolled back repressive laws, bolstered democratic institutions and captured the world's attention with an underwater cabinet meeting to highlight the risks of rising sea levels. But the Maldives' brief moment as a model Islamic democracy was not to last. Less than four years later, Mr Nasheed resigned following a mutiny by the police and weeks of demonstrations after the arrest of the chief justice, something he now calls a coup. In November 2013, Mr Yameen took office, but as he is Mr Gayoom's half-brother, it looked like a return to the old order. However, over the last year the two strongmen have had a spectacular falling out. Maldives leaves Commonwealth amid democracy row Maldives president faces 'removal plot', BBC learns Trouble in Paradise So much so that Mr Gayoom, the grizzled old dictator, has thrown in his lot with the dashing young democrat, Mr Nasheed. To give you an idea of just how improbable this union is, you should know that Mr Nasheed was imprisoned and tortured during Mr Gayoom's rule. Current Maldives President Abdulla Yameen Nevertheless these unlikely allies have prospered and - bolstered by defections from the ruling party - the opposition has managed to gain a small majority in the Maldivian parliament. They had a plan - to stage a coup, but a democratic one. They tabled a no-confidence vote against the speaker of the country's parliament. The idea was to replace him and his deputy with opposition figures, who would lead an emergency government until elections early next year. It looked likely to work, until, that is, Mr Yameen literally called in the troops. They barred opposition MPs from entering parliament for the vote, thereby putting paid to the plotters' plans. Since then Mr Yameen has been trying to strip the opposition of its majority, arresting MPs and ruling that defectors must resign their seats. It has been enough to allow him to cling on to power, for the moment at least. An opposition activist argues with a policeman outside parliament in Male in March 2017 If you are wondering why on earth you should care about this sun-soaked soap opera, you need to see the wider picture - because the Maldives is at the centre of a much bigger strategic power play. The country's more than 1,000 islands stretch 800km (500 miles) into the Indian Ocean. They straddle crucial sea-lanes, notably the busy but prosaically named bottleneck, the ""One and a Half Degree Channel"". It makes the Maldives a pawn in the great game for regional influence being played out between India and China, the outcome of which may influence the shape of the world economy for years to come. But there are more basic principles at stake here too - human rights and the rule of democracy. And they matter just as much in small nations with great beaches like the Maldives, as they do anywhere else in the world.

Sixth-former dies in Ecuador raft fall,"Matthew Hitchman, 17, went to the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe A sixth-form pupil on a school trip to Ecuador has fallen from an inflatable white water raft and died. Matthew Hitchman, 17, from the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was on a month-long school trek. On Sunday he fell off the raft and attempts to rescue him ""proved impossible"", the school said. The group from the school had just completed a trek to the Northern Andes when the accident happened. The pupils had been working on a community project to provide sustainable tourism income in a remote area of Ecuador. In a statement the school headmaster Philip Wayne said: ""Matthew will be sadly missed by all who knew him. ""He was a caring, friendly and well-liked student who was highly regarded by his teachers and fellow pupils."" The school said it had focused on the ""safe and compassionate return of 11 boys to the UK without one of their team mates, supporting our staff and students and giving the best possible care we can offer to a devastated family"". A spokesman for World Challenge, which organised the trek, said: ""A full independent review is already under way."" He said the firm had suspended white water rafting in all destinations until the completion of the review. It has been organising educational expeditions for 30 years and claimed that since 2003 more than 6,500 students had completed expeditions to Ecuador.

Fox 'expects Sky approval in 2018',"Campaigners from Avaaz protested in London ahead of Culture Secretary Karen Bradley's remarks in June Approval of 21st Century Fox's proposed takeover of Sky is likely to come in the first half of 2018, the company said on Wednesday, in a sign it is gearing up for wider review of the merger. Fox had hoped to close the deal in 2017 but it has been delayed by regulators. It follows concerns a deal would give the family of businessman Rupert Murdoch too much control over UK news. US-based Fox already has a minority stake in Sky. Both Sky and Fox are controlled by Mr Murdoch, who also owns the Times and the Sun newspapers. Fox is seeking to buy the 61% of Sky it doesn't own. In June, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said she was ""minded"" to refer the almost Â£12bn (Â£9bn) deal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for wider review, based on the risks to media plurality. James Murdoch said he remained confident the deal would be approved This week, she asked Ofcom for clarification about parts of its investigation of the proposal, extending the timeline for her decision to the end of August. The request came after a lawsuit was filed in the US, alleging false quotes had been inserted into a Fox News story that was coordinated with the White House. Fox, which later retracted the story, has disputed the allegations. 'Confident of approval' Fox told investors on Wednesday that setting aside money for the deal remains a priority, noting that the company has already received necessary approvals in Europe. A wider review could push back approval to the end of June 2018, the firm said. ""We remain confident our transaction will be approved, but more likely in the first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year,"" said James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox. Mr Murdoch made the comments to analysts as the company released its latest earnings. He is also chairman of Sky News. Over the 12 months to the end of June, Fox made $3bn in profit for shareholders, with revenues growing by 4% to $28.5bn. The firm's revenue in the fourth quarter increased 1.5% to $6.7bn, powered by growth in its cable division, which includes Fox News and the FX channel. But profits in the quarter contracted, as the company struggled to keep audiences at its broadcast television division and for its movies. The firm reported $476m in shareholder profits for the quarter, down more than 12%. Fox, like other media companies, is grappling with the way the internet and on-demand video has changed media consumption, with audiences increasingly going online. Disney on Tuesday said it would invest in its own streaming sites and end a distribution deal with Netflix. Fox said the changes are reinforcing its focus on news and sports, which are more likely to be watched in real time. The firm is also exploring new distribution options. It has announced an ad-free offering with Comcast, expanded its partnership with Hulu and is exploring its own apps.

Ex-FBI man and daughter guilty of murder,"Thomas Martens and Molly Corbett delayed calling for an ambulance and pretended to carry out CPR, the trial heard A former FBI agent and his daughter have been sentenced to 20-25 years in prison for bludgeoning her Irish husband to death. Thomas Martens, 67, and Molly Corbett, 33, both claimed self-defence in the 2 August 2015 killing of Jason Corbett. Mr Corbett, 39, died of blunt force trauma and was hit at least 10 times, according to the medical examiner. A jury of nine women and three men unanimously found the two guilty of second-degree murder. She first met Mr Corbett in 2008 after travelling to his native Ireland to work as an au pair for his two children after his first wife died in 2006 from an asthma attack. The Limerick native wed the American in 2011 and moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Martens, who worked for the FBI for more than 30 years, had claimed he was defending his daughter after Mr Corbett choked her. He told a 911 operator that night that he hit Mr Corbett ""in the head with a baseball bat"", and that he heard him say: ""I'm going to kill her"". Prosecutors said Molly Corbett (R) did not appear to have suffered any injuries to indicate she had been assaulted by Jason (L) ""He's bleeding all over and I may have killed him,"" Martens said during the call to emergency services. The Davidson County jury was shown a metal baseball bat and a paving stone recovered at the scene, which prosecutors said were used to kill the Irishman. Mr Corbett, a plant manager for a packaging firm, was beaten so badly that pieces of his skull fell off during a post-mortem examination, the trial heard. The court also heard the father and daughter had delayed calling for an ambulance and pretended to carry out CPR after the attack in the master bedroom of the four-bedroom home. Prosecutors said Molly Corbett did not appear to have suffered any injuries to indicate she had been assaulted. But defence lawyers argued an investigator had failed to collect evidence that night showing otherwise. Lawyers for Corbett said she had a mark on her neck, hair under her husband's fingernails and blood on his feet, suggesting a struggle. Corbett declined to testify, but the judge allowed her to speak after the verdict. ""I did not murder my husband. My father did not murder my husband,"" she said before sobbing. She added that he was an abusive spouse and that ""the incidents occurred as they did on a somewhat regular basis, the difference is that my father was there"". ""I'm really sorry to my mom, he should have just killed me,"" she said. Corbett fought for and lost custody of her two step-children after her husband's death. Guardianship was granted to Mr Corbett's sister, Tracy Lynch, who testified in court on the prosecution's behalf. ""Jason will be remembered for who he was, not for how he died,"" Ms Lynch said after Wednesday's verdict.
