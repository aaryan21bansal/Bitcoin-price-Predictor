Military Wives Choirs get share of Â£76m fund,"Kristin Scott Thomas, Gareth Malone and Sharon Horgan appeared with the Combined Military Wives Choir at their London UK film premiere in February Venues and organisations including the Military Wives Choirs, The Hepworth Wakefield and Night and Day in Manchester are to receive a share of Â£76m government arts funding. Whitby's Gothic Festival, London's Somerset House and Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall are also set to benefit. The latest raft of grants, for 588 organisations, will come out of the wider Â£1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund. It follows Monday's Â£257m injection, which helped The Cavern Club and LSO. Cavern Club and LSO get share of Â£257m culture fund 'The rug can be pulled any time,' say indie stars Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said that Saturday's new round of ""vital funding"" would go to ""protect cultural gems across the country, save jobs and prepare the arts to bounce back"". It will cover comedy clubs, circuses, festivals, regional theatres and local museums, across England. ""These awards build on our commitment to be here for culture in every part of the country,"" he added. While July's announcement of the wider support package was welcomed by the arts and entertainment industries, Mr Dowden did admit that it would not be enough to save every job or cultural establishment. The Military Wives Choir rose to fame through the BBC documentary series with Gareth Malone and was recently the subject of a film starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan. Military Wives: 'Director didn't want us to sound too slick' Director Melanie Nightingale said they were ""incredibly grateful"" for the ""much-needed support,"" at a time when many arts organisations have been struggling due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are thrilled that this funding enables our 73 choirs to sing, share and support one another and feel stronger together through music,"" she said. The grants of under Â£1m have also been awarded to the West End's longest running play, The Mousetrap; the Shangri-La stage at Glastonbury Festival; and grassroots music venues, including Night & Day Cafe. Night & Day Cafe in Manchester has hosted gigs by the likes of the Arctic Monkeys, Elbow, and Jessie J Jennifer Smithson, director of the latter Manchester venue, explained that the financial help ""enables us to plan for the future when we look forward to having live music back at the venue once again"". Joe Wright, who directed films including Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, is also a Kneehigh associate. He said he was delighted the Cornwall theatre had been successful in round two, and will now be able to reopen in December with the aim of providing safe, socially distanced outdoor artistic experiences. ""Kneehigh remain an inspiration for many throughout the sector, they've never got 'stuck' and have always been quick to adapt to new challenges,"" he said. ""Their mission to remain local whilst telling stories that reflect all our lives is vital in helping us all through these unprecedented times."" Further round of funding from the Cultural Recovery Fund pot are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Organisations that will be receiving funding part of the Â£76m include: Kneehigh Theatre, Cornwall - Â£249,833 Whitby Gothic Festival, North Yorkshire - Â£55,000 Night and Day, Manchester - Â£64,745 Military Wives Choirs, London - Â£92,057 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Yorkshire - Â£50,000 Walk the Plank, Salford - Â£170,268 Solfest, Cumbria - Â£100,000 Circus Berlin, Gateshead - Â£423,000 ZoieLogic Dance Theatre, Southampton - Â£50,544 Create Studios, Swindon - Â£195,222 Somerset House, Westminster, London - Â£850,000 Paraorchestra, Bristol - Â£156,000 The Puppet Theatre Barge, London - Â£52,352 The Hepworth Wakefield Trust, Wakefield, Yorkshire - Â£146,726 Chiltern Open Air Museum, Buckinghamshire - Â£219,008 Hofesh Shechter Company, Brighton - Â£250,000 Britten Sinfonia, Cambridge - Â£197,810 Kings Place, Islington, London - Â£562,000 Berkshire Maestros, Reading - Â£783,746 Vindolanda Trust, Hexham - Â£250,000 Future DJs, Knutsford - Â£175,000 Nottingham Museums - Â£180,000 Moseley Folk and Arts Festival, Birmingham - Â£50,000 The British Motor Museum, Warwick - Â£707,000 Leicester Comedy Festival - Â£105,000 For a full list, visit theArts Council England website.,external Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Ban on visiting Wales from Covid hotspots begins,"In Wales, people living in hotspot areas cannot travel - but people in England's can A ban on people travelling to Wales from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UK has come into effect. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the rules on Wednesday after twice asking Boris Johnson to stop people from English hotspots from travelling. The ban covers all of Northern Ireland, England'stier two and three areasand the Scottish central belt. Mr Johnson has since written back to Mr Drakeford and said the UK ""must avoid imposing conflicting restrictions"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart criticised the decision, saying it risks""stirring division and confusion, but the move has been backed by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The new rules, which came into force at 18:00 BST on Friday, mean anyone coming from places in the UK with extra restrictions is now banned from entering the country. People living in parts of England and Scotland without extra restrictions can still travel to areas of Wales which are not under local lockdowns, including Powys, Pembrokeshire and Gwynedd (apart from Bangor). Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Currently, 17 areas of Wales, including 15 of its 22 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli, are currently under local lockdowns. Movement in and out of these counties without a reasonable excuse was already banned. As is the case within Wales, there arereasonable excuses for travelling in and out of locked down areasincluded in the ban. Under the new rules, exceptions to the travel ban include: Getting food, medical or essential supplies for those in the same household or vulnerable people - this includes for animals To work or provide voluntary or charitable services if this cannot be done from outside the area Elite athletes can train and compete To provide or receive emergency assistance To attend a wedding or civil partnership (as a guest or as part of the wedding party) or a funeral To attend court Children to play sport, music or for other recreational activities - or to continue existing contact arrangements between parents who do not live together To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm The new rules will be enforced with fines Announcing the ban, Mr Drakeford said: ""Evidence from public health professionals suggests coronavirus is moving from east to west across the UK and across Wales. ""As a general rule, it is concentrating in urban areas and then spreading to more sparsely populated areas as a result of people travelling."" Mr Drakeford said the law will be ""essentially designed to prevent people going to those holiday parts of Wales, the far west and the far southwest of Wales, where the virus is still in very low circulation"". Speaking on behalf of the four Welsh police forces, North Wales Police said officers would be ""proactive"" in targeting those not sticking to rules on gatherings. But the head of the Police Federation in Wales warned that the rules could be ""unenforceable"". Police forces in Wales are already responsible for enforcing travel rules in local lockdown areas The Welsh Government said police will explain regulations to anyone caught breaking the rules before issuing a fixed penalty notice, but will issue a fine of Â£60, which will be halved if paid within 14 days. Fines will then be doubled for each offence, up to a limit of Â£1,920. Alun Michael, the police and crime commissioner for South Wales Police, said officers would ask the public to ""use common sense"". ""It obviously makes no sense for people who are in high infection areas to travel into Wales into lower infection areas,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfaston Friday. ""It's very clear we've got a very challenging period coming up and obeying the rules is absolutely crucial. This is a public health emergency."" Mr Michael, who was the first Labour leader of the Welsh Government, added: ""We really need the UK government to be giving out the same messages about not travelling that have come very clearly from the Welsh Government."" This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected calls for travel restrictions in a BBC Wales interview In his response letter to Mr Drakeford, Mr Johnson said he would ask Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to arrange an ""urgent meeting"" between the four UK nations. He said: ""We share the same ambitions, yet as you said in your letter to me it would be far better for all four parts of the UK to act in concert. ""We must avoid a situation where different areas within the UK impose conflicting restrictions on each other."" Mr Johnson also said in his letter that the UK government had decided not to impose legal restrictions on people travelling from hotspots as ""effective enforcement would be extremely difficult and resource intensive"".

Fishmonger Hall attack officers 'lacked training',"Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were killed during a conference to rehabilitate offenders Prevent officers tasked with monitoring the man who killed two people in the Fishmonger's Hall attack had ""no specific training"" in handling terrorists, a court has heard. Convicted terrorist Usman Khan fatally stabbed Cambridge graduates Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at prisoner rehabilitation event on 29 November. He injured two others before he was shot dead by police on London Bridge. A pre-inquest review hearing was held at the Old Bailey on Friday morning. The full inquest into the deaths of Mr Merritt and Ms Jones is expected to take place next April - and one for Khan will follow after. Nick Armstrong, a lawyer for Mr Merritt's family, suggested there was already evidence of a ""systemic problem"". He said officers in Staffordshire who were handling Khan had said they had ""received no specific training in dealing with terrorist offenders"". Henry Pitchers QC, for Ms Jones's family, said the question was not whether Prevent or probation knew there was a risk but whether they ""should have had an inkling"". Khan was ""assessed as the highest level of risk"" when he was allowed to leave prison - less than a year before the attack - and ""had 22 licence conditions attach to his release,"" Mr Pitchers told the court. He said the last visit by police officers to Khan's home in Stafford was two weeks before the attack. The flat was dark, and Khan opposed the officers photographing his Xbox and asked them to leave, which they did. But this does not appear to have raised suspicions, Mr Pitchers said. He also raised the issue of security at the Learning Together event where the attack took place. ""There was no security check at the door,"" he said. ""Not even a rudimentary bag check."" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons At the pre-inquest review Jude Bunting, representing Khan's mother Parveen Begum, said: ""Mrs Begum and her family were deeply shocked by the events. ""Mrs Begum still finds it hard to believe such terrible damage was caused by her son. ""They condemn Usman Khan's actions"" ""They want to better understand how this tragedy happened. How a family member who they thought was reformed, committed this atrocity."" Usman Khan, 28, was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange The court heard the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police does not think anyone else was involved in the attack. Chief Coroner Mark Lucraft QC was told a toxicology investigation of Khan's body found evidence of ""the occasional use of cocaine"" in the period leading up to his death. Khan had recently been released from a prison sentence for terrorism offences when he attended the Learning Together event at Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London. Ms Jones's family's legal team opposed an application by Khan's family that they should have ""interested party"" status at the inquest into her death and that of Mr Merritt. They also opposed Khan's family having legal representation in the inquests. Mr Armstrong, representing Mr Merritt's family, also opposed the applications.

Coronavirus infections still rising rapidly,"Coronavirus infections are continuing to rise rapidly, with an estimated 27,900 new cases a day in England, the Office for National Statistics says. This figure is far higher than the number ofconfirmed cases announced by the government each day,external. The R number has risen slightly to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread across the country. It comes as the highest level of restrictions are introduced in more of the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said 'R' was not growing as fast as it would be without the measures people were following. But he said ""we are not where we need to be"", adding there was ""more work to do"". The increase in people testing positive in recent weeks is being driven by high rates in older teenagers and young adults,the ONS infection survey,externalsays. It found steep increases in infection rates in the north west, the north east, Yorkshire and the Humber. New cases of the virus have gone up by 60% in a week, according to the ONS, based on its survey of people in random households with or without symptoms. It estimates that one in 160 people in England had the virus in the week to 8 October - an increase on one in 240 the previous week. For the same week, the ONS estimates one in 390 people had the virus in Wales and one in 250 in Northern Ireland - both an increase on the week before. The ONS survey doesn't cover Scotland. Asconfirmed cases and hospital admissions rise there, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is in a ""precarious"" position in its fight to contain Covid-19. How many confirmed cases are there in your areas? Lancashire to move to highest Covid alert level What Covid tier is my area in? Can I stay with my partner in a Tier 2 area? And other questions An app which tracks the Covid symptoms of four million users estimates there are more than 27,000 new cases per day in the UK. Its latest figures, for the two weeks to 11 October, found the fastest acceleration of cases in the north west, while Scotland, Wales, London and the Midlands were also increasing, but more slowly. Prof Tim Spector from King's College London, who foundedthe Covid Symptom study app,external, said there was no longer the ""exponential increases"" of a couple of weeks ago - but the data still shows ""new cases continuing to rise"". Other estimates, from a large study by Imperial College London and a group of scientists advising government, suggest new cases could be even higher - up to 74,000 a day. A different measures of cases - the number of people with symptoms to test positive for coronavirus - rose by 15,650 on Friday, the lowest for four days. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The R number is the average number of people infected by each person testing positive for the virus. An R number above 1 means the epidemic is growing. At the peak of the epidemic back in April, the R number is thought to have been around 3. From May up until mid-August after the national lockdown, it stayed below 1, but has been rising steadily since. All the restrictions in place around the UK are now an attempt to reduce transmission of the virus between people and get it back to below 1.

British Airways fined Â£20m over data breach,"British Airways has been fined Â£20m ($26m) by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for a data breach which affected more than 400,000 customers. The breach took place in 2018 and affected both personal and credit card data. The fine is considerably smaller than the Â£183m that the ICO originally said it intended to issue back in 2019. It said ""the economic impact of Covid-19"" had been taken into account. However, it is still the largest penalty issued by the ICO to date. The incident took place when BA's systems were compromised by its attackers, and then modified to harvest customers' details as they were input. It was two months before BA was made aware of it by a security researcher, and then notified the ICO. How did hackers get into British Airways? BA boss apologises for data breach The data stolen included log in, payment card and travel booking details as well name and address information. A subsequent investigation concluded that sufficient security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, were not in place at the time. The ICO noted that some of these measures were available on the Microsoft operating system that BA was using at the time. ""When organisations take poor decisions around people's personal data, that can have a real impact on people's lives. The law now gives us the tools to encourage businesses to make better decisions about data, including investing in up-to-date security,"" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. British Airways said it had alerted customers as soon as it had found out about the attack on its systems. ""We are pleased the ICO recognises that we have made considerable improvements toâ¯the security of our systems since the attack and that we fully co-operated with its investigation,"" said a spokesman. Data protection officer Carl Gottlieb said that in the current climate, Â£20m was a ""massive"" fine. ""It shows the ICO means business and is not letting struggling companies off the hook for their data protection failures,"" he said. It's taken more than two years for BA to face the music over this extremely serious incident. The company breached data protection law and failed to protect themselves from preventable cyber attack. It then failed to detect the hack until the damage was done to hundreds of thousands of customers. The lag between incident and fine has raised eyebrows in privacy circles but I understand the Information Commissioner's Office has been working methodically to get it right. This is the commissioner's first major fine under the EU data regulation GDPR and was being watched closely by the rest of Europe as a potential landmark decision. The final figure of Â£20m has come as a shock to many who were expecting it to be closer to the eye-watering Â£183m initially proposed but it is still a significant moment for data privacy and GDPR. Other companies will look at the fine as a shape of things to come if they also fail to protect customers. In a post-Covid world, the ICO may not be as gentle.

PM warns he may 'need to intervene' on Manchester,"This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson says the spread of coronavirus in Greater Manchester is ""grave"" and he may ""need to intervene"" if new measures are not agreed. The prime minister urged mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively"" with the government over the region entering ""very high"" tier three measures. He said the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the essence"". Mr Burnham, who wants more financial aid for workers affected, said regional leaders will meet No 10 at ""any time"". Measures under tier three include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Liverpool City Region was the first of England's regions to enter the very high alert level. Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three from Saturdaywith a financial support package worth Â£42m. Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. What are the tier 2 and tier 3 rules coming in this weekend? Can I stay with my partner in tier 2? And other questions Lancashire rising to highest Covid alert level What is a circuit-breaker? PM appears confused over single parent rules Speaking at a Downing Street briefing on Friday, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""reluctance"" of local leaders to put the region under tougher restrictions and said it would be ""far from a pain-free course of action"". He warned: ""Of course, if agreement cannot be reached I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester's hospitals and save the lives of Manchester's residents. ""But our efforts would be so much more effective if we work together."" Revealing that a deal had not been reached between No 10 and the region's leaders, Mr Johnson said it was time for action to be taken. ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die,"" he said. In a joint statement with Greater Manchester's deputy mayors and council leaders, Mr Burnham said they had sought a further meeting with Downing Street officials - and this did not happen. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward,"" they said. They said they had done ""everything within our power to protect the health of our residents"" but are not convinced that closing pubs and bars is the only way to protect hospitals. Instead, they want other measures like shielding to be considered, and tougher penalties on venues that do not comply to Covid regulations, including instant closure powers. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" they said, adding that the current proposals do not ""provide adequate support"". Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt The latest government figures showed there were 15,650 new cases reported on Friday, bringing the total to 689,257. There were a further 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 43,429. Mr Johnson said he hoped the most stringent ""very high"" restrictions could be lifted as quickly as possible for the affected regions. He said: ""The amount by which we need to reduce the R is not as big as it was right back in the beginning of the spread of this disease. ""If we all work together on the measures we have outlined we can definitely do it."" The reproduction (R) number has risen slightly to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread across the country. The PM said he wanted to avoid another national lockdown ""if at all possible"" amid calls for a circuit-breaker - a short, limited lockdown - across the country. He said he disagreed with those who argued in favour of a national lockdown ""instead of targeted local action"", insisting: ""Closing businesses in Cornwall where transmission is low will not cut transmission in Manchester"". Mr Johnson said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wanted to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said during the briefing that the nation is in a ""different situation"" from when the Sage group of scientists recommended a two-to-three week national ""circuit break"" to stop the spread of coronavirus. He said the situation had changed, adding: ""We recommended in September taking a circuit break. The idea there was that actually a two-week interruption would set cases back probably to the levels they were in August and then at those levels, test and trace is more effective to keep control. ""Where we are now is of course a different situation. It's crucial that where the R is above 1 and the numbers are high we get R below 1 for all the reasons that have been outlined, including of course the hospitalisations which are increasing. So it's crucial that's done, and there are a number of ways that can be done."" He added that would only be achieved by combining ""tier three baseline conditions"" suggested by the government with some extra measures agreed in an affected region using ""local knowledge and local insight"".

Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         The PM said accepting increased coronavirus restrictions was the ""right and responsible"" measure to protect the NHS. He added: ""Without action, there is no doubt that our NHS would soon be struggling to treat the sheer number of people seriously ill with Covid. ""Non-Covid treatments and surgeries would need to be cancelled to cope and many more people would die."" Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris MP said it was ""damaging"" for Mr Johnson to avoid a full lockdown and that the regional approach is not enough. ""We need this circuit-breaker to give us time to sort these significant problems in testing and tracing,"" he said. ""We've had the worst week last week for tracing. The system's falling over. The prime minister is desperate to avoid lockdown just as he was at the beginning of the pandemic - but we know that that delay at the beginning was really damaging."" On Thursday, London, Essex, York and parts of Surrey, Derbyshire and Cumbria were moved up to tier two and will face tougher measures from Saturday. More than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The PM also revealed that the UK is developing the capacity to manufacture millions of new fast turnaround tests for coronavirus - with some saliva tests able to deliver results in 15 minutes. He said distribution and trials of the tests would start over ""the next few weeks"" and would enable NHS and care home staff to be tested ""more frequently"". Schoolchildren and university students would also be able to be tested, he said, to help keep education ""open safely over the winter"".

Fortnight 'fire-break' likely within days,"Wales appears to be heading for another lockdown People in Wales are facing a national lockdown lasting at least two weeks in plans described as a ""fire-break"" by the first minister. Mark Drakeford said it would be a ""short, sharp"" circuit-breaker to slow down the virus. He said a decision was likely to be made on Monday, while talks continue with health officials, scientific advisors and councils over the weekend. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said. ""A 'fire-break' would also mean a short, sharp shock to all our lives. ""We would all have to stay at home to once again save lives. But this time it would be for weeks not months."" Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford warned that 2,500 people were now being infected with coronavirus every day in Wales, with critical care units in hospitals full. ""A successful fire-break would re-set the virus at a lower level,"" he added. ""Together with a new national set of rules for the whole of Wales after the fire-break period we would have slowed the virus down enough to get us through to Christmas."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said Mr Drakeford was quoting the estimated number of cases, including untested and asymptomatic, not the daily confirmed casesreported by Public Health Wales. ""There will be many people who don't get a test who have symptoms and large numbers who are asymptomatic,"" she said. ""The numbers the first minister reported today come from TAC (Technical Advisory Cell which advices the Welsh Government) and are the scientific community's best understanding of the number of cases based on a wide range of indicators."" The TAC's latest summary says the daily growth rate is estimated by Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) to be between 0.02 and 0.07 in Wales, indicating that infections could be increasing by between 2% and 7% per day. Currently about 2.3 million people in Wales are living in communities under local lockdown rules, with other communities living under different rules. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said that following any ""fire-break"" period, consistent national rules would be put in place to keep the level of the virus low. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 ""If we do this, we would much rather not have to do this again before the end of the year,"" he said, adding ministers needed to find rules people could live with. ""A set of consistent national rules will be really important, so people can look forward to the end of the year and recognise who they can spend their festive period with."" Plaid Cymru has been calling on Mr Drakeford to introduce the circuit-breaker without delay, while Labour at Westminster says a similar approach should be adopted in England. The British Medical Association in Wales, which represents doctors, said it would welcome a circuit-breaker lockdown. ""Cases are climbing fast across Wales with the latest figures showing that the number of Covid-related patients in the Welsh NHS has risen by 49% in a week,"" said Dr David Bailey, from BMA Wales. ""It's clear that the current restrictions are not strong enough to suppress the spread of the virus. ""Doctors in Wales support, and are calling for as a matter of urgency, a circuit-breaker lockdown for a number of weeks. ""It is imperative that robust action is taken now without delay, to protect the citizens of Wales, and the Welsh NHS."" Discussions on a fire-break lockdown will continue over the weekend Giving a briefing on Friday, the first minister said any fire-break lockdown in Wales would not be ""a magic wand"". He said restrictions would not ""make coronavirus disappear"" but they would ""buy time"". ""I can't offer a guaranteeâ¦ that it would not be necessary to take further measures later in the winter,"" he added. ""But I'm focused on the immediate situation, the immediate difficulties faced by our national health service by the continuing spread of the virus in all parts of Wales, and we have to act to deal with that now in this planned and pre-emptive way."" Mr Drakeford said ministers were drawing up plans for a new business support package before taking a final decision on any circuit-breaker. Allow Facebook content?

The General Secretary of TUC Wales Shavanah Taj said: ""The question is, what does that look like and how does that actually impact jobs?"" Ms Taj said if a short lockdown was brought in, jobs and businesses needed protection. ""The hospitality industry in particular supports tens of thousands of jobs throughout Wales and we do need to be doing everything possible to make sure that these workers in particular are not left unsupported,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales. ""We've got to be doing everything possible to avoid mass job losses and business closures at all costs."" Will areas such as the Brecon Beacons be off limits again? Rosemarie Harris, the leader of Powys council said she also expected the circuit-breaker action to be taken. ""Maybe two or three weeks of lockdown, a similar lockdown to before where we are all required to stay at home,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I'm not comfortable with it, but I would say that there is probably a majority support for it, as long as it is fairly short and sharp and that we have an exit strategy."" However, she said she would be seeking financial support for businesses that will be hit by any lockdown. ""It will - again - be difficult for Powys. We are travellers, because we have to be - we have no district general hospital within the county, we have no higher education, many people go out [of the county] for work, for shopping,"" she said. As part of a short lockdown in Northern Ireland, schools are closing for two weeks at half term. On Thursday morning, Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the government was discussing ""whether a circuit-breaker is an appropriate step"". That included considering ""what role education has to play in all of that and then we need to be able to give families advance notice if there is to be a change of circumstance"". Laura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT, said any decision ""needs to be communicated clearly to schools and parents"". ""It needs to be made to give everyone enough time to prepare for the impact any school closures may have"". Salon owner Charlotte Griffiths said she is concerned more restrictions may hit the hair and beauty industry Charlotte Griffiths, who owns a beauty salon in Cardiff, said she is concerned over the prospect of more restrictions. She said: ""It will affect us a lot, more so because we've only just managed to get back up on our feet from the last lockdown. ""We've only been open since November of last year, so we've spent the last year building our client base and we're now in a position where we've just broken even from the last lockdown, and it's about to hit again. ""They talk about hospitality and other industries, but they don't talk about the hair and beauty industry. We're a safe industry, but we're not recognised."" A total of 17 areas in Wales are under local lockdown because of rising infection rates - meaning people cannot travel outside of their area and indoor meetings are restricted. The first minister confirmed on Friday that all the local restrictions would remain in force across Wales ""for at least another seven days"". ""The general trend in Wales is a worsening situation and most areas where local restrictions are in place have reported a seven-day trend where Covid-19 cases have increased,"" he said. He said the local lockdowns did appear to have slowed the spread of Covid and were ""making a positive difference"". CIRCUIT BREAKER:What does a short lockdown mean?

Lancashire rising to highest Covid alert level,"People in Blackpool will be among those affected by the new rules Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three - the top level of England Covid restrictions - from Saturday. The ""very high"" alert level measures include pub closures and bans on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and most outdoor venues. However, gyms and leisure centres would not close, unlike in Liverpool City Region -  the other area in tier three. Some local council leaders said they had been ""bullied"" into accepting the deal by Downing Street. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had ""worked intensively with local leaders"" to agree the move. He added that an ""unrelenting rise in cases"" in the north-west England county had meant ""we must act now"". Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. Latest reaction from Lancashire 'Massive disappointment' over tier 3 move Can I stay with my partner if we live in a Tier 2 area? What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? The Labour leaders of Preston, Pendle and South Ribble councils released statements saying they had been forced to accept a deal that would not be enough to stop the virus. Paul Foster, of South Ribble said: ""We have been bullied, harassed, threatened and blackmailed into moving into tier three."" He added: ""The discussions with government were a complete shambles and we were basically told if we didn't accept the restrictions we would have even more draconian measures imposed on us."" However, Geoff Driver, the Conservative leader of Lancashire County Council, told the BBC: ""It's been a long drawn out process but I think we've got a good deal."" He said it involved a support package worth Â£42m, the area having initially been promised Â£12m, with Â£30m to help the businesses affected. Mr Driver said Lancashire had also been promised more support for local test and trace and a specific ministerial team to deal with the outbreak in the county. ""What we've been able to do is to convince government that the measures we have in place to monitor such things as the gyms and the leisure centres are sufficient to ensure that they're not a source of infection,"" he added. The new measures, which will be reviewed every two weeks, cover all parts of Lancashire: People must not socialise with anybody they do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, in any indoor setting or in any private garden or at most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events People from different households can still meet in an outdoor public space such as a park or beach, the countryside, a public garden or a sports venue, in groups of six or less All pubs and bars must close, unless they are serving substantial meals Residents should avoid staying overnight in another part of the UK, and others should avoid staying overnight in the area People should try to avoid travelling outside the very high alert level area or entering the very high alert level area, other than for essential journeys or to travel through as part of a longer journey From Monday 19 October, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops and soft play areas must close and car boot sale will not be permitted Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region, gyms and leisure centres have also been forced to close. Mayor of Liverpool Joe Andersontweeted:,external""Liverpool City Region has demanded immediate clarification on why Lancashire gyms are allowed to stay open and Liverpool's close. ""Inconsistent mess - we now have tier three A and tier three B."" Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he was ""concerned that there appear to be differences between the two packages of measures, particularly the opening of gyms"". ""We have always been clear that we were given no choice about the specific package of measures that would be applied to us,"" he said. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was up to regional leaders to decide whether gyms should be closed. ""The purpose of the very high level is to allow for local, tailored interventions and they are determined on the basis of discussions with local authorities and based on local evidence,"" he said.

"UK's trade talks with EU are over, says No 10","This video can not be played The PM says it is time to ""get readyâ for trading arrangements with the EU to be ""more like Australia's"" from 1 January. Talks between the UK and EU over a post-Brexit trade agreement are ""over"", Downing Street has said. No 10 argued there was ""no point"" in discussions continuing next week unless the EU was prepared to discuss the detailed legal text of a partnership. UK chief negotiator Lord Frost said he had told EU counterpart Michel Barnier there was now no ""basis"" for planned talks on Monday. Number 10 said the two sides had agreed to talk again next week - by phone. Earlier, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the Brussels negotiating team would go to London after the weekend to ""intensify"" discussions. France's Europe minister ClÃ©ment Beaune told BBC Newsnight that, while the EU would not pursue a deal at any cost, ""we will listen to what the UK side wants to say to us"". Meanwhile, ratings agency Moody's has downgraded the UK's credit status, citing falling economic strength due to the coronavirus pandemic and uncertainty over Brexit. EU leaders call for UK trade talks to continue Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? The prime minister had set this week's EU summit as the deadline for the two sides to agree a deal. But there are still major disagreements over fishing rights and state help for businesses. And the UK government hardened up its message to the EU over the course of Friday. In the morning, Boris Johnson said the country had to ""get ready"" to trade next year without an agreement, although he did not say the talks were over. He suggested the EU was unwilling to consider seriously the UK's preferred option of a comprehensive free trade agreement based on the bloc's existing arrangement with Canada. The UK, he added, must look at the ""alternative"" - which he suggested was Australia's much-more limited set of agreements with the EU. ""The talks are over."" As statements go, those four words from the prime minister's spokesman this afternoon were something of a bombshell. But Michel Barnier, due to come to London next week to continue talks, might not be unpacking his briefcase just yet. There's no doubt that Downing Street is sending the clearest signal possible that it expects the EU to make the next move. And the rhetoric accompanying the talks has reached a new level. But both sides still want a deal, the process has not broken down and there is still time to reach an agreement. It's one thing to declare the talks over; it's another thing to refuse to continue talking. The prime minister's official spokesman took a tougher line with Brussels later in the day. ""There is only any point in Michel Barnier coming to London next week if he's prepared to address all the issues on the basis of a legal text in an accelerated way, without the UK required to make all the moves or to discuss the practicalities of travel and haulage,"" he said. ""If not, there is no point in coming."" What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Brexit: What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? He added: ""Trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying they do not want to change their negotiating position."" The UK and EU had been hoping for a ""zero-tariff"" agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. If no deal is reached, they will operate on World Trade Organization rules, meaning tariffs are imposed. Mrs von der Leyen (R) left the summit early after exchanging views with EU leaders By BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake Boris Johnson's public declaration that the UK should prepare for no deal did not cause great concern within EU circles. The immediate response came in a tweet from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who said it was full steam ahead for trade talks next week and that EU negotiators would be getting on the Eurostar to London as planned. But the subsequent statement from the prime minister's official spokesman that the ""trade talks are over"" has left senior diplomats ""deeply unimpressed"", as one put it. Although ""we're getting used to being part of Johnson's pantomime"", they added. Some EU figures fear Boris Johnson still doesn't know if he actually wants a deal and is trying to buy time while he grapples with the Covid crisis. Following the hardening of the British position by No 10, France's President Macron called on the prime minister to make up his mind, while there was still time. Many in Brussels remain ""cautiously optimistic"" some sort of deal can be agreed, but any route there is now even harder to see. After the EU summit concluded on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be best to get a deal and that compromises on both sides would be needed. French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK needed a Brexit deal more than the EU did. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves urged the UK government to ""step back from the brink"" and ""stop posturing"". ""Any tariffs or any delays at the border will make it harder for goods to flow freely, whether those are foods or medicines,"" she said.

"Â£40m fund a 'drop in the ocean' for closed pubsThe Scottish government's funding package for pubs and restaurants is not nearly enough, industry leaders warn.Scotland","Pubs and restaurants across the central belt were ordered to close last Friday The Scottish government's Â£40m package for licensed premises affected by coronavirus restrictions is a ""drop in the ocean"", industry leaders have said. Businesses such as pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for grants of up to Â£3,000 if they have been closed. They will be to claim up to Â£1,500 if they are still open but are seeing reduced trade. The Scottish Hospitality Group said the money ""would not touch the sides"" of what was needed. The group, which represents some of the country's best known hospitality firms, also criticised a lack of clarity about when the grants - which open for applications next Tuesday - would actually be paid out. It said this made it difficult for business owners to plan ahead. No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopen Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch Scotland's finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said she wanted to make sure businesses received the money ""as quickly as possible"". However, she acknowledged that it would not be enough to fully cover the income that licensed premises had lost either through closure or by having their opening hours restricted. Pubs and restaurants in five health board areas across the central belt of Scotland have been closed for the past week, with tough restrictions placed on licensed premises elsewhere in the country. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already warned that things will not return to normal when the current restrictions expire on 26 October, with the Scottish government planning to bring in a tiered system of restrictions at that point - similar to the one already in place in England. The first minister has warned that things will not return to normal when the current restrictions on licensed premises expire later this month Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery said funding support offered to the sector, which employs nearly 300,000 people in Scotland, was ""absolutely no good at all"". He added: ""It's not going to touch the sides and we're looking at bringing redundancies forward. ""Â£40m may sound like a lot of money, but Liverpool City Council brought Â£40m over a weekend to support 3,000 businesses. ""In Scotland we've got Â£40m to support 20,000 businesses who are subject to restrictions of some kind."" Mr Montgomery also told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the industry had been ""absolutely crippled through no fault of our own"" by the restrictions. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         And he said businesses still do not know when they would receive the money, which is intended to see them through until+ 26 October, or what would happen after that date. He added: ""It opens on 20 October but we don't know when we are going to get paid it. ""The people that are indirectly affected by it â how much they are going to get? When they are going to get it? ""This should have all been planned long before the announcement last week."" His concerns were echoed by James Brown, the managing director of Brewdog Bars, who said the Â£40m fund was a ""drop in the ocean"" for the industry. Many pubs and restaurants believe they have been unfairly treated by the current restrictions Mr Brown added: ""The ones that are really going to struggle are the independent pubs - who are the lifeblood of our community - and the late night industry, which is on its knees. ""Nightclubs haven't been able to open since lockdown and there is no end in sight. ""We want to show our support and call for the government to provide more assistance. That Â£40m is a drop in the ocean for what is actually needed to help these businesses and keep jobs"". Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland that she fully understood the concerns. She added: ""The grant support will never replace all lost income and it can never be distributed fast enough because businesses are battling for survival and have been for many months. ""We want to get that money out the door as quickly as possible."" Ms Forbes said the size of the grants reflected that the current restrictions were intended to be a ""short, sharp intervention"". But she said they would never be a replacement for the UK government's furlough scheme, which she said had been a ""lifeline"" for businesses. And she repeated her call for furlough to be fully extended by the UK government at the end of the month. The Chancellor has already unveiled a replacement for the furlough scheme, which will end on 31 October UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled plans for a new Job Support Scheme, which will replace the current furlough scheme from 1 November. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise the pay of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to lower demand. Workers who do at least a third of their normal hours will be paid by their employer for those hours. The government and the employer will also pay a third each for the hours they cannot work. It means someone working a third of their hours would receive 77% of their pay, with the government grant capped at Â£697.92 per month. All small and medium sized businesses will be eligible for the UK-wide scheme, which aims to stop mass job cuts when furlough ends.

France grapples with freedom of speech,"A statue on Place de la Republique, Paris, symbolically ""gagged"" by protesters after the Charlie Hebdo attacks When French President Francois Hollande gave a sombre televised address to the nation, hours after the shocking attack on Charlie Hebdo, he vowed to protect the message of freedom that the magazine's journalists represented. Charlie Hebdo's ""heroes"" had defended freedom of speech and this was an attack on the entire republic, he said. But since the start of the week, 54 people have been detained and several jailed for a variety of remarks, shouted out in the street or posted on social media, and France's judiciary has been lampooned for what appear to be double standards. The so-called comic Dieudonne M'bala M'bala will face trial for writing ""I feel like Charlie Coulibaly"", hours after 3.7 million French citizens had taken to the streets behind the ""je suis Charlie"" rallying cry. He said the posting was meant to be humorous. But in the context of his past convictions for anti-Semitism, the authorities saw it as a voice of support for one of the gunmen, Amedy Coulibaly, who had murdered four Jewish men in a kosher supermarket. Dieudonne could face up to seven years in jail for his Facebook comment Prime Minister Manuel Valls set it out plainly: freedom of speech should not be confused with anti-Semitism, racism and Holocaust denial. But Dieudonne has plenty of young fans who watch his shows and follow his social media posts, however tasteless they may be, and many in France saw his arrest as an example of double standards. After all, Charlie Hebdo's entire ethos has been tasteless lampooning of the establishment. ""Extremely clumsy to detain Dieudonne when you've just made the whole world march for freedom of speech,"" read one tweet. But the crackdown extends way beyond a notorious comic with a string of convictions. The justice ministry has revealed that a number of fast-track custodial sentences have been handed down in cities across France in the past few days for expressions of support for the gunmen. In Toulouse alone, three men in their early twenties have been jailed, two of them for 10 months, for shouting obscenities at police. One threatened to attack police with a Kalashnikov while another said the Kouachi brothers were ""just the start"". It was in Toulouse that Islamist gunman Mohamed Merah killed seven people in a series of attacks in 2012, including one on a Jewish school. In Nanterre, east of Paris, a man was sent to prison for a year for posting a video on Facebook that mocked policeman Ahmed Merabet, who was shot at point-blank range by one of the Kouachis. The French government tightened anti-terror laws in November, clamping down on online comments Human rights groups have been less than impressed with what would seem to be a knee-jerk response by the authorities after what Mr Valls admitted had been clear failings by the security services. France's League of Human Rights (LDH) has condemned the fast-track sentences, which it argues are handed down in dreadful conditions and largely apply to drunks or fools. But while the sentences may look startling and in some cases even draconian, they are following the letter of an anti-terror law that was passed by the National Assembly as recently as last November. Directly provoking or publicly condoning terrorism in France now commands a five-year jail term and a fine of â¬75,000. And if it is done online, the penalty can be extended to seven years and â¬100,000 (Â£76,000; $116,000). So for the many French who did not feel ""je suis Charlie"", where does France now see the boundary between freedom of speech and condoning terrorism? The right to say, write or print what you want is rooted in thedeclaration of rights,externalthat came with the 1789 French Revolution, but even then abuse of that freedom was limited by law. Those exceptions were definedin 1881 (in French),externalas defamation, slander and incitement to hate. There is also explicit reference to condoning crimes of war, crimes against humanity or collaboration with the enemy. Not everyone has felt comfortable with the ""je suis Charlie"" message in France However, not since the revolution has blasphemy been against the law in France, and according to Mr Valls it never will. The restrictions on freedom of speech go well beyond those in the US. A former editor of Charlie Hebdo had to defend himself against incitement in 2007 after reprinting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Since November those restrictions have gone further still. What was previously a law against condoning terrorism in the media has been extended to social media too. And it will not just be careless tweets or Facebook posts that are caught in the crosshairs. US-based social media companies will be required to police their sites too.

Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie',"Police have been deployed to guard Sarcelles' synagogue French Muslims disgusted by the shootings in Paris may nonetheless have reasons for not embracing the slogan ""I am Charlie"". ""For a Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad is more important than their own parents,"" says the young man I meet in Sarcelles, his face twisted with contempt for the caricatures Charlie Hebdo published. His friend, also 18, nods in agreement as we stand on a street in this Paris dormitory town, famous in France for its large Sephardic Jewish community. ""They were warned but they kept on mocking the prophet,"" he continues. ""But you cannot kill for that. You cannot go against press freedom in France. Still, they will have to answer to God."" ""Real Muslims condemn these attacks,"" adds a third man, 22 and also Muslim. ""Those who committed them were insane. The attack on the kosher supermarket was a catastrophe for France and for the world. If you kill one man it is like you kill all of humanity. That is how we think."" We stand chatting openly on the pavement but nobody wants to be identified. Mistrust of the media runs deep since an outburst of violence last July when police held rioters back from entering the town's Jewish area as they raged at Israel's bombardment of Gaza. Sarcelles has a sizeable Muslim community An invisible line marks the beginning of the Jewish area on Avenue Paul Valery, scene of the confrontation with the police. It starts just before a Holocaust monument and a synagogue. There is no sign of trouble but it has been guarded by CRS riot police since last week. David, a kosher businessman I encounter, is so dismayed by the deterioration he perceives in community relations in France that he foresees a time when the ""great majority"" of its half-million or so Jews will emigrate. But the Muslim teenager accuses French media of exaggerating the divisions in Sarcelles, where Jews now make up about a quarter of the 60,000-strong population. ""We say one thing, you might write another,"" he suggests, smiling. When I ask how he and his friends relate to the town's Jewish community, they say they have Jewish friends and ""nothing has changed"". ""Mosques get attacked but that doesn't make the news,"" he adds. The older of the three speaks with real warmth of the French values of liberty, equality and fraternity which were schooled into him. Solidarity rallies were staged across France on Sunday, gathering millions of people ""When I go on holiday to Morocco, I know I could never live there because people make me feel French,"" he says of his ancestral country. ""But in France I am made to feel Moroccan,"" he adds. ""Am I going up to the Jewish area?"" asks the younger man. The Jews got the nice part of Sarcelles, he explains, a little sourly, while we got this, gesturing back to the long blocks of uniform five-storey council flats stretching down to the railway station. Actually, there was a time when Jewish immigrants from the former French colonies lived there themselves in numbers, and some Jews still do, but the demographic has changed. By the mosque near the station, old men sit and chat in Arabic. A Tunisian Muslim pensioner I meet gives two reasons why he shunned Sunday's national unity march in Paris, while condemning the attacks. Like the teenagers, he is indignant at the cartoons Charlie Hebdo published: ""It set out to provoke people for its own amusement. ""It attacked their religion. Make fun of yourselves if you will, but leave others alone. The media is like a car: you need to have a licence to be on the road, otherwise you will be a danger to others. Charlie had no licence to put people's lives at risk with their provocations."" His other reason is the presence at the march of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu whom he calls ""the biggest terrorist in the world"" because of the Gaza conflict. He insists he is not anti-Jewish, saying he had Jewish friends back in Tunisia. Another Muslim pensioner I meet separately, a man from Morocco, says he has Jewish friends too, here in France, men he will ""have a coffee or beer with"". He takes a rather detached view of Charlie Hebdo, dismissing it as a fringe paper he never wanted to read. ""But I am 200% in support of freedom of expression,"" he declares. More Muslims might have attended the march had they not felt ""shame"", he suggests, at the actions of gunmen claiming to defend Islam. ""Muslims may also fear retaliation by jihadists if they take to the streets,"" he adds. He himself is uneasy after the attacks. ""Nobody is safe now,"" he says before directing me to the nearest tram stop. As my tram glides out of Sarcelles, I reflect that I have not seen a single ""I am Charlie"" poster or pencil symbol since my arrival yet the quiet battle of ideas here is no less intense than in Paris itself.

New Scottish face covering rules come into force,"Face masks are now required in workplace areas such as canteens, with the rules set to extend to corridors Face coverings must now be worn in workplace canteens in Scotland under new rules that have come into force. Other communal workplace areas such as corridors will also be included in the restrictions from Monday. But the rules on wearing face coverings at wedding and civil partnership ceremonies have been relaxed slightly. It means the couple will no longer have to cover their faces during the ceremony so long as they are at least 2m away from everyone else. Face coverings were already required in a number of public settings in Scotland, such as shops and on public transport. They must also be worn in secondary schools by adults and all pupils in areas such as corridors and communal areas where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopen There are exemptions from all of the rules for young children and people with certain health conditions. The new workplace restrictions mean that everyone must cover their face in work canteens unless they are sitting at a table - similar to the rules for cafes - and in most other communal areas. The measures were announced on Thursday by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said they were needed as part of the response to an increase in the number of cases and deaths across the country in recent weeks. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Ms Sturgeon said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. A further 1,196 cases of the virus were recorded on Friday, bringing the total number since the pandemic began to 45,232. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 27 to 629 since Thursday, with 58 patients being treated in intensive care - an increase of six. The deaths of nine more people who died after testing positive for Covid-19 have also been registered, bringing the total under that measure to 2,594. Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have been closed until at least 26 October, with tough restrictions placed on licensed premises elsewhere in the country. And strict rules on household mixing that were introduced three weeks ago mean that people are generally not allowed to visit other homes. Couples who are getting married or entering civil partnerships no longer need to cover their faces during the ceremony Ms Sturgeon has said that these measures - particularly the most recent ones for pubs and restaurants - will not yet be having an impact on the number of cases of the virus that are being detected. She has also warned that tougher measures may have to be introduced in the future, and that the country will not return to normal when the current restrictions on licensed premises expire on 26 October. The Scottish government intends to introduce a tiered system of restrictions at that point, similar to the one that came into force in England earlier this week. It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and to improve compliance with the rules - particularly around self-isolation. How does England's tiered system work? The English system has been highly controversial, with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnhamthreatening to ""stand firm""against plans to move it into the highest Tier 3 category of restrictions. Mr Burnham has described the tiered strategy as being ""flawed"" and ""unfair"", and has called for greater financial support to be given by the UK government to people affected by tougher rules. However, neighbouringLancashire has agreed a deal to enter Tier 3, the BBC has been told. An official announcement on the new measures is expected later. It will become the second part of England, after the Liverpool City Region, to go into Tier 3.

Â£40m fund a 'drop in the ocean' for closed pubs,"Pubs and restaurants across the central belt were ordered to close last Friday The Scottish government's Â£40m package for licensed premises affected by coronavirus restrictions is a ""drop in the ocean"", industry leaders have said. Businesses such as pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for grants of up to Â£3,000 if they have been closed. They will be to claim up to Â£1,500 if they are still open but are seeing reduced trade. The Scottish Hospitality Group said the money ""would not touch the sides"" of what was needed. The group, which represents some of the country's best known hospitality firms, also criticised a lack of clarity about when the grants - which open for applications next Tuesday - would actually be paid out. It said this made it difficult for business owners to plan ahead. No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopen Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch Scotland's finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said she wanted to make sure businesses received the money ""as quickly as possible"". However, she acknowledged that it would not be enough to fully cover the income that licensed premises had lost either through closure or by having their opening hours restricted. Pubs and restaurants in five health board areas across the central belt of Scotland have been closed for the past week, with tough restrictions placed on licensed premises elsewhere in the country. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already warned that things will not return to normal when the current restrictions expire on 26 October, with the Scottish government planning to bring in a tiered system of restrictions at that point - similar to the one already in place in England. The first minister has warned that things will not return to normal when the current restrictions on licensed premises expire later this month Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery said funding support offered to the sector, which employs nearly 300,000 people in Scotland, was ""absolutely no good at all"". He added: ""It's not going to touch the sides and we're looking at bringing redundancies forward. ""Â£40m may sound like a lot of money, but Liverpool City Council brought Â£40m over a weekend to support 3,000 businesses. ""In Scotland we've got Â£40m to support 20,000 businesses who are subject to restrictions of some kind."" Mr Montgomery also told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the industry had been ""absolutely crippled through no fault of our own"" by the restrictions. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         And he said businesses still do not know when they would receive the money, which is intended to see them through until+ 26 October, or what would happen after that date. He added: ""It opens on 20 October but we don't know when we are going to get paid it. ""The people that are indirectly affected by it â how much they are going to get? When they are going to get it? ""This should have all been planned long before the announcement last week."" His concerns were echoed by James Brown, the managing director of Brewdog Bars, who said the Â£40m fund was a ""drop in the ocean"" for the industry. Many pubs and restaurants believe they have been unfairly treated by the current restrictions Mr Brown added: ""The ones that are really going to struggle are the independent pubs - who are the lifeblood of our community - and the late night industry, which is on its knees. ""Nightclubs haven't been able to open since lockdown and there is no end in sight. ""We want to show our support and call for the government to provide more assistance. That Â£40m is a drop in the ocean for what is actually needed to help these businesses and keep jobs"". Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland that she fully understood the concerns. She added: ""The grant support will never replace all lost income and it can never be distributed fast enough because businesses are battling for survival and have been for many months. ""We want to get that money out the door as quickly as possible."" Ms Forbes said the size of the grants reflected that the current restrictions were intended to be a ""short, sharp intervention"". But she said they would never be a replacement for the UK government's furlough scheme, which she said had been a ""lifeline"" for businesses. And she repeated her call for furlough to be fully extended by the UK government at the end of the month. The Chancellor has already unveiled a replacement for the furlough scheme, which will end on 31 October UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled plans for a new Job Support Scheme, which will replace the current furlough scheme from 1 November. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise the pay of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to lower demand. Workers who do at least a third of their normal hours will be paid by their employer for those hours. The government and the employer will also pay a third each for the hours they cannot work. It means someone working a third of their hours would receive 77% of their pay, with the government grant capped at Â£697.92 per month. All small and medium sized businesses will be eligible for the UK-wide scheme, which aims to stop mass job cuts when furlough ends.

Before we do, here are the main UK stories from today:  Here are the main stories from around the world today: Danai HowardBBC News Internet searches in Hong Kong for flights to Singapore have jumped by 400% following the announcement that the two cities were planning a potential ""travel bubble"". The travel website Expedia said it saw a three-digit surge in the number of customers, while prices for flights in December rose by at least 57% in the last 24 hours, to $3,297 [Hong Kong dollars] (Â£329) for a round-trip. Meanwhile, the share price for Hong Kongâs airline Cathay Pacific jumped by 7% following the announcement on Thursday. The travel bubble would mean that people would be able to travel between Hong Kong and Singapore without the need to quarantine, but Singaporeâs Transport Minister, Ong Ye Kung, has said travellers would still need to have received negative Covid-19 test results to travel under the scheme. International travel to Asia collapsed during the pandemic, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. The Singapore-Hong Kong deal will provide some much-needed relief for the regionâs aviation and tourism sectors. âIt is a safe, careful, but significant step forward to revive air travel, and provide a model for future collaboration with other parts of the world,"" Mr Ong said.    Tensions are running high between Downing Street and local leaders in Greater Manchester, who have been unable to agree on whether the areas should move to England's highest, tier-three level of Covid restrictions. Mayor Andy Burnham, his deputy mayors
and other Greater Manchester leaders have just released a statement, saying: ""At our last meeting with Downing Street officials yesterday morning, we were told they would arrange a further meeting later in the day to provide a response to our requests. That did not happen and, despite being on standby all day today, we are still waiting for it to be arranged. We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward. They add that they are ânot convinced that
closing hospitality venues is the only way to protect hospitals"" and they would prefer to look at other measures ""such as reinstating shielding arrangements and
introducing tougher instant closure powers on non-compliant pubs, restaurants,
shops and other business premisesâ. It comes after Prime
Minister Boris Johnson warned he may âhave to interveneâ if tier-three measures were not
agreed for Manchester. The
prime minister urged Mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively""
with the government, saying the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the
essence"". Circuit breaker lockdowns have been used in some countries such as Singapore and Israel as way of reducing the number of cases of coronavirus by stopping the ways it can spread. Wales says it willspend the next few days considering a circuit-breaker lockdown which they're calling a 'fire break'. But how do they work? How long is a Covid circuit breaker? How can it help fight coronavirus? This video can not be played Circuit breaker lockdown: What is a circuit breaker? Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Belgium is seeing a rise in the number of Covid cases All bars, cafes and
restaurants across Belgium will close from Monday for a month, following a
surge in the number of Covid 19 cases. A night time curfew will also be in place across the country
from Monday from midnight until 5am. The Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo announced the
measures this evening, stating that the country had entered a âvery serious
alert phase, phase fourâ. The measures will also mean that people can only have one
close contact outside of their household, compared to four close contacts
previously. Mr De Croo also stated that working from home will be
compulsory for all workers who are able to. Sales of alcohol will also be
banned after 8pm. He added that the situation could be reviewed after two weeks
for all measures. Belgium has had an average of 6,000 infections and 20 deaths
per day in the past 7 days, including a rise of 7,360 cases in a single day
recorded on Wednesday. The infection rate over the past two weeks stands at 549
infections per 100,000 people. Thatâs an increase of 182% compared to that two
weeks before. The daily flow of patients at several hospitals in Brussels
and Wallonia is starting to put pressure on the health system again, according
to medical staff. Officials have now ordered hospitals to reserve 50% of ICU beds for Covid patients, up from 30%. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has confirmed it will not apply for emergency authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine before late next month - puncturing President Donald Trump's hope for a virus jab before the 3 November presidential election. In a statement, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company may know whether or not their vaccine is effective by the end of October, but that the time needed to collect safety and manufacturing data will push the authorisation date several weeks later. ""We are operating at the speed of science,"" he said. Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be ready before Americans go to the polls next month, fueling speculation that the timeline is politically motivated. At a town hall event last night, Democratic challenger Joe Biden said he would take a vaccine when it becomes ready, if ""the body of scientists"" say it is safe. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says ""there was no contact tracing done"" with him by the White House after he tested positive for Covid-19. ""My contact tracing was done by my local county board of health. They called me when i was in the hospital,"" he said to ABC News in his first televised interview since his release from hospital. The Republican was present at the 26 September Rose Garden event, now under scrutiny as a possible super-spreading event. Christie has since expressed regret over the event, saying he incorrectly believed the White House was a ""safe zone"" and that he was ""wrong"" not to wear a mask. ""I let my guard down. And it was wrong, it was just a big mistake,"" he said to ABC. Asked on Friday if he has since urged President Trump to advocate for mask wearing, Christie said that ""everybody's going to make their own decisions on that"". A new
three-tier system has been introduced in England to help control the spread of
the virus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. But
what rules happen at what tier? The
BBCâs health correspondent, Laura Foster, has a summary. This video can not be played Covid tier lockdown: What is the tier lockdown system in England? As almost
every day brings another record high in the number of daily infections in
Russia, the authorities have been tightening restrictions across the vast
country. They differ
from region to region since President Vladimir Putin delegated significant powers
for fighting the epidemic to local authorities in April. On 16
October, Russia reported another spike of 15,150 new coronavirus cases, up from
13,754 the previous day. In late August, the number was below 5,000. The daily
death toll from Covid-19 has been rising too, reaching an all-time high of 286
yesterday. To combat
the spread of the epidemic, employers in some cities have been told to move at
least some of their staff to home working, some regional administrations have
urged locals to stay at home, but no part of Russia has returned to the strict
lockdown measures that were imposed at the start of the pandemic. Wearing a face mask in shops or on public transport is
mandatory in most Russian regions. Employers in Moscow, Rostov and
Volgograd have been ordered to switch at least 30% of staff
â as well as everyone older than 65 - to working from home. Also in Moscow, the autumn school holidays were
extended from one week to two (until 18 October) and older pupils will be
moved to distance learning until the end of the month. The authorities in Moscow, Volgograd, Khanty-Mansi
Autonomous Area, Nizhny Novgorod Region, Krasnodar Territory
and Russia-annexed Crimea ruled that people over 65, pregnant women
and those with chronic diseases must stay at home. In Rostov, local residents are required to stay at home unless
they are on the way to work, shopping or engaged in one of a number of other
activities such as exercising or walking a dog. Mass public
events are banned in Rostov Region, Krasnodar
Territory, Transbaikal Territory, Udmurtia and the city of
Sevastopol in Crimea. Stavropol Territory requires visitors from other regions to
quarantine for 14 days. Leningrad Regionintroduced,external""red"", ""yellow"" and
""green"" zones depending on the density of Covid-19 cases in the area,
and limits the number of people present in these zones accordingly. Kaliningrad
Region banned cinemas on weekends. Bars and night clubs are closed in
Kaliningrad Region, Chukotka and Rostov Region. Rostov Region and Lipetsk Region suspended routine medical
care, except for urgent conditions, for everyone apart from Covid-19
patients.  Today's developments have done nothing to provide the clarity desperately needed by one business owner in Greater Manchester - who still doesn't know whether her area will move into the highest Covid alert level. Emma Shone, co-owner of gin and whisky bar Number 6 in Sale, Trafford, was left none the wiser after this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. She said: ""Itâs completely frustrating for us as a local business. ""There are no winners in either tier two or tier three but for us he [the prime minister] needs to make that decision. ""We are going into yet another weekend of uncertainty about whether we have the hours for our staff, whether we purchase more stock. ""We went through that last weekend and now we're about to go through it again. ""Given the urgency Boris Johnson makes in all his press conferences, it seems very unclear as to why he wonât make that decision and take it out of the hands of [Greater Manchester Mayor] Andy Burnham, who appears to be making a very political statement as opposed to what is good for our local businesses. ""For us it is just devastating that we still donât have a decision as we go into another weekend."" The US reported more than 65,000 cases across the country on Thursday - the most in a single day since July - as it inches toward a total of eight million infections. Uncontrolled outbreaks are raging on in the Upper Midwest, in states like Wisconsin and Montana. Nearby, North Dakota and South Dakota are now adding more cases than any states have since the start of the pandemic. The return of students to colleges and universities has been linked to the rapid spread. A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost 100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September - around when college students began their return to school - found that weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally. Authorities have also pointed to a rise in ""pandemic fatigue"", now more than six months after the outbreak reached the US.  Passengers were banned from disembarking from a ship in Malta Passengers
have been stopped from disembarking a cruise ship in Malta due to a suspected
case of Covid-19. The MSC
Grandiosa cruise
ship was allowed into Valetta harbour but left the port after collecting
supplies. During
the beginning of the pandemic, cruise ships were involved in a large number of
cases. Malta
allowed cruise ships into its harbours on the condition that passengers did not
mix with locals. As we have been reporting, discussions are still ongoing about Greater Manchester going into the highest Covid alert level. The government wants the area to go into tier three, but Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called the tougher rules ""flawed and unfair"" and wants more financial support for people affected. During today's coronavirus press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may ""need to intervene"" in order to save lives. Now, Burnham has responded, flagging up comments made by the chief scientific adviser to the government, Sir Patrick Vallance, who has said he thinks tier-three restrictions will not be enough to control the virus.

than 10,000 cases were confirmed in Italy on Friday, the highest ever daily
figure reported in the country. A
further 55 deaths were reported. During
the height of the pandemic in March, Italy was badly affected. More
than 36,427 people have died and more than 391,000 people have contracted the virus
since the outbreak began there. Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking
about the financial support available for those in areas with the highest level
of local restrictions â tier three. âThe
Job Support Scheme combined with Universal Credit means that those on low
incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of
their wages,âhe said. The
Job Support Scheme (JSS) replaces furlough from 1 November. Peopleâs
entitlement to Universal Credit depends on many factors such as income, whether
the claimant has children and whether they have savings. For
example, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, if you have more than Â£16,000 in savings, you are not entitled to any Universal Credit, which means
you would only get the 67% of your wages paid by JSS (up to a maximum of Â£2,100
a month). In
this case, you could get a little more than 67% of your usual income (because
you would be paying a bit less tax) but not as much as 80% of it. You
can read more about the Job Support Schemehere.  The three main symptoms of coronavirus are a fever, a continuous dry cough or a loss of smell or taste.

Pub chain Wetherspoon sees first loss since 1984,"JD Wetherspoon has reported its first annual pre-tax loss since 1984 as it laid bare the impact of coronavirus restrictions on the pubs industry. It revealed a Â£105.4m loss on sharply lower sales in the year to 26 July. Wetherspoon's chairman Tim Martin railed against changes in rules to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which he said were ""confusing"". From Saturday, households in London will not be allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. London and Essex will come under Tier 2 restrictions while Liverpool has already been placed under tougher Tier 3 rules. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Martin said: ""There's massive confusion in the UK now because you've got the 'rule of six', Tier 2, Tier 3 - everyone's confused. ""I think you should concentrate on the basics which is social distancing. If you don't get too close to someone you won't get infected, that works better."" London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' How and when can pubs open? The loss after exceptional items is a sharp reversal from the Â£95.4m pre-tax profit reported in the previous year. Wetherspoon's full-year results - which cover the first weeks after pubs were allowed to reopen on 4 July - also revealed that sales dropped by 30.6% to Â£1.2bn. The company said that since reopening, like-for-like sales at its pubs were 15% lower compared to last year: ""With strong sales in the first few weeks, followed by a marked slowdown since the introduction of a curfew and other regulations."" During that time, 66 Wetherspoon's staff across 50 pubs tested positive for coronavirus. The company employs 41,000 staff and had reopened 861 of its pubs. Mr Martin said that although the safety measures introduced to allow reopening were tough on pubs ""because it reduced capacity dramatically"", the industry was ""gradually getting used to it"". ""Trade was improving and social distancing was working and infections were low,"" he said. ""But what's happened under emergency powers, the government is making a lot of changes which we think in the industry are arbitrary [and] don't work, like the curfew and that's making life almost impossible."" UK Hospitality, which represents the industry, has warned that the new Tier 2 restrictions due to come into force in London and Essex could lead to 250,000 people losing their jobs unless firms are given additional financial support. The hospitality industry has been one of the worst hit sectors during the pandemic. Earlier this week, Marston's, the pubs and brewery group, said up to 2,150 furloughed staff were at risk of losing their jobs. Wetherspoon said recently that up to 450 of its staff who work at pubs in airports were facing cuts as ""sales are generally much lower and where a high percentage is closed"". The company confirmed on Friday that 108 head office staff have been made redundant. London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' What will pubs, cafes and gigs be like from 19 July?

Manic Street Preachers help singer pay for surgery,"Ali Hirsz says she was ""shocked"" when the donation appeared. A singer from Cambridge will be able to have vital surgery, thanks to the Manic Street Preachers. Ali Hirsz needs the trapezius muscle that runs from her neck to her shoulder rebuilt, in an operation that isn't available on the NHS. After Covid-19 robbed her of income from live music, she had toask fans to help raise the money,externalfor the operation. Her initial crowd-funding goal was Â£1,000 - but once she reached Â£500, the Manics stepped in and paid the rest. When the donation arrived, ""I was in tears,"" she tells the BBC. ""I love them anyway, they're such a great band, but Â£500 is so unbelievably generous. I thought, 'I can't believe they've done that.' ""It's such a relief."" Representatives for the Manic Street Preachers confirmed to the BBC that the donation had come from the band. Hirsz, who sings with an indie band called Idealistics, has an incurable connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The condition means ""my skin is like tissue paper, it tears really easy,"" says the 20-year-old. A vascular compression on her small intestine also requires her to be fed via a tube. She needs corrective surgery on her shoulder after a previous operation severed the nerve to her trapezius muscle, causing it to waste away. As a result, her shoulder blade dropped, affecting the blood supply to her arm. The condition has already forced her to stop playing bass, as she has little feeling in her left hand. She says she has ""never asked for money before"" and was ""sweating with nerves"" before posting her crowd-funding request last week. But the campaign became necessary after coronavirus wiped out her band's concert diary; and Hirsz had to leave her day job as a horse trainer because she was shielding. Hundreds of musicians protest outside Parliament Disabled 'pushed out' of post-lockdown world Niall Horan to play show for 'forgotten' crew In the the meantime, she says, she received no financial support from the government's furlough or self-employment support schemes. ""It is very, very stressful, particularly in times where you don't have money lying around anyway,"" she says. Ali (left) formed Idealistics as a teenager with her partner George Gillott and sister, Dom, on drums. The response to her campaign has been ""overwhelming"", however. Hirsz hit the Â£1,000 goal within 24 hours, and has since increased her target to Â£5,000. ""Because the surgery's not been done before, we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost,"" she explains. ""I know it's a hard time for everyone,"" she adds, ""so all these donations mean everything."" Hirsz says her story is typical of disabled musicians, who have found themselves left high and dry by the Covid-19 pandemic. Singer-songwriter Chloe Mogg, who has both fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, agrees the last six months have been ""really, really tough"". ""The NHS is doing an amazing job at the moment but, especially with chronic fatigue syndrome, it seems like all the invisible illnesses have been pushed to the side,"" she says. ""We're walking on a tightrope and we don't know if we're going to fall off at any stage."" Mogg says she has faced discrimination from venues and promoters because of her condition But Mogg, like Hirsz, has approached the pandemic with imagination and resilience, channelling her energies into organising an online music and arts festival. CalledThe 7 Arts Still Exist,external, it highlights the work created by artists, designers, sculptors, writers, musicians, dancers and photographers during the pandemic. Mogg is already lining up its third event with her childhood friend Amy Crouch. The musician says the pandemic has taught her to ""live more in the present moment"", even when ""it felt like I've been put on pause"". ""It's been tough for me and it's been tough for a lot of musician friends who have anxiety problems,"" she says. ""It's something we're learning to adapt to - but I don't feel like we should be needing to adapt. It's really, really tough."" For visually-impaired sitar player Baluji Shrivastav, adaptability has been the watchword for the last six months. The 70-year-old, who has played with Oasis, Stevie Wonder, Massive Attack, Kylie Minogue and Coldplay, cannot travel during the pandemic, making it ""very difficult to perform anywhere"". ""But we still meet sometimes,"" he says. ""We are allowed to meet six people in one place, and we have a garden so we rehearse there sometimes - but it will be difficult in the winter."" Baluji Shrivastav played at the Paralympic closing ceremony with Coldplay Shrivastav was appointed an OBE in 2016 for his services to music, after founding the Inner Vision Orchestra, whose players are all blind or partially-sighted. He says live-streamed concerts are harder for blind musicians, because communication between players is reliant on physical proximity. Meeting up for socially-distanced concerts poses other problems. ""Even if we can reach the venue without help, we need help within the venue itself,"" he says. ""It's a constant difficulty for visually-impaired people. ""And, of course, financially, we are not earning at all."" According to theUK Disability Arts Alliance #WeShallNotBeRemoved,external, the pandemic has had a particularly negative impact on disabled people working in the creative industries. In anopen letter to the secretary of state for culture,external, Oliver Dowden MP, the alliance warned that ""many disabled artists are facing long term shielding, a total loss of income, compromised independent living and the risk of invisibility in wider society"". Separately, the Audience Access Alliance - which represents 12 disability charities in the UK - says it is ""deeply concerned"" that disabled people will miss out on access to gigs, theatre and sport when venues reopen because of extra Covid-related precautions and restrictions. ""If we want to 'build back better', it's vital that we build back for all,""the organisation wrote in an open letter,externalto the live music industry earlier this month. The fear for both organisations is that the progress made since the UK's equality act came into force 10 years ago will be lost. Hirsz and Mogg both have horror stories about the discrimination they faced before Covid. One promoter refused to work with Idealistics because of Hirsz's condition. ""They said, 'You've got all these [feeding] tubes and nobody wants to see that.  You're just going to deter a crowd,'"" she recalls. Mogg was also berated by a promoter last year, after a flare-up of fibromyalgia forced her to pull out of a show. ""He was like, 'You're a massive disappointment,'"" she says. ""It was so embarrassing. I felt really ridiculed and ashamed of my illness, even though it's part of me."" Despite the challenges like those, Hirsz, Mogg and Shrivastav are determined to stay active throughout the pandemic. The Idealistics have just released their new singleMemory River,external(inspired, naturally, by the Manic Street Preachers), while Hirsz is working as an advocate for disability charity Attitude is Everything.

"Burnham holding government 'over a barrel' - RaabDo ""the right thing"" and accept tougher rules, the foreign secretary urges Greater Manchester's mayor.UKComments","Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt Greater Manchester's mayor should ""do the right thing by the people"" and agree to the highest level of Covid measures, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said Labour's Andy Burnham was ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics"". Mr Burnham wants more financial support for people affected by tougher rules. Northern mayors said in a joint statement they were ""united"" in a ""fight for what is right"". ""The government is claiming that the north is divided and only interested in getting what we can for our own region. That is simply not the case,"" said Mr Burnham, North Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll and Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region. Discussions between central government and local leaders over putting the region into tier three have stalled, and the leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said no talks were planned for Friday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""much rather not impose things"" but he was ""concerned about what's happening in Manchester, where clearly the levels of infection are rising steeply, the levels of hospitalisation are rising steeply and we do need action"". Meanwhile,Lancashire has agreed to move to tier three, the highest level of restrictions. It comes as a scientist advising the government, Dr Jeremy Farrar, warned that the row over England's three-tier coronavirus restrictions was ""very damaging to public health"". Row over Covid rules 'damaging public health' Manchester reaction: 'Not knowing is killing the business' What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? On Thursday, Mr Burnham said Greater Manchester would ""stand firm"" against plans to move it into tier three, calling it a ""flawed"" and ""unfair"" policy. He said the government was ""asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work"". Under tier three - the very high alert level - measures include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Mr Raab told BBC Breakfast: ""Ultimately we need to take action - we can't have a situation as we have seen in Manchester where Andy Burnham is effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics."" ""I would just urge Andy Burnham to do the right thing by the people of Manchester,"" he said. He said the government would ""hold in reserve the ability"" to impose stricter restrictions, adding that the ""right response"" was for Mr Burnham to ""recognise that the financial package is generous"". The stand-off between the mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and the Westminster government is fascinating. It's not as simple as a north-south divide. Nor is it purely a clash between Labour and the Conservatives. This goes beyond a local v national government row, too. On one side you have a long-serving MP, former health secretary and one time candidate for leader of the Labour party representing one of the party's traditional heartlands. On the other you have a Conservative government with a big majority reliant on MPs from those and other constituencies in the north of England. The mayor unsurprisingly wants more financial support for his region if tighter restrictions are imposed, the government needs its strategy of tiered restrictions to be seen to work. Boris Johnson's promise to ""level up"" less prosperous regions of the UK plays into this, as does the chancellor's decision to reduce the extent to which he's prepared to pay people's wages. Downing Street's decision to involve local leaders in deciding restrictions was always likely to result in negotiations like this. But as the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise, it's no exaggeration to say lives are at risk. Neither side will want to be seen as responsible for the virus spreading further and faster while politicians traded insults in public. Mr Raab said that if Greater Manchester and Mr Burnham are ""pulling up the drawbridge and just saying 'we're not going to proceed unless more money is coming in', I don't think that's an appropriate way to proceed"". ""We can't have a situation where Andy Burnham is effectively saying unless you give us what we want, we're not going to do the right thing in terms of following the new rules which will protect the very people of Manchester he's elected to represent."" In response to the foreign secretary's comments, Mr Burnhamtweeted,externalthat ""it's not about what we want for ourselves,"" adding: ""It's about what we want for low-paid and self-employed people everywhere: fairness."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy The joint statement from the mayors in northern England said the government's offer to pay two-thirds of the salaries of people whose workplaces have to close would not prevent job losses. It also said Universal Credit was not enough to ""prevent severe hardship for thousands of low-paid workers before Christmas"". Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard told BBC Breakfast that ""at the moment there are no meetings in the diary between us and government"", adding that ""we are in a bit of a vacuum"". From Saturday, people in London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, will move to the second highest tier - high alert. This means more than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high alert restrictions. Mr Raab told Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""risk"" that the government's three-tiered approach ""won't work"". However, he said local leaders must ""lean in"" and back the system to ensure it functions as ""effectively and swiftly as possible"". His comments come after Dr Farrar, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned making it a north-south or party political issue was ""a very dangerous route"". He also said that negotiations with individual areas delayed the ability to respond to the virus, and he was more in favour of national restrictions.

"Breaking|Breaking newsPM warns he may 'need to intervene' on ManchesterBoris Johnson says Manchester Covid spread is ""grave"" and he ""may need to intervene"" if new measures are not agreedUK","This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson says the spread of coronavirus in Greater Manchester is ""grave"" and he may ""need to intervene"" if new measures are not agreed. The prime minister urged mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively"" with the government over the region entering ""very high"" tier three measures. He said the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the essence"". Mr Burnham, who wants more financial aid for workers affected, said regional leaders will meet No 10 at ""any time"". Measures under tier three include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Liverpool City Region was the first of England's regions to enter the very high alert level. Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three from Saturdaywith a financial support package worth Â£42m. Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. What are the tier 2 and tier 3 rules coming in this weekend? Can I stay with my partner in tier 2? And other questions Lancashire rising to highest Covid alert level What is a circuit-breaker? PM appears confused over single parent rules Speaking at a Downing Street briefing on Friday, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""reluctance"" of local leaders to put the region under tougher restrictions and said it would be ""far from a pain-free course of action"". He warned: ""Of course, if agreement cannot be reached I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester's hospitals and save the lives of Manchester's residents. ""But our efforts would be so much more effective if we work together."" Revealing that a deal had not been reached between No 10 and the region's leaders, Mr Johnson said it was time for action to be taken. ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die,"" he said. In a joint statement with Greater Manchester's deputy mayors and council leaders, Mr Burnham said they had sought a further meeting with Downing Street officials - and this did not happen. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward,"" they said. They said they had done ""everything within our power to protect the health of our residents"" but are not convinced that closing pubs and bars is the only way to protect hospitals. Instead, they want other measures like shielding to be considered, and tougher penalties on venues that do not comply to Covid regulations, including instant closure powers. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" they said, adding that the current proposals do not ""provide adequate support"". Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt The latest government figures showed there were 15,650 new cases reported on Friday, bringing the total to 689,257. There were a further 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 43,429. Mr Johnson said he hoped the most stringent ""very high"" restrictions could be lifted as quickly as possible for the affected regions. He said: ""The amount by which we need to reduce the R is not as big as it was right back in the beginning of the spread of this disease. ""If we all work together on the measures we have outlined we can definitely do it."" The reproduction (R) number has risen slightly to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread across the country. The PM said he wanted to avoid another national lockdown ""if at all possible"" amid calls for a circuit-breaker - a short, limited lockdown - across the country. He said he disagreed with those who argued in favour of a national lockdown ""instead of targeted local action"", insisting: ""Closing businesses in Cornwall where transmission is low will not cut transmission in Manchester"". Mr Johnson said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wanted to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said during the briefing that the nation is in a ""different situation"" from when the Sage group of scientists recommended a two-to-three week national ""circuit break"" to stop the spread of coronavirus. He said the situation had changed, adding: ""We recommended in September taking a circuit break. The idea there was that actually a two-week interruption would set cases back probably to the levels they were in August and then at those levels, test and trace is more effective to keep control. ""Where we are now is of course a different situation. It's crucial that where the R is above 1 and the numbers are high we get R below 1 for all the reasons that have been outlined, including of course the hospitalisations which are increasing.

Burnham holding government 'over a barrel' - Raab,"Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt Greater Manchester's mayor should ""do the right thing by the people"" and agree to the highest level of Covid measures, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said Labour's Andy Burnham was ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics"". Mr Burnham wants more financial support for people affected by tougher rules. Northern mayors said in a joint statement they were ""united"" in a ""fight for what is right"". ""The government is claiming that the north is divided and only interested in getting what we can for our own region. That is simply not the case,"" said Mr Burnham, North Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll and Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region. Discussions between central government and local leaders over putting the region into tier three have stalled, and the leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said no talks were planned for Friday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""much rather not impose things"" but he was ""concerned about what's happening in Manchester, where clearly the levels of infection are rising steeply, the levels of hospitalisation are rising steeply and we do need action"". Meanwhile,Lancashire has agreed to move to tier three, the highest level of restrictions. It comes as a scientist advising the government, Dr Jeremy Farrar, warned that the row over England's three-tier coronavirus restrictions was ""very damaging to public health"". Row over Covid rules 'damaging public health' Manchester reaction: 'Not knowing is killing the business' What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? On Thursday, Mr Burnham said Greater Manchester would ""stand firm"" against plans to move it into tier three, calling it a ""flawed"" and ""unfair"" policy. He said the government was ""asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work"". Under tier three - the very high alert level - measures include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Mr Raab told BBC Breakfast: ""Ultimately we need to take action - we can't have a situation as we have seen in Manchester where Andy Burnham is effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics."" ""I would just urge Andy Burnham to do the right thing by the people of Manchester,"" he said. He said the government would ""hold in reserve the ability"" to impose stricter restrictions, adding that the ""right response"" was for Mr Burnham to ""recognise that the financial package is generous"". The stand-off between the mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and the Westminster government is fascinating. It's not as simple as a north-south divide. Nor is it purely a clash between Labour and the Conservatives. This goes beyond a local v national government row, too. On one side you have a long-serving MP, former health secretary and one time candidate for leader of the Labour party representing one of the party's traditional heartlands. On the other you have a Conservative government with a big majority reliant on MPs from those and other constituencies in the north of England. The mayor unsurprisingly wants more financial support for his region if tighter restrictions are imposed, the government needs its strategy of tiered restrictions to be seen to work. Boris Johnson's promise to ""level up"" less prosperous regions of the UK plays into this, as does the chancellor's decision to reduce the extent to which he's prepared to pay people's wages. Downing Street's decision to involve local leaders in deciding restrictions was always likely to result in negotiations like this. But as the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise, it's no exaggeration to say lives are at risk. Neither side will want to be seen as responsible for the virus spreading further and faster while politicians traded insults in public. Mr Raab said that if Greater Manchester and Mr Burnham are ""pulling up the drawbridge and just saying 'we're not going to proceed unless more money is coming in', I don't think that's an appropriate way to proceed"". ""We can't have a situation where Andy Burnham is effectively saying unless you give us what we want, we're not going to do the right thing in terms of following the new rules which will protect the very people of Manchester he's elected to represent."" In response to the foreign secretary's comments, Mr Burnhamtweeted,externalthat ""it's not about what we want for ourselves,"" adding: ""It's about what we want for low-paid and self-employed people everywhere: fairness."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy The joint statement from the mayors in northern England said the government's offer to pay two-thirds of the salaries of people whose workplaces have to close would not prevent job losses. It also said Universal Credit was not enough to ""prevent severe hardship for thousands of low-paid workers before Christmas"". Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard told BBC Breakfast that ""at the moment there are no meetings in the diary between us and government"", adding that ""we are in a bit of a vacuum"". From Saturday, people in London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, will move to the second highest tier - high alert. This means more than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high alert restrictions. Mr Raab told Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""risk"" that the government's three-tiered approach ""won't work"". However, he said local leaders must ""lean in"" and back the system to ensure it functions as ""effectively and swiftly as possible"". His comments come after Dr Farrar, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned making it a north-south or party political issue was ""a very dangerous route"". He also said that negotiations with individual areas delayed the ability to respond to the virus, and he was more in favour of national restrictions.

"Coronavirus infections still rising rapidlyThe R number has crept up to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread.Health","Coronavirus infections are continuing to rise rapidly, with an estimated 27,900 new cases a day in England, the Office for National Statistics says. This figure is far higher than the number ofconfirmed cases announced by the government each day,external. The R number has risen slightly to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread across the country. It comes as the highest level of restrictions are introduced in more of the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said 'R' was not growing as fast as it would be without the measures people were following. But he said ""we are not where we need to be"", adding there was ""more work to do"". The increase in people testing positive in recent weeks is being driven by high rates in older teenagers and young adults,the ONS infection survey,externalsays. It found steep increases in infection rates in the north west, the north east, Yorkshire and the Humber. New cases of the virus have gone up by 60% in a week, according to the ONS, based on its survey of people in random households with or without symptoms. It estimates that one in 160 people in England had the virus in the week to 8 October - an increase on one in 240 the previous week. For the same week, the ONS estimates one in 390 people had the virus in Wales and one in 250 in Northern Ireland - both an increase on the week before. The ONS survey doesn't cover Scotland. Asconfirmed cases and hospital admissions rise there, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is in a ""precarious"" position in its fight to contain Covid-19. How many confirmed cases are there in your areas? Lancashire to move to highest Covid alert level What Covid tier is my area in? Can I stay with my partner in a Tier 2 area? And other questions An app which tracks the Covid symptoms of four million users estimates there are more than 27,000 new cases per day in the UK. Its latest figures, for the two weeks to 11 October, found the fastest acceleration of cases in the north west, while Scotland, Wales, London and the Midlands were also increasing, but more slowly. Prof Tim Spector from King's College London, who foundedthe Covid Symptom study app,external, said there was no longer the ""exponential increases"" of a couple of weeks ago - but the data still shows ""new cases continuing to rise"". Other estimates, from a large study by Imperial College London and a group of scientists advising government, suggest new cases could be even higher - up to 74,000 a day. A different measures of cases - the number of people with symptoms to test positive for coronavirus - rose by 15,650 on Friday, the lowest for four days. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The R number is the average number of people infected by each person testing positive for the virus. An R number above 1 means the epidemic is growing. At the peak of the epidemic back in April, the R number is thought to have been around 3. From May up until mid-August after the national lockdown, it stayed below 1, but has been rising steadily since.

"Breaking|Breaking newsPM warns he 'may need to intervene' on ManchesterBoris Johnson says Manchester Covid spread is ""grave"" and he ""may need to intervene"" if new measures are not agreedUK","This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson says the spread of coronavirus in Greater Manchester is ""grave"" and he may ""need to intervene"" if new measures are not agreed. The prime minister urged mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively"" with the government over the region entering ""very high"" tier three measures. He said the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the essence"". Mr Burnham, who wants more financial aid for workers affected, said regional leaders will meet No 10 at ""any time"". Measures under tier three include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Liverpool City Region was the first of England's regions to enter the very high alert level. Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three from Saturdaywith a financial support package worth Â£42m. Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. What are the tier 2 and tier 3 rules coming in this weekend? Can I stay with my partner in tier 2? And other questions Lancashire rising to highest Covid alert level What is a circuit-breaker? PM appears confused over single parent rules Speaking at a Downing Street briefing on Friday, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""reluctance"" of local leaders to put the region under tougher restrictions and said it would be ""far from a pain-free course of action"". He warned: ""Of course, if agreement cannot be reached I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester's hospitals and save the lives of Manchester's residents. ""But our efforts would be so much more effective if we work together."" Revealing that a deal had not been reached between No 10 and the region's leaders, Mr Johnson said it was time for action to be taken. ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die,"" he said. In a joint statement with Greater Manchester's deputy mayors and council leaders, Mr Burnham said they had sought a further meeting with Downing Street officials - and this did not happen. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward,"" they said. They said they had done ""everything within our power to protect the health of our residents"" but are not convinced that closing pubs and bars is the only way to protect hospitals. Instead, they want other measures like shielding to be considered, and tougher penalties on venues that do not comply to Covid regulations, including instant closure powers. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" they said, adding that the current proposals do not ""provide adequate support"". Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt The latest government figures showed there were 15,650 new cases reported on Friday, bringing the total to 689,257. There were a further 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 43,429. Mr Johnson said he hoped the most stringent ""very high"" restrictions could be lifted as quickly as possible for the affected regions. He said: ""The amount by which we need to reduce the R is not as big as it was right back in the beginning of the spread of this disease. ""If we all work together on the measures we have outlined we can definitely do it."" The reproduction (R) number has risen slightly to 1.3-1.5, with growth of the epidemic still widespread across the country. The PM said he wanted to avoid another national lockdown ""if at all possible"" amid calls for a circuit-breaker - a short, limited lockdown - across the country. He said he disagreed with those who argued in favour of a national lockdown ""instead of targeted local action"", insisting: ""Closing businesses in Cornwall where transmission is low will not cut transmission in Manchester"". Mr Johnson said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wanted to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said during the briefing that the nation is in a ""different situation"" from when the Sage group of scientists recommended a two-to-three week national ""circuit break"" to stop the spread of coronavirus. He said the situation had changed, adding: ""We recommended in September taking a circuit break. The idea there was that actually a two-week interruption would set cases back probably to the levels they were in August and then at those levels, test and trace is more effective to keep control. ""Where we are now is of course a different situation. It's crucial that where the R is above 1 and the numbers are high we get R below 1 for all the reasons that have been outlined, including of course the hospitalisations which are increasing. So it's crucial that's done, and there are a number of ways that can be done."" He added that would only be achieved by combining ""tier three baseline conditions"" suggested by the government with some extra measures agreed in an affected region using ""local knowledge and local insight"".

Before we do, here are the main UK stories from today:  Here are the main stories from around the world today: Danai HowardBBC News Internet searches in Hong Kong for flights to Singapore have jumped by 400% following the announcement that the two cities were planning a potential ""travel bubble"". The travel website Expedia said it saw a three-digit surge in the number of customers, while prices for flights in December rose by at least 57% in the last 24 hours, to $3,297 [Hong Kong dollars] (Â£329) for a round-trip. Meanwhile, the share price for Hong Kongâs airline Cathay Pacific jumped by 7% following the announcement on Thursday. The travel bubble would mean that people would be able to travel between Hong Kong and Singapore without the need to quarantine, but Singaporeâs Transport Minister, Ong Ye Kung, has said travellers would still need to have received negative Covid-19 test results to travel under the scheme. International travel to Asia collapsed during the pandemic, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. The Singapore-Hong Kong deal will provide some much-needed relief for the regionâs aviation and tourism sectors. âIt is a safe, careful, but significant step forward to revive air travel, and provide a model for future collaboration with other parts of the world,"" Mr Ong said.    Tensions are running high between Downing Street and local leaders in Greater Manchester, who have been unable to agree on whether the areas should move to England's highest, tier-three level of Covid restrictions. Mayor Andy Burnham, his deputy mayors
and other Greater Manchester leaders have just released a statement, saying: ""At our last meeting with Downing Street officials yesterday morning, we were told they would arrange a further meeting later in the day to provide a response to our requests. That did not happen and, despite being on standby all day today, we are still waiting for it to be arranged. We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward. They add that they are ânot convinced that
closing hospitality venues is the only way to protect hospitals"" and they would prefer to look at other measures ""such as reinstating shielding arrangements and
introducing tougher instant closure powers on non-compliant pubs, restaurants,
shops and other business premisesâ. It comes after Prime
Minister Boris Johnson warned he may âhave to interveneâ if tier-three measures were not
agreed for Manchester. The
prime minister urged Mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively""
with the government, saying the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the
essence"". Circuit breaker lockdowns have been used in some countries such as Singapore and Israel as way of reducing the number of cases of coronavirus by stopping the ways it can spread. Wales says it willspend the next few days considering a circuit-breaker lockdown which they're calling a 'fire break'. But how do they work? How long is a Covid circuit breaker? How can it help fight coronavirus? This video can not be played Circuit breaker lockdown: What is a circuit breaker? Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Belgium is seeing a rise in the number of Covid cases All bars, cafes and
restaurants across Belgium will close from Monday for a month, following a
surge in the number of Covid 19 cases. A night time curfew will also be in place across the country
from Monday from midnight until 5am. The Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo announced the
measures this evening, stating that the country had entered a âvery serious
alert phase, phase fourâ. The measures will also mean that people can only have one
close contact outside of their household, compared to four close contacts
previously. Mr De Croo also stated that working from home will be
compulsory for all workers who are able to. Sales of alcohol will also be
banned after 8pm. He added that the situation could be reviewed after two weeks
for all measures. Belgium has had an average of 6,000 infections and 20 deaths
per day in the past 7 days, including a rise of 7,360 cases in a single day
recorded on Wednesday. The infection rate over the past two weeks stands at 549
infections per 100,000 people. Thatâs an increase of 182% compared to that two
weeks before. The daily flow of patients at several hospitals in Brussels
and Wallonia is starting to put pressure on the health system again, according
to medical staff. Officials have now ordered hospitals to reserve 50% of ICU beds for Covid patients, up from 30%. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has confirmed it will not apply for emergency authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine before late next month - puncturing President Donald Trump's hope for a virus jab before the 3 November presidential election. In a statement, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company may know whether or not their vaccine is effective by the end of October, but that the time needed to collect safety and manufacturing data will push the authorisation date several weeks later. ""We are operating at the speed of science,"" he said. Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be ready before Americans go to the polls next month, fueling speculation that the timeline is politically motivated. At a town hall event last night, Democratic challenger Joe Biden said he would take a vaccine when it becomes ready, if ""the body of scientists"" say it is safe. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says ""there was no contact tracing done"" with him by the White House after he tested positive for Covid-19. ""My contact tracing was done by my local county board of health. They called me when i was in the hospital,"" he said to ABC News in his first televised interview since his release from hospital. The Republican was present at the 26 September Rose Garden event, now under scrutiny as a possible super-spreading event. Christie has since expressed regret over the event, saying he incorrectly believed the White House was a ""safe zone"" and that he was ""wrong"" not to wear a mask. ""I let my guard down. And it was wrong, it was just a big mistake,"" he said to ABC. Asked on Friday if he has since urged President Trump to advocate for mask wearing, Christie said that ""everybody's going to make their own decisions on that"". A new
three-tier system has been introduced in England to help control the spread of
the virus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. But
what rules happen at what tier? The
BBCâs health correspondent, Laura Foster, has a summary. This video can not be played Covid tier lockdown: What is the tier lockdown system in England? As almost
every day brings another record high in the number of daily infections in
Russia, the authorities have been tightening restrictions across the vast
country. They differ
from region to region since President Vladimir Putin delegated significant powers
for fighting the epidemic to local authorities in April. On 16
October, Russia reported another spike of 15,150 new coronavirus cases, up from
13,754 the previous day. In late August, the number was below 5,000. The daily
death toll from Covid-19 has been rising too, reaching an all-time high of 286
yesterday. To combat
the spread of the epidemic, employers in some cities have been told to move at
least some of their staff to home working, some regional administrations have
urged locals to stay at home, but no part of Russia has returned to the strict
lockdown measures that were imposed at the start of the pandemic. Wearing a face mask in shops or on public transport is
mandatory in most Russian regions. Employers in Moscow, Rostov and
Volgograd have been ordered to switch at least 30% of staff
â as well as everyone older than 65 - to working from home. Also in Moscow, the autumn school holidays were
extended from one week to two (until 18 October) and older pupils will be
moved to distance learning until the end of the month. The authorities in Moscow, Volgograd, Khanty-Mansi
Autonomous Area, Nizhny Novgorod Region, Krasnodar Territory
and Russia-annexed Crimea ruled that people over 65, pregnant women
and those with chronic diseases must stay at home. In Rostov, local residents are required to stay at home unless
they are on the way to work, shopping or engaged in one of a number of other
activities such as exercising or walking a dog. Mass public
events are banned in Rostov Region, Krasnodar
Territory, Transbaikal Territory, Udmurtia and the city of
Sevastopol in Crimea. Stavropol Territory requires visitors from other regions to
quarantine for 14 days. Leningrad Regionintroduced,external""red"", ""yellow"" and
""green"" zones depending on the density of Covid-19 cases in the area,
and limits the number of people present in these zones accordingly. Kaliningrad
Region banned cinemas on weekends. Bars and night clubs are closed in
Kaliningrad Region, Chukotka and Rostov Region. Rostov Region and Lipetsk Region suspended routine medical
care, except for urgent conditions, for everyone apart from Covid-19
patients.  Today's developments have done nothing to provide the clarity desperately needed by one business owner in Greater Manchester - who still doesn't know whether her area will move into the highest Covid alert level. Emma Shone, co-owner of gin and whisky bar Number 6 in Sale, Trafford, was left none the wiser after this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. She said: ""Itâs completely frustrating for us as a local business. ""There are no winners in either tier two or tier three but for us he [the prime minister] needs to make that decision. ""We are going into yet another weekend of uncertainty about whether we have the hours for our staff, whether we purchase more stock. ""We went through that last weekend and now we're about to go through it again. ""Given the urgency Boris Johnson makes in all his press conferences, it seems very unclear as to why he wonât make that decision and take it out of the hands of [Greater Manchester Mayor] Andy Burnham, who appears to be making a very political statement as opposed to what is good for our local businesses. ""For us it is just devastating that we still donât have a decision as we go into another weekend."" The US reported more than 65,000 cases across the country on Thursday - the most in a single day since July - as it inches toward a total of eight million infections. Uncontrolled outbreaks are raging on in the Upper Midwest, in states like Wisconsin and Montana. Nearby, North Dakota and South Dakota are now adding more cases than any states have since the start of the pandemic. The return of students to colleges and universities has been linked to the rapid spread. A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost 100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September - around when college students began their return to school - found that weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally. Authorities have also pointed to a rise in ""pandemic fatigue"", now more than six months after the outbreak reached the US.  Passengers were banned from disembarking from a ship in Malta Passengers
have been stopped from disembarking a cruise ship in Malta due to a suspected
case of Covid-19. The MSC
Grandiosa cruise
ship was allowed into Valetta harbour but left the port after collecting
supplies. During
the beginning of the pandemic, cruise ships were involved in a large number of
cases. Malta
allowed cruise ships into its harbours on the condition that passengers did not
mix with locals. As we have been reporting, discussions are still ongoing about Greater Manchester going into the highest Covid alert level. The government wants the area to go into tier three, but Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called the tougher rules ""flawed and unfair"" and wants more financial support for people affected. During today's coronavirus press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may ""need to intervene"" in order to save lives. Now, Burnham has responded, flagging up comments made by the chief scientific adviser to the government, Sir Patrick Vallance, who has said he thinks tier-three restrictions will not be enough to control the virus.

than 10,000 cases were confirmed in Italy on Friday, the highest ever daily
figure reported in the country. A
further 55 deaths were reported. During
the height of the pandemic in March, Italy was badly affected. More
than 36,427 people have died and more than 391,000 people have contracted the virus
since the outbreak began there. Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking
about the financial support available for those in areas with the highest level
of local restrictions â tier three. âThe
Job Support Scheme combined with Universal Credit means that those on low
incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of
their wages,âhe said. The
Job Support Scheme (JSS) replaces furlough from 1 November. Peopleâs
entitlement to Universal Credit depends on many factors such as income, whether
the claimant has children and whether they have savings. For
example, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, if you have more than Â£16,000 in savings, you are not entitled to any Universal Credit, which means
you would only get the 67% of your wages paid by JSS (up to a maximum of Â£2,100
a month). In
this case, you could get a little more than 67% of your usual income (because
you would be paying a bit less tax) but not as much as 80% of it. You
can read more about the Job Support Schemehere.  The three main symptoms of coronavirus are a fever, a continuous dry cough or a loss of smell or taste.

Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he said: ""If the government are doing things that we think are ignoring the science, that are not in the nation's best interest, we've got a responsibility to speak up - which is what you've seen this week with Keir Starmer articulating and arguing for a circuit breaker...

"Lancashire rising to highest Covid alert levelThe move to tier three, after intensive talks, sees pubs and car boot sales closed but gyms stay open.","People in Blackpool will be among those affected by the new rules Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three - the top level of England Covid restrictions - from Saturday. The ""very high"" alert level measures include pub closures and bans on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and most outdoor venues. However, gyms and leisure centres would not close, unlike in Liverpool City Region -  the other area in tier three. Some local council leaders said they had been ""bullied"" into accepting the deal by Downing Street. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had ""worked intensively with local leaders"" to agree the move. He added that an ""unrelenting rise in cases"" in the north-west England county had meant ""we must act now"". Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. Latest reaction from Lancashire 'Massive disappointment' over tier 3 move Can I stay with my partner if we live in a Tier 2 area? What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? The Labour leaders of Preston, Pendle and South Ribble councils released statements saying they had been forced to accept a deal that would not be enough to stop the virus. Paul Foster, of South Ribble said: ""We have been bullied, harassed, threatened and blackmailed into moving into tier three."" He added: ""The discussions with government were a complete shambles and we were basically told if we didn't accept the restrictions we would have even more draconian measures imposed on us."" However, Geoff Driver, the Conservative leader of Lancashire County Council, told the BBC: ""It's been a long drawn out process but I think we've got a good deal."" He said it involved a support package worth Â£42m, the area having initially been promised Â£12m, with Â£30m to help the businesses affected. Mr Driver said Lancashire had also been promised more support for local test and trace and a specific ministerial team to deal with the outbreak in the county. ""What we've been able to do is to convince government that the measures we have in place to monitor such things as the gyms and the leisure centres are sufficient to ensure that they're not a source of infection,"" he added. The new measures, which will be reviewed every two weeks, cover all parts of Lancashire: People must not socialise with anybody they do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, in any indoor setting or in any private garden or at most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events People from different households can still meet in an outdoor public space such as a park or beach, the countryside, a public garden or a sports venue, in groups of six or less All pubs and bars must close, unless they are serving substantial meals Residents should avoid staying overnight in another part of the UK, and others should avoid staying overnight in the area People should try to avoid travelling outside the very high alert level area or entering the very high alert level area, other than for essential journeys or to travel through as part of a longer journey From Monday 19 October, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops and soft play areas must close and car boot sale will not be permitted Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region, gyms and leisure centres have also been forced to close.

Fortnight 'fire-break' in Wales likely within days,"Wales appears to be heading for another lockdown People in Wales are facing a national lockdown lasting at least two weeks in plans described as a ""fire-break"" by the first minister. Mark Drakeford said it would be a ""short, sharp"" circuit-breaker to slow down the virus. He said a decision was likely to be made on Monday, while talks continue with health officials, scientific advisors and councils over the weekend. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said. ""A 'fire-break' would also mean a short, sharp shock to all our lives. ""We would all have to stay at home to once again save lives. But this time it would be for weeks not months."" Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford warned that 2,500 people were now being infected with coronavirus every day in Wales, with critical care units in hospitals full. ""A successful fire-break would re-set the virus at a lower level,"" he added. ""Together with a new national set of rules for the whole of Wales after the fire-break period we would have slowed the virus down enough to get us through to Christmas."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said Mr Drakeford was quoting the estimated number of cases, including untested and asymptomatic, not the daily confirmed casesreported by Public Health Wales. ""There will be many people who don't get a test who have symptoms and large numbers who are asymptomatic,"" she said. ""The numbers the first minister reported today come from TAC (Technical Advisory Cell which advices the Welsh Government) and are the scientific community's best understanding of the number of cases based on a wide range of indicators."" The TAC's latest summary says the daily growth rate is estimated by Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) to be between 0.02 and 0.07 in Wales, indicating that infections could be increasing by between 2% and 7% per day. Currently about 2.3 million people in Wales are living in communities under local lockdown rules, with other communities living under different rules. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said that following any ""fire-break"" period, consistent national rules would be put in place to keep the level of the virus low. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 ""If we do this, we would much rather not have to do this again before the end of the year,"" he said, adding ministers needed to find rules people could live with. ""A set of consistent national rules will be really important, so people can look forward to the end of the year and recognise who they can spend their festive period with."" Plaid Cymru has been calling on Mr Drakeford to introduce the circuit-breaker without delay, while Labour at Westminster says a similar approach should be adopted in England. The British Medical Association in Wales, which represents doctors, said it would welcome a circuit-breaker lockdown. ""Cases are climbing fast across Wales with the latest figures showing that the number of Covid-related patients in the Welsh NHS has risen by 49% in a week,"" said Dr David Bailey, from BMA Wales. ""It's clear that the current restrictions are not strong enough to suppress the spread of the virus. ""Doctors in Wales support, and are calling for as a matter of urgency, a circuit-breaker lockdown for a number of weeks. ""It is imperative that robust action is taken now without delay, to protect the citizens of Wales, and the Welsh NHS."" Discussions on a fire-break lockdown will continue over the weekend Giving a briefing on Friday, the first minister said any fire-break lockdown in Wales would not be ""a magic wand"". He said restrictions would not ""make coronavirus disappear"" but they would ""buy time"". ""I can't offer a guaranteeâ¦ that it would not be necessary to take further measures later in the winter,"" he added. ""But I'm focused on the immediate situation, the immediate difficulties faced by our national health service by the continuing spread of the virus in all parts of Wales, and we have to act to deal with that now in this planned and pre-emptive way."" Mr Drakeford said ministers were drawing up plans for a new business support package before taking a final decision on any circuit-breaker. Allow Facebook content?

The General Secretary of TUC Wales Shavanah Taj said: ""The question is, what does that look like and how does that actually impact jobs?"" Ms Taj said if a short lockdown was brought in, jobs and businesses needed protection. ""The hospitality industry in particular supports tens of thousands of jobs throughout Wales and we do need to be doing everything possible to make sure that these workers in particular are not left unsupported,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales. ""We've got to be doing everything possible to avoid mass job losses and business closures at all costs."" Will areas such as the Brecon Beacons be off limits again? Rosemarie Harris, the leader of Powys council said she also expected the circuit-breaker action to be taken. ""Maybe two or three weeks of lockdown, a similar lockdown to before where we are all required to stay at home,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I'm not comfortable with it, but I would say that there is probably a majority support for it, as long as it is fairly short and sharp and that we have an exit strategy."" However, she said she would be seeking financial support for businesses that will be hit by any lockdown. ""It will - again - be difficult for Powys. We are travellers, because we have to be - we have no district general hospital within the county, we have no higher education, many people go out [of the county] for work, for shopping,"" she said. As part of a short lockdown in Northern Ireland, schools are closing for two weeks at half term. On Thursday morning, Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the government was discussing ""whether a circuit-breaker is an appropriate step"". That included considering ""what role education has to play in all of that and then we need to be able to give families advance notice if there is to be a change of circumstance"". Laura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT, said any decision ""needs to be communicated clearly to schools and parents"". ""It needs to be made to give everyone enough time to prepare for the impact any school closures may have"". Salon owner Charlotte Griffiths said she is concerned more restrictions may hit the hair and beauty industry Charlotte Griffiths, who owns a beauty salon in Cardiff, said she is concerned over the prospect of more restrictions. She said: ""It will affect us a lot, more so because we've only just managed to get back up on our feet from the last lockdown. ""We've only been open since November of last year, so we've spent the last year building our client base and we're now in a position where we've just broken even from the last lockdown, and it's about to hit again. ""They talk about hospitality and other industries, but they don't talk about the hair and beauty industry. We're a safe industry, but we're not recognised."" A total of 17 areas in Wales are under local lockdown because of rising infection rates - meaning people cannot travel outside of their area and indoor meetings are restricted. The first minister confirmed on Friday that all the local restrictions would remain in force across Wales ""for at least another seven days"". ""The general trend in Wales is a worsening situation and most areas where local restrictions are in place have reported a seven-day trend where Covid-19 cases have increased,"" he said. He said the local lockdowns did appear to have slowed the spread of Covid and were ""making a positive difference"". CIRCUIT BREAKER:What does a short lockdown mean?

"Lancashire rising to top, tier 3, Covid alert level","People in Blackpool will be among those affected by the new rules Lancashire has agreed to move into tier three - the top level of England Covid restrictions - from Saturday. The ""very high"" alert level measures include pub closures and bans on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and most outdoor venues. However, gyms and leisure centres would not close, unlike in Liverpool City Region -  the other area in tier three. Some local council leaders said they had been ""bullied"" into accepting the deal by Downing Street. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had ""worked intensively with local leaders"" to agree the move. He added that an ""unrelenting rise in cases"" in the north-west England county had meant ""we must act now"". Around 1.5 million people, including those living in Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Lancaster and Preston, will be affected by the new rules. Latest reaction from Lancashire 'Massive disappointment' over tier 3 move Can I stay with my partner if we live in a Tier 2 area? What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? The Labour leaders of Preston, Pendle and South Ribble councils released statements saying they had been forced to accept a deal that would not be enough to stop the virus. Paul Foster, of South Ribble said: ""We have been bullied, harassed, threatened and blackmailed into moving into tier three."" He added: ""The discussions with government were a complete shambles and we were basically told if we didn't accept the restrictions we would have even more draconian measures imposed on us."" However, Geoff Driver, the Conservative leader of Lancashire County Council, told the BBC: ""It's been a long drawn out process but I think we've got a good deal."" He said it involved a support package worth Â£42m, the area having initially been promised Â£12m, with Â£30m to help the businesses affected. Mr Driver said Lancashire had also been promised more support for local test and trace and a specific ministerial team to deal with the outbreak in the county. ""What we've been able to do is to convince government that the measures we have in place to monitor such things as the gyms and the leisure centres are sufficient to ensure that they're not a source of infection,"" he added. The new measures, which will be reviewed every two weeks, cover all parts of Lancashire: People must not socialise with anybody they do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, in any indoor setting or in any private garden or at most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events People from different households can still meet in an outdoor public space such as a park or beach, the countryside, a public garden or a sports venue, in groups of six or less All pubs and bars must close, unless they are serving substantial meals Residents should avoid staying overnight in another part of the UK, and others should avoid staying overnight in the area People should try to avoid travelling outside the very high alert level area or entering the very high alert level area, other than for essential journeys or to travel through as part of a longer journey From Monday 19 October, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops and soft play areas must close and car boot sale will not be permitted Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region, gyms and leisure centres have also been forced to close. Mayor of Liverpool Joe Andersontweeted:,external""Liverpool City Region has demanded immediate clarification on why Lancashire gyms are allowed to stay open and Liverpool's close. ""Inconsistent mess - we now have tier three A and tier three B."" Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he was ""concerned that there appear to be differences between the two packages of measures, particularly the opening of gyms"". ""We have always been clear that we were given no choice about the specific package of measures that would be applied to us,"" he said. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was up to regional leaders to decide whether gyms should be closed. ""The purpose of the very high level is to allow for local, tailored interventions and they are determined on the basis of discussions with local authorities and based on local evidence,"" he said.

UK must 'get ready' for no EU trade deal - PM,"This video can not be played The PM says it is time to ""get readyâ for trading arrangements with the EU to be ""more like Australia's"" from 1 January. Talks between the UK and EU over a post-Brexit trade agreement are ""over"", Downing Street has said. No 10 argued there was ""no point"" in discussions continuing next week unless the EU was prepared to discuss the detailed legal text of a partnership. UK chief negotiator Lord Frost said he had told EU counterpart Michel Barnier there was now no ""basis"" for planned talks on Monday. Number 10 said the two sides had agreed to talk again next week - by phone. Earlier, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the Brussels negotiating team would go to London after the weekend to ""intensify"" discussions. France's Europe minister ClÃ©ment Beaune told BBC Newsnight that, while the EU would not pursue a deal at any cost, ""we will listen to what the UK side wants to say to us"". Meanwhile, ratings agency Moody's has downgraded the UK's credit status, citing falling economic strength due to the coronavirus pandemic and uncertainty over Brexit. EU leaders call for UK trade talks to continue Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? The prime minister had set this week's EU summit as the deadline for the two sides to agree a deal. But there are still major disagreements over fishing rights and state help for businesses. And the UK government hardened up its message to the EU over the course of Friday. In the morning, Boris Johnson said the country had to ""get ready"" to trade next year without an agreement, although he did not say the talks were over. He suggested the EU was unwilling to consider seriously the UK's preferred option of a comprehensive free trade agreement based on the bloc's existing arrangement with Canada. The UK, he added, must look at the ""alternative"" - which he suggested was Australia's much-more limited set of agreements with the EU. ""The talks are over."" As statements go, those four words from the prime minister's spokesman this afternoon were something of a bombshell. But Michel Barnier, due to come to London next week to continue talks, might not be unpacking his briefcase just yet. There's no doubt that Downing Street is sending the clearest signal possible that it expects the EU to make the next move. And the rhetoric accompanying the talks has reached a new level. But both sides still want a deal, the process has not broken down and there is still time to reach an agreement. It's one thing to declare the talks over; it's another thing to refuse to continue talking. The prime minister's official spokesman took a tougher line with Brussels later in the day. ""There is only any point in Michel Barnier coming to London next week if he's prepared to address all the issues on the basis of a legal text in an accelerated way, without the UK required to make all the moves or to discuss the practicalities of travel and haulage,"" he said. ""If not, there is no point in coming."" What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Brexit: What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? He added: ""Trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying they do not want to change their negotiating position."" The UK and EU had been hoping for a ""zero-tariff"" agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. If no deal is reached, they will operate on World Trade Organization rules, meaning tariffs are imposed. Mrs von der Leyen (R) left the summit early after exchanging views with EU leaders By BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake Boris Johnson's public declaration that the UK should prepare for no deal did not cause great concern within EU circles. The immediate response came in a tweet from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who said it was full steam ahead for trade talks next week and that EU negotiators would be getting on the Eurostar to London as planned. But the subsequent statement from the prime minister's official spokesman that the ""trade talks are over"" has left senior diplomats ""deeply unimpressed"", as one put it. Although ""we're getting used to being part of Johnson's pantomime"", they added. Some EU figures fear Boris Johnson still doesn't know if he actually wants a deal and is trying to buy time while he grapples with the Covid crisis. Following the hardening of the British position by No 10, France's President Macron called on the prime minister to make up his mind, while there was still time. Many in Brussels remain ""cautiously optimistic"" some sort of deal can be agreed, but any route there is now even harder to see. After the EU summit concluded on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be best to get a deal and that compromises on both sides would be needed. French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK needed a Brexit deal more than the EU did. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves urged the UK government to ""step back from the brink"" and ""stop posturing"". ""Any tariffs or any delays at the border will make it harder for goods to flow freely, whether those are foods or medicines,"" she said.

How Trump can still win the election,"Recent polls suggest Joe Biden has a significant and steady lead over Republican Donald Trump in this year's presidential race in both national preference and key swing-state surveys. Due to record-shattering fundraising, the Democrat also has a sizeable financial advantage, which means he'll be able to blanket the airwaves with his campaign message in the final weeks. Electoral analysts have been increasing their odds that Trump will lose his re-election bid. Nate Silver's Fivethirtyeight.com blog currently has Biden with an 87% chance of winning, while Decision Desk HQ puts him at 83.5%. How is Trump doing in the polls? If all of this is painfully familiar to Democrats, it should be. At a similar point four years ago, Hillary Clinton was also predicted to have a high likelihood of victory. They remember how that turned out. Could history repeat itself with another Trump victory? If the president is taking the oath of office once again in January, here are five possible reasons why it happened. Four years ago, just 11 days before the election, FBI Director James Comey disclosed that his agency was reopening an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. For a week, related stories dominated the headlines and gave the Trump campaign room to breathe. With just over two weeks before polls close in 2020, a similar seismic political event might be enough to propel Trump to victory. So far, at least, the big surprises this month have been bad news for Trump - such as the revelation of his tax returns and his hospitalisation for Covid-19. Hunter Biden and his father, then Vice-President Joe Biden, in 2016 A New York Post article about a mysterious laptop containing an email that might link Joe Biden to his son Hunter's efforts to lobby for a Ukrainian gas company has been billed by some conservatives as such a campaign earthquake - but its questionable provenance and lack of specificity means it's unlikely to sway many voters. Biden article reignites social media bias claims Trump has promised that there's more to come, however. If this is just an opening salvo, setting up direct evidence of wrongdoing by Biden while vice-president, that could be a different, bigger story. Or perhaps there's another, wholly unanticipated and shocking campaign development that's just about to burst. If we could predict it, it wouldn't be a surprise. Practically since Biden secured the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, national polls have given him a steady lead over Trump. Even in key swing states, which have shown a tighter race, Biden has demonstrated a consistent lead frequently outside the margin of error. As 2016 demonstrated, however, national leads are irrelevant and state-level polls can miss the mark. Predicting what a presidential electorate will look like - that is, who will actually show up to cast a ballot - is a challenge in every election, and some pollsters got it wrong last time, undercounting the number of white, non-college-educated voters who would turn out for Trump. This video can not be played Can we believe the polls this time? Although the New York Times predicts Biden's current margins would protect him from even a 2016-level misfire, pollsters have some new obstacles to overcome in 2020. Many Americans, for instance, are planning to vote by mail for the first time. Republicans are already promising to aggressively challenge mail-in ballots to prevent what they say could be the potential for widespread fraud - something Democrats have said is really an effort at voter suppression. If voters fill out their forms incorrectly or do not follow proper procedure, or there is delay or disruption in mail delivery, it could lead to otherwise valid ballots being discarded. Understaffed or limited in-person polling places could also make it more difficult to vote on election day, discouraging Americans who had been considered by pollsters to be ""likely voters."" The dust has now settled from the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden more than two weeks ago, and the president is the one who got the dirtiest. Polls indicate Trump's aggressive, interrupting style didn't play well with suburban women, who are a key voting demographic in this campaign. Meanwhile, Biden held up adequately under fire, assuaging concerns among voters - played up by Republicans - that he had lost a step in his advancing age. This video can not be played ""Shut up, man"" and other insults and interruptions from the first debate Trump missed an opportunity to change his first-debate impressions when he backed out of the second scheduled debate because it had been switched from in-person to a ""virtual format"". He'll have one more chance on the big stage next Thursday and will have to make it count. If Trump presents a calmer, more presidential demeanour and Biden comes unglued or has some particularly dramatic gaffe, the balance of the race could possibly tilt in Trump's favour. How to avoid another 'car-crash' debate Even with polls showing an advantage for Biden, there are enough states where Trump is ahead or within the margin of error that - if things break just the right way for the president - the Electoral College arithmetic could work out for him. Even though Trump lost the national popular vote last time around, he had a comfortable margin in the Electoral College, where each state gets a number of votes based on their population. This video can not be played Who really decides the US election? A look at which voters matter Some of the swing states he won - like Michigan and Wisconsin - seem to be out of reach this time. But if he can claw out narrow victories in the rest, turning out even more white non-college voters in places like Pennsylvania and Florida, he can reach the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the White House. There are even scenarios where he and Biden each get 269 votes, creating a tie that would be decided by the state delegations to House of Representatives, a majority of which would probably side with Trump. A simple guide to the US election Where does Trump stand on key issues? Who will be the next US president? You decide Why we might not get a result on election night Biden has run a remarkably well disciplined campaign so far. Whether it's by design or due to the realities imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, a candidate known to be gaffe-prone has been able to largely stay out of the spotlight and avoid situations where his mouth can get him in trouble. But Biden is now hitting the campaign trail in earnest. With more exposure comes a greater risk of saying or doing something that costs him at the polls. This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Biden's electoral coalition is a hodgepodge of suburban moderates, disaffected Republicans, traditional working-class Democrats, ethnic minorities and liberal true believers. That's a lot of different and conflicting interests that could be stirred to anger if he gives them reason to. Then there's the chance that, under the fatigue of the campaign trail, Biden shows his age and again raises concern about whether he is up to the task of being president. If he does, the Trump campaign will be poised to pounce. The Biden campaign may feel it just has to run out the clock, and the White House will be theirs. But if they stumble, they wouldn't be the first political team to find a way to snatch improbable defeat from the jaws of what seemed certain victory.

Scots pupils to wear face coverings from 31 August,"Face coverings will only be required in corridors, communal areas and on buses Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next Monday. Education Secretary John Swinney said the new rules would apply to all pupils aged over 12. He saidthe guidance,externalhad been updated based onnew advice from the World Health Organization(WHO). There will be no requirement to wear face coverings in classrooms where distancing measures are in place. Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? WHO says children over 12 should wear masks Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? Mr Swinney said individual exemptions could be granted for health reasons, but the guidance would be ""obligatory"" for all secondary, special and grant-aided schools. He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""From August 31st young people over the age of 12 in secondary schools should habitually be wearing face coverings when they are moving around schools and corridors and in communal areas where it is difficult to deliver the physical distancing."" He said the Scottish government had acted in the light of the new WHO advice based on evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults, but had decided to go further by extending it to school transport. ""It's part of the general measures we are taking to ensure we keep pace with the emerging advice about how to keep our schools open and to keep our schools safe,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signalled on Monday that a change in the guidance was imminent. The new rules for school buses will apply to pupils over the age of five, in line with guidelines for public transport. Staff and students can continue to wear face coverings in all settings voluntarily if they wish. Eileen Prior, executive director of the parents' organisation Connect, formerly known as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, earlier said she hoped schools would be offered some flexibility over how the new guidance was implemented. She said: ""In some schools it won't be necessary - it depends very much on the environment within a school. ""Some schools are incredibly crowded but some simply aren't and some are well below capacity, perhaps with wide corridors and they don't have the issue that we have in many high schools of young people just crowding because they just can't not crowd."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âIf we need to change the advice then of course we willâ But Mr Swinney said while the new rules were not mandatory, they had the same status as other guidance on reopening of schools, such as physical distancing and hand hygiene, and should be considered ""obligatory"" across the secondary sector. ""There will be exemptions from this because the wearing of face coverings is not suitable for all individuals and that has to be respected,"" he said. He also stressed that an individual pupil should not be excluded from a school because they were not wearing a face covering. The UK government has said there are ""no plans"" to introduce similar measures when schools return in England after the summer break. Head teachers, however,have complained about a lack of clarityand asked whether English schools would have the flexibility to allow masks if requested as a safety measure by teachers. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the revised guidance in Scotland was a sensible move. She said: ""The schools have done brilliantly well getting going again but I think their physical distancing in some of the communal areas is always going to be a bit of a challenge to enforce... when we've still got cases circulating in the community this will provide additional protection when it's difficult to physically distance."" She said there may be more work to do to educate young people about the correct way to put on or remove a face covering. ""Not touching the surface - taking it off around the ears. I would recommend young people might carry a little bag in their pocket, stick the face covering in there and when they're taking it off and when they're putting it back on, making sure they don't touch the front of it,"" she said. ""And then of course there's the cleaning issue - these coverings need to be washed, just in warm water and soap."" The interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said the education advisory group had considered carefully whether poor hygiene while using masks might spread the virus. ""In their consideration they looked at the evidence from infection from removing masks, on and off, and whether that was likely to play a significant component in terms of introducing an increased risk of transmission,"" he said. ""On balance, their assessment of that evidence was that there was insufficient evidence to support that view."" The EIS teaching union welcomed the announcement as a ""sensible and appropriate step"" but repeated its call for investment in more teaching staff to allow smaller class sizes. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""There needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring social distancing in schools to protect pupils, staff and the wider community. Smaller class sizes to ensure appropriate physical distancing of pupils are essential."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

"Burnham holding government 'over a barrel' - RaabDo ""the right thing"" and accept tougher rules, the foreign secretary urges Greater Manchester's mayor.","Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt Greater Manchester's mayor should ""do the right thing by the people"" and agree to the highest level of Covid measures, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said Labour's Andy Burnham was ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics"". Mr Burnham wants more financial support for people affected by tougher rules. Northern mayors said in a joint statement they were ""united"" in a ""fight for what is right"". ""The government is claiming that the north is divided and only interested in getting what we can for our own region. That is simply not the case,"" said Mr Burnham, North Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll and Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region. Discussions between central government and local leaders over putting the region into tier three have stalled, and the leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said no talks were planned for Friday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""much rather not impose things"" but he was ""concerned about what's happening in Manchester, where clearly the levels of infection are rising steeply, the levels of hospitalisation are rising steeply and we do need action"". Meanwhile,Lancashire has agreed to move to tier three, the highest level of restrictions. It comes as a scientist advising the government, Dr Jeremy Farrar, warned that the row over England's three-tier coronavirus restrictions was ""very damaging to public health"". Row over Covid rules 'damaging public health' Manchester reaction: 'Not knowing is killing the business' What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? On Thursday, Mr Burnham said Greater Manchester would ""stand firm"" against plans to move it into tier three, calling it a ""flawed"" and ""unfair"" policy. He said the government was ""asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work"". Under tier three - the very high alert level - measures include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Mr Raab told BBC Breakfast: ""Ultimately we need to take action - we can't have a situation as we have seen in Manchester where Andy Burnham is effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics."" ""I would just urge Andy Burnham to do the right thing by the people of Manchester,"" he said. He said the government would ""hold in reserve the ability"" to impose stricter restrictions, adding that the ""right response"" was for Mr Burnham to ""recognise that the financial package is generous"". The stand-off between the mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and the Westminster government is fascinating. It's not as simple as a north-south divide. Nor is it purely a clash between Labour and the Conservatives. This goes beyond a local v national government row, too. On one side you have a long-serving MP, former health secretary and one time candidate for leader of the Labour party representing one of the party's traditional heartlands. On the other you have a Conservative government with a big majority reliant on MPs from those and other constituencies in the north of England. The mayor unsurprisingly wants more financial support for his region if tighter restrictions are imposed, the government needs its strategy of tiered restrictions to be seen to work. Boris Johnson's promise to ""level up"" less prosperous regions of the UK plays into this, as does the chancellor's decision to reduce the extent to which he's prepared to pay people's wages. Downing Street's decision to involve local leaders in deciding restrictions was always likely to result in negotiations like this. But as the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise, it's no exaggeration to say lives are at risk. Neither side will want to be seen as responsible for the virus spreading further and faster while politicians traded insults in public. Mr Raab said that if Greater Manchester and Mr Burnham are ""pulling up the drawbridge and just saying 'we're not going to proceed unless more money is coming in', I don't think that's an appropriate way to proceed"". ""We can't have a situation where Andy Burnham is effectively saying unless you give us what we want, we're not going to do the right thing in terms of following the new rules which will protect the very people of Manchester he's elected to represent."" In response to the foreign secretary's comments, Mr Burnhamtweeted,externalthat ""it's not about what we want for ourselves,"" adding: ""It's about what we want for low-paid and self-employed people everywhere: fairness."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy The joint statement from the mayors in northern England said the government's offer to pay two-thirds of the salaries of people whose workplaces have to close would not prevent job losses. It also said Universal Credit was not enough to ""prevent severe hardship for thousands of low-paid workers before Christmas"". Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard told BBC Breakfast that ""at the moment there are no meetings in the diary between us and government"", adding that ""we are in a bit of a vacuum"". From Saturday, people in London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, will move to the second highest tier - high alert. This means more than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high alert restrictions. Mr Raab told Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""risk"" that the government's three-tiered approach ""won't work"". However, he said local leaders must ""lean in"" and back the system to ensure it functions as ""effectively and swiftly as possible"". His comments come after Dr Farrar, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned making it a north-south or party political issue was ""a very dangerous route"". He also said that negotiations with individual areas delayed the ability to respond to the virus, and he was more in favour of national restrictions.

Fortnight circuit-breaker 'likely' within days,"Wales appears to be heading for another lockdown People in Wales are facing a national lockdown lasting at least two weeks in plans described as a ""fire-break"" by the first minister. Mark Drakeford said it would be a ""short, sharp"" circuit-breaker to slow down the virus. He said a decision was likely to be made on Monday, while talks continue with health officials, scientific advisors and councils over the weekend. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said. ""A 'fire-break' would also mean a short, sharp shock to all our lives. ""We would all have to stay at home to once again save lives. But this time it would be for weeks not months."" Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford warned that 2,500 people were now being infected with coronavirus every day in Wales, with critical care units in hospitals full. ""A successful fire-break would re-set the virus at a lower level,"" he added. ""Together with a new national set of rules for the whole of Wales after the fire-break period we would have slowed the virus down enough to get us through to Christmas."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said Mr Drakeford was quoting the estimated number of cases, including untested and asymptomatic, not the daily confirmed casesreported by Public Health Wales. ""There will be many people who don't get a test who have symptoms and large numbers who are asymptomatic,"" she said. ""The numbers the first minister reported today come from TAC (Technical Advisory Cell which advices the Welsh Government) and are the scientific community's best understanding of the number of cases based on a wide range of indicators."" The TAC's latest summary says the daily growth rate is estimated by Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) to be between 0.02 and 0.07 in Wales, indicating that infections could be increasing by between 2% and 7% per day. Currently about 2.3 million people in Wales are living in communities under local lockdown rules, with other communities living under different rules. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said that following any ""fire-break"" period, consistent national rules would be put in place to keep the level of the virus low. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 ""If we do this, we would much rather not have to do this again before the end of the year,"" he said, adding ministers needed to find rules people could live with. ""A set of consistent national rules will be really important, so people can look forward to the end of the year and recognise who they can spend their festive period with."" Plaid Cymru has been calling on Mr Drakeford to introduce the circuit-breaker without delay, while Labour at Westminster says a similar approach should be adopted in England. The British Medical Association in Wales, which represents doctors, said it would welcome a circuit-breaker lockdown. ""Cases are climbing fast across Wales with the latest figures showing that the number of Covid-related patients in the Welsh NHS has risen by 49% in a week,"" said Dr David Bailey, from BMA Wales. ""It's clear that the current restrictions are not strong enough to suppress the spread of the virus. ""Doctors in Wales support, and are calling for as a matter of urgency, a circuit-breaker lockdown for a number of weeks. ""It is imperative that robust action is taken now without delay, to protect the citizens of Wales, and the Welsh NHS."" Discussions on a fire-break lockdown will continue over the weekend Giving a briefing on Friday, the first minister said any fire-break lockdown in Wales would not be ""a magic wand"". He said restrictions would not ""make coronavirus disappear"" but they would ""buy time"". ""I can't offer a guaranteeâ¦ that it would not be necessary to take further measures later in the winter,"" he added. ""But I'm focused on the immediate situation, the immediate difficulties faced by our national health service by the continuing spread of the virus in all parts of Wales, and we have to act to deal with that now in this planned and pre-emptive way."" Mr Drakeford said ministers were drawing up plans for a new business support package before taking a final decision on any circuit-breaker. Allow Facebook content?

The General Secretary of TUC Wales Shavanah Taj said: ""The question is, what does that look like and how does that actually impact jobs?"" Ms Taj said if a short lockdown was brought in, jobs and businesses needed protection. ""The hospitality industry in particular supports tens of thousands of jobs throughout Wales and we do need to be doing everything possible to make sure that these workers in particular are not left unsupported,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales. ""We've got to be doing everything possible to avoid mass job losses and business closures at all costs."" Will areas such as the Brecon Beacons be off limits again? Rosemarie Harris, the leader of Powys council said she also expected the circuit-breaker action to be taken. ""Maybe two or three weeks of lockdown, a similar lockdown to before where we are all required to stay at home,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I'm not comfortable with it, but I would say that there is probably a majority support for it, as long as it is fairly short and sharp and that we have an exit strategy."" However, she said she would be seeking financial support for businesses that will be hit by any lockdown. ""It will - again - be difficult for Powys. We are travellers, because we have to be - we have no district general hospital within the county, we have no higher education, many people go out [of the county] for work, for shopping,"" she said. As part of a short lockdown in Northern Ireland, schools are closing for two weeks at half term. On Thursday morning, Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the government was discussing ""whether a circuit-breaker is an appropriate step"". That included considering ""what role education has to play in all of that and then we need to be able to give families advance notice if there is to be a change of circumstance"". Laura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT, said any decision ""needs to be communicated clearly to schools and parents"". ""It needs to be made to give everyone enough time to prepare for the impact any school closures may have"". Salon owner Charlotte Griffiths said she is concerned more restrictions may hit the hair and beauty industry Charlotte Griffiths, who owns a beauty salon in Cardiff, said she is concerned over the prospect of more restrictions. She said: ""It will affect us a lot, more so because we've only just managed to get back up on our feet from the last lockdown. ""We've only been open since November of last year, so we've spent the last year building our client base and we're now in a position where we've just broken even from the last lockdown, and it's about to hit again. ""They talk about hospitality and other industries, but they don't talk about the hair and beauty industry. We're a safe industry, but we're not recognised."" A total of 17 areas in Wales are under local lockdown because of rising infection rates - meaning people cannot travel outside of their area and indoor meetings are restricted. The first minister confirmed on Friday that all the local restrictions would remain in force across Wales ""for at least another seven days"". ""The general trend in Wales is a worsening situation and most areas where local restrictions are in place have reported a seven-day trend where Covid-19 cases have increased,"" he said.

However, she said she would be seeking financial support for businesses that will be hit by any lockdown. ""It will - again - be difficult for Powys. We are travellers, because we have to be - we have no district general hospital within the county, we have no higher education, many people go out [of the county] for work, for shopping,"" she said. As part of a short lockdown in Northern Ireland, schools are closing for two weeks at half term. On Thursday morning, Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the government was discussing ""whether a circuit-breaker is an appropriate step"". That included considering ""what role education has to play in all of that and then we need to be able to give families advance notice if there is to be a change of circumstance"". Laura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT, said any decision ""needs to be communicated clearly to schools and parents"". ""It needs to be made to give everyone enough time to prepare for the impact any school closures may have"". Salon owner Charlotte Griffiths said she is concerned more restrictions may hit the hair and beauty industry Charlotte Griffiths, who owns a beauty salon in Cardiff, said she is concerned over the prospect of more restrictions. She said: ""It will affect us a lot, more so because we've only just managed to get back up on our feet from the last lockdown. ""We've only been open since November of last year, so we've spent the last year building our client base and we're now in a position where we've just broken even from the last lockdown, and it's about to hit again. ""They talk about hospitality and other industries, but they don't talk about the hair and beauty industry. We're a safe industry, but we're not recognised."" A total of 17 areas in Wales are under local lockdown because of rising infection rates - meaning people cannot travel outside of their area and indoor meetings are restricted. The first minister confirmed on Friday that all the local restrictions would remain in force across Wales ""for at least another seven days"". ""The general trend in Wales is a worsening situation and most areas where local restrictions are in place have reported a seven-day trend where Covid-19 cases have increased,"" he said.

"Tighter rules introduced on face coverings in ScotlandThey are to be required in workplace canteens, with more areas affected from Monday.","Face masks are now required in workplace areas such as canteens, with the rules set to extend to corridors Face coverings must now be worn in workplace canteens in Scotland under new rules that have come into force. Other communal workplace areas such as corridors will also be included in the restrictions from Monday. But the rules on wearing face coverings at wedding and civil partnership ceremonies have been relaxed slightly. It means the couple will no longer have to cover their faces during the ceremony so long as they are at least 2m away from everyone else. Face coverings were already required in a number of public settings in Scotland, such as shops and on public transport. They must also be worn in secondary schools by adults and all pupils in areas such as corridors and communal areas where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopen There are exemptions from all of the rules for young children and people with certain health conditions. The new workplace restrictions mean that everyone must cover their face in work canteens unless they are sitting at a table - similar to the rules for cafes - and in most other communal areas. The measures were announced on Thursday by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said they were needed as part of the response to an increase in the number of cases and deaths across the country in recent weeks. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Ms Sturgeon said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. A further 1,196 cases of the virus were recorded on Friday, bringing the total number since the pandemic began to 45,232. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 27 to 629 since Thursday, with 58 patients being treated in intensive care - an increase of six. The deaths of nine more people who died after testing positive for Covid-19 have also been registered, bringing the total under that measure to 2,594. Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have been closed until at least 26 October, with tough restrictions placed on licensed premises elsewhere in the country. And strict rules on household mixing that were introduced three weeks ago mean that people are generally not allowed to visit other homes. Couples who are getting married or entering civil partnerships no longer need to cover their faces during the ceremony Ms Sturgeon has said that these measures - particularly the most recent ones for pubs and restaurants - will not yet be having an impact on the number of cases of the virus that are being detected. She has also warned that tougher measures may have to be introduced in the future, and that the country will not return to normal when the current restrictions on licensed premises expire on 26 October. The Scottish government intends to introduce a tiered system of restrictions at that point, similar to the one that came into force in England earlier this week. It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and to improve compliance with the rules - particularly around self-isolation. How does England's tiered system work? The English system has been highly controversial, with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnhamthreatening to ""stand firm""against plans to move it into the highest Tier 3 category of restrictions. Mr Burnham has described the tiered strategy as being ""flawed"" and ""unfair"", and has called for greater financial support to be given by the UK government to people affected by tougher rules. However, neighbouringLancashire has agreed a deal to enter Tier 3, the BBC has been told. An official announcement on the new measures is expected later. It will become the second part of England, after the Liverpool City Region, to go into Tier 3.

Row over Covid rules 'damaging public health',"The row over England's three-tier regional Covid restrictions is ""very damaging to public health"", a scientist advising the government has warned. Talks between Westminster and local leaders over moving Greater Manchester and Lancashire to the toughest tier of rules are due to resume later. Manchester's Labour mayor said northern England had been treated with contempt. But Dr Jeremy Farrar warned making it a north-south or party political issue was ""a very dangerous route"". The Wellcome Trust director, who also sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),told the BBC's Newscast podcastcountries that had controlled the virus well so far - including South Korea and New Zealand - had a ""national consensus about the way forward"". This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules ""I think we've got to come together as a country, this fragmentation, and frankly making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that's a very dangerous route to go on,"" he said. ""What we don't want now is a fragmentation or confusion - one area or region or city pitched against another. I think that would be very, very damaging to public health and the country's ability to respond."" Sir Jeremy added that negotiations with individual areas delayed the ability to respond to the virus, and he was more in favour of national restrictions. The prime minister has defended the three-tier system as ""the right way forward"", which he hoped would ""avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? What Covid tier is my area in? Discussions between central government and leaders in Lancashire are expected to resume at 08:00 BST, while more talks are also expected between leaders in Greater Manchester and No 10 on Friday morning. From Saturday, people in London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow in Furness, Cumbria, will move to the second highest tier - high alert. This means more than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high alert restrictions. So far the Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert. Areas onmediumalertare subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- which currently includes north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier - in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close. For the three-tier system to work, Sir Jeremy said the current level of restrictions would have to be toughened up ""substantially"" and he was more in favour of national restrictions. ""One of the concerns I have is it is sort of dividing up the country when every part of the country is going through an expanding epidemic at the moment in all age groups,"" he said. ""One of the challenges is the confusion of the messaging. I think on the whole simplicity is easier to understand, it's easier to adhere to, there's a sense that the country is in this together and all parts of the country affected."" He said he would have preferred a ""circuit-breaker"" - a short, national lockdown - in September, but the ""next best"" time to act was as soon as possible. The government is under significant pressure over its approach to local restrictions. Talks to try to strike an agreement with Greater Manchester will continue on Friday morning - but local leaders in the region are angry and have pledged to fight back against further measures if they are not accompanied by significantly more support, including an improved furlough package for those whose workplaces are forced to close. The final decision on restrictions rests with ministers - but they desperately want local support for any decision and for now the stand-off continues. That stand-off is causing dismay among some scientists. But the government is also facing resistance from its own MPs in Greater Manchester - who fear its plans are too strict. Meanwhile, conversations on Lancashire moving to the highest tier of restrictions continued late into the night. Local leaders are considering a package of support offered by ministers but no final decision has been made yet. On Thursday, Greater Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham said leaders in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to a move to the top tier and he called for more financial support for businesses and individuals affected by restrictions. He said the region was ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said local leaders should ""set aside party politics"" and work with the government, with cases rising ""exponentially"" in the north west of England. However, some of the area's Tory MPs also oppose Greater Manchester moving to the top tier, including Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee and MP for Altrincham and Sale West - who said there was ""widespread concern"" about the proposals. The Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has backed tougher restrictions for the capital but has also called for more financial support. This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy Meanwhile, the Scottish government is planning to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that in England. The country's central belt already faces stricter rules, with pubs and restaurants closed. InNorthern Ireland, schools will close on Monday while, from Friday, pubs, restaurants and cafes will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks. And a ban on travelling to Wales from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UKcomes into effect on Friday evening. On Thursday, a further 18,980 cases and 138 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported across the UK.

Burnham holding the government 'over a barrel',"Andy Burnham says northern England has been treated with contempt Greater Manchester's mayor should ""do the right thing by the people"" and agree to the highest level of Covid measures, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said Labour's Andy Burnham was ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics"". Mr Burnham wants more financial support for people affected by tougher rules. Northern mayors said in a joint statement they were ""united"" in a ""fight for what is right"". ""The government is claiming that the north is divided and only interested in getting what we can for our own region. That is simply not the case,"" said Mr Burnham, North Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll and Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region. Discussions between central government and local leaders over putting the region into tier three have stalled, and the leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said no talks were planned for Friday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ""much rather not impose things"" but he was ""concerned about what's happening in Manchester, where clearly the levels of infection are rising steeply, the levels of hospitalisation are rising steeply and we do need action"". Meanwhile,Lancashire has agreed to move to tier three, the highest level of restrictions. It comes as a scientist advising the government, Dr Jeremy Farrar, warned that the row over England's three-tier coronavirus restrictions was ""very damaging to public health"". Row over Covid rules 'damaging public health' Manchester reaction: 'Not knowing is killing the business' What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? On Thursday, Mr Burnham said Greater Manchester would ""stand firm"" against plans to move it into tier three, calling it a ""flawed"" and ""unfair"" policy. He said the government was ""asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work"". Under tier three - the very high alert level - measures include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Mr Raab told BBC Breakfast: ""Ultimately we need to take action - we can't have a situation as we have seen in Manchester where Andy Burnham is effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel over money and politics."" ""I would just urge Andy Burnham to do the right thing by the people of Manchester,"" he said. He said the government would ""hold in reserve the ability"" to impose stricter restrictions, adding that the ""right response"" was for Mr Burnham to ""recognise that the financial package is generous"". The stand-off between the mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and the Westminster government is fascinating. It's not as simple as a north-south divide. Nor is it purely a clash between Labour and the Conservatives. This goes beyond a local v national government row, too. On one side you have a long-serving MP, former health secretary and one time candidate for leader of the Labour party representing one of the party's traditional heartlands. On the other you have a Conservative government with a big majority reliant on MPs from those and other constituencies in the north of England. The mayor unsurprisingly wants more financial support for his region if tighter restrictions are imposed, the government needs its strategy of tiered restrictions to be seen to work. Boris Johnson's promise to ""level up"" less prosperous regions of the UK plays into this, as does the chancellor's decision to reduce the extent to which he's prepared to pay people's wages. Downing Street's decision to involve local leaders in deciding restrictions was always likely to result in negotiations like this. But as the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise, it's no exaggeration to say lives are at risk. Neither side will want to be seen as responsible for the virus spreading further and faster while politicians traded insults in public. Mr Raab said that if Greater Manchester and Mr Burnham are ""pulling up the drawbridge and just saying 'we're not going to proceed unless more money is coming in', I don't think that's an appropriate way to proceed"". ""We can't have a situation where Andy Burnham is effectively saying unless you give us what we want, we're not going to do the right thing in terms of following the new rules which will protect the very people of Manchester he's elected to represent."" In response to the foreign secretary's comments, Mr Burnhamtweeted,externalthat ""it's not about what we want for ourselves,"" adding: ""It's about what we want for low-paid and self-employed people everywhere: fairness."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy The joint statement from the mayors in northern England said the government's offer to pay two-thirds of the salaries of people whose workplaces have to close would not prevent job losses. It also said Universal Credit was not enough to ""prevent severe hardship for thousands of low-paid workers before Christmas"". Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard told BBC Breakfast that ""at the moment there are no meetings in the diary between us and government"", adding that ""we are in a bit of a vacuum"". From Saturday, people in London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, will move to the second highest tier - high alert. This means more than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high alert restrictions. Mr Raab told Radio 4's Today programme there was a ""risk"" that the government's three-tiered approach ""won't work"". However, he said local leaders must ""lean in"" and back the system to ensure it functions as ""effectively and swiftly as possible"". His comments come after Dr Farrar, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned making it a north-south or party political issue was ""a very dangerous route"". He also said that negotiations with individual areas delayed the ability to respond to the virus, and he was more in favour of national restrictions.

Before we do, here are the main UK stories from today:  Here are the main stories from around the world today: Danai HowardBBC News Internet searches in Hong Kong for flights to Singapore have jumped by 400% following the announcement that the two cities were planning a potential ""travel bubble"". The travel website Expedia said it saw a three-digit surge in the number of customers, while prices for flights in December rose by at least 57% in the last 24 hours, to $3,297 [Hong Kong dollars] (Â£329) for a round-trip. Meanwhile, the share price for Hong Kongâs airline Cathay Pacific jumped by 7% following the announcement on Thursday. The travel bubble would mean that people would be able to travel between Hong Kong and Singapore without the need to quarantine, but Singaporeâs Transport Minister, Ong Ye Kung, has said travellers would still need to have received negative Covid-19 test results to travel under the scheme. International travel to Asia collapsed during the pandemic, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. The Singapore-Hong Kong deal will provide some much-needed relief for the regionâs aviation and tourism sectors. âIt is a safe, careful, but significant step forward to revive air travel, and provide a model for future collaboration with other parts of the world,"" Mr Ong said.    Tensions are running high between Downing Street and local leaders in Greater Manchester, who have been unable to agree on whether the areas should move to England's highest, tier-three level of Covid restrictions. Mayor Andy Burnham, his deputy mayors
and other Greater Manchester leaders have just released a statement, saying: ""At our last meeting with Downing Street officials yesterday morning, we were told they would arrange a further meeting later in the day to provide a response to our requests. That did not happen and, despite being on standby all day today, we are still waiting for it to be arranged. We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward. They add that they are ânot convinced that
closing hospitality venues is the only way to protect hospitals"" and they would prefer to look at other measures ""such as reinstating shielding arrangements and
introducing tougher instant closure powers on non-compliant pubs, restaurants,
shops and other business premisesâ. It comes after Prime
Minister Boris Johnson warned he may âhave to interveneâ if tier-three measures were not
agreed for Manchester. The
prime minister urged Mayor Andy Burnham to ""engage constructively""
with the government, saying the situation was worsening every day and ""time is of the
essence"". Circuit breaker lockdowns have been used in some countries such as Singapore and Israel as way of reducing the number of cases of coronavirus by stopping the ways it can spread. Wales says it willspend the next few days considering a circuit-breaker lockdown which they're calling a 'fire break'. But how do they work? How long is a Covid circuit breaker? How can it help fight coronavirus? This video can not be played Circuit breaker lockdown: What is a circuit breaker? Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Belgium is seeing a rise in the number of Covid cases All bars, cafes and
restaurants across Belgium will close from Monday for a month, following a
surge in the number of Covid 19 cases. A night time curfew will also be in place across the country
from Monday from midnight until 5am. The Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo announced the
measures this evening, stating that the country had entered a âvery serious
alert phase, phase fourâ. The measures will also mean that people can only have one
close contact outside of their household, compared to four close contacts
previously. Mr De Croo also stated that working from home will be
compulsory for all workers who are able to. Sales of alcohol will also be
banned after 8pm. He added that the situation could be reviewed after two weeks
for all measures. Belgium has had an average of 6,000 infections and 20 deaths
per day in the past 7 days, including a rise of 7,360 cases in a single day
recorded on Wednesday. The infection rate over the past two weeks stands at 549
infections per 100,000 people. Thatâs an increase of 182% compared to that two
weeks before. The daily flow of patients at several hospitals in Brussels
and Wallonia is starting to put pressure on the health system again, according
to medical staff. Officials have now ordered hospitals to reserve 50% of ICU beds for Covid patients, up from 30%. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has confirmed it will not apply for emergency authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine before late next month - puncturing President Donald Trump's hope for a virus jab before the 3 November presidential election. In a statement, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company may know whether or not their vaccine is effective by the end of October, but that the time needed to collect safety and manufacturing data will push the authorisation date several weeks later. ""We are operating at the speed of science,"" he said. Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be ready before Americans go to the polls next month, fueling speculation that the timeline is politically motivated. At a town hall event last night, Democratic challenger Joe Biden said he would take a vaccine when it becomes ready, if ""the body of scientists"" say it is safe. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says ""there was no contact tracing done"" with him by the White House after he tested positive for Covid-19. ""My contact tracing was done by my local county board of health. They called me when i was in the hospital,"" he said to ABC News in his first televised interview since his release from hospital. The Republican was present at the 26 September Rose Garden event, now under scrutiny as a possible super-spreading event. Christie has since expressed regret over the event, saying he incorrectly believed the White House was a ""safe zone"" and that he was ""wrong"" not to wear a mask. ""I let my guard down. And it was wrong, it was just a big mistake,"" he said to ABC. Asked on Friday if he has since urged President Trump to advocate for mask wearing, Christie said that ""everybody's going to make their own decisions on that"". A new
three-tier system has been introduced in England to help control the spread of
the virus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. But
what rules happen at what tier? The
BBCâs health correspondent, Laura Foster, has a summary. This video can not be played Covid tier lockdown: What is the tier lockdown system in England? As almost
every day brings another record high in the number of daily infections in
Russia, the authorities have been tightening restrictions across the vast
country. They differ
from region to region since President Vladimir Putin delegated significant powers
for fighting the epidemic to local authorities in April. On 16
October, Russia reported another spike of 15,150 new coronavirus cases, up from
13,754 the previous day. In late August, the number was below 5,000. The daily
death toll from Covid-19 has been rising too, reaching an all-time high of 286
yesterday. To combat
the spread of the epidemic, employers in some cities have been told to move at
least some of their staff to home working, some regional administrations have
urged locals to stay at home, but no part of Russia has returned to the strict
lockdown measures that were imposed at the start of the pandemic. Wearing a face mask in shops or on public transport is
mandatory in most Russian regions. Employers in Moscow, Rostov and
Volgograd have been ordered to switch at least 30% of staff
â as well as everyone older than 65 - to working from home. Also in Moscow, the autumn school holidays were
extended from one week to two (until 18 October) and older pupils will be
moved to distance learning until the end of the month. The authorities in Moscow, Volgograd, Khanty-Mansi
Autonomous Area, Nizhny Novgorod Region, Krasnodar Territory
and Russia-annexed Crimea ruled that people over 65, pregnant women
and those with chronic diseases must stay at home. In Rostov, local residents are required to stay at home unless
they are on the way to work, shopping or engaged in one of a number of other
activities such as exercising or walking a dog. Mass public
events are banned in Rostov Region, Krasnodar
Territory, Transbaikal Territory, Udmurtia and the city of
Sevastopol in Crimea. Stavropol Territory requires visitors from other regions to
quarantine for 14 days. Leningrad Regionintroduced,external""red"", ""yellow"" and
""green"" zones depending on the density of Covid-19 cases in the area,
and limits the number of people present in these zones accordingly. Kaliningrad
Region banned cinemas on weekends. Bars and night clubs are closed in
Kaliningrad Region, Chukotka and Rostov Region. Rostov Region and Lipetsk Region suspended routine medical
care, except for urgent conditions, for everyone apart from Covid-19
patients.  Today's developments have done nothing to provide the clarity desperately needed by one business owner in Greater Manchester - who still doesn't know whether her area will move into the highest Covid alert level. Emma Shone, co-owner of gin and whisky bar Number 6 in Sale, Trafford, was left none the wiser after this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. She said: ""Itâs completely frustrating for us as a local business. ""There are no winners in either tier two or tier three but for us he [the prime minister] needs to make that decision. ""We are going into yet another weekend of uncertainty about whether we have the hours for our staff, whether we purchase more stock. ""We went through that last weekend and now we're about to go through it again. ""Given the urgency Boris Johnson makes in all his press conferences, it seems very unclear as to why he wonât make that decision and take it out of the hands of [Greater Manchester Mayor] Andy Burnham, who appears to be making a very political statement as opposed to what is good for our local businesses. ""For us it is just devastating that we still donât have a decision as we go into another weekend."" The US reported more than 65,000 cases across the country on Thursday - the most in a single day since July - as it inches toward a total of eight million infections. Uncontrolled outbreaks are raging on in the Upper Midwest, in states like Wisconsin and Montana. Nearby, North Dakota and South Dakota are now adding more cases than any states have since the start of the pandemic. The return of students to colleges and universities has been linked to the rapid spread. A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost 100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September - around when college students began their return to school - found that weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally. Authorities have also pointed to a rise in ""pandemic fatigue"", now more than six months after the outbreak reached the US.  Passengers were banned from disembarking from a ship in Malta Passengers
have been stopped from disembarking a cruise ship in Malta due to a suspected
case of Covid-19. The MSC
Grandiosa cruise
ship was allowed into Valetta harbour but left the port after collecting
supplies. During
the beginning of the pandemic, cruise ships were involved in a large number of
cases. Malta
allowed cruise ships into its harbours on the condition that passengers did not
mix with locals. As we have been reporting, discussions are still ongoing about Greater Manchester going into the highest Covid alert level. The government wants the area to go into tier three, but Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called the tougher rules ""flawed and unfair"" and wants more financial support for people affected. During today's coronavirus press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may ""need to intervene"" in order to save lives. Now, Burnham has responded, flagging up comments made by the chief scientific adviser to the government, Sir Patrick Vallance, who has said he thinks tier-three restrictions will not be enough to control the virus.

than 10,000 cases were confirmed in Italy on Friday, the highest ever daily
figure reported in the country. A
further 55 deaths were reported. During
the height of the pandemic in March, Italy was badly affected. More
than 36,427 people have died and more than 391,000 people have contracted the virus
since the outbreak began there. Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking
about the financial support available for those in areas with the highest level
of local restrictions â tier three. âThe
Job Support Scheme combined with Universal Credit means that those on low
incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of
their wages,âhe said. The
Job Support Scheme (JSS) replaces furlough from 1 November. Peopleâs
entitlement to Universal Credit depends on many factors such as income, whether
the claimant has children and whether they have savings. For
example, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, if you have more than Â£16,000 in savings, you are not entitled to any Universal Credit, which means
you would only get the 67% of your wages paid by JSS (up to a maximum of Â£2,100
a month). In
this case, you could get a little more than 67% of your usual income (because
you would be paying a bit less tax) but not as much as 80% of it. You
can read more about the Job Support Schemehere.  The three main symptoms of coronavirus are a fever, a continuous dry cough or a loss of smell or taste. Anyone showing these symptoms should get a coronavirus test and stay at home to stop the coronavirus from spreading further.

The system's falling over,"" the MP for Nottingham North said. Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he said: ""If the government are doing things that we think are ignoring the science, that are not in the nation's best interest, we've got a responsibility to speak up - which is what you've seen this week with Keir Starmer articulating and arguing for a circuit breaker... We think it's the best way forward.â He said Nottingham MPs and council leaders would be meeting with the government to discuss further local restrictions next week. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ban to begin on visiting Wales from Covid hotspotsThere are questions over how the move will be policed and whether it will cause ""division"".","In Wales, people living in hotspot areas cannot travel - but people in England's can A ban on people travelling to Wales from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UK has come into effect. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the rules on Wednesday after twice asking Boris Johnson to stop people from English hotspots from travelling. The ban covers all of Northern Ireland, England'stier two and three areasand the Scottish central belt. Mr Johnson has since written back to Mr Drakeford and said the UK ""must avoid imposing conflicting restrictions"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart criticised the decision, saying it risks""stirring division and confusion, but the move has been backed by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The new rules, which came into force at 18:00 BST on Friday, mean anyone coming from places in the UK with extra restrictions is now banned from entering the country. People living in parts of England and Scotland without extra restrictions can still travel to areas of Wales which are not under local lockdowns, including Powys, Pembrokeshire and Gwynedd (apart from Bangor). Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Currently, 17 areas of Wales, including 15 of its 22 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli, are currently under local lockdowns. Movement in and out of these counties without a reasonable excuse was already banned. As is the case within Wales, there arereasonable excuses for travelling in and out of locked down areasincluded in the ban. Under the new rules, exceptions to the travel ban include: Getting food, medical or essential supplies for those in the same household or vulnerable people - this includes for animals To work or provide voluntary or charitable services if this cannot be done from outside the area Elite athletes can train and compete To provide or receive emergency assistance To attend a wedding or civil partnership (as a guest or as part of the wedding party) or a funeral To attend court Children to play sport, music or for other recreational activities - or to continue existing contact arrangements between parents who do not live together To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm The new rules will be enforced with fines Announcing the ban, Mr Drakeford said: ""Evidence from public health professionals suggests coronavirus is moving from east to west across the UK and across Wales. ""As a general rule, it is concentrating in urban areas and then spreading to more sparsely populated areas as a result of people travelling."" Mr Drakeford said the law will be ""essentially designed to prevent people going to those holiday parts of Wales, the far west and the far southwest of Wales, where the virus is still in very low circulation"". Speaking on behalf of the four Welsh police forces, North Wales Police said officers would be ""proactive"" in targeting those not sticking to rules on gatherings. But the head of the Police Federation in Wales warned that the rules could be ""unenforceable"". Police forces in Wales are already responsible for enforcing travel rules in local lockdown areas The Welsh Government said police will explain regulations to anyone caught breaking the rules before issuing a fixed penalty notice, but will issue a fine of Â£60, which will be halved if paid within 14 days. Fines will then be doubled for each offence, up to a limit of Â£1,920. Alun Michael, the police and crime commissioner for South Wales Police, said officers would ask the public to ""use common sense"". ""It obviously makes no sense for people who are in high infection areas to travel into Wales into lower infection areas,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfaston Friday. ""It's very clear we've got a very challenging period coming up and obeying the rules is absolutely crucial. This is a public health emergency."" Mr Michael, who was the first Labour leader of the Welsh Government, added: ""We really need the UK government to be giving out the same messages about not travelling that have come very clearly from the Welsh Government."" This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected calls for travel restrictions in a BBC Wales interview In his response letter to Mr Drakeford, Mr Johnson said he would ask Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to arrange an ""urgent meeting"" between the four UK nations. He said: ""We share the same ambitions, yet as you said in your letter to me it would be far better for all four parts of the UK to act in concert. ""We must avoid a situation where different areas within the UK impose conflicting restrictions on each other."" Mr Johnson also said in his letter that the UK government had decided not to impose legal restrictions on people travelling from hotspots as ""effective enforcement would be extremely difficult and resource intensive"".

In a statement, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company may know whether or not their vaccine is effective by the end of October, but that the time needed to collect safety and manufacturing data will push the authorisation date several weeks later. ""We are operating at the speed of science,"" he said. Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be ready before Americans go to the polls next month, fueling speculation that the timeline is politically motivated. At a town hall event last night, Democratic challenger Joe Biden said he would take a vaccine when it becomes ready, if ""the body of scientists"" say it is safe. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says ""there was no contact tracing done"" with him by the White House after he tested positive for Covid-19. ""My contact tracing was done by my local county board of health. They called me when i was in the hospital,"" he said to ABC News in his first televised interview since his release from hospital. The Republican was present at the 26 September Rose Garden event, now under scrutiny as a possible super-spreading event. Christie has since expressed regret over the event, saying he incorrectly believed the White House was a ""safe zone"" and that he was ""wrong"" not to wear a mask. ""I let my guard down. And it was wrong, it was just a big mistake,"" he said to ABC. Asked on Friday if he has since urged President Trump to advocate for mask wearing, Christie said that ""everybody's going to make their own decisions on that"". A new
three-tier system has been introduced in England to help control the spread of
the virus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. But
what rules happen at what tier? The
BBCâs health correspondent, Laura Foster, has a summary. This video can not be played Covid tier lockdown: What is the tier lockdown system in England? As almost
every day brings another record high in the number of daily infections in
Russia, the authorities have been tightening restrictions across the vast
country. They differ
from region to region since President Vladimir Putin delegated significant powers
for fighting the epidemic to local authorities in April. On 16
October, Russia reported another spike of 15,150 new coronavirus cases, up from
13,754 the previous day. In late August, the number was below 5,000. The daily
death toll from Covid-19 has been rising too, reaching an all-time high of 286
yesterday. To combat
the spread of the epidemic, employers in some cities have been told to move at
least some of their staff to home working, some regional administrations have
urged locals to stay at home, but no part of Russia has returned to the strict
lockdown measures that were imposed at the start of the pandemic. Wearing a face mask in shops or on public transport is
mandatory in most Russian regions. Employers in Moscow, Rostov and
Volgograd have been ordered to switch at least 30% of staff
â as well as everyone older than 65 - to working from home. Also in Moscow, the autumn school holidays were
extended from one week to two (until 18 October) and older pupils will be
moved to distance learning until the end of the month. The authorities in Moscow, Volgograd, Khanty-Mansi
Autonomous Area, Nizhny Novgorod Region, Krasnodar Territory
and Russia-annexed Crimea ruled that people over 65, pregnant women
and those with chronic diseases must stay at home. In Rostov, local residents are required to stay at home unless
they are on the way to work, shopping or engaged in one of a number of other
activities such as exercising or walking a dog. Mass public
events are banned in Rostov Region, Krasnodar
Territory, Transbaikal Territory, Udmurtia and the city of
Sevastopol in Crimea. Stavropol Territory requires visitors from other regions to
quarantine for 14 days. Leningrad Regionintroduced,external""red"", ""yellow"" and
""green"" zones depending on the density of Covid-19 cases in the area,
and limits the number of people present in these zones accordingly. Kaliningrad
Region banned cinemas on weekends. Bars and night clubs are closed in
Kaliningrad Region, Chukotka and Rostov Region. Rostov Region and Lipetsk Region suspended routine medical
care, except for urgent conditions, for everyone apart from Covid-19
patients.  Today's developments have done nothing to provide the clarity desperately needed by one business owner in Greater Manchester - who still doesn't know whether her area will move into the highest Covid alert level. Emma Shone, co-owner of gin and whisky bar Number 6 in Sale, Trafford, was left none the wiser after this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. She said: ""Itâs completely frustrating for us as a local business. ""There are no winners in either tier two or tier three but for us he [the prime minister] needs to make that decision. ""We are going into yet another weekend of uncertainty about whether we have the hours for our staff, whether we purchase more stock. ""We went through that last weekend and now we're about to go through it again. ""Given the urgency Boris Johnson makes in all his press conferences, it seems very unclear as to why he wonât make that decision and take it out of the hands of [Greater Manchester Mayor] Andy Burnham, who appears to be making a very political statement as opposed to what is good for our local businesses. ""For us it is just devastating that we still donât have a decision as we go into another weekend."" The US reported more than 65,000 cases across the country on Thursday - the most in a single day since July - as it inches toward a total of eight million infections. Uncontrolled outbreaks are raging on in the Upper Midwest, in states like Wisconsin and Montana. Nearby, North Dakota and South Dakota are now adding more cases than any states have since the start of the pandemic. The return of students to colleges and universities has been linked to the rapid spread. A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost 100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September - around when college students began their return to school - found that weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally. Authorities have also pointed to a rise in ""pandemic fatigue"", now more than six months after the outbreak reached the US.  Passengers were banned from disembarking from a ship in Malta Passengers
have been stopped from disembarking a cruise ship in Malta due to a suspected
case of Covid-19. The MSC
Grandiosa cruise
ship was allowed into Valetta harbour but left the port after collecting
supplies. During
the beginning of the pandemic, cruise ships were involved in a large number of
cases. Malta
allowed cruise ships into its harbours on the condition that passengers did not
mix with locals. As we have been reporting, discussions are still ongoing about Greater Manchester going into the highest Covid alert level. The government wants the area to go into tier three, but Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called the tougher rules ""flawed and unfair"" and wants more financial support for people affected. During today's coronavirus press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may ""need to intervene"" in order to save lives. Now, Burnham has responded, flagging up comments made by the chief scientific adviser to the government, Sir Patrick Vallance, who has said he thinks tier-three restrictions will not be enough to control the virus.

than 10,000 cases were confirmed in Italy on Friday, the highest ever daily
figure reported in the country. A

the height of the pandemic in March, Italy was badly affected. More
than 36,427 people have died and more than 391,000 people have contracted the virus

about the financial support available for those in areas with the highest level
of local restrictions â tier three. âThe
Job Support Scheme combined with Universal Credit means that those on low
incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of
their wages,âhe said. The
Job Support Scheme (JSS) replaces furlough from 1 November. Peopleâs
entitlement to Universal Credit depends on many factors such as income, whether
the claimant has children and whether they have savings. For
example, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, if you have more than Â£16,000 in savings, you are not entitled to any Universal Credit, which means
you would only get the 67% of your wages paid by JSS (up to a maximum of Â£2,100
a month). In
this case, you could get a little more than 67% of your usual income (because
you would be paying a bit less tax) but not as much as 80% of it. You

NI pubs and restaurants to close on Friday evening,"Pubs, restaurants and cafes across NI closed their doors to sit-in customers at 18:00 BST on Friday understricter Covid-19 restrictions. Hair and beauty salons also have to shut and gyms face additional measures for the next four weeks too. Belfast Chamber of Commerce chief executive Simon Hamilton said a support package for businesses ""didn't cut it"". It also emerged on Friday that driving instructors will be taken off the road. Ministers released the fullpublic health regulations and guidance,externalrelating to the new restrictions on Friday night. On Thursday Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced hotels would be able to apply to ascheme designed to help businesses forced to shut. The additional financial support comes afternew restrictions were announced in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19. Mr Murphy said the package was intended to get support to businesses quickly. But Mr Hamilton said it was ""paltry in comparison to the costs that many businesses are going to face"". He told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster: ""The chancellor and the government don't appear to be too keen to provide more money for what they describe as localised lockdowns, so I am really, really concerned, having talked to members over the last 24/48 hours, that this is just too far for them, this is too much."" NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external New Covid support announced for NI firms NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered Mr Hamilton warned there was a risk of thousands of job losses. Simon Hamilton said much more support was needed for businesses The scheme will see payments available to businesses every fortnight that they are closed, on a tiered level. It is set to cost Â£35m and will open for applications from Monday. Hospitality Ulster chief Colin Neill echoed Mr Hamilton's views, saying the support was vital but was ""nowhere near enough"". He said: ""We now need the prime minister, the chancellor and the treasury to listen up, level up and stop sitting on their hands."" Mr Neill called for more emergency funding to be given to Stormont to help hospitality businesses ""in dire need"". The new scheme will see small businesses receive Â£1,600 every fortnight that they are in lockdown, medium businesses Â£2,400 and large firms getting Â£3,200. The thresholds are: Small businesses with a net annual value (NAV) up to Â£15,000 Medium businesses with a NAV of Â£15,001 to Â£51,000 Large businesses with NAV of Â£51,001 or more Jenny Sherlock owns Inner Beauty in the seaside town of Millisle, County Down. Before the coronavirus pandemic, a Friday usually meant her beauty salon was buzzing with people getting ready for the weekend. Hairdressers, makeup artists and beauticians rent chairs at the salon to provide their services, but their businesses never really got off the ground once lockdown restrictions eased. Staff were busy on Friday trying to fit as many clients in as possible ahead of the closure, this time hopefully for only four weeks. ""We had to supply all posters, floor stickers, desk and table top shields and dividing sections. All PPE had to be provided, as we all wore masks, face shields, disposable aprons and gloves in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus,"" she said. ""We sanitised all the work stations after each client and implemented a one-in-one-out system, meaning staff had to rotate their working hours and days so that we didn't have clients clash. ""Having been told we've now to close again after doing everything possible to keep open is disheartening and mentally draining with all the worrying about what's happening and how bills are going to get paid, never mind how we're going to afford to reopen again when the time comes."" Wednesday saw new measures announced for all of Northern Ireland, with schools closing for two weeks from Monday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households, other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics. Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services - prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting Hotels with exemptions for them to offer rooms to essential workers such as workers who need hotels for work-related purposes and ""staff on the front line battling Covid"" Driving instructors must stop offering lessons This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds From 18:00 on Friday, visits to prisons in Northern Ireland have also been suspended.

NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered,"The reopening of theatres and concert venues is among the latest moves by Stormont minister to ease lockdown Northern Ireland Executive ministers have agreed to lift more Covid-19 public health restrictions this week, allowing theatre and concert venues to reopen. The rules on live music and the number of people who are allowed to meet in a private home are also being eased. Ministers have been gradually lifting restrictions in the past few months, following the strict lockdown they imposed across Northern Ireland after Christmas 2020. However, a recent surge in infection rates and the resulting pressure on hospital admissions mean some restriction remain in place for now. BBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, travel, face coverings and other areas. Yes. On Monday, ministers agreed that a total of 10 people from three households would now be allowed to meet inside a home. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Previously, the limit was six people from two households (or 10 people if one household was bigger than six people). Overnight stays have been allowed for some time. Yes, and the numbers allowed to enter have been gradually increasing. From Monday 26 July, a maximum of 15 people from an unlimited number of households are able to meet in a private garden. Again, children aged 12 and under do not count towards this limit. Long-awaited holidays abroad are possible without quarantine from 26 July for some travellers Yes, you can. Atraffic light system for international travelcame into force on 24 May, with a limited number of countries on the green list meaning people arriving in Northern Ireland from those areas were exempt from quarantine. With the expanded vaccination rollout, more significant changes took effect on 19 July. New rules came into force on that date which meant travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from amber countries (except France) were able toavoid quarantine if they had received both their Covid-19 vaccinesin the UK. These passengers still need to produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before departure and take a PCR test on day two after arrival. There are exemptions for some including children under 18, those medically advised against vaccination and clinical trial participants. On Thursday 29 July, the NI Executive announced thatpeople who have been fully vaccinated in the EU (except France) or the US will not need to isolate when coming to Northern Ireland. The move, from Monday 2 August, brings Northern Ireland in line with England, Scotland and Wales. There are also no limits on travel to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, known as the Common Travel Area (CTA). On 24 May, the Northern Ireland Executive lifted its guidance on self-isolating after travelling to another part of the CTA. Testing is still advised after arriving back in Northern Ireland from another part of the CTA but it is guidance only. Restrictions on dancing mean nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain shut Yes,live music resumed from 5 July with a number of restrictions, but these rules are in the process of being eased. Stormont ministers have now agreed that concert venues and theatres can reopen from 18:00 BST on Tuesday 27 July. But the venues must sell tickets in advance of performance, they must have allocated seating and ensure social distancing of at least 1m (3ft). Volume restrictions on live indoor music which were in force from 5- 26 July have now been lifted. However, dancing is not permitted and this restriction is not due to be reconsidered by ministers before 12 August. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed at present. Face coverings remain mandatory in many settings AlthoughPrime Minister Boris Johnson removed the legal requirement to use face coverings in England from 19 July, that change did not apply in Northern Ireland. Masks have been mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland since July 2020 and in shops since August 2020, with a limited number of exemptions. But from 26 July, people attending indoor religious services in Northern Ireland will no longer have to wear a face covering during the service. However, it is still be a legal requirement to wear face masks when entering and exiting the building, and guidance will recommend that worshipers keep their masks on during services. Face coverings remain compulsory in other settings, including: Pubs, restaurants and hotels when customers are not seated at a table Taxis and private buses For staff in retail shops In public areas of civil services offices such as jobs and benefits offices When boarding a plane In banks, building societies, credit unions and post offices For driving instructors and their students It's a more complicated picture. The executive says from 26 July, where it's still the law to socially distance - such as restaurants and workplaces - the limit will be reduced to 1m for indoors activities. The 1m rule was then extended to include retail and shopping centres. It will be removed for all outdoor activities from law but guidance will be that social distancing is recommended at 1m (3ft) where possible. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan recently said more significant changes were coming and that he hoped the executive could agree on 12 August to put in place a date to end social distancing in law. That meeting could also see ministers discuss lifting the remaining restrictions on hospitality, such as the numbers of people allowed to sit at a table together. Many people postponed their weddings over the past year and a half These ceremonies have been continuing with restrictions through the latest lockdown, but from 24 May, post-wedding and civil partnership receptions were allowed to resume. However, mitigations remain in place including: Tables of up to 10 people only (no household limit) No restriction on numbers of people at the top table Venues must carry out a risk assessment for capacity Dancing is not permitted Vehicle testing has been disrupted since early 2020 by MoT equipment failures and the pandemic From 26 July,normal services resumed at MoT centres. During MoT examinations, a vehicle can be shared by the driver and the examiner for five minutes if both wear a mask. Customers will be permitted to be seated safely for eight minutes and must remaining socially-distanced and wear a mask. The executive said that was to allow customers to be present in testing halls and take their vehicle through the process with examiners. On the same date - 26 July - other close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons do not need clients to book ahead for appointments first and overlapping appointments will also be allowed. Quite possibly, but do not expect Northern Ireland's rules to directly match the timeline in other parts of the UK. The Northern Ireland Executive can change the restrictions regularly in line with new public health advice and said it is conscious of the pace of change in other jurisdictions. It has said its decisions have been taken in a ""local context"". The executive's planned meeting on 12 August will look at the requirements for face coverings and self-isolation as well as its guidance around working from home and relaxing restrictions on meeting at home. That day could see ministers agree a date to end some of the measures that have dominated lives and livelihoods since last March. But as ever, putting that in place requires support from the executive's five parties. Achieving political consensus on how and when to end restrictions remains challenging to navigate.

Tighter rules introduced on face coverings in Scotland,"Face masks are now required in workplace areas such as canteens, with the rules set to extend to corridors Face coverings must now be worn in workplace canteens in Scotland under new rules that have come into force. Other communal workplace areas such as corridors will also be included in the restrictions from Monday. But the rules on wearing face coverings at wedding and civil partnership ceremonies have been relaxed slightly. It means the couple will no longer have to cover their faces during the ceremony so long as they are at least 2m away from everyone else. Face coverings were already required in a number of public settings in Scotland, such as shops and on public transport. They must also be worn in secondary schools by adults and all pupils in areas such as corridors and communal areas where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopen There are exemptions from all of the rules for young children and people with certain health conditions. The new workplace restrictions mean that everyone must cover their face in work canteens unless they are sitting at a table - similar to the rules for cafes - and in most other communal areas. The measures were announced on Thursday by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said they were needed as part of the response to an increase in the number of cases and deaths across the country in recent weeks. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Ms Sturgeon said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. A further 1,196 cases of the virus were recorded on Friday, bringing the total number since the pandemic began to 45,232. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 27 to 629 since Thursday, with 58 patients being treated in intensive care - an increase of six. The deaths of nine more people who died after testing positive for Covid-19 have also been registered, bringing the total under that measure to 2,594. Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have been closed until at least 26 October, with tough restrictions placed on licensed premises elsewhere in the country. And strict rules on household mixing that were introduced three weeks ago mean that people are generally not allowed to visit other homes. Couples who are getting married or entering civil partnerships no longer need to cover their faces during the ceremony Ms Sturgeon has said that these measures - particularly the most recent ones for pubs and restaurants - will not yet be having an impact on the number of cases of the virus that are being detected. She has also warned that tougher measures may have to be introduced in the future, and that the country will not return to normal when the current restrictions on licensed premises expire on 26 October. The Scottish government intends to introduce a tiered system of restrictions at that point, similar to the one that came into force in England earlier this week. It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and to improve compliance with the rules - particularly around self-isolation. How does England's tiered system work? The English system has been highly controversial, with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnhamthreatening to ""stand firm""against plans to move it into the highest Tier 3 category of restrictions. Mr Burnham has described the tiered strategy as being ""flawed"" and ""unfair"", and has called for greater financial support to be given by the UK government to people affected by tougher rules. However, neighbouringLancashire has agreed a deal to enter Tier 3, the BBC has been told. An official announcement on the new measures is expected later. It will become the second part of England, after the Liverpool City Region, to go into Tier 3.

A further 1,196 cases of the virus were recorded on Friday, bringing the total number since the pandemic began to 45,232. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 27 to 629 since Thursday, with 58 patients being treated in intensive care - an increase of six. The deaths of nine more people who died after testing positive for Covid-19 have also been registered, bringing the total under that measure to 2,594. Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have been closed until at least 26 October, with tough restrictions placed on licensed premises elsewhere in the country. And strict rules on household mixing that were introduced three weeks ago mean that people are generally not allowed to visit other homes. Couples who are getting married or entering civil partnerships no longer need to cover their faces during the ceremony Ms Sturgeon has said that these measures - particularly the most recent ones for pubs and restaurants - will not yet be having an impact on the number of cases of the virus that are being detected. She has also warned that tougher measures may have to be introduced in the future, and that the country will not return to normal when the current restrictions on licensed premises expire on 26 October. The Scottish government intends to introduce a tiered system of restrictions at that point, similar to the one that came into force in England earlier this week. It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and to improve compliance with the rules - particularly around self-isolation. How does England's tiered system work? The English system has been highly controversial, with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnhamthreatening to ""stand firm""against plans to move it into the highest Tier 3 category of restrictions. Mr Burnham has described the tiered strategy as being ""flawed"" and ""unfair"", and has called for greater financial support to be given by the UK government to people affected by tougher rules. However, neighbouringLancashire has agreed a deal to enter Tier 3, the BBC has been told. An official announcement on the new measures is expected later. It will become the second part of England, after the Liverpool City Region, to go into Tier 3.

Row of English Covid rules 'damaging public health',"The row over England's three-tier regional Covid restrictions is ""very damaging to public health"", a scientist advising the government has warned. Talks between Westminster and local leaders over moving Greater Manchester and Lancashire to the toughest tier of rules are due to resume later. Manchester's Labour mayor said northern England had been treated with contempt. But Dr Jeremy Farrar warned making it a north-south or party political issue was ""a very dangerous route"". The Wellcome Trust director, who also sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),told the BBC's Newscast podcastcountries that had controlled the virus well so far - including South Korea and New Zealand - had a ""national consensus about the way forward"". This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules ""I think we've got to come together as a country, this fragmentation, and frankly making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that's a very dangerous route to go on,"" he said. ""What we don't want now is a fragmentation or confusion - one area or region or city pitched against another. I think that would be very, very damaging to public health and the country's ability to respond."" Sir Jeremy added that negotiations with individual areas delayed the ability to respond to the virus, and he was more in favour of national restrictions. The prime minister has defended the three-tier system as ""the right way forward"", which he hoped would ""avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? What Covid tier is my area in? Discussions between central government and leaders in Lancashire are expected to resume at 08:00 BST, while more talks are also expected between leaders in Greater Manchester and No 10 on Friday morning. From Saturday, people in London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow in Furness, Cumbria, will move to the second highest tier - high alert. This means more than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high alert restrictions. So far the Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert. Areas onmediumalertare subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- which currently includes north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier - in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close. For the three-tier system to work, Sir Jeremy said the current level of restrictions would have to be toughened up ""substantially"" and he was more in favour of national restrictions. ""One of the concerns I have is it is sort of dividing up the country when every part of the country is going through an expanding epidemic at the moment in all age groups,"" he said. ""One of the challenges is the confusion of the messaging. I think on the whole simplicity is easier to understand, it's easier to adhere to, there's a sense that the country is in this together and all parts of the country affected."" He said he would have preferred a ""circuit-breaker"" - a short, national lockdown - in September, but the ""next best"" time to act was as soon as possible. The government is under significant pressure over its approach to local restrictions. Talks to try to strike an agreement with Greater Manchester will continue on Friday morning - but local leaders in the region are angry and have pledged to fight back against further measures if they are not accompanied by significantly more support, including an improved furlough package for those whose workplaces are forced to close. The final decision on restrictions rests with ministers - but they desperately want local support for any decision and for now the stand-off continues. That stand-off is causing dismay among some scientists. But the government is also facing resistance from its own MPs in Greater Manchester - who fear its plans are too strict. Meanwhile, conversations on Lancashire moving to the highest tier of restrictions continued late into the night. Local leaders are considering a package of support offered by ministers but no final decision has been made yet. On Thursday, Greater Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham said leaders in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to a move to the top tier and he called for more financial support for businesses and individuals affected by restrictions. He said the region was ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said local leaders should ""set aside party politics"" and work with the government, with cases rising ""exponentially"" in the north west of England. However, some of the area's Tory MPs also oppose Greater Manchester moving to the top tier, including Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee and MP for Altrincham and Sale West - who said there was ""widespread concern"" about the proposals. The Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has backed tougher restrictions for the capital but has also called for more financial support. This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy Meanwhile, the Scottish government is planning to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that in England. The country's central belt already faces stricter rules, with pubs and restaurants closed. InNorthern Ireland, schools will close on Monday while, from Friday, pubs, restaurants and cafes will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks. And a ban on travelling to Wales from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UKcomes into effect on Friday evening.
