Rupert Murdoch's son James quits News Corp,"James Murdoch, the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has resigned from the board of News Corporation citing ""disagreements over editorial content"". In a filing to US regulators, he said he also disagreed with some ""strategic decisions"" made by the company. The exact nature of the disagreements was not detailed. But Mr Murdoch has previously criticised News Corp outlets, which include the Wall Street Journal, for climate change coverage. In recent years James Murdoch has also found himself at odds - politically - with his father, BBC North America correspondent David Willis says. Whilst Murdoch Senior has pledged support for Donald Trump, James Murdoch has reportedly contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign of Mr Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden. James Murdoch's departure from News Corp would, our correspondent says, appear to grant even more influence to his brother Lachlan who is generally thought to share his father's more conservative views. Rupert, News Corp's executive chairman, and Lachlan, co-chairman, wished James well in a joint statement. ""We're grateful to James for his many years of service to the company,"" the statement said. ""We wish him the very best in his future endeavours."" News Corp also owns The Times, The Sun and The Sunday Times in the UK, as well as a stable of Australian newspapers, including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun.

Hedge fund star charged with indecent assault,"Crispin Odey, one of Britain's highest-profile hedge fund managers and political donors, has been charged with indecent assault. He is alleged to have assaulted a woman over the age of 16, at an address in Chelsea in July 1998, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Mr Odey, a backer of Brexit and Boris Johnson, was charged on 14 May. In a short statement, Mr Odey said: ""The allegation is denied and I will strongly contest this matter."" The latest Sunday Times Rich List says Mr Odey, 61, and his wife are worth Â£825m. Mr Odey established Odey Asset Management in 1991. He went to Harrow School and then studied History and Economics at Christ Church, Oxford. He owns a home in Swan Walk, a Thames riverside street in Chelsea.

British Airways pilots vote to accept jobs deal,"British Airways pilots have voted to accept a deal that will temporarily cut pay by 20% and eliminate 270 jobs, says the pilots' union Balpa. The deal prevents a controversial ""fire-and-rehire"" scheme where staff would have been handed new contracts ""on worse conditions"". The 20% pay cuts will reduce to 8% over two years and to zero in the long term. The ballot result saw 85% of members accept the deal on an 87% turnout. ""Our members have made a pragmatic decision in the circumstances, but the fact that we were unable to persuade BA to avoid all compulsory redundancies is bitterly disappointing,"" said Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton in a statement. BA said it was facing an ""enormous challenge"" and that it did not expect to return to 2019 levels of business ""until at least 2023"". British Airways faces strike threat over job cut plan British Airways owner IAG says crisis worst in its history British Airways: A breakdown in trust? The airline had proposed to make 12,000 staff redundant, as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with 1,255 pilot jobs at stake. Balpa said there would still be some compulsory redundancies, estimated at 270 jobs, although that number is ""likely to fall"" as BA will be working with the union to mitigate the impact of the changes. This video can not be played Willie Walsh said the impact of the pandemic had led to unprecedented levels of disruption in the air industry On 28 July, trade unionUnite threatened industrial action against the airline""with immediate effect"" over plans to hand staff their notice and then rehire them on new contracts with unfavourable terms. Talks with other BA staff, such as cabin crew, engineers and office staff, are still continuing. Many airlines are struggling to survive as the pandemic severely disrupts global travel. The plunge in travel will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (Â£66bn) this year, the International Air Transport Association has warned. It said last month that 2020 revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019. BA has insisted that it is doing its best to save jobs. On Thursday, Willie Walsh, the boss of BA owner IAG, told the BBC thatthe coronavirus crisis was the worst the company has faced in its history. IAG reported a loss of â¬4.2bn (Â£3.8bn) for the first half of the year, and Mr Walsh said it would take until at least 2023 for passenger levels to recover. However, there is anger from staff over the way BA has approached job cuts, according to the BBC's business correspondent Theo Leggett. For cabin crew, there is not only the threat of redundancy, but also the possibility of big pay cuts for long-serving staff. Many of those affected believe the company is using the current crisis to force through changes it has wanted to make for years. Longer-serving crew at BA have contracts which are, by modern standards, relatively generous. They date back to an era when the airline industry was less ferociously competitive, before the emergence of budget carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet forced older airlines to cut costs and change their business models. In a statement, BA said: ""This is an incredibly difficult time for everyone at British Airways and we are grateful to Balpa and our flight operations team for the work they have done to reach this agreement and save hundreds of jobs. ""The financial results show the enormous challenge British Airways faces as it contends with the impact of the global pandemic and government travel bans, reducing demand for travel very significantly. ""We do not expect our company to return to 2019 levels of business until at least 2023 and therefore we need to act now to reshape our company for a very different future.""

Scots warned to avoid Covid hotspots in England,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon warns people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules The Scottish government has warned people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules. It said travel between Scotland and Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire should only be undertaken if ""absolutely essential"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those already in the affected areas do not need to return to Scotland early. But she said they should be ""more careful than normal"" after their return home. They are being advised to minimise contact with other households for 14 days, avoid indoor hospitality and be vigilant in monitoring for symptoms. The advice was issued as 30 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon holds coronavirus briefing Which lockdown rules will change next in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said it was the first time in more than eight weeks that so many cases had been recorded in a single day. She said the government was paying ""close attention"" to the figures - but pointed out that the number of tests being carried out had risen from 5,000 to 15,000 a day over the same period. The positive cases represented less than 1% of those who had been tested, and were spread over nine health board areas. Manchester is one the areas affected by the new measures to control Covid-19 Ms Sturgeon said the virus was ""under control"" in Scotland - but that need for caution was ""more obvious"" now than it had been since the outset of the pandemic. She also said that about half the new cases confirmed in the last week had been among people aged between 20 and 39. ""That's something we've seen in other parts of the world recently - younger age groups, perhaps people more likely to go to pubs and restaurants and meet up with friends, are testing positive in higher numbers,"" she said. ""These figures should be a reason for caution. ""I urge everyone, particularly people in their 20s and 30s, not to be complacent and to please follow all the rules."" The UK government imposed its new local restrictions, which include banning separate households from meeting each other at home, in the north of England after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The areas affected by the local restrictions are: Greater Manchester: City of Manchester, Trafford, Stockport, Oldham, Bury, Wigan, Bolton, Tameside, Rochdale, Salford Lancashire: Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale West Yorkshire: Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given an update to the devolved governments on the reasons for the decision. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government's decision to advise against all but essential travel to the area was not taken lightly. ""The connections between Scotland and the north of England are very strong, they are very important and they are highly valued by people on both sides of the border,"" she said. The new rules came into force at midnight in Manchester She said all four nations agreed on the importance of information sharing. ""We have always been clear that localised flare ups are likely as we continue to supress the virus but by responding quickly and appropriately we can limit the effect these have on wider transmission,"" she said. ""I strongly advise anyone planning to travel to areas affected in the north of England, or anyone planning to travel to Scotland from those same areas, to cancel their plans."" Ms Sturgeon added that those whose travel was essential ""should follow public health advice at all times"". Mr Hancock earlier told BBC Breakfast the UK government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing. Visiting people at home banned in parts of northern England PM postpones lockdown easing in England What are the new rules for Greater Manchester? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month. However, pubs, restaurants and other facilities will be allowed to reopen in the city from Monday, as some of the stricter measures are lifted. Meanwhile, plans to ease more coronavirus restrictions across England this weekend have beenpostponed for at least two weeks. CASES:Where are the latest cases? DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

New lockdown rules cause 'confusion and distress',"Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens The government has been accused of causing ""confusion and distress"" with its handling of new lockdown rules. People living in Greater Manchester and other parts of northern England have been told theycannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens. Greater Manchester's mayor and deputy mayor, along with council leaders, raised ""concerns"" about how the changes were announced by the government. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""we have to move fast sometimes"". The government announced the new lockdown restrictions shortly after 21:15 BST on Thursday. ""We announced the decision as soon as practical,"" added Mr Hancock, who said he had been working with ""local authorities, like Andy Burnham"" to tackle a rise in cases. On Friday, a statement released by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) in partnership with council leaders said the timing and content of the announcement ""has caused confusion and distress for our residents"". It is ""strongly recommended"" that in future ""full supporting details should be available to the public at the moment any public or media statement is made"", the GMCA said. Greater Manchester leaders also claimed they are not convinced that including gatherings in gardens in the restrictions, which will be reviewed weekly, is ""a proportionate measure"". ""We therefore call on the government to provide further evidence or amend the regulations,"" a GMCA spokesperson added. Further support for hospitality businesses that have recently opened, as well as for people who have been shielding, is needed as well, the GMCA said. Zoe Patrick said the lockdown would be make childcare ""difficult"" Millions of people in parts of northern England are subject to the new restrictions, which ban separate households from meeting each other at home, after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The rules affect people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the force ""will engage with people, explain the current circumstances and encourage people to do the right thing in complying with the government guidelines"". ""We will only take enforcement action as a last resort, when people are not listening and putting others at risk,"" a GMP spokesperson added. Visiting people at home banned in parts of northern England Lancashire coronavirus restrictions 'ridiculous' Blackburn Muslims told 'celebrate Eid al-Adha at home' People in Greater Manchester have described their confusion at the sudden news. Zoe Patrick, 33, from Stockport, said the rules meant she and her husband would find it difficult to look after their son. ""This is now very difficult for us as we did have our son's grandparents over to help us... but now of course these new rules mean we can't do that so we will have to struggle on our own."" Jenny Cooper has been shielding since March and said the measures feel ""disappointing"" Jenny Cooper, 36, from Burnage, has Crohn's disease so has been shielding since March. She said: ""It's really important to keep the vulnerable safe, but it does feel very sudden. ""We were on the cusp of freedom. It's disappointing as many of us feel left behind."" Coronavirus: Are more local lockdowns likely in England? Hospitality firms have also been hit by the sudden restrictions. Piotr Pawlowski, who runs Cafe Bistro in Flixton, Trafford, said he had received cancellations for their tapas evenings this weekend, which he has been preparing for all week. ""We are not going to make the numbers we should do so food is going to go to waste,"" he said. The cafe remained open for takeaway throughout the lockdown but suffered a 30-40% loss in sales. He said the new restrictions, which ban members of two different households from mixing in restaurants, would not help but ""it's something we need to follow"". ""Safety is most important for us and our customers,"" he added. Saif Al-Islam Chaudhry said he was going to celebrate Eid in a public park Saif Al-Islam Chaudhry, 35, who owns an art company, said ""it is not a nice feeling for anyone"". ""I think the timing of this may seem dubious to many people."" Referring to Eid celebrations, he said: ""If I understood the new restriction correctly, Muslims can use the existing guidelines to meet in public parks. That is what I am intending to do today."" Jason Bailey, who owns a street food event, said the timing of the measures is ""awful"" for business The owner of street food business Grub in Manchester Jason Bailey, 39, said ""this could be the setback to push us over the edge"". ""Keeping people safe has to be the top priority... It's just how it's been done, the timing is awful. ""We're already wading through queries from people totally confused by the announcements trying to cancel their table reservations, despite the fact we are an outside food market. ""We'll undoubtedly spend more time and money trying to cope with it all and at the moment we're only just sustainable as a business running on a reduced capacity."" Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit Many of the areas subjected to the tighter rules are among those with the highest rates of new infections in the past week. In Greater Manchester, the only borough to have seen cases come down substantially is Rochdale, but even then it remains one of the areas with the highest new infection rates out of more than 300 local authorities in England. Oldham's cases in particular have been surging and the local council sounded the alarm earlier this week. In the week to 26 July the area recorded 134 cases of coronavirus, up from 44 the week before. This means almost 57 positive tests for every 100,000 people in Oldham that week. Trafford went from 26 cases to 91, which works out at more than 38 for every 100,000 residents. While Wigan is much further down the table for new cases, its figures have risen as well. Bolton has not recorded a rise in the week to 26 July, but provisional data for the week to 28 July suggests it may move slightly up, although these figures are subject to revision as more test results come in.

Up to 30 can meet outdoors and gyms to reopen,"Groups of up to 30 people will be able to meet while social distancing outdoors in places like Cardiff Castle from Monday Up to 30 people can meet outdoors and children under 11 will not have to social distance in Wales from Monday. Swimming pools, gyms, leisure centres and indoor play areas, including soft play, will be allowed to reopen from 10 August. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the new guidance for children was because of their lower rates of transmission. Licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen from Monday, but receptions will need to be outdoors. The changes are part of the latest review to the coronavirus rules in Wales. Live: What will lockdown easing bring? Mr Drakeford admitted on Friday thatnew lockdown restrictionsin the north west of England had given him ""pause for thought"" before easing the rules further. But he said the changes bring those areas line with Wales, and declined to call for people not to travel from the places affected. Plaid Cymru has called for measures to limit non-essential travel from the affected areas. Mr Drakeford suggested Wales was near the limit of what could reopen and the ""headroom"" that was left could be needed to allow schools to reopen in September. ""I think we are now pretty close to the point where most aspects of the Welsh economy have been able to reopen,"" he said. ""There are a small number of things still on a list that can't reopen - nightclubs, casinos and so on. ""I think it'd be a while before they are able to reopen."" Research by University College London suggested 61% of adults in Wales had a ""broad understanding"" of current lockdown rules, compared with 45% in England. But of the 7,600 people from Wales who took part in the Covid-19 Social Study, only 18% reported ""complete understanding"" of guidelines as lockdown has eased. The percentage agreeing to the same question in England was 14%. The latest three week review means that from Monday up to 30 people will be able to meet outside, while social distancing, regardless of how many households they are from. This video can not be played Ian and Elizabeth were among the first to get married after rules were eased More may be able to meet indoors from 15 August but Mr Drakeford said he wanted more data on the infection rate before confirming it. ""It is the most risky thing you can do,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""People would have heard this morningfreedoms in the north of England being reversedin relation to people meeting indoors because of the evidence that the virus is being spread by households meeting indoors,"" he said. ""We hope not to be in a position of having to reverse decisions in Wales, so we will wait another couple of weeks."" Meanwhile: Indoor bowling alleys, auction houses and bingo halls will be able to resume trading on Monday, alongsideindoor pubs, restaurants and cafes- providing there is social distancing Swimming pools, spas, indoor leisure centres, gyms and children's indoor play can open on 10 August, as long as coronavirus conditions ""remain favourable"" Licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen from Monday in Wales. Receptions will need to be outdoors, but that could change from 15 August. People have already been able to get married in places of worship. Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens The Scottish Government haswarned people to not to travelto the areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules, and anyone planning to travel from there to Scotland to cancel their plans. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said by not limiting non-essential travel from affected parts of England, there was a risk of ""undoing all the good work to contain outbreaks in both countries"". ""Restrictions have been imposed in the north west of England to try to slow down transmission there, but with many of the four million affected people regularly travelling to the north of Wales for work or for holidays, this has a direct impact here, too,"" he said. But Mr Drakeford said ""travel restrictions in their own right"" were not being considered, and instead said visitors from elsewhere in the UK were ""welcome"". ""If you come to Wales, please help us to keep Wales safe,"" he told a press conference. What do the latest lockdown rules mean? First minister 'very keen to allow gyms to reopen' Coronavirus spike being watched 'very carefully' The first minister called for visitors to ""to maintain social distance, make sure you wash your hands,"" and ""if you're using shared facilities do so carefully and consciously"". People living in Greater Manchester and other parts of northern England have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens. But Mr Drakeford said the measures ""by and large brings the position there into line with the position that we already have here in Wales"". Mark Drakeford warned coronavirus could thrive once autumn returns Part of the reason for relaxing lockdown restrictions in Wales is to allow people to make the most of the outdoors ""while we can,"" the first minister said. Mr Drakeford said the situation would be assessed again in the autumn ahead of a period where coronavirus could ""thrive"". ""The summer weeks are going through our fingers,"" he said. ""We still have the whole of August and with a bit of luck most of September in which people will be able to enjoy the outdoors. ""We will then have to assess in the autumn, when we know we are heading into the time of year - the cold, the dark, the damp - all those conditions that coronavirus thrives in."" The news comes as health officials deal with aspike in cases in Wrexham. Mr Drakeford also said he had discussed not relaxing rules in that part of Wales. However ""weighing it all up and knowing that the Wrexham spikes are contained to particular sites at the moment, we think it's right to allow people in Wrexham to benefit from these steps ahead as well as everybody else"", he said. ""If we need to, we've always said, we would take local action and we review that very carefully every day."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mark Drakeford spoke for the first time since 28 May on Friday. A call was held between the PM and the first ministers of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. BBC Wales was told it was held at Mr Johnson's request. Mr Drakeford said they discussed the lockdown changes in northern England. Scientific advice says coronavirus is likely to decay quickly in sunlight The Welsh Government has been slower than other parts of the UK in lifting restrictions, and Welsh Labour ministers have emphasised a cautious approach. But as coronavirus cases fell some of the most severe lockdown rules - including the travel ban and the enforced closure of non-essential shops - were removed. At the same time measures such as contact tracing have been stepped up, with the hope that more testing will allow outbreaks to be isolated and stopped in their tracks. Children under the age of 11 will not need to keep 2m apart The Welsh Conservatives' Darren Millar said earlier this week that freedoms ""have or are being safely restored in other parts of the UK and people in Wales should be able to enjoy them too"". Plaid Cymru said any easing of restrictions needed to be accompanied by a ""robust mechanism to stamp out coronavirus outbreaks"". The coronavirus lockdown in Wales is controlled by the Welsh Government, while the UK government in London has been dealing with the equivalent rules in England.

Analysis: We're at the limit of easing lockdown,"This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Two weeks ago, Boris Johnson was setting out plansfor normality by Christmas. But since then the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. And the Office for National Statistics, which is regularly testing households in England, estimates there are around 4,200 new infections a day, compared with 2,800 a week ago. For the first time since May, we're having to deal with rising numbers of cases. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, when there were an estimated 100,000 infections every day, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread, and the government's scientific advisers have always warned there was not much wiggle room to lift restrictions and still suppress it. The uptick in infections is a warning that we are passing the limits of lifting lockdown. It is clear we are not a New Zealand,where life is almost back to normalafter their ""zero-Covid"" strategy. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said: ""I think what we're seeing from the data from ONS, and other data, is that we have probably reached near the limit or the limits of what we can do in terms of opening up society. ""So what that means potentially is that if we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things."" School children are on their summer holidays at the moment, but we are just weeks away from the start of term. Schools are expected toreopen fully in England in Septemberand inScotland from 11 August. If the current rules are leading to an increase in cases, can we open schools as well?

Hong Kong 'seeking arrest' of fleeing activists,"Simon Cheng and Nathan Law are among those reportedly wanted under a new security law Police in Hong Kong are seeking the arrest of six pro-democracy activists living in exile in Western countries, including the UK, media reports say. The group reportedly includes former UK consulate worker Simon Cheng, well-known activist Nathan Law and US citizen Samuel Chu. They are wanted on suspicion of violating a new security law imposed in Hong Kong by Beijing, Chinese state TV reported, calling them ""troublemakers"". Hong Kong police declined to comment. The development comes after legislative elections scheduled for September were delayed for a year by Hong Kong's government on Friday. It said the move was necessary because of a spike in Covid-19 infections, but the opposition accused it of using the pandemic as a pretext. The White House said the move undermined democracy. HK delays elections for a year 'over virus fears' Pro-democracy politicians had hoped to capitalise on anger in the Chinese territory about the new security law to win a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo). Many in Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to China in 1997, fear that unique freedoms meant to be guaranteed until 2047 are under serious threat. The UK and Australia are among countries that have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong in recent weeks. Germany did so on Friday - one of those reported to be on the new ""wanted list"" has received asylum there. Chinese state TV network CCTV said six people were wanted on suspicion of inciting secession or colluding with foreign forces - both crimes can be punished with up to life in prison under the new security law. The six, according to CCTV and Hong Kong media, are: Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who was recently granted political asylum in Britain. He was detained last August while on a business trip to mainland China and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong. He denies that and says he was beaten and forced to sign false confessionswhile in Chinese custody. Responding to news of the arrest warrant, Mr Cheng told the BBC that he would not stop speaking out about issues in Hong Kong. ""The totalitarian regime now criminalises me, and I would take that not as a shame but an honour,"" he said. This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China Nathan Law, 27, a high-profile activist who has fled to the UK. ""I have no idea what is my 'crime' and I don't think that's important. Perhaps I love Hong Kong too much,"" he said on Twitter. Mr Law first came to prominence as a student protest leader in 2014. He said he was disappointed and frightened to have to live in exile, and that he was going to have to ""sever"" his relationship with his family in Hong Kong. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The Hong Kong residents ready to leave for the UK Samuel Chu, a US citizen. He is the son of Reverend Chu Yiu Ming, a Baptist minister who was one of the founders of the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"". Mr Chu runs the Washington DC-based Hong Kong Democracy Council and said he last visited Hong Kong in November 2019. ""I might be the first non-Chinese citizen to be targeted, but I will not be the last. If I am targeted, any American and any citizen of any nation who speaks out for Hong Kong can, and will be, too,"" he said. The national security law carries extraterritorial provisions that say anyone, including non-Hong Kong residents, can be charged under it. China says the law is necessary to restore stability and order in the global financial hub. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think Ray Wong, a pro-independence activist who fled to Germany in 2017 and is now in Britain, told the BBC that the list of ""wanted"" exiles had been drawn up to ""intimidate"" pro-democracy activists who are trying to drum up international support for their cause. Honcques Laus, an 18-year-old now in the UK, first came to prominence in November 2017 when he brandished a pro-independence banner next to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. ""Come arrest me in the UK,"" he was quoted - as Lau Hong - as telling a journalist on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'It's make or break for our firm now',"Gita Lavingia says she now cannot see 80% of her clients A decision on Friday to put lockdown easing on hold in England has caused confusion and dismay for businesses. The delay means that places such as casinos and bowling alleys, which had been due to open on 1 August, will have to wait at least two weeks more. Firms in the beauty sector, already angered about delays in being able to fully open, are stunned by the news. ""We're in absolute shock,"" Gita Lavingia, owner of Lavingia Beauty, Clapham, south London told the BBC. ""We literally found out this afternoon, with less than 24 hours' notice, and we have clients booked in for tomorrow."" Ms Lavingia says that 80% of her business is focused on facials. Because the treatments involve close contact with a customer's face, the continuation of restrictions means that her firm will have to cancel most of the bookings it has lined up. ""We lose Â£800 in revenue for each day we cannot fully-operate. And many of our therapists are self-employed, so they are earning nothing at all,"" she added. PM puts lockdown easing on hold in England Visiting people at home banned in parts of England  Ms Lavingia doesn't understand why beauty salons cannot be fully-operational: ""We've always been very careful with health and safety standards, which are crucial protocols in the beauty industry, and since the pandemic, now we have extra precautions in place."" She stressed that clients had provided feedback that they ""felt safe"" to return to the clinic, and therefore they should be allowed to do so. The beauty salon owner said she feels like there is a ""never-ending"" cloud hanging over her - Lavingia Beauty owes approximately Â£8,000 in rent since March, and there is an outstanding VAT bill on the horizon that will need to be dealt with at some point too. The anxiety that she and her staff feel affects the atmosphere at the salon, because clients come to relax and get away from their own troubles, and they can sense that not all is well under the surface. ""It's make or break for our business now - there's a big question mark about how long we can stay open for."" The move has come when many firms were ""starting to get back on their feet"", said the British Chambers of Commerce. Under current restrictions, beauty salons can do nails but not eyebrows BCC co-executive director Claire Walker said: ""While tackling the public health emergency must be the priority, these announcements - made at short notice - will be a hammer blow to business and consumer confidence at a time when many firms were just starting to get back on their feet. ""Business communities need as much clarity as possible from government if they are to plan ahead and rebuild their operations in the coming months."" The National Hair and Beauty Federation also reacted with dismay. Treatments on the face, which were excluded when beauty salons were allowed to reopen in England on 13 July, were due to be given the go-ahead from Saturday, but this has now been postponed. ""We are extremely disappointed that this last-minute decision has been made,"" the federation said. ""We will continue to push for financial support following this further setback."" The CBI said the news would be ""a real disappointment for some businesses"". ""But firms know that public safety comes first."" added the CBI's chief UK policy director, Matthew Fell. Both the BCC and the CBI called for extended support and targeted measures to help businesses affected. ""Businesses will continue to do what is necessary to avoid an infection spike,"" said the CBI's Mr Fell. ""Delayed reopening will unfortunately lead to even more financial pressure for some companies. So there may yet be a need for more direct support to shore up cash flow, including extended business rates relief."" UK Hospitality said the delay was ""devastating news"" for hospitality businesses and leisure venues that had hoped to be back in business this weekend. ""They have spent a lot of time and money, which they can ill afford to lose at the minute, getting ready to reopen. For those people who work in those sectors, the security of their jobs remains uncertain,"" said its chief executive, Kate Nicholls. ""We now need clear communication to ensure that consumer confidence is not damaged further. We are also going to need further support for those businesses that cannot reopen."" Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said the announcement would come as ""a massive blow to thousands of small firms, soon-to-be newlyweds, artists and sportspeople"". ""However, we were warned that restrictions will need to be responsive to any resurgence in transmissions,"" he added. ""What we absolutely have to avoid is a scenario where whole swathes of the small business community - not least those in the creative industries, tourism and leisure sectors - are wiped out entirely."" The news came ina briefing from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said planned reopening for 1 August would be delayed for at least a fortnight. That means venues such as casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks must remain closed until 15 August. Indoor performances will also not resume and pilots of larger gatherings in sports venues and conference centres will not take place, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted. Separately, face coverings will be compulsory in more indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from next weekend. They are already required in shops and indoor transport hubs. The prime minister said the rules for face coverings would become enforceable in law from 8 August.

Byron Burger to slash outlets and shed 650 jobsThe burger chain is the latest High Street name to cut jobs after the coronavirus hit to trading.Business,"Restaurant chain Byron Burger is closing permanently more than half its 51 outlets and cutting 650 jobs. It is part of a deal that will see the remaining 20 sites and 551 staff transfer to a new owner, Calverton UK. Many of the restaurants were already closed, victims of the economic impact on the hospitality sector of coronavirus. Will Wright, an administrator at KPMG who sold the chain, said the pandemic's impact ""on Byron has been profound"". He added: ""After exploring a number of options to safeguard the future of the business and following a competitive sales process, this transaction ensures Byron will continue to have a presence on our high streets."" It was believed that KPMG was in talks with three potential buyers, which were were looking at taking over the whole firm or parts of it. Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss 6,000 jobs at risk at Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia Founded in 2007, Byron has been struggling for a number of years. In 2018 itagreed a rescue planand restructuring which was handled by KPMG. As part of that deal, investment house Three Hills Capital Partners became the biggest shareholder. Under the deal, Byron Burger's existing investors will take a minority stake in the business, KPMG said. No financial details were disclosed. Sandeep Vyas, of Calveton said: ""Byron is a pioneering brand much loved by customers across the UK. We are backing Byron because we believe it has great opportunity ahead of it, and it is well placed to adapt to the new consumer environment and dining trends."" He said the new investors would look to boost the chain's digital on-demand platforms. Restaurant chains, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus crisis, have been hit hard by the pandemic.

PM puts lockdown easing on hold in England,"The further easing of lockdown restrictions in England - due to come in this weekend - has been postponed for at least two weeks, after an increase in coronavirus cases. Casinos and bowling alleys will remain shut, as Boris Johnson said it was time to ""squeeze the brake pedal"". Face coverings will be mandatory in more indoor settings, such as cinemas. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, warned the UK may have hit its limits on easing restrictions. Appearing alongside the prime minister at a special Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said the ""idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control"" is wrong. Asked whether it was safe for England's schools to fully reopen to all pupils in the autumn, he said it was a ""difficult balancing act"" but ""we have probably reached near the limit, or the limits, of what we can do in terms of opening up society."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal"" Speaking at the briefing, Mr Johnson said planned changes to guidance for those who have been shielding during the pandemic, and advice for employers, will still go ahead. The rethink on easing England's lockdown follows new restrictions for people in parts of northern England,after a spike in virus cases. The prime minister said progress in tackling coronavirus continues, with the daily and weekly number of deaths falling, but warned that some European countries are ""struggling"" to control it. The UK must be ready to ""react"", he said. Manchester lockdown rules cause 'confusion and distress' Lockdown heightened in parts of England Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday suggestinfection rates in England are rising, with around 4,200 new infections a day- compared with 3,200 a week ago. The ONS's estimates of daily cases - based on a sample of households completing swab tests - are higher than the figures for lab-confirmed cases reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) because they include people without symptoms who would not otherwise have applied for a test. Highlighting the ONS figures, Mr Johnson added: ""The prevalence of the virus in the community, in England, is likely to be rising for the first time since May."" He said that with ""numbers creeping up"" it was time to ""squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control"". Allow Twitter content?

He urged people to ""follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance - and get a test if we have symptoms"", summing the advice up with the slogan: ""Hands, face, space, get a test"". A further120 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK,externalaccording to the latest DHSC figures, bringing the total number of virus deaths to 46,119. Meanwhile, 880 new lab-confirmed cases have been recorded. Cases in England are increasing for the first time since May. Data from the ONS suggests there are around 4,200 new infections a day compared with 3,200 a week ago. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread, and the government's scientific advisers have always warned there was not much wiggle room to lift restrictions and still suppress it. The uptick in infections is a warning we may have already passed the limit of lifting lockdown. That is why Boris Johnson has delayed some of the planned lifting of restrictions in England and face masks will become a more frequent sight. The big question remains around schools. If the current rules are leading to an increase in cases, can we open schools as well? If we open schools will we have to close something else? It is worth noting all this is happening in July and scientists suspect the virus will spread even more easily in the winter months. You can read more from Jameshere. Mr Johnson said the planned reopening of ""higher risk settings"" on 1 August would be delayed for at least a fortnight. This means that the following will not be able to take place until 15 August, at the earliest: the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services indoor performances pilots of larger gatherings in sports venuesand conference centres the expansion of wedding receptions to allow up to 30 people beauty treatmentsthat involve the face, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading treatments Fans will no longer be allowed to attend pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England Fans attended the World Snooker Championship when it started on Friday as part of a pilot to test the return of larger crowds to sports venues. The tournament will now go ahead without spectatorsuntil at least 15 August, which is when the final is scheduled to begin. Neil White, 51, from Chorley in Lancashire, owns a wedding photography business. Of the 44 weddings he had scheduled for this year, just three bookings remain.""I think I speak for the rest of the wedding industry in that there is a huge amount of worry and stress about the future,"" he said. Mr White said that while businesses such as pubs and restaurants in have been able to reopen, those in the wedding sector ""seem to have been brushed under the carpet"" even though they are ""itching to get back to work"". ""If it continues to next year there are a lot of businesses that are going to close,"" he added. The British Beauty Council said the changes were ""very disappointing for a sector that has already seen delay after delay in reopening"". At-a-glance: What can I do now? Separately, face coverings will be compulsory in more indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from next weekend. They are already required in shops, banks, airports and other indoor transport hubs. The prime minister saidthe rules for face coveringswould be enforceable in law from 8 August. This video can not be played Chris Whitty on lockdown easing: ""We have probably reached near the limit of what we can do"" However, he said the plan to pause shielding for those most vulnerable to the virus will go ahead from Saturday. That means some 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic can return to work, if they cannot work from home, so long as their workplace is Covid-secure. Guidance for employers will also change, as planned, from the start of August,Mr Johnson said. The latest announcement came shortly after new lockdown rules were introduced in parts of northern England, including Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and parts of West Yorkshire. The rules include a ban on separate households meeting each other inside their homes and private gardens.  How can we celebrate Eid? And other lockdown questions Lockdown rules mean 'spirit of Eid has gone' Scots warned to avoid Covid hotspots in England The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had made the ""right decision"" regarding the new rules for parts of northern England, but urged it to ""improve"" what he called ""extremely poor"" communication. Ministers have said police forces and councils will be given powers to enforce the new rules.

"Avoid England hotspots, Scots told","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon warns people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules The Scottish government has warned people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules. It said travel between Scotland and Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire should only be undertaken if ""absolutely essential"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those already in the affected areas do not need to return to Scotland early. But she said they should be ""more careful than normal"" after their return home. They are being advised to minimise contact with other households for 14 days, avoid indoor hospitality and be vigilant in monitoring for symptoms. The advice was issued as 30 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon holds coronavirus briefing Which lockdown rules will change next in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said it was the first time in more than eight weeks that so many cases had been recorded in a single day. She said the government was paying ""close attention"" to the figures - but pointed out that the number of tests being carried out had risen from 5,000 to 15,000 a day over the same period. The positive cases represented less than 1% of those who had been tested, and were spread over nine health board areas. Manchester is one the areas affected by the new measures to control Covid-19 Ms Sturgeon said the virus was ""under control"" in Scotland - but that need for caution was ""more obvious"" now than it had been since the outset of the pandemic. She also said that about half the new cases confirmed in the last week had been among people aged between 20 and 39. ""That's something we've seen in other parts of the world recently - younger age groups, perhaps people more likely to go to pubs and restaurants and meet up with friends, are testing positive in higher numbers,"" she said. ""These figures should be a reason for caution. ""I urge everyone, particularly people in their 20s and 30s, not to be complacent and to please follow all the rules."" The UK government imposed its new local restrictions, which include banning separate households from meeting each other at home, in the north of England after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The areas affected by the local restrictions are: Greater Manchester: City of Manchester, Trafford, Stockport, Oldham, Bury, Wigan, Bolton, Tameside, Rochdale, Salford Lancashire: Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale West Yorkshire: Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given an update to the devolved governments on the reasons for the decision. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government's decision to advise against all but essential travel to the area was not taken lightly. ""The connections between Scotland and the north of England are very strong, they are very important and they are highly valued by people on both sides of the border,"" she said. The new rules came into force at midnight in Manchester She said all four nations agreed on the importance of information sharing. ""We have always been clear that localised flare ups are likely as we continue to supress the virus but by responding quickly and appropriately we can limit the effect these have on wider transmission,"" she said. ""I strongly advise anyone planning to travel to areas affected in the north of England, or anyone planning to travel to Scotland from those same areas, to cancel their plans."" Ms Sturgeon added that those whose travel was essential ""should follow public health advice at all times"". Mr Hancock earlier told BBC Breakfast the UK government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing. Visiting people at home banned in parts of northern England PM postpones lockdown easing in England What are the new rules for Greater Manchester? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month. However, pubs, restaurants and other facilities will be allowed to reopen in the city from Monday, as some of the stricter measures are lifted. Meanwhile, plans to ease more coronavirus restrictions across England this weekend have beenpostponed for at least two weeks. CASES:Where are the latest cases? DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

"Harper jury not pressured, says judge","PC Harper was killed while responding to a report of a quad bike being stolen The judge in the case of three teenagers convicted of killing PC Andrew Harper has spoken about the ""controversy"" over the jury's decision to find them not guilty of murder. Before passing sentence at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Edis addressed the court over questions about the verdicts. It comes after the police officer's widow, Lissie Harper, called on the government to order a retrial amid fears jurors had come under ""improper pressure"". Mr Justice Edis said: ""I have been made aware that there has been some discussion about the trial and, in particular, the measures which were in place for the protection of the jury. ""It may be believed in some quarters that the jury was subject to some improper pressure. To the best of my knowledge and belief there is no truth in that at all."" Jessie Cole, Henry Long and Albert Bowers (L-R) had been convicted of killing PC Harper at the Old Bailey As he jailed driver Henry Long for 16 years for manslaughter, and his accomplices Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole 13 years for the same offence, the judge said: ""Nothing which I can do, or could have done if there had been a conviction for murder, can restore Andrew Harper to his loving wife and family, or to the public he served so well. ""His devastating loss in these terrible circumstances will follow his family forever and they have the profound sympathy of the court and the whole nation in their loss."" He added: ""The victim personal statements are deeply moving and I have read them with care and listened intently to what was said in this courtroom."" Mrs Harper described to to the court how losing her husband, who was killed in the line of duty a month after their wedding day, had devastated her life. Below is her statement in full. PC Andrew Harper's teenage killers jailed PC Harper married his childhood sweetheart Lissie four weeks before his death This is my third attempt at writing a victim impact statement. After many words of anguish, scriptures of love and testimonies of heartbreak, I sit at this task with an emptiness that I without pretence admit that in an attempt to describe what impact Andrew's death has had on me, I simply find myself in a lost and endless world of numb despair. Perhaps the reason that this question in particular defeats me is because until and unless you have stood in my shoes, unless you have had the immense misfortune of losing a husband or a wife, a soul mate, true love or beloved partner whom you intended to be with until your dying day, then how is this grief and loss even possible to describe? I have used every word in my vocabulary to describe the pain, torture and hopelessness that I feel, I have written poems and letters and messages of love and devastation over the indescribable trauma that I have been forced to endure these past eleven months. I have screamed and cried and broken down in fractured defeat and yet when it is this moment that I am asked to explain my impacted life that the hollowness of loss truly appears. My husband was brutally killed four weeks after our wedding dayâ¦ What impact has this had on my life? Need I repeat the devastating details and the cruelty in which this occurred? Should I speak again of how we were robbed of our future? Of the plans that were stolen from us? Should I describe my torment over the children that will never come to be? Or like so many people are these heartbreaking details etched into your mind in the shattering way that they will forever remain in mine? Four weeks was all I had to call him my husband, four weeks to be called his wife. My life often feels bleak, hopeless, irreparable. My desolate nights bring no rest, no time for reprieve from this utter turmoil. Every aspect of my life since Andrew was taken is bitterly different. Every moment of my life before Andrew was taken was imprinted with his love and his presence. A fact in which I alone can only truly understand. So not only did these men take my true, beautiful love away from me, not only did they rob a brother, son, uncle and friend from all who love him, but they took our future too. They took more than one life away that day. They stole the person that I used to be, the happiness that we shared and the beautiful plans we had made together. That night as I opened the door to the stranger in uniform before me, everything I had known in my life to be true was robbed away. Every ounce of beautiful peace, gone. So in answer to the question of how Andrew's death has impacted meâ¦ well, you would be justified in your knowledge that I am without question a mere shadow of the person I once was, broken, distraught, beaten! An empty shell, void of the contented life I once loved. Please do not let the sacrifice that he was forced and unknowingly made to give stand for nothing. He gave everything. A bitter reality that I must face and endure for the rest of my life, every second, every minute, every day. Whatever is decided today in these courtsâ¦ it will never bring Andrew back. Andrew will never grace us with his smile, his compassion and his selfless generosity and love as he used to do. I will spend every day of the rest of my life with a hollowness that will never ever be filled. An indescribable reality that no amount of words will ever fully reveal. Yet again, I search around for the words to express my heartbreak, yet each description of grief appears inadequate and incomplete. Deborah Adlam was in court to hear the sentencing Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay also read a victim impact statement from Deborah Adlam, PC Harper's mother. She described her son as a ""good man, a brave, caring person, funny and uplifting"", who would be missed daily and ""loved forever"". She said: ""I haven't been able to work for fear of breaking down, my mind just isn't in the right place, my anxiety is overpowering. ""I hardly sleep... I have no motivation or even daily routine - chores or cooking a meal, it just feels pointless now. ""I have sat in the mortuary of my son's covered body, too damaged for me to see. ""He will never get to be called 'daddy' or hold his own child - we imagined this was not too far away in the future."" Det Supt Stuart Blaik said the defendants made a ""conscious decision"" not to assist police and their family and friends had tried to ""frustrate"" the investigation. He said the defendants's associates ""attempted to give false alibis"", and clothing and phones were ""discarded and hidden"" from the travellers' site in an attempt to disrupt his team's work. Long, Bowers and Cole had shown ""no remorse for what happened that evening at any stage"", he said. ""Their lies and deceit have been exposed in this trial,"" he said. PC Andrew Harper died after his ankles became entangled in a tow strap attached to a getaway car Det Supt Blaik said: ""The gravity and the scale of the case was beyond anything I have ever had to deal with before."" The case would ""live with me for the rest of my life"", he said. He said only the defendants would ""know"" what they saw, heard and what was said in the car as it dragged PC Harper to his death. ""Had they not been out stealing that night this wouldn't have happened,"" he said. ""Had they not decided to stop when they could have stopped, when they were caught red-handed, rather than just putting their hands up for a theft of quad bike, they made decisions to do something different and those decisions have caused the death of Andrew Harper.""

Byron Burger to slash outlets and shed 650 jobs,"Restaurant chain Byron Burger is closing permanently more than half its 51 outlets and cutting 650 jobs. It is part of a deal that will see the remaining 20 sites and 551 staff transfer to a new owner, Calverton UK. Many of the restaurants were already closed, victims of the economic impact on the hospitality sector of coronavirus. Will Wright, an administrator at KPMG who sold the chain, said the pandemic's impact ""on Byron has been profound"". He added: ""After exploring a number of options to safeguard the future of the business and following a competitive sales process, this transaction ensures Byron will continue to have a presence on our high streets."" It was believed that KPMG was in talks with three potential buyers, which were were looking at taking over the whole firm or parts of it. Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss 6,000 jobs at risk at Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia Founded in 2007, Byron has been struggling for a number of years. In 2018 itagreed a rescue planand restructuring which was handled by KPMG. As part of that deal, investment house Three Hills Capital Partners became the biggest shareholder. Under the deal, Byron Burger's existing investors will take a minority stake in the business, KPMG said. No financial details were disclosed. Sandeep Vyas, of Calveton said: ""Byron is a pioneering brand much loved by customers across the UK. We are backing Byron because we believe it has great opportunity ahead of it, and it is well placed to adapt to the new consumer environment and dining trends."" He said the new investors would look to boost the chain's digital on-demand platforms. Restaurant chains, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus crisis, have been hit hard by the pandemic.

for tuning into our coverage today. We'll be back on Saturday with more updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Our
team updating you throughout the day were: Thom Poole, Justin
Parkinson, Jennifer Scott, Joshua Nevett, Joseph Lee, Dulcie Lee, Martha
Buckley, Krutika Pathi, Jo Couzens and Sophie Williams. Hereâs an update on the latest developments in the UK and around the world today: A couple marry in Belfast, where wedding celebrations with as many as 10 people are allowed outdoors Wedding ceremonies or
civil partnerships with as many as 30 guests have been allowed since 4 July in
England but anexpected
relaxation in restrictions to allow the same number of people to attend wedding
receptions has been put back until 15 Augustâ at the earliest. Weddings had been banned
under almost all circumstances since lockdown began on 23 March, prompting
73,600 marriages and same-sex civil partnership ceremonies to be postponed. Northern Ireland has allowed outdoors weddings with 10 people
presentsince early June.WalesandScotlandalso now allow wedding ceremonies to take place, but
social distancing must be observed and big gatherings are not allowed. Wedding photographer, Neil White, from
Chorley, Lancashire, says he was booked to do 44 weddings this year â but now heâs down to three. He told the BBC:  âA lot has been mentioned, quite rightly, about the grief of couples not
able to enjoy their day and the struggles of cancelling or postponing. However,
the wedding industry and its suppliers are taking a huge hit right now, when we
should be enjoying peak season. âWhile many other
industries have been allowed to open, such as pubs and restaurants, the wedding
industry at large has not been given any directives for its future. We seem to
have been forgotten.â He said the longer it
goes on, many venues and suppliers will lose their livelihoods, adding that the
future of the industry is âbleakâ. Fewer than half of adults spending time with family and
friends are sticking tosocial distancing rules when they
meet up, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. Almost three-quarters of adults polled said they'd socialised with others during the last
seven days - with 50% welcoming family or friends into their homes, it said. Of the 1,150 people who reported socialising, 47% said they
had maintained social distancing  - rising to 70% of
those aged 70 and over. Three in 10 (31%) said they often followed the measures, 13%
said they sometimes did and 8% said they rarely or never followed social
distancing. More than a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said they had met up with between
five to 10 people, while 6% said the group had been larger than 10. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""households gathering
and not abiding by the social distancing rules"" was one of the reasons for the stricter rules announced late on Thursday for some parts of England. The ONS also found that 63% of respondents strongly supported targeted lockdown measures to stop the rise of the virus and 57% were in favour of mandatory face
coverings in shops and supermarkets. Cases around the globe rose by 292,527 on Friday Friday has seen a record daily global increase in coronavirus cases, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). The
one-day total rose by 292,527 - up from the previous record daily increase of 284,196 on 24
July. Deaths
on Friday rose by 6,812, according to a daily report. The countries
reporting the largest increases were the US, Brazil, India and South Africa. Guidance saying people with serious medical conditions should stay at home is coming to an end Since March, as many as 2.2m in England with medical conditions that make them ""extremely vulnerable"" have been taking the most extreme measures of self-isolation. Only earlier this month did the government say it was safe for them to leave the house at all. That is due to end tomorrow, with the government ""pausing"" the guidance on shielding. Under the new rules, the government says these people can go to work as long as their workplace meets its Covid-secure standards -  but they should still work from home if they can. Children who are clinically extremely vulnerable can attend school or college in line with the broader plans to reopen educational institutions. But while people who had been shielding can go out, they are advised to keep social interactions low and to maintain social distancing carefully. The end of the shielding guidance also means the end of extra support for extremely vulnerable groups, such as free food parcels and medicine deliveries.

has confirmed 1,525 new cases, the biggest rise since the lockdown was lifted there
last month. It
is the third day in a row that new cases have exceeded 1,000. More
than half of these recent infections are from Aragon and Madrid,according
to El Pais.,external More
than 28,000 people have died in Spain and more than 285,000 cases have been confirmed
since the outbreak began. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and around 46,000 people have died, according to government figures. However, these numbers only include people who tested positive for the virus and subsequently died. The actual death toll is higher. We take a look
at some of the key figures of the pandemic in the UK- estimates of the
death toll and number of cases. You can also find out more about cases in your area using our

on a Norwegian cruise ship, MS Roald Amundsen, tested positive for Covid-19 and
are now in hospital. The ship is docked in Tromsoe, northern Norway. All 160 quarantined
crew will be tested and the 177 passengers, who have disembarked, have been
urged to self-isolate. The ship, owned by Norwegian firm Hurtigruten,
had been on a week-long voyage to Svalbard in the Arctic. It is scheduled to visit
ports in England and Scotland in September, Reuters reports. In March, Hurtigruten suspended most cruises
because of the pandemic, but it plans to return 14 vessels to service by the
end of September. Early in the pandemic thousands of
passengers were stranded aboard cruise ships in Asian and US waters because of
coronavirus outbreaks onboard. Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens New restrictions affecting millions ofpeople in
parts of northern England have come just as Muslim communities prepare to
celebrate Eidthis weekend. Ash Mohammed, from Hale in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, had been due to meet his siblings in his brother's garden today to celebrate the festival. His sister is driving up from Cardiff and now ""doesn't know whether to turn around or not"". He told the BBC: ""A lot of families were planning to get together. Some sort of warning would have been helpful. ""It's akin to someone saying on Christmas Eve that you can't see your family on Christmas Day. As far as I understand, 20 of us could go to Wetherspoons if we wanted to but a Muslim family can't sit in their garden."" He added that, while no one wanted a second wave, it wasn't as though Eid has been sprung on Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson. ""They could have given us some warning a week ago to say the data is going the wrong way and these restrictions might have to be brought in,"" he said. Vietnam had been proud of its zero death toll Vietnam
has recorded its second Covid-related death, just hours after it recorded its
first. The
fatality was said to be a 61-year-old dialysis patient in Da Nang, the
epicentre of the outbreak there. No
new infections had been reported for more than three months before an outbreak
was reported in the resort town. Itâs
a devastating blow to the country which had been proud of its zero death toll. Vietnam acted before it even had confirmed cases, closing its borders early to almost all travellers, except returning citizens. Anyone entering the country must quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing. Earlier
today the country reported 37 new cases, according to local media. Scientific advisers say for schools to open fully, other measures may need to be tightened At the Downing Street briefing earlier, UK Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty warned that ""the idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong"" - meaning the country faced some ""very, very difficult choices"". Newly released papers from the Sage advisory group reveal a bit more about the scientific thinking, suggesting experts believe there is a trade-off between opening schools and opening other areas of society. On 23 June, scientists said coronavirus measures might need to be changed at the end of summer to keep the R number below 1 - a level at which the epidemic is not growing - while still reopening schools. On 9 July, they said the spread of the virus from children to adults ""appears to be low"" but stressed there needed to be ""enough âroomâ in terms of the epidemic to open schools"". They also warned that areas seeing coronavirus restrictions reimposed - such as parts of northern England today - might not respond in the same way as they did when lockdown was first introduced, due to changing levels of trust, fear and anger. Ryanair claims Ireland's travel restrictions are unlawful Ryanair
says it has launched legal proceedings against the Irish government over its
travel restrictions. Currently,
Ireland has a âgreen listâ of countries in which a 14-day quarantine rule does
not apply. However Britain, France and Spain are not on this list. Ryanair
claims the restrictions are unlawful. It is calling for a review of the list and claims that the Irish parliament was not given the opportunity to scrutinise
it.. The
airline claims the list has been detrimental to its business. It
comes after Ryanair, British Airways and easyJet launched a similar challenge
against the British government, however this was ended after a 14-day quarantine
rule for travellers coming from many tourist spots such as France and Greece
was scrapped. There are currently 50 people in isolation in the country Iceland
has re-introduced restrictions on public gatherings after two infection
clusters were confirmed. Under
the new rules, public gatherings are limited to 100 people and a two-metre
social distancing rule has been re-imposed. It
comes after Icelanders were told that social gatherings of 1,000 people were
allowed and social distancing would become optional from 25 May. Iceland
avoided a full lockdown, choosing to impose social distancing and close schools
and some businesses. According
to the governmentâs Covid website, there are currently 50 people in isolation. A
total of 1,885 cases have been confirmed and 10 people have died since the
pandemic began. Tests on a random sample of the population in England suggest infections are increasing Coronavirus infections in England have risen from an estimated 2,800 to 4,200 since last week,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest. A sample of households in England, excluding care homes and hospitals, were swabbed to test for current infection. However there is not enough data to suggest a higher proportion of positive tests in any particular region. Despite the ONS figures suggesting a rise in infections, the official estimate of the virus's reproduction or R number (a measure of whether cases are rising or falling) for England was between 0.8 and 1 as of 31 July. An R number below one indicates the number of infections is shrinking. It's calculated using a range of different measures, including hospital admissions and deaths. Because it takes more time for someone to end up in hospital due to an infection, it's possible the latest estimate of R isn't capturing more recent upticks in infection. People who should be isolating have been leaving their houses, according to Victoria's premier One
in four people who tested positive for coronavirus in Australiaâs state of
Victoria were not at home when authorities came to check up on them. Victoria
Premier Andrew Daniels said 130 unsuccessful visits had been made to people who should have been in quarantine over the past 24 hours. Last
week, the Victorian government said sick people breaking isolation rules â or not
getting tested in time â was leading to continued spread despite lockdown
measures. Victoria
recorded 623 cases on Friday and eight deaths. Those
who were not at home will receive a follow up from police andcould

The socially-distanced reopening of indoor theatre and music venues in England has been delayed until at least 15 August, Boris Johnson announced today. The easing of restrictions had been due to start this weekend but has been postponed amid concerns over a rise in virus cases. Face coverings will also be required in additional settings including museums, galleries and cinemas - enforceable in law from 8 August. Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust, said ""most theatres will not be able to put on productions until we reach stage five [of the roadmap for the return of professional performing arts], which allows fuller audiences, so that is the most critical date for much of the sector"". Read more here James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys. It will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Two weeks ago, Boris Johnson was setting out plansfor normality by Christmas. But since then the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, when there were an estimated 100,000 infections every day, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread. The uptick in infections is a warning that we are passing the limits of lifting lockdown. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst For three days running, China has recorded more than 100 new cases of Covid-19. In the last 24 hours, 127 cases have been recorded, including 112 in north-west Xinjiang, and 11 in north-east Liaoning province. For eight consecutive days, the number of cases has grown in China, meaning that official media have urged people nationwide not to relax vigilance: to wear a mask and avoid gatherings. But there is limited concern about either of the outbreaks in Xinjiang or Liaoning leading to a second wave in the country. China has experienced a number of localised outbreaks since the beginning of the year â including in the capital Beijing â and media have lauded the co-operation of the public with swift self-isolation procedures, and their willingness to be tested, in keeping the virus under control. Currently, in Xinjiangâs Urumqi and Liaoningâs Dalian, communities where people have tested positive have gone into full lockdown. Other residents have taken advantage of free testing that has been made available to them in public areas with a lot of space. Over the next few days, medical staff will finalise testing 3.5 million people in Urumqi, and six million in Dalian. A further 120 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who have died after a positive Covid-19 test to 46,119. There were another 880 cases confirmed by testing in the last 24 hours. The figure for deaths may be different from the sum of newly reported deaths for the four nations, because the UK-wide figure is calculated on a different time frame and includes deaths in all settings, not just hospitals. The government has also launched a review of the UK death figures, over concerns that England may be wrongly including deaths which took place months after the person tested positive for the virus.

Fans not allowed to attend sport events,"This video can not be played Barry Hearn says 'the show must go on' after government restriction wreck snooker plans Fans will not be allowed to attend the pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England after a spike in coronavirus cases, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Spectators were due to watch the first two days of two county cricket matches, while 205 fans were at the start of the World Snooker Championship on Friday. It was also hoped to allow 4,000 racegoers at Goodwood on Saturday. The new restrictions on fans will be enforced until at least 15 August. The announcement comes after general restrictions werereintroduced for people in parts of northern England. ""Pilots of larger crowds at sports venues will not take place,"" Johnson said at a news conference on Friday. ""I said from May we would not hesitate to put on the brakes at the slightest sign that the numbers were going in the wrong direction."" Johnson had said earlier this month that spectators could be able toreturn to stadiums in England from October. Premier League looking at 'clinical passports' to help get fans back into stadiums Beers, big screens and sanitiser - 1,000 fans return to cricket at Oval pilot Coronavirus: PM puts lockdown easing on hold in England Fans were already at theWorld Snooker Championshipin Sheffield when the prime minister spoke on Friday, with announcer Rob Walker shouting ""we are back"" as play started, before adding: ""Our socially distanced crowd are poised to roar once more."" World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn was shown smiling, clapping and fist-pumping, as spectators - some wearing masks - cheered on the first players Judd Trump and Tom Ford. Just hours earlier, Hearn had told BBC of his ""pride"" and ""relief"" at getting fans back at events. However, while those with tickets for Friday's further sessions were allowed to stay, there will now be no spectators permitted at the Crucible Theatre from Saturday. Fans with tickets will be given a refund, or be allowed to use them next year. After the government decision, Hearn told BBC Sport he was ""gutted"" and ""disappointed"" to not have an atmosphere, but added: ""The show must go on. ""There is a chance - I'm forever the optimist - that maybe a return for the final [on 16 August] is the earliest possible opportunity. ""Congratulations to those guys who went today because they will be able to talk about this for the rest of their lives - the ultimate golden ticket. ""I've never known a circumstance change in a couple of hours, but that is symbolic of what is happening in the world at the moment.

Watch day one of the World Snooker Championship live Sport has been held behind closed doors since its return, including England's Test series against West Indies Two matches in cricket'sBob Willis Trophystarting on Saturday had been due to welcome spectators - Surrey v Middlesex at the Oval and Warwickshire against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""We understand the reasons the government has made this decision, and remain ready to work with them to ensure supporters can safely return to stadiums when government advice allows. ""We are pleased the Bob Willis Trophy will still begin this weekend behind closed doors, and fans will be able to watch their teams in action through the online streams being provided."" The Oval had been due to host 2,500 fans on Saturday and Sunday,having held the first pilot last weekend of 1,000 fans. Surrey chief executive Richard Gould said: ""A lot of hard work has taken place to ensure that members and fans could return to our ground safely. ""We still hope to welcome members to the ground for future matches this summer, and we will continue to work with the ECB and the government to encourage this to happen."" A statement fromGoodwoodracecourse said: ""We are very disappointed for those who were hoping to attend tomorrow's event and for all those who have worked so hard to make it possible for spectators to be present. ""We will engage with public health authorities and the DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) over a rescheduled pilot at the earliest opportunity."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden posted on social media that it was ""very disappointing news"". ""I know the huge efforts cricket, snooker and horseracing have made to welcome fans back. We'll keep working together on their safe return ASAP,"" he added. BBC sports editor Dan Roan This will be hugely disappointing news for the events involved, and obviously very worrying for the wider sports industry, which is increasingly desperate to get paying fans back through the turnstiles to ease an unprecedented financial crisis - especially for those sports bodies dependent on matchday revenue, like English Football League clubs. Until now, the effort to get sports back up and running after lockdown had gone relatively smoothly, with the football season resuming and now almost completed, along with other events such as Test cricket, Formula 1 and horse racing. This then is a first major setback in the wider effort to return sport to some kind of normality. However, crucially, I am told by Whitehall sources that the government remains keen to work with sports and Public Health England with a view to getting fans back inside venues from 1 October. Some sports organisations - like the Premier League - would like to see that target date brought forward, but Friday's news will not have helped them win that argument. Attendances of 20% to 40% capacity - depending on the nature of the venue - is envisaged by officials from October, and more pilots are being planned in the coming weeks. It is simply too early to tell whether this is now unrealistic. It remains the aim but there are no guarantees. This is a stark reminder that the nature of the pandemic means it is difficult to plan months in advance, and that officials will need to take decisive action when data shows worrying trends.

Shamima Begum case heads to Supreme Court,"The case of runaway Shamima Begum, who is fighting to return to the UK from Syria, will go to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal decided that the case raised a point of law of public importance that only the Supreme Court can resolve. Earlier this month, three Court of Appeal judges ruled Ms Begum should be allowed back to London to fight for the return of her citizenship. The government said that decision was deeply flawed. Ms Begum, now 20, was one of three schoolgirls who left London to join the Islamic State group in Syria in 2015. After she was found in a refugee camp in 2019, her British citizenship was revoked by former Home Secretary Sajid Javid on security grounds. Shamima Begum can return for UK citizenship fight Who is Shamima Begum and how do you lose your citizenship? The women and children no-one wants Separately, the court has revealed that the Sun newspaper will be referred to the Attorney General after it obtained a copy of the Court of Appeal's draft judgement - or its ""essential contents"" - in advance of it being handed down on 16 July. It had been given to the parties involved on 9 July. Lady Justice King, the head of the panel of three judges, said they were referring the newspaper to the Attorney General because of a potential contempt of court in publishing a story about the judgement - seemingly leaked from government - before it was announced in court. The Court of Appeal's move shows it thinly-disguised anger at the apparent government leak of its confidential judgement to The Sun, a cardinal sin against the independence of the courts. Ms Begum's lawyers say the leak allowed ministers a ""first strike"" in setting the agenda over their client's fate - rather than allowing justice to take its course. Draft judgements are typically shared among a tight group of those involved in a case so that corrections can be made and, where necessary, to allow them to prepare for their next move. The draft in this case also included confidential information about Ms Begum's situation that the court had already decided should not be made public. Sir Jonathan Jones, the head of the government legal department, is now under pressure to identify who leaked it and report that finding back to the judges. There will only be a handful of people inside the Home Office or elsewhere in Whitehall who knew the outcome. But there is also pressure for Attorney General Suella Braverman. She is simultaneously legally responsible for any decisions to pursue newspapers for contempt of court - and a cabinet minister. And that means her decision on this matter will face the utmost scrutiny. The judge also granted Ms Begum's lawyers permission to challenge a decision that the absence of a fair and effective appeal over the citizenship decision did not necessarily mean it should be restored - subject to the Supreme Court accepting that part of the case. Sir James Eadie, representing the Home Office, said earlier there was a ""big issue at stake"" in the case, to decide what should happen when someone cannot have a fair appeal over being stripped of their citizenship as a ""result of going abroad and aligning with terrorist groups"". He said it was ""an issue of real pressing public importance"" which was ""perhaps the central democratic issue of our times"".

New lockdown rules cause 'confusion and distress'Greater Manchester's leaders criticise the government's handling of the lockdown announcement.,"Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens The government has been accused of causing ""confusion and distress"" with its handling of new lockdown rules. People living in Greater Manchester and other parts of northern England have been told theycannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens. Greater Manchester's mayor and deputy mayor, along with council leaders, raised ""concerns"" about how the changes were announced by the government. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""we have to move fast sometimes"". The government announced the new lockdown restrictions shortly after 21:15 BST on Thursday. ""We announced the decision as soon as practical,"" added Mr Hancock, who said he had been working with ""local authorities, like Andy Burnham"" to tackle a rise in cases. On Friday, a statement released by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) in partnership with council leaders said the timing and content of the announcement ""has caused confusion and distress for our residents"". It is ""strongly recommended"" that in future ""full supporting details should be available to the public at the moment any public or media statement is made"", the GMCA said. Greater Manchester leaders also claimed they are not convinced that including gatherings in gardens in the restrictions, which will be reviewed weekly, is ""a proportionate measure"". ""We therefore call on the government to provide further evidence or amend the regulations,"" a GMCA spokesperson added. Further support for hospitality businesses that have recently opened, as well as for people who have been shielding, is needed as well, the GMCA said. Zoe Patrick said the lockdown would be make childcare ""difficult"" Millions of people in parts of northern England are subject to the new restrictions, which ban separate households from meeting each other at home, after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The rules affect people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the force ""will engage with people, explain the current circumstances and encourage people to do the right thing in complying with the government guidelines"". ""We will only take enforcement action as a last resort, when people are not listening and putting others at risk,"" a GMP spokesperson added. Visiting people at home banned in parts of northern England Lancashire coronavirus restrictions 'ridiculous' Blackburn Muslims told 'celebrate Eid al-Adha at home' People in Greater Manchester have described their confusion at the sudden news. Zoe Patrick, 33, from Stockport, said the rules meant she and her husband would find it difficult to look after their son. ""This is now very difficult for us as we did have our son's grandparents over to help us... but now of course these new rules mean we can't do that so we will have to struggle on our own."" Jenny Cooper has been shielding since March and said the measures feel ""disappointing"" Jenny Cooper, 36, from Burnage, has Crohn's disease so has been shielding since March. She said: ""It's really important to keep the vulnerable safe, but it does feel very sudden. ""We were on the cusp of freedom. It's disappointing as many of us feel left behind."" Coronavirus: Are more local lockdowns likely in England? Hospitality firms have also been hit by the sudden restrictions. Piotr Pawlowski, who runs Cafe Bistro in Flixton, Trafford, said he had received cancellations for their tapas evenings this weekend, which he has been preparing for all week. ""We are not going to make the numbers we should do so food is going to go to waste,"" he said. The cafe remained open for takeaway throughout the lockdown but suffered a 30-40% loss in sales. He said the new restrictions, which ban members of two different households from mixing in restaurants, would not help but ""it's something we need to follow"". ""Safety is most important for us and our customers,"" he added. Saif Al-Islam Chaudhry said he was going to celebrate Eid in a public park Saif Al-Islam Chaudhry, 35, who owns an art company, said ""it is not a nice feeling for anyone"". ""I think the timing of this may seem dubious to many people."" Referring to Eid celebrations, he said: ""If I understood the new restriction correctly, Muslims can use the existing guidelines to meet in public parks. That is what I am intending to do today."" Jason Bailey, who owns a street food event, said the timing of the measures is ""awful"" for business The owner of street food business Grub in Manchester Jason Bailey, 39, said ""this could be the setback to push us over the edge"". ""Keeping people safe has to be the top priority... It's just how it's been done, the timing is awful. ""We're already wading through queries from people totally confused by the announcements trying to cancel their table reservations, despite the fact we are an outside food market. ""We'll undoubtedly spend more time and money trying to cope with it all and at the moment we're only just sustainable as a business running on a reduced capacity."" Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit Many of the areas subjected to the tighter rules are among those with the highest rates of new infections in the past week. In Greater Manchester, the only borough to have seen cases come down substantially is Rochdale, but even then it remains one of the areas with the highest new infection rates out of more than 300 local authorities in England. Oldham's cases in particular have been surging and the local council sounded the alarm earlier this week. In the week to 26 July the area recorded 134 cases of coronavirus, up from 44 the week before. This means almost 57 positive tests for every 100,000 people in Oldham that week. Trafford went from 26 cases to 91, which works out at more than 38 for every 100,000 residents. While Wigan is much further down the table for new cases, its figures have risen as well. Bolton has not recorded a rise in the week to 26 July, but provisional data for the week to 28 July suggests it may move slightly up, although these figures are subject to revision as more test results come in.

HK delays elections for a year 'over virus fears',"Carrie Lam said there were no political motives behind her move - but opposition activists disagree The Hong Kong government has postponed September's parliamentary elections by a year, saying it is necessary amid a rise in coronavirus infections. Hong Kong is currently experiencing a spike in Covid-19 infections, and reported 121 new cases on Friday. However, the opposition has accused the government of using the pandemic as a pretext to stop people from voting. On Thursday,the government banned 12 pro-democracy candidatesfrom running in the elections. Opposition activists had hoped to obtain a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo) in September's poll, capitalising on anger at Beijing's imposition of a controversial national security law in Hong Kong, and fears that the territory's freedoms are being eroded. Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 under an agreement meant to guarantee a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. Pro-democracy candidates had made unprecedented gains in last year's district council elections, winning 17 out of 18 councils. On Friday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would invoke emergency powers to postpone the elections, calling it the ""most difficult decision I've made over the past seven months"". ""This postponement is entirely made based on public safety reasons, there were no political considerations,"" she said. Why Hong Kong's 'third wave' is a warning to all Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law Separately on Friday, Hong Kong police put six overseas activists on a wanted list on suspicion of violating the new national security law, media reports, including from Chinese state TV, said. Reported to be among them arehigh-profile activist Nathan Law, who has fled to the UK, andSimon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulatewho alleges he was tortured in China and was recently granted political asylum in Britain. But Hong Kong police have refused to comment. Mr Cheng told the BBC that an arrest warrant would not stop him speaking out about issues in Hong Kong. ""The totalitarian regime now criminalises me, and I would take that not as a shame but an honour,"" he said. This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China The Hong Kong residents ready to leave for the UK Hong Kong has had more than 100 daily new cases, for 10 days in a row. The overall numbers are still lower than those of many other places - but the spike comes after Hong Kong appeared to have contained the outbreak, with weeks of few or no local infections. Now, it's experiencing what's been described as a ""third wave"" of infections, and Ms Lam says she fears Hong Kong's hospitals will be overwhelmed by new cases. Health experts have told the BBC that, with the reintroduction of social distancing measures, the rate of infection appears to have slowed, and they hope Hong Kong will be back to close to zero local infections within four to six weeks. The city has introduced tough new measures to combat the virus, banning gatherings of more than two people. The territory has had more than 3,200 confirmed infections, and 27 deaths, from the virus. Ms Lam said Hong Kong's pandemic was in ""its worst situation since January"" and ""as community spread continues, the risk of a large-scale outbreak will increase"". She said that with 4.4m registered voters in Hong Kong, the elections would involve ""a large-scale gathering and an immense infection risk"", while social distancing measures would prevent candidates from canvassing. She also said that proceeding with elections in September would pose a particular risk to elderly voters, and that Hong Kong had many registered voters in mainland China, and overseas, who would be unable to take part in the elections while border quarantine measures were in place. The Chinese government said it supported the decision, which was made ""in the interests of the public"". Opposition politicians say that, under local election laws, the polls can only be postponed by 14 days, and that a longer delay would ""trigger a constitutional crisis in the city"". Lawmaker Tanya Chan said she suspected pro-government politicians were more concerned about ""their own election prospects"" rather than ""the severity of the pandemic"". Some experts have suggested that measures could be put into place to make elections safer, such as reducing waiting times at polling stations - and that a delay of a whole year is not necessary. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think Activist Joshua Wong, who was disqualified from running in the elections, wrote on Twitter that the pandemic was being used as ""as an excuse to postpone the election"" and was ""the largest election fraud in #HK's history."" Hundreds of thousands of people took part in unofficial pro-democracy primaries earlier this month, in what was seen as an a show of support for the pro-democracy movement. In Washington, the White House condemned the delay, saying it undermined democracy. It came a day after President Trump suggested the US election in November could be delayed even though he has no power to do so. At least 68 countries or territories postponed elections due to Covid-19, while 49 places held elections as planned, saysthe International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance,external. In announcing her decision, Ms Lam argued that many governments had also postponed elections by a year, including London's Mayoral elections, and local government elections in Australia's New South Wales. Her comparison was queried by journalists, who said the outbreak in Hong Kong was not as severe. London has had a total of about 35,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, compared to Hong Kong's 3,200. Meanwhile, in Australia, by-elections in Victoria went ahead as scheduled in March, as did a federal by-election in New South Wales. Singapore held its general election earlier this month with safety measures in place - and had its highest turnout in recent years. The vote demonstrated ""that it is possible to protect public health even as people go about exercising their democratic right to vote"", said Eugene Tan, a law professor and political commentator at Singapore Management University. The Legislative Council - or LegCo - helps to make and amend Hong Kong's laws. It is made up of 70 seats - but only 35 of these seats are directly voted for by the public. File photo of the chamber of the Legislative Council Another 30 seats represent ""functional constituencies"" - these are voted for by smaller groups representing special interests, primarily businesses, banking and trade. Historically these sectors have been largely pro-Beijing. The last five seats are made up of district councillors who are elected by the public to sit on LegCo.

Scots told to avoid England hotspots,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon warns people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules The Scottish government has warned people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules. It said travel between Scotland and Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire should only be undertaken if ""absolutely essential"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those already in the affected areas do not need to return to Scotland early. But she said they should be ""more careful than normal"" after their return home. They are being advised to minimise contact with other households for 14 days, avoid indoor hospitality and be vigilant in monitoring for symptoms. The advice was issued as 30 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon holds coronavirus briefing Which lockdown rules will change next in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said it was the first time in more than eight weeks that so many cases had been recorded in a single day. She said the government was paying ""close attention"" to the figures - but pointed out that the number of tests being carried out had risen from 5,000 to 15,000 a day over the same period. The positive cases represented less than 1% of those who had been tested, and were spread over nine health board areas. Manchester is one the areas affected by the new measures to control Covid-19 Ms Sturgeon said the virus was ""under control"" in Scotland - but that need for caution was ""more obvious"" now than it had been since the outset of the pandemic. She also said that about half the new cases confirmed in the last week had been among people aged between 20 and 39. ""That's something we've seen in other parts of the world recently - younger age groups, perhaps people more likely to go to pubs and restaurants and meet up with friends, are testing positive in higher numbers,"" she said. ""These figures should be a reason for caution. ""I urge everyone, particularly people in their 20s and 30s, not to be complacent and to please follow all the rules.""

Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government's decision to advise against all but essential travel to the area was not taken lightly.

One in 10 adults in Wales have said they would not want to be vaccinated against coronavirus if a jab became available. A survey from NHS Wales and Public Health Wales (PHW) said 83% of people would
want to be protected against Covid-19 if a vaccine became available while 10% would not and 7% are unsure. Among those with children, 8% of parents polled wouldn't want their children to be vaccinated while 78% said they would allow their children to have a jab. There is currently no Covid-19 vaccine
available, but PHW says Wales is playing an ""important role in vaccine trials"" in the UK. The survey, which polled 604 people, found nearly
half - 44% of people - said they had come within one
metre with at least three people from outside their household or extended
household in the last seven days. âThere is a huge amount of work under way to
try and develop a vaccine against Covid-19,"" said Prof Karen Hughes, of Public Health Wales. ""It is very positive to see that
more than eight out of 10 people in Wales would want to be vaccinated if such a
vaccine did become available."" British Transport Police Wales is reminding people using trains this weekend to wear face coverings. On Monday, three-layer face coverings became mandatory on all public transport in Wales - buses, trains, and taxis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnnson says the rules on face coverings in England will be extended ""to other indoor settings where you're likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship"". ""We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings and this will become enforceable in law from the 8 August,"" he says. However, this will not apply in Wales. On Monday, three-layer face coverings became mandatory on all public transport in Wales - buses, trains, and taxis. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has remained firm on face coverings for shopping or other activities - it is not happening in Wales. ""The advice of the Welsh Government is that if places are crowded then face coverings are advisory. Where places are not crowded, it is a matter for the individual citizen to make that decision,"" he has said. Four more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales (PHW). It means the number of people who have died with the virus has increased to 1,560. A further 26 new cases of Covid-19 were reported by PHW, meaning 17,258 people have now tested positive for the illness in Wales. According to PHW, 5,491 tests were carried out in the last day in both PHW and non-NHS laboratories. Part of the reason for relaxing lockdown restrictions in Wales is to allow people to make the most of the outdoors âwhile we can,â the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said the situation would be assessed again in the autumn ahead of a period where coronavirus could âthriveâ. Speaking at his weekly briefing, Mr Drakeford said: âThe summer weeks are going through our fingers. ""We still have the whole of August and with a bit of luck most of September in which people will be able to enjoy the outdoors. ""Part of the reason for relaxing some of those restrictions today is to allow people to make more use of that time while we can. ""We will then have to assess in the autumn, when we know we are heading into the time of year - the cold, the dark, the damp - all those conditions that coronavirus thrives in. ""And it will then be incumbent on us all, when we aren't able to be outside as much, to behave inside in a way that mitigates the additional risks that we will all be facing"" It is only possible to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales because of the public's ""willingness to stick with this difficult journey,"" Mr Drakeford says. He said it meant Wales was able to ""go on reopening our economy and finding new opportunities for friends and families to meet, while those opportunities are being closed down in other parts of the United Kingdom"". He rejected a suggestion that a substantial number of people were using the good weather as an excuse to ignore social distancing rules. He said: âIt is perfectly possible to have quite a large number of people in a large park in Cardiff, for example, still observing social distancing. ""So I don't think just the fact that there's a large number of people, means that people are not behaving in the right way. ""But I'm very happy to repeat the message, that despite the fact that coronavirus continues to fall in Wales, none of that is a reason for people not to go on doing all the right things.â Coronavirus cases could rise again rapidly, First Minister Mark Drakeford warned. ""This is a virus where we can go from a position, as we are in Wales today, where the virus is at its lowest ebb and still declining,"" he told his weekly briefing. ""And in a very short number of weeks that position can be transformed, so nobody should think that we are immune from some of the difficulties others are experiencing.â He said the situation in thenorth-west of Englandwould not lead to north and south Wales having different Covid-19 restrictions. âI donât anticipate in a blanket way a different regime for the north of Wales and the south of Wales,"" Mr Drakeford. ""If there are local flare ups we will mobilise our public health effort, our test, trace protect system to bear down on those outbreaks, as we have shown we can to successfully in Anglesey and in Merthyr Tydfil over recent weeks.â Travel restrictions could be reintroduced to control future flare-ups of the virus but ""would be targeted to where we think they would be necessary"", Mr Drakeford says. He said: âWe continue to be willing, were the facts to justify it, to think
about local lockdowns where there are flare ups with considerable community
transmission. ""And if we were to require local lockdowns in Wales, then 'stay
local' might become part of the message... âSo travel restrictions in that sense,
are still part of the repertoire that we could draw on."" Mr Drakeford urged people in Wales to âthink
carefullyâ as lockdown restrictions are eased
further. He said people should take advantage of the outdoors at this time of year but they should âabide by the rulesâ. He also said local authorities would be given stronger enforcement powers âto be able to
take quick and decisive actionâ against businesses flouting the rules. âI am hugely impressed by the efforts I see individual
businesses making to make sure that their premises are properly safe and secure
as far as coronavirus is concerned,"" he said. âAnd we want to support those businesses that are doing
the right thing - they're putting time, energy, money no doubt into making
their premises safe for people to visit. âAnd one of the ways we can support those businesses, is
to take more decisive action in that small minority of cases where it is clear
that those things are not being done."" He said he would ""strengthen the enforcement powers
of local authorities to be able to take quick and decisive action where we come
across instances of people not being prepared to abide by the rules that we
have agreed with that sector"". He said the rules had been drawn up in consultation
with people who represent businesses.   People from outside Wales are âwelcomeâ into the country during the summer holidays, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. That is despiteadvice from the Scottish Governmentfor areas in the north west of England affected by changes to lockdown not to travel to Scotland - and vice versa. But the Welsh Government is not offering similar advice. âMy advice to people who travel across our very permeable border, travelling into England and into Wales, is simply that if you come to Wales, please help us to keep Wales safe,"" Mr Drakeford told his weekly press conference. He called for visitors âto maintain the social distance, make sure you wash your hands, if you're using shared facilities do so carefully and consciously, because in that way we can go on keeping Wales safe and open for everybody to enjoy.â He said he had discussed the measures in the north west of England with the Prime Minister Boris Johnson this morning. He saidEngland's moveâby and large brings the position there into line with the position that we already have here in Walesâ. Newcoronavirus restrictions in the northern Englandhave given First Minister Mark
Drakeford ""pause for thought"" before easing the rules further in Wales, he
admitted today. Mr Drakeford is
looking at how people can meet more of their family and friends indoors, possibly
as soon as 15 August. At present, people can
only form an extended or ""bubble"" household with one other household. But Mr Drakeford said
evidence suggested increased indoor contact was risky as it could lead to more
cases of the virus. âThis
is one of the most difficult areas from a public health perspective because as
people have more contact with one another indoors, the risk of transmission
increases,â he said. âMore
than half of the cases our contract tracers identified in July in north Wales
were linked to household contacts. âToday,
we have seen indoor meetings curtailed in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire
and parts of West Yorkshire following a spike in coronavirus cases there too. âAll of this is bound
to give us pause for thought.â He
also stressed that action would be taken against the âsmall minorityâ of
businesses or individuals who are breaking the rules. âIgnoring
the guidance cannot be an option â we have legal powers, which allow us and
others to take action if some peopleâs behaviour becomes a threat to other
peopleâs health,â he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford has thanked the Welsh public for ""everything you
     have done to reduce the spread of coronavirus"" which has allowed him to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales. While UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has""put the brakes on"" lockdown restrictions being eased in England, in Wales some restrictions are to be lifted on Monday. From Monday, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales can reopen indoors, up to 30 people can meet outdoors, children under 11 won't have to socially distance and licensed weddings can start again. ""The virus is
     continuing to decline in Wales and we can once again, carefully and
     cautiously, go on lifting the lockdown,"" Mr Drakeford told his weekly briefing. ""But coronavirus has not
     gone away. This pandemic will not be over by Christmas. That is why is so important that we all protecting one another from the virus."" British Airways owner IAG has said it willtake until at least 2023 for
passenger levels to recoverfrom the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, posted a â¬4.2bn (Â£3.8bn) loss in the first half of the year as demand collapsed. Passenger numbers fell 98% in the April-to-June period, and the group is planning to cut jobs. IAG said it planned to raise â¬2.75bn, and had support for this from its main shareholder, Qatar Airways. However, shares in IAG, which also owns Spain's Iberia, fell 6% to 170p in early trading on Friday. BA employs about 45,000 staff and has more than half of these on furlough.

Scots warned to avoid English Covid hotspots,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon warns people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules The Scottish government has warned people not to visit areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules. It said travel between Scotland and Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire should only be undertaken if ""absolutely essential"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those already in the affected areas do not need to return to Scotland early. But she said they should be ""more careful than normal"" after their return home. They are being advised to minimise contact with other households for 14 days, avoid indoor hospitality and be vigilant in monitoring for symptoms. The advice was issued as 30 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon holds coronavirus briefing Which lockdown rules will change next in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said it was the first time in more than eight weeks that so many cases had been recorded in a single day. She said the government was paying ""close attention"" to the figures - but pointed out that the number of tests being carried out had risen from 5,000 to 15,000 a day over the same period. The positive cases represented less than 1% of those who had been tested, and were spread over nine health board areas. Manchester is one the areas affected by the new measures to control Covid-19 Ms Sturgeon said the virus was ""under control"" in Scotland - but that need for caution was ""more obvious"" now than it had been since the outset of the pandemic. She also said that about half the new cases confirmed in the last week had been among people aged between 20 and 39. ""That's something we've seen in other parts of the world recently - younger age groups, perhaps people more likely to go to pubs and restaurants and meet up with friends, are testing positive in higher numbers,"" she said. ""These figures should be a reason for caution. ""I urge everyone, particularly people in their 20s and 30s, not to be complacent and to please follow all the rules."" The UK government imposed its new local restrictions, which include banning separate households from meeting each other at home, in the north of England after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The areas affected by the local restrictions are: Greater Manchester: City of Manchester, Trafford, Stockport, Oldham, Bury, Wigan, Bolton, Tameside, Rochdale, Salford Lancashire: Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale West Yorkshire: Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given an update to the devolved governments on the reasons for the decision. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government's decision to advise against all but essential travel to the area was not taken lightly. ""The connections between Scotland and the north of England are very strong, they are very important and they are highly valued by people on both sides of the border,"" she said. The new rules came into force at midnight in Manchester She said all four nations agreed on the importance of information sharing. ""We have always been clear that localised flare ups are likely as we continue to supress the virus but by responding quickly and appropriately we can limit the effect these have on wider transmission,"" she said. ""I strongly advise anyone planning to travel to areas affected in the north of England, or anyone planning to travel to Scotland from those same areas, to cancel their plans."" Ms Sturgeon added that those whose travel was essential ""should follow public health advice at all times"". Mr Hancock earlier told BBC Breakfast the UK government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing. Visiting people at home banned in parts of northern England PM postpones lockdown easing in England What are the new rules for Greater Manchester? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month.

House prices 'bounced back in July',"House prices bounced back in July, climbing 1.7% during the month compared to a 1.5% fall in June, according to the Nationwide. ""The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,"" it said. Activity has been boosted by pent-up demand and the stamp duty holiday. But the lender warned: ""There is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn."" The average price in July was Â£220,936, according to the Nationwide. However, while prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, July's price was 1.6% lower than in April at the beginning of lockdown. However, it was a marked change to June's prices whenthe market posted its first annual fall in eight years. The rebound in prices reflected a number of factors, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. He said pent up demand was coming through, from people who had already decided to move before lockdown began. But some people were moving because of their lockdown experience, he said. ""Behavioural shifts may be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,"" he said. ""Moreover, social distancing does not appear to be having as much of a chilling effect as we might have feared, at least at this stage."" He said the upward trends look set to continue in the near term, and will be further boosted by the recently-announced stamp duty holiday. How will the stamp duty holiday work? But he added a note of caution. ""Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. ""If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead."" Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, also warned that the future may not be so positive for the housing market. ""Lenders remain keen to lend but also cautious as to borrowers' financial positions, given the impending end of the furlough scheme and a number of redundancies which have already been announced,"" he said. Anna Clare Harper, author of Strategic Property Investing, warned: ""What no one can forecast is what happens next, with some nerves among homeowners, investors and economists as to what the future may hold."" Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of Garrington Property Finders, said lockdown would have a lasting effect on the property market. ""Like so much else that has been transformed by the pandemic, the property market map is being redrawn as people reassess what they want from their homes and when, or even if, they need to travel to work,"" he said. ""Three months of being cooped up in the same four walls has led many people to consider a move."" UK property sales in coronavirus summer slump What is stamp duty and how much do I pay?

HK delays elections for a year 'over virus fears'The move comes weeks after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong.,"Carrie Lam said there were no political motives behind her move - but opposition activists disagree The Hong Kong government has postponed September's parliamentary elections by a year, saying it is necessary amid a rise in coronavirus infections. Hong Kong is currently experiencing a spike in Covid-19 infections, and reported 121 new cases on Friday. However, the opposition has accused the government of using the pandemic as a pretext to stop people from voting. On Thursday,the government banned 12 pro-democracy candidatesfrom running in the elections. Opposition activists had hoped to obtain a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo) in September's poll, capitalising on anger at Beijing's imposition of a controversial national security law in Hong Kong, and fears that the territory's freedoms are being eroded. Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 under an agreement meant to guarantee a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. Pro-democracy candidates had made unprecedented gains in last year's district council elections, winning 17 out of 18 councils. On Friday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would invoke emergency powers to postpone the elections, calling it the ""most difficult decision I've made over the past seven months"". ""This postponement is entirely made based on public safety reasons, there were no political considerations,"" she said. Why Hong Kong's 'third wave' is a warning to all Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law Separately on Friday, Hong Kong police put six overseas activists on a wanted list on suspicion of violating the new national security law, media reports, including from Chinese state TV, said. Reported to be among them arehigh-profile activist Nathan Law, who has fled to the UK, andSimon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulatewho alleges he was tortured in China and was recently granted political asylum in Britain. But Hong Kong police have refused to comment. Mr Cheng told the BBC that an arrest warrant would not stop him speaking out about issues in Hong Kong. ""The totalitarian regime now criminalises me, and I would take that not as a shame but an honour,"" he said. This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China The Hong Kong residents ready to leave for the UK Hong Kong has had more than 100 daily new cases, for 10 days in a row. The overall numbers are still lower than those of many other places - but the spike comes after Hong Kong appeared to have contained the outbreak, with weeks of few or no local infections. Now, it's experiencing what's been described as a ""third wave"" of infections, and Ms Lam says she fears Hong Kong's hospitals will be overwhelmed by new cases. Health experts have told the BBC that, with the reintroduction of social distancing measures, the rate of infection appears to have slowed, and they hope Hong Kong will be back to close to zero local infections within four to six weeks. The city has introduced tough new measures to combat the virus, banning gatherings of more than two people. The territory has had more than 3,200 confirmed infections, and 27 deaths, from the virus. Ms Lam said Hong Kong's pandemic was in ""its worst situation since January"" and ""as community spread continues, the risk of a large-scale outbreak will increase"". She said that with 4.4m registered voters in Hong Kong, the elections would involve ""a large-scale gathering and an immense infection risk"", while social distancing measures would prevent candidates from canvassing. She also said that proceeding with elections in September would pose a particular risk to elderly voters, and that Hong Kong had many registered voters in mainland China, and overseas, who would be unable to take part in the elections while border quarantine measures were in place. The Chinese government said it supported the decision, which was made ""in the interests of the public"". Opposition politicians say that, under local election laws, the polls can only be postponed by 14 days, and that a longer delay would ""trigger a constitutional crisis in the city"". Lawmaker Tanya Chan said she suspected pro-government politicians were more concerned about ""their own election prospects"" rather than ""the severity of the pandemic"". Some experts have suggested that measures could be put into place to make elections safer, such as reducing waiting times at polling stations - and that a delay of a whole year is not necessary. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think Activist Joshua Wong, who was disqualified from running in the elections, wrote on Twitter that the pandemic was being used as ""as an excuse to postpone the election"" and was ""the largest election fraud in #HK's history."" Hundreds of thousands of people took part in unofficial pro-democracy primaries earlier this month, in what was seen as an a show of support for the pro-democracy movement. In Washington, the White House condemned the delay, saying it undermined democracy. It came a day after President Trump suggested the US election in November could be delayed even though he has no power to do so. At least 68 countries or territories postponed elections due to Covid-19, while 49 places held elections as planned, saysthe International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance,external. In announcing her decision, Ms Lam argued that many governments had also postponed elections by a year, including London's Mayoral elections, and local government elections in Australia's New South Wales. Her comparison was queried by journalists, who said the outbreak in Hong Kong was not as severe. London has had a total of about 35,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, compared to Hong Kong's 3,200. Meanwhile, in Australia, by-elections in Victoria went ahead as scheduled in March, as did a federal by-election in New South Wales. Singapore held its general election earlier this month with safety measures in place - and had its highest turnout in recent years. The vote demonstrated ""that it is possible to protect public health even as people go about exercising their democratic right to vote"", said Eugene Tan, a law professor and political commentator at Singapore Management University. The Legislative Council - or LegCo - helps to make and amend Hong Kong's laws. It is made up of 70 seats - but only 35 of these seats are directly voted for by the public. File photo of the chamber of the Legislative Council Another 30 seats represent ""functional constituencies"" - these are voted for by smaller groups representing special interests, primarily businesses, banking and trade. Historically these sectors have been largely pro-Beijing. The last five seats are made up of district councillors who are elected by the public to sit on LegCo. This system, where only a proportion of LegCo councillors are chosen by the public, has been called undemocratic by critics but supporters of the system say it helps avoid populism and protects Hong Kong's business interests.

Ex-football coach admits more sexual offences,"A court sketch of Barry Bennell, who was once described as ""the devil incarnate"" by a judge Former football coach and serial paedophile Barry Bennell has pleaded guilty to nine sexual offences. The 66-year-old former Crewe Alexandra coach and Manchester City scout, also known as Richard Jones, entered the pleas at Chester Crown Court. He admitted nine offences, including indecent assault, in relation to two complainants between 1979 and 1988. Bennell is currently serving a 31-year sentence after being convicted of 50 child sexual offences. The former football talent spotter wasdescribed as the ""devil incarnate"" by a judgeafter he was convicted in 2018 of abusing 12 boys aged eight to 15 between 1979 and 1991. Judge Patrick Thompson said he would have to put himself in the position of the previous judge and decide how much extra he could have imposed had he been aware there were two more complainants. He added: ""It is important the two victims have the opportunity to come to court."" Barry Bennell: A cruel and arrogant paedophile A mother's horror at son's sexual abuse Who is Barry Bennell? Bennell appeared at the court via videolink from from HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire. Eleanor Laws QC, defending, asked that Bennell not be required to attend court in person for his sentencing, as he was ""not very well"" and ""vulnerable because of his health"". Bennell's 2018 trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard he was a ""predatory paedophile"" who preyed on young footballers he was supposed to be coaching. Many later came forward to give evidence against him. Some said they felt they could never recover from the abuse they suffered. Bennell was previously convicted of of child abuse on three other occasions. He received jail sentences in the UK and in the US in 1995, 1998 and 2015. The latest hearing was adjourned until 5 October.

Fans not allowed to attend pilot events,"This video can not be played Barry Hearn says 'the show must go on' after government restriction wreck snooker plans Fans will not be allowed to attend the pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England after a spike in coronavirus cases, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Spectators were due to watch the first two days of two county cricket matches, while 205 fans were at the start of the World Snooker Championship on Friday. It was also hoped to allow 4,000 racegoers at Goodwood on Saturday. The new restrictions on fans will be enforced until at least 15 August. The announcement comes after general restrictions werereintroduced for people in parts of northern England. ""Pilots of larger crowds at sports venues will not take place,"" Johnson said at a news conference on Friday. ""I said from May we would not hesitate to put on the brakes at the slightest sign that the numbers were going in the wrong direction."" Johnson had said earlier this month that spectators could be able toreturn to stadiums in England from October. Premier League looking at 'clinical passports' to help get fans back into stadiums Beers, big screens and sanitiser - 1,000 fans return to cricket at Oval pilot Coronavirus: PM puts lockdown easing on hold in England Fans were already at theWorld Snooker Championshipin Sheffield when the prime minister spoke on Friday, with announcer Rob Walker shouting ""we are back"" as play started, before adding: ""Our socially distanced crowd are poised to roar once more."" World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn was shown smiling, clapping and fist-pumping, as spectators - some wearing masks - cheered on the first players Judd Trump and Tom Ford. Just hours earlier, Hearn had told BBC of his ""pride"" and ""relief"" at getting fans back at events. However, while those with tickets for Friday's further sessions were allowed to stay, there will now be no spectators permitted at the Crucible Theatre from Saturday. Fans with tickets will be given a refund, or be allowed to use them next year. After the government decision, Hearn told BBC Sport he was ""gutted"" and ""disappointed"" to not have an atmosphere, but added: ""The show must go on. ""There is a chance - I'm forever the optimist - that maybe a return for the final [on 16 August] is the earliest possible opportunity. ""Congratulations to those guys who went today because they will be able to talk about this for the rest of their lives - the ultimate golden ticket. ""I've never known a circumstance change in a couple of hours, but that is symbolic of what is happening in the world at the moment.

Watch day one of the World Snooker Championship live Sport has been held behind closed doors since its return, including England's Test series against West Indies Two matches in cricket'sBob Willis Trophystarting on Saturday had been due to welcome spectators - Surrey v Middlesex at the Oval and Warwickshire against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""We understand the reasons the government has made this decision, and remain ready to work with them to ensure supporters can safely return to stadiums when government advice allows. ""We are pleased the Bob Willis Trophy will still begin this weekend behind closed doors, and fans will be able to watch their teams in action through the online streams being provided."" The Oval had been due to host 2,500 fans on Saturday and Sunday,having held the first pilot last weekend of 1,000 fans. Surrey chief executive Richard Gould said: ""A lot of hard work has taken place to ensure that members and fans could return to our ground safely. ""We still hope to welcome members to the ground for future matches this summer, and we will continue to work with the ECB and the government to encourage this to happen."" A statement fromGoodwoodracecourse said: ""We are very disappointed for those who were hoping to attend tomorrow's event and for all those who have worked so hard to make it possible for spectators to be present. ""We will engage with public health authorities and the DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) over a rescheduled pilot at the earliest opportunity."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden posted on social media that it was ""very disappointing news"". ""I know the huge efforts cricket, snooker and horseracing have made to welcome fans back. We'll keep working together on their safe return ASAP,"" he added. BBC sports editor Dan Roan This will be hugely disappointing news for the events involved, and obviously very worrying for the wider sports industry, which is increasingly desperate to get paying fans back through the turnstiles to ease an unprecedented financial crisis - especially for those sports bodies dependent on matchday revenue, like English Football League clubs. Until now, the effort to get sports back up and running after lockdown had gone relatively smoothly, with the football season resuming and now almost completed, along with other events such as Test cricket, Formula 1 and horse racing. This then is a first major setback in the wider effort to return sport to some kind of normality. However, crucially, I am told by Whitehall sources that the government remains keen to work with sports and Public Health England with a view to getting fans back inside venues from 1 October. Some sports organisations - like the Premier League - would like to see that target date brought forward, but Friday's news will not have helped them win that argument. Attendances of 20% to 40% capacity - depending on the nature of the venue - is envisaged by officials from October, and more pilots are being planned in the coming weeks. It is simply too early to tell whether this is now unrealistic. It remains the aim but there are no guarantees. This is a stark reminder that the nature of the pandemic means it is difficult to plan months in advance, and that officials will need to take decisive action when data shows worrying trends.

BA owner says crisis worst in its history,"This video can not be played Willie Walsh said the impact of the pandemic had led to unprecedented levels of disruption in the air industry The boss of British Airways owner IAG says the coronavirus pandemic has hit it harder than anything before. Willie Walsh told the BBC: ""These are extreme times. BA has lost more in a quarter than a record loss for a year."" IAG reported a loss of â¬4.2bn (Â£3.8bn) for the first half of the year, and Mr Walsh said it would take until at least 2023 for passenger levels to recover. Passenger numbers fell 98% in the April-to-June period, and the airline group is planning to cut jobs. Losses for BA outstrip those made in both the credit crisis of 2008 and following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The loss for the second quarter of the year was Â£711m, compared with Â£187m in 2001 and Â£309m after the financial crisis. Airlines call for joint US-EU virus testing scheme IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it planned to raise â¬2.75bn and had support for this from its main shareholder, Qatar Airways. However, shares in IAG were down 7% in morning trading at 167p. BA employs about 45,000 staff and has more than half of these on furlough. Earlier this year it said it was planning to cut up to 12,000 jobs, and the airline is facingthe threat of strike actionby staff whose jobs are under threat. However, Mr Walsh suggested that the job cuts might not be as steep as previously indicated. He told the BBC: ""We are in consultation with the trade unions. We want them to work with us to try to mitigate the measures that we have to take. ""That figure of 12,000 is the maximum that would be required, I would hope that it will be significantly lower than that."" Mr Walsh said: ""The industry will recover from this crisis, though we do not expect this to be before 2023, and there will be opportunities for IAG to capitalise on its strength and leadership positions."" He added that business had begun to pick up as guidance on travel abroad was loosened: ""We have seen evidence that demand recovers when government restrictions are lifted."" But he said the industry would never be the same again: ""Anyone who believes that this is just a temporary downturn and therefore can be fixed with temporary measures, I'm afraid seriously misjudges what the industry is going through. ""This will represent a structurally changed industry and that's why we've taken the action that we've taken and that's why we believe now the the right time to raise additional capital."" Willie Walsh calls this by far the biggest crisis the aviation industry has ever faced - and the figures are certainly eye-watering. If planes can't fly, airlines have no way to make money - yet they still have high costs to cope with. That's why IAG has lost billions over the past few months. It's also the reason IAG and other carriers are desperate for governments to find ways of allowing as many people to travel as possible without needing to quarantine themselves afterwards. They need traffic to recover. IAG also has other problems to contend with. Mr Walsh says the company has no option but to cut thousands of jobs at BA - and pay many of those who remain a lot less. But the company's approach has alienated a large portion of the workforce, and caused a deep rift between staff and management. It now faces the possibility of industrial action - at a time when it really needs to be luring back customers, who may already be nervous of travelling. Mr Walsh said customers with pre-existing bookings were continuing to fly to and from Spain, despite the government's change to guidance advising against non-essential travel to the country and the re-imposition of quarantine for people returning. Some IAG airline passengers are still chasing refunds for cancelled flights. A Civil Aviation Authority review of airlines' performance on refunds said on Thursday that test calls to BA terminated after a recorded message had played out. Mr Walsh told the BBC: ""It's important for us to acknowledge we have disappointed people. We've not been able to refund people as quickly as we would like."" He said the company had paid out Â£1.1bn in refunds and that it aimed to speed up the repayments process so people would receive refunds within seven days of applying. But he said it was a complex process, and much of it had to be done manually. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the results showed the scale of the challenge for IAG: ""While the uncertainty continues, IAG will have more difficult decisions to make and it would be no of surprise if the cut of 12,000 BA employees was just the start. ""With mixed messages on international travel, it will be difficult to convince most to start travelling again any time soon. For now, IAG needs to weather the storm and wait for clearer skies if it's going to stand any chance of recovery.""

As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Kylie and Kendall Jenner endorsed 'knock-off' tech,"Kendall Jenner promoted a product that appears to be a clone of Apple's AirPods Kylie and Kendall Jenner are amongst dozens of influencers BBC Click has discovered to be promoting the sale of imitation Apple AirPods on Instagram. The two celebrities have a combined following of 322 million followers. Apple says cloned earphones infringe its intellectual property rights. It is not thought to be pursuing a case against the two sisters. However, the firm has taken previous action against influencers it believed to be hawking ""knock-off"" AirPods. Kylie and Kendall Jenner declined to comment. Click's investigation uncovered dozens of social media influencers promoting clones of Apple Airpods and Apple Watches. The influencers do not hold stock of the goods themselves. Instead, they promote links to websites where anonymous sellers ship the products directly from China. The products typically may be indistinguishable from the genuine items at first glance but feature different brand names on their packaging and sometimes deliver a poor user experience. Promotion of such products can be regarded as being a copyright and trademark infringement under UK law, if the knock-offs are deemed to look similar enough to the legitimate items. The national co-ordinator for the UK's National Trading Standards eCrime team said that if influencers were found to be promoting knock-off products, in the first instance they would be informed of consumer laws, but if they continued then ""formal action"" would be considered. ""We would be concerned that some consumers, swayed by the power of social influencers, and the overall look and feel of the websites, might be misled into thinking they are buying genuine Apple AirPods,"" Mike Andrews said. Instagram itself has told the BBC that influencers must follow local laws and vet brands before agreeing to paid partnerships. The vendors behind the products are known as drop shippers - a kind of intermediary who doesn't make or even see the products they sell, and uses influencers to promote them. Kylie Jenner promoted one product via her Instagram account, the image was then copied and republished by others They typically source their products from online Chinese marketplaces and have them sent directly to consumers.

"House prices 'bounced back in July'Pent-up demand and the stamp duty holiday boosted prices, but Nationwide warns it could be a false dawn.Business","House prices bounced back in July, climbing 1.7% during the month compared to a 1.5% fall in June, according to the Nationwide. ""The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,"" it said. Activity has been boosted by pent-up demand and the stamp duty holiday. But the lender warned: ""There is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn."" The average price in July was Â£220,936, according to the Nationwide. However, while prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, July's price was 1.6% lower than in April at the beginning of lockdown. However, it was a marked change to June's prices whenthe market posted its first annual fall in eight years. The rebound in prices reflected a number of factors, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. He said pent up demand was coming through, from people who had already decided to move before lockdown began. But some people were moving because of their lockdown experience, he said. ""Behavioural shifts may be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,"" he said. ""Moreover, social distancing does not appear to be having as much of a chilling effect as we might have feared, at least at this stage."" He said the upward trends look set to continue in the near term, and will be further boosted by the recently-announced stamp duty holiday. How will the stamp duty holiday work? But he added a note of caution. ""Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. ""If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead."" Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, also warned that the future may not be so positive for the housing market. ""Lenders remain keen to lend but also cautious as to borrowers' financial positions, given the impending end of the furlough scheme and a number of redundancies which have already been announced,"" he said. Anna Clare Harper, author of Strategic Property Investing, warned: ""What no one can forecast is what happens next, with some nerves among homeowners, investors and economists as to what the future may hold."" Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of Garrington Property Finders, said lockdown would have a lasting effect on the property market. ""Like so much else that has been transformed by the pandemic, the property market map is being redrawn as people reassess what they want from their homes and when, or even if, they need to travel to work,"" he said. ""Three months of being cooped up in the same four walls has led many people to consider a move."" UK property sales in coronavirus summer slump What is stamp duty and how much do I pay?

Republicans to Trump: You can't delay electionTop Republicans reject the US president's suggestion that November's vote be put back.US & Canada,"The president suggested postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results Top Republicans have rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that November's presidential election should be delayed over alleged fraud concerns. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy both dismissed the idea. Mr Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election, as any delay would have to be approved by Congress. Earlier, the president suggested that increased postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results. He floated a delay until people could ""properly, securely and safely"" vote. There is little evidence to support Mr Trump's claims but he has long railed against postal voting, which he has said would be susceptible to fraud. US states want to make mail-in voting easier because of public health concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Could Donald Trump delay the presidential election? Mr Trump's intervention came as new figures showed the US economy had suffered the worst contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Senator McConnell said no US presidential election had ever been delayed before. ""Never in the history of this country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time. We will find a way to do that again this November third,"" he told local Kentucky station WNKY. Mr McCarthy echoed him. ""Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election,"" he said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham meanwhile said a delay was ""not a good idea"". However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to be drawn on Mr Trump's suggestion. Quizzed by reporters on whether a president could delay an election, he said he would not ""enter a legal judgement on the fly"". The spokesman for Mr Trump's re-election campaign, Hogan Gidley, said Mr Trump had just been ""raising a question"". Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now. The president also must know that tweeting about a delay - even framed as an ""I'm just asking!"" question - is sure to ignite a political firestorm, particularly after he has repeatedly refused to say whether he'd accept an adverse result in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump appears to be doing everything in his power to undermine the credibility of November's vote, in which a record number of Americans are predicted to rely on mail-in voting to avoid the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. He's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about the reliability of the mail balloting and suggested broad conspiracy theories. Critics warn that he could be laying the groundwork for contesting the results - although the purpose may be simply to give him a scapegoat if he loses. His tweet could also be an attempt to divert attention away from the truly dismal second-quarter economic numbers just released. He's been relying on a financial turnaround to breathe life into his re-election campaign, and instead the outlook appears exceedingly gloomy. Whatever the reason, tweeting about an election delay is not the move of a candidate confident of victory - and could be a sign of more desperate moves to come. Read Anthony's full analysis At a Thursday afternoon White House news conference, Mr Trump denied he wanted to postpone the election, but argued that mass postal voting would leave the result in doubt. ""I don't want to delay, I want to have the election,"" he said. ""But I also don't want to have to wait for three months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything."" ""I don't want to see a crooked election,"" Mr Trump also told reporters. ""This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens."" In a series of tweets earlier, Mr Trump railed against mass postal voting and warned - without providing evidence - that it would be susceptible to foreign interference. Allow Twitter content?

In June, New York allowed voters to vote by post in the Democratic primary poll for the party's presidential candidate. But there have been long delays in counting the ballots and the results are still unknown. US media report that there are also concerns that many ballots will not be counted because they were not filled in correctly or do not have postmarks on them that show they were sent before voting officially ended. According to the Washington Post,external, US Postal Service workers say backlogs may delay delivery of ballots in time for November's election because of cost-cutting measures under the Trump administration. President Trump does not have the authority to move the date of the election, which by law is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Any change of date would need to be approved by both houses of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats control the House of Representatives and some have already said they will not support any delay to the vote. Any move by Congress to delay the election into 2021 would also require a constitutional amendment, US media quoted constitutional experts as saying. The week when everything changed for Trump Earlier this month, six US states were planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections in November: California, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.Other states are considering it,external, according to a postal voting campaign group. These states will automatically send postal ballots to all registered voters, which then have to be sent back or dropped off on election day - although some in-person voting is still available in certain limited circumstances. About half of US states allow any registered voter to cast their ballot by post on request. Does US postal voting lead to fraud? Does Trump have power to delay election?

PM postpones lockdown easing in England,"The further easing of lockdown restrictions in England - due to come in this weekend - has been postponed for at least two weeks, after an increase in coronavirus cases. Casinos and bowling alleys will remain shut, as Boris Johnson said it was time to ""squeeze the brake pedal"". Face coverings will be mandatory in more indoor settings, such as cinemas. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, warned the UK may have hit its limits on easing restrictions. Appearing alongside the prime minister at a special Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said the ""idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control"" is wrong. Asked whether it was safe for England's schools to fully reopen to all pupils in the autumn, he said it was a ""difficult balancing act"" but ""we have probably reached near the limit, or the limits, of what we can do in terms of opening up society."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal"" Speaking at the briefing, Mr Johnson said planned changes to guidance for those who have been shielding during the pandemic, and advice for employers, will still go ahead. The rethink on easing England's lockdown follows new restrictions for people in parts of northern England,after a spike in virus cases. The prime minister said progress in tackling coronavirus continues, with the daily and weekly number of deaths falling, but warned that some European countries are ""struggling"" to control it. The UK must be ready to ""react"", he said. Manchester lockdown rules cause 'confusion and distress' Lockdown heightened in parts of England Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday suggestinfection rates in England are rising, with around 4,200 new infections a day- compared with 3,200 a week ago. The ONS's estimates of daily cases - based on a sample of households completing swab tests - are higher than the figures for lab-confirmed cases reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) because they include people without symptoms who would not otherwise have applied for a test. Highlighting the ONS figures, Mr Johnson added: ""The prevalence of the virus in the community, in England, is likely to be rising for the first time since May."" He said that with ""numbers creeping up"" it was time to ""squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control"". Allow Twitter content?

He urged people to ""follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance - and get a test if we have symptoms"", summing the advice up with the slogan: ""Hands, face, space, get a test"". A further120 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK,externalaccording to the latest DHSC figures, bringing the total number of virus deaths to 46,119. Meanwhile, 880 new lab-confirmed cases have been recorded. Cases in England are increasing for the first time since May. Data from the ONS suggests there are around 4,200 new infections a day compared with 3,200 a week ago. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread, and the government's scientific advisers have always warned there was not much wiggle room to lift restrictions and still suppress it. The uptick in infections is a warning we may have already passed the limit of lifting lockdown. That is why Boris Johnson has delayed some of the planned lifting of restrictions in England and face masks will become a more frequent sight. The big question remains around schools. If the current rules are leading to an increase in cases, can we open schools as well? If we open schools will we have to close something else? It is worth noting all this is happening in July and scientists suspect the virus will spread even more easily in the winter months. You can read more from Jameshere. Mr Johnson said the planned reopening of ""higher risk settings"" on 1 August would be delayed for at least a fortnight. This means that the following will not be able to take place until 15 August, at the earliest: the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services indoor performances pilots of larger gatherings in sports venuesand conference centres the expansion of wedding receptions to allow up to 30 people beauty treatmentsthat involve the face, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading treatments Fans will no longer be allowed to attend pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England Fans attended the World Snooker Championship when it started on Friday as part of a pilot to test the return of larger crowds to sports venues. The tournament will now go ahead without spectatorsuntil at least 15 August, which is when the final is scheduled to begin. Neil White, 51, from Chorley in Lancashire, owns a wedding photography business. Of the 44 weddings he had scheduled for this year, just three bookings remain.""I think I speak for the rest of the wedding industry in that there is a huge amount of worry and stress about the future,"" he said. Mr White said that while businesses such as pubs and restaurants in have been able to reopen, those in the wedding sector ""seem to have been brushed under the carpet"" even though they are ""itching to get back to work"". ""If it continues to next year there are a lot of businesses that are going to close,"" he added. The British Beauty Council said the changes were ""very disappointing for a sector that has already seen delay after delay in reopening"". At-a-glance: What can I do now? Separately, face coverings will be compulsory in more indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from next weekend. They are already required in shops, banks, airports and other indoor transport hubs. The prime minister saidthe rules for face coveringswould be enforceable in law from 8 August. This video can not be played Chris Whitty on lockdown easing: ""We have probably reached near the limit of what we can do"" However, he said the plan to pause shielding for those most vulnerable to the virus will go ahead from Saturday. That means some 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic can return to work, if they cannot work from home, so long as their workplace is Covid-secure. Guidance for employers will also change, as planned, from the start of August,Mr Johnson said. The latest announcement came shortly after new lockdown rules were introduced in parts of northern England, including Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and parts of West Yorkshire. The rules include a ban on separate households meeting each other inside their homes and private gardens.  How can we celebrate Eid? And other lockdown questions Lockdown rules mean 'spirit of Eid has gone' Scots warned to avoid Covid hotspots in England The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had made the ""right decision"" regarding the new rules for parts of northern England, but urged it to ""improve"" what he called ""extremely poor"" communication. Ministers have said police forces and councils will be given powers to enforce the new rules. In other key developments: Pubs and restaurants in Leicester - which saw the UK's first local lockdown -are set to reopen from Monday as a number of restrictions in the city are lifted A 14-year-old girl is being treated for a life-threatening illnessafter being ""gravely neglected"" by her family during lockdown.

Fans not allowed to attend pilot eventsFans will not be allowed to attend the pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England after a spike in coronavirus cases.,"This video can not be played Barry Hearn says 'the show must go on' after government restriction wreck snooker plans Fans will not be allowed to attend the pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England after a spike in coronavirus cases, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Spectators were due to watch the first two days of two county cricket matches, while 205 fans were at the start of the World Snooker Championship on Friday. It was also hoped to allow 4,000 racegoers at Goodwood on Saturday. The new restrictions on fans will be enforced until at least 15 August. The announcement comes after general restrictions werereintroduced for people in parts of northern England. ""Pilots of larger crowds at sports venues will not take place,"" Johnson said at a news conference on Friday. ""I said from May we would not hesitate to put on the brakes at the slightest sign that the numbers were going in the wrong direction."" Johnson had said earlier this month that spectators could be able toreturn to stadiums in England from October. Premier League looking at 'clinical passports' to help get fans back into stadiums Beers, big screens and sanitiser - 1,000 fans return to cricket at Oval pilot Coronavirus: PM puts lockdown easing on hold in England Fans were already at theWorld Snooker Championshipin Sheffield when the prime minister spoke on Friday, with announcer Rob Walker shouting ""we are back"" as play started, before adding: ""Our socially distanced crowd are poised to roar once more."" World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn was shown smiling, clapping and fist-pumping, as spectators - some wearing masks - cheered on the first players Judd Trump and Tom Ford. Just hours earlier, Hearn had told BBC of his ""pride"" and ""relief"" at getting fans back at events. However, while those with tickets for Friday's further sessions were allowed to stay, there will now be no spectators permitted at the Crucible Theatre from Saturday. Fans with tickets will be given a refund, or be allowed to use them next year. After the government decision, Hearn told BBC Sport he was ""gutted"" and ""disappointed"" to not have an atmosphere, but added: ""The show must go on. ""There is a chance - I'm forever the optimist - that maybe a return for the final [on 16 August] is the earliest possible opportunity. ""Congratulations to those guys who went today because they will be able to talk about this for the rest of their lives - the ultimate golden ticket. ""I've never known a circumstance change in a couple of hours, but that is symbolic of what is happening in the world at the moment. ""We don't go off into a corner or go into sulks or tears, we get the job done."" Watch day one of the World Snooker Championship live Sport has been held behind closed doors since its return, including England's Test series against West Indies Two matches in cricket'sBob Willis Trophystarting on Saturday had been due to welcome spectators - Surrey v Middlesex at the Oval and Warwickshire against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""We understand the reasons the government has made this decision, and remain ready to work with them to ensure supporters can safely return to stadiums when government advice allows. ""We are pleased the Bob Willis Trophy will still begin this weekend behind closed doors, and fans will be able to watch their teams in action through the online streams being provided."" The Oval had been due to host 2,500 fans on Saturday and Sunday,having held the first pilot last weekend of 1,000 fans. Surrey chief executive Richard Gould said: ""A lot of hard work has taken place to ensure that members and fans could return to our ground safely. ""We still hope to welcome members to the ground for future matches this summer, and we will continue to work with the ECB and the government to encourage this to happen."" A statement fromGoodwoodracecourse said: ""We are very disappointed for those who were hoping to attend tomorrow's event and for all those who have worked so hard to make it possible for spectators to be present. ""We will engage with public health authorities and the DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) over a rescheduled pilot at the earliest opportunity."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden posted on social media that it was ""very disappointing news"". ""I know the huge efforts cricket, snooker and horseracing have made to welcome fans back. We'll keep working together on their safe return ASAP,"" he added. BBC sports editor Dan Roan This will be hugely disappointing news for the events involved, and obviously very worrying for the wider sports industry, which is increasingly desperate to get paying fans back through the turnstiles to ease an unprecedented financial crisis - especially for those sports bodies dependent on matchday revenue, like English Football League clubs. Until now, the effort to get sports back up and running after lockdown had gone relatively smoothly, with the football season resuming and now almost completed, along with other events such as Test cricket, Formula 1 and horse racing. This then is a first major setback in the wider effort to return sport to some kind of normality. However, crucially, I am told by Whitehall sources that the government remains keen to work with sports and Public Health England with a view to getting fans back inside venues from 1 October. Some sports organisations - like the Premier League - would like to see that target date brought forward, but Friday's news will not have helped them win that argument. Attendances of 20% to 40% capacity - depending on the nature of the venue - is envisaged by officials from October, and more pilots are being planned in the coming weeks. It is simply too early to tell whether this is now unrealistic. It remains the aim but there are no guarantees. This is a stark reminder that the nature of the pandemic means it is difficult to plan months in advance, and that officials will need to take decisive action when data shows worrying trends.

UK PM 'squeezes the brakes' and delays easing,"UK PM Boris Johnson halts plans to ease restrictions in England due to start on Saturday Rules on face coverings are extended to more indoor settings, including museums and places of worship England at ""outer edge"" of how much restrictions can be eased, says chief medical officer Millions in northern England face new restrictions after a spike in cases Hong Kong postpones elections after a spike in cases Spain records its biggest daily rise in cases since its lockdown was lifted last month A record 292,527 new cases reported worldwide on Friday - WHO Vietnam reports its first death, months into the pandemic Globally there have been more than 17m cases and nearly 700,000 deaths Thom Poole, Joshua Nevett, Dulcie Lee, Martha Buckley, Jo Couzens and Sophie Williams Thanks
for tuning into our coverage today. We'll be back on Saturday with more updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Our
team updating you throughout the day were: Thom Poole, Justin
Parkinson, Jennifer Scott, Joshua Nevett, Joseph Lee, Dulcie Lee, Martha
Buckley, Krutika Pathi, Jo Couzens and Sophie Williams. Hereâs an update on the latest developments in the UK and around the world today: A couple marry in Belfast, where wedding celebrations with as many as 10 people are allowed outdoors Wedding ceremonies or
civil partnerships with as many as 30 guests have been allowed since 4 July in
England but anexpected
relaxation in restrictions to allow the same number of people to attend wedding
receptions has been put back until 15 Augustâ at the earliest. Weddings had been banned
under almost all circumstances since lockdown began on 23 March, prompting
73,600 marriages and same-sex civil partnership ceremonies to be postponed. Northern Ireland has allowed outdoors weddings with 10 people
presentsince early June.WalesandScotlandalso now allow wedding ceremonies to take place, but
social distancing must be observed and big gatherings are not allowed. Wedding photographer, Neil White, from
Chorley, Lancashire, says he was booked to do 44 weddings this year â but now heâs down to three. He told the BBC:  âA lot has been mentioned, quite rightly, about the grief of couples not
able to enjoy their day and the struggles of cancelling or postponing. However,
the wedding industry and its suppliers are taking a huge hit right now, when we
should be enjoying peak season. âWhile many other
industries have been allowed to open, such as pubs and restaurants, the wedding
industry at large has not been given any directives for its future. We seem to
have been forgotten.â He said the longer it
goes on, many venues and suppliers will lose their livelihoods, adding that the
future of the industry is âbleakâ. Fewer than half of adults spending time with family and
friends are sticking tosocial distancing rules when they
meet up, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. Almost three-quarters of adults polled said they'd socialised with others during the last
seven days - with 50% welcoming family or friends into their homes, it said. Of the 1,150 people who reported socialising, 47% said they
had maintained social distancing  - rising to 70% of
those aged 70 and over. Three in 10 (31%) said they often followed the measures, 13%
said they sometimes did and 8% said they rarely or never followed social
distancing. More than a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said they had met up with between
five to 10 people, while 6% said the group had been larger than 10. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""households gathering
and not abiding by the social distancing rules"" was one of the reasons for the stricter rules announced late on Thursday for some parts of England. The ONS also found that 63% of respondents strongly supported targeted lockdown measures to stop the rise of the virus and 57% were in favour of mandatory face
coverings in shops and supermarkets. Cases around the globe rose by 292,527 on Friday Friday has seen a record daily global increase in coronavirus cases, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). The
one-day total rose by 292,527 - up from the previous record daily increase of 284,196 on 24
July. Deaths
on Friday rose by 6,812, according to a daily report. The countries
reporting the largest increases were the US, Brazil, India and South Africa. Guidance saying people with serious medical conditions should stay at home is coming to an end Since March, as many as 2.2m in England with medical conditions that make them ""extremely vulnerable"" have been taking the most extreme measures of self-isolation. Only earlier this month did the government say it was safe for them to leave the house at all. That is due to end tomorrow, with the government ""pausing"" the guidance on shielding. Under the new rules, the government says these people can go to work as long as their workplace meets its Covid-secure standards -  but they should still work from home if they can. Children who are clinically extremely vulnerable can attend school or college in line with the broader plans to reopen educational institutions. But while people who had been shielding can go out, they are advised to keep social interactions low and to maintain social distancing carefully. The end of the shielding guidance also means the end of extra support for extremely vulnerable groups, such as free food parcels and medicine deliveries.

has confirmed 1,525 new cases, the biggest rise since the lockdown was lifted there
last month. It
is the third day in a row that new cases have exceeded 1,000. More
than half of these recent infections are from Aragon and Madrid,according
to El Pais.,external More
than 28,000 people have died in Spain and more than 285,000 cases have been confirmed
since the outbreak began. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and around 46,000 people have died, according to government figures. However, these numbers only include people who tested positive for the virus and subsequently died. The actual death toll is higher. We take a look
at some of the key figures of the pandemic in the UK- estimates of the
death toll and number of cases. You can also find out more about cases in your area using our

on a Norwegian cruise ship, MS Roald Amundsen, tested positive for Covid-19 and
are now in hospital. The ship is docked in Tromsoe, northern Norway. All 160 quarantined
crew will be tested and the 177 passengers, who have disembarked, have been
urged to self-isolate. The ship, owned by Norwegian firm Hurtigruten,
had been on a week-long voyage to Svalbard in the Arctic. It is scheduled to visit
ports in England and Scotland in September, Reuters reports. In March, Hurtigruten suspended most cruises
because of the pandemic, but it plans to return 14 vessels to service by the
end of September. Early in the pandemic thousands of
passengers were stranded aboard cruise ships in Asian and US waters because of
coronavirus outbreaks onboard. Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens New restrictions affecting millions ofpeople in
parts of northern England have come just as Muslim communities prepare to
celebrate Eidthis weekend. Ash Mohammed, from Hale in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, had been due to meet his siblings in his brother's garden today to celebrate the festival. His sister is driving up from Cardiff and now ""doesn't know whether to turn around or not"". He told the BBC: ""A lot of families were planning to get together. Some sort of warning would have been helpful. ""It's akin to someone saying on Christmas Eve that you can't see your family on Christmas Day. As far as I understand, 20 of us could go to Wetherspoons if we wanted to but a Muslim family can't sit in their garden."" He added that, while no one wanted a second wave, it wasn't as though Eid has been sprung on Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson. ""They could have given us some warning a week ago to say the data is going the wrong way and these restrictions might have to be brought in,"" he said. Vietnam had been proud of its zero death toll Vietnam
has recorded its second Covid-related death, just hours after it recorded its
first. The
fatality was said to be a 61-year-old dialysis patient in Da Nang, the
epicentre of the outbreak there. No
new infections had been reported for more than three months before an outbreak
was reported in the resort town. Itâs
a devastating blow to the country which had been proud of its zero death toll. Vietnam acted before it even had confirmed cases, closing its borders early to almost all travellers, except returning citizens. Anyone entering the country must quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing. Earlier
today the country reported 37 new cases, according to local media. Scientific advisers say for schools to open fully, other measures may need to be tightened At the Downing Street briefing earlier, UK Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty warned that ""the idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong"" - meaning the country faced some ""very, very difficult choices"". Newly released papers from the Sage advisory group reveal a bit more about the scientific thinking, suggesting experts believe there is a trade-off between opening schools and opening other areas of society. On 23 June, scientists said coronavirus measures might need to be changed at the end of summer to keep the R number below 1 - a level at which the epidemic is not growing - while still reopening schools. On 9 July, they said the spread of the virus from children to adults ""appears to be low"" but stressed there needed to be ""enough âroomâ in terms of the epidemic to open schools"". They also warned that areas seeing coronavirus restrictions reimposed - such as parts of northern England today - might not respond in the same way as they did when lockdown was first introduced, due to changing levels of trust, fear and anger. Ryanair claims Ireland's travel restrictions are unlawful Ryanair
says it has launched legal proceedings against the Irish government over its
travel restrictions. Currently,
Ireland has a âgreen listâ of countries in which a 14-day quarantine rule does
not apply. However Britain, France and Spain are not on this list. Ryanair
claims the restrictions are unlawful. It is calling for a review of the list and claims that the Irish parliament was not given the opportunity to scrutinise
it.. The
airline claims the list has been detrimental to its business. It
comes after Ryanair, British Airways and easyJet launched a similar challenge
against the British government, however this was ended after a 14-day quarantine
rule for travellers coming from many tourist spots such as France and Greece
was scrapped. There are currently 50 people in isolation in the country Iceland
has re-introduced restrictions on public gatherings after two infection
clusters were confirmed. Under
the new rules, public gatherings are limited to 100 people and a two-metre
social distancing rule has been re-imposed. It
comes after Icelanders were told that social gatherings of 1,000 people were
allowed and social distancing would become optional from 25 May. Iceland
avoided a full lockdown, choosing to impose social distancing and close schools
and some businesses. According
to the governmentâs Covid website, there are currently 50 people in isolation. A
total of 1,885 cases have been confirmed and 10 people have died since the
pandemic began. Tests on a random sample of the population in England suggest infections are increasing Coronavirus infections in England have risen from an estimated 2,800 to 4,200 since last week,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest. A sample of households in England, excluding care homes and hospitals, were swabbed to test for current infection. However there is not enough data to suggest a higher proportion of positive tests in any particular region. Despite the ONS figures suggesting a rise in infections, the official estimate of the virus's reproduction or R number (a measure of whether cases are rising or falling) for England was between 0.8 and 1 as of 31 July. An R number below one indicates the number of infections is shrinking. It's calculated using a range of different measures, including hospital admissions and deaths. Because it takes more time for someone to end up in hospital due to an infection, it's possible the latest estimate of R isn't capturing more recent upticks in infection. People who should be isolating have been leaving their houses, according to Victoria's premier One
in four people who tested positive for coronavirus in Australiaâs state of
Victoria were not at home when authorities came to check up on them. Victoria
Premier Andrew Daniels said 130 unsuccessful visits had been made to people who should have been in quarantine over the past 24 hours. Last
week, the Victorian government said sick people breaking isolation rules â or not
getting tested in time â was leading to continued spread despite lockdown
measures. Victoria
recorded 623 cases on Friday and eight deaths. Those
who were not at home will receive a follow up from police andcould
face a fine,external, according to Channel 9 News. The socially-distanced reopening of indoor theatre and music venues in England has been delayed until at least 15 August, Boris Johnson announced today. The easing of restrictions had been due to start this weekend but has been postponed amid concerns over a rise in virus cases. Face coverings will also be required in additional settings including museums, galleries and cinemas - enforceable in law from 8 August. Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust, said ""most theatres will not be able to put on productions until we reach stage five [of the roadmap for the return of professional performing arts], which allows fuller audiences, so that is the most critical date for much of the sector"". Read more here James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys. It will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Two weeks ago, Boris Johnson was setting out plansfor normality by Christmas. But since then the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, when there were an estimated 100,000 infections every day, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread. The uptick in infections is a warning that we are passing the limits of lifting lockdown. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst For three days running, China has recorded more than 100 new cases of Covid-19. In the last 24 hours, 127 cases have been recorded, including 112 in north-west Xinjiang, and 11 in north-east Liaoning province. For eight consecutive days, the number of cases has grown in China, meaning that official media have urged people nationwide not to relax vigilance: to wear a mask and avoid gatherings. But there is limited concern about either of the outbreaks in Xinjiang or Liaoning leading to a second wave in the country. China has experienced a number of localised outbreaks since the beginning of the year â including in the capital Beijing â and media have lauded the co-operation of the public with swift self-isolation procedures, and their willingness to be tested, in keeping the virus under control. Currently, in Xinjiangâs Urumqi and Liaoningâs Dalian, communities where people have tested positive have gone into full lockdown. Other residents have taken advantage of free testing that has been made available to them in public areas with a lot of space. Over the next few days, medical staff will finalise testing 3.5 million people in Urumqi, and six million in Dalian. A further 120 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who have died after a positive Covid-19 test to 46,119. There were another 880 cases confirmed by testing in the last 24 hours. The figure for deaths may be different from the sum of newly reported deaths for the four nations, because the UK-wide figure is calculated on a different time frame and includes deaths in all settings, not just hospitals. The government has also launched a review of the UK death figures, over concerns that England may be wrongly including deaths which took place months after the person tested positive for the virus.

Lockdown heightened in parts of England,"Updates on Friday 31 July Visiting people at home banned in parts of northern England Boris Johnson halts plans to ease restrictions in England due to start on Saturday Rules on face coverings are extended to more indoor settings, including museums and places of worship Evidence suggests a slight increase in the number of people in England testing positive for coronavirus Hancock: 'Households not abiding by social distancing' Burnham: 'Protect each other' by following the rules Pubs and restaurants to reopen in Leicester Rob England and Kate Darlington Rob EnglandBBC News Our live coverage has finished for today. But you can still follow the latest coronavirus updates from across the globe on theBBC News website here. I'll leave you with the prime minister's new coronavirus slogan - ""hands, face, space, get a test"". Stay safe. Coronavirus infections are rising in England, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest. A sample of households in England, excluding care homes and hospitals, were swabbed to test for current infection. The ONS says daily cases have risen from an estimated 2,800 to 4,200 since last week. However, there is not enough data to suggest a higher proportion of positive tests in any particular region. The way the public was told about new local lockdown rules coming into force in West Yorkshire was ""chaotic in the extreme"", according to one Bradford MP. Last night, health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say separate households living in areas across northern England, from midnight, would be banned from meeting each other indoors and in their gardens. The Labour MP for Bradford South, Judith Cummins, said the way people were told was ""very chaotic in the extreme"". ""If you're trying to get the public to buy in to a public health message, you need to communicate that effectively and properly with some some time for people to adjust, not a couple of hours. ""I think it's a terrible and appalling way to communicate. We're talking about people's livelihoods and people's lives. To do it with a couple of hours' notice is simply not good enough."" A comedy club boss says the government's decision not to reopen indoor performance venues is a ""huge blow"". Jessica Toomey, director of the Frog
and Bucket Comedy Club in Manchester, said the decision was a blow not just  to her club but ""the industry as a whole."" ""Weâve put in a considerable amount of time
and investment gearing up to reopen again but we have to respect the decision. ""The show will go on. The Frog will return bigger and better,"" she said.  David PittamBBC News Online Gillian Grant, a 55-year-old from Braunstone, echoed the thoughts of many residents in commenting on the confusion caused by the partial lifting of Leicester's lockdown. Pubs and restaurants in Leicester areset to reopen from Mondayas a number of lockdown restrictions in the city are lifted, but restrictions on household visits willapply in the same way as they do in parts of northern England. ""I couldn't
make heads nor tails of it last night to be honest,"" she said. ""You can go the pub and have
a drink now but can't see your family?"" Alex SmithBBC News Online Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton has welcomed the government's decision to take Oadby and Wigston out of lockdown from Monday, but said more work needed to be done as infection rates in the borough were ""still too high"". The borough, along with the city of Leicester, has been subject to stricter measures since 29 June and was not included when it was announced that certain suburbs would be released from the lockdown zone on 16 July. Mr Rushton said: ""The announcement signals a move towards a more normal way of life and is great news for local businesses who can open their doors and start trading again. ""The response of residents has been tremendous and the testing rate in the borough is 12 times higher than the rest of the UK â and Iâd like to thank people for heeding our call. ""Unfortunately, rates in the borough are still too high. So let's not be under any illusions - there is still work to do. If you have symptoms get a test, self-isolate if you or anyone in your home has symptoms, keep your distance and wash your hands."" PA Media The mayor of Leicester says the city has been left ""out in the dark, very frustrated and very angry"" following the government's ""shambolic""lockdown announcement. A number of Leicester lockdown restrictions will be lifted from Monday, with Oadby and Wigston set to move out of lockdown altogether. Sir Peter Soulsby described Health Secretary Matt Hancock's words as ""an inadequate response to the last four weeks of lockdown we have had to suffer"". ""Once again, it was shambolic,"" Sir Peter told a news conference on Friday. ""What the government did yesterday, I can't help but feel, was make it up as they went along and frankly that's not the way to deal with this."" The mayor also called for more clarity from the government, adding there were still unanswered questions about people meeting up with family and friends and travel restrictions. The timing ofnew coronavirus lockdown restrictions which have been introduced in parts of northern Englandwill have a major impact on Eid celebrations, an organisation representing Muslims in part of West Yorkshire has said. The restrictions, which ban separate households in areas including Calderdale, Bradford and Kirklees, from meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases, were announced last night and came into force at midnight. Yunus Lunat, from the Indian Muslim Welfare Society in Batley, has criticised what he calls a ""lack of awareness"" at the government level. He says: ""The problem for the Muslim community, certainly that I represent in Batley, with it being Eid today, is what data became available so late in the day last night for this to be announced at three hours' notice? ""Would they do this on Christmas Eve? On the government website it refers to Muslims celebrating Eid this weekend. No, we're celebrating Eid three hours after the announcement."" A woman from Manchester who has been shielding says the ""very sudden"" lockdown measures are ""disappointing"". Jenny Cooper, 36, from
Burnage, lives with Crohn's disease and has been shielding since March. It's really important to keep the vulnerable safe, but it does feel very sudden.  We were on the cusp of freedom. It's disappointing as many of us feel left behind. Jenny Cooper The governmenthas banned separate households in east Lancashire and other parts of northern Englandfrom meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The chair of the Lancashire Council of Mosques said the hastily announced restrictions were going to be ""very, very difficult"" for Muslim communities poised to celebrate Eid. Chair Rafiq Sufi said: ""I can't visit my mum and she lives across the road."" He continued: ""We've been working very hard and we've been trying so much to make sure everything's Covid-19 safe. ""We've been bombarded with texts and messages and it's really difficult for us to try and explain to people that it's a decision for our own safety, but the timing is of such concern. ""The weather's going to be fantastic today and people were expecting to have parties and meet their relatives and suddenly this restriction comes in, it's going to be very, very difficult, but we have to abide by it."" James VincentPolitical Editor, BBC Look North We knew something might
be coming - but not this... Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale in West Yorkshire have been closely watched for weeks. Bradford had even asked the government to think about whether there should be any more easing of restrictions there. But this Tweet just after 21:00 last night changed it all: Allow Twitter content?

That's now off the cards - indefinitely - in some parts of Yorkshire. Sam ProffittBBC News Office workers in England can soon go back to their desks - but many want to keep working remotely. According to the ONS, 30% of adults in the UK were exclusively working from home at the start of July. From 1 August, employers in England can allow staff back into offices at their own discretion when they feel it's safe to do so. But will workers want to return? James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Over the past two weeks the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. A total of 45 people have tested positive for coronavirusat the Iceland supermarket distribution centre in Swindon. The borough council confirmed the cases at the site, run by XPO Logistics, and expect the number to rise. The Unite Union says some employees, 150 of whom are self-isolating, are now afraid to return to the premises. A spokesman for the company said it was working with local authorities in an attempt to keep staff safe.

Sarah Gillett, 52, received a delivery of beer in time for her to be able to reopen the pub, but said it had been ""a nightmare trying to follow""  the new lockdown rules.

This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,338, NHS England said. Patients were aged between 73 and 92 years old and all but one, aged 75, had underlying health conditions. Plans to reduce the rate of coronavirus cases in Calderdale have been discussed at the highest level of government, the leader of the council says. Calderdale is one of the areas affected by new lockdown rules in parts of West Yorkshire following aspike in coronavirus cases in parts of northern England. The chief executive of Calderdale Council, Robin Tuddenham, said: ""We've been an area of concern now for a week, our neighbouring areas have been a concern a bit longer. ""We do know the rate of infection has been increasing in Calderdale and we've been talking to the government about the kind of action we might take with them and our communities to reduce the risk. ""We are concerned and we do need to get on top of this infection again,"" he added. People who pay council tax to specific councils are affected by the new local coronavirus lockdown rules, according to one West Yorkshire council. Some social media users have expressed confusion over who is affected by new rules which were brought in overnight in Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. Designed to slow the spread of the virus, separate households living in those areas have been banned from meeting each other indoors and in their gardens. Bradford Council says the lockdown is not based on specific postcodes,but rather on who you pay your council tax to,external.

Why Hong Kong's 'third wave' is a warning to all,"Infections reached a record high - 149 cases - on Thursday Until recently, Hong Kong was considered a poster child in its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite sharing a border with mainland China, where the first cases were reported, Hong Kong kept its infection numbers down and was able to avoid the extreme lockdown measures introduced in parts of China, Europe and the US. But now, it's been hit by not even a second, but a third, wave of infections. The government has warned its hospital system could face collapse, and it's just had a record high number of new infections in a day. What went wrong, and what lessons are there for countries juggling both the pandemic, and the economic pain caused by lockdown? Hong Kong had its first Covid-19 cases in late January, leading to widespread concern and panic buying, but infection numbers remained relatively low and the spread was controlled quite quickly. It experienced what became known as its ""second wave"" in March, after overseas students and residents started returning to the territory, leading to a spike in imported infections. As a result, Hong Kong introduced strict border controls, banning all non-residents from entering its borders from overseas, and everyone who returned was required to undergo a Covid-19 test and 14-day quarantine. It even used electronic bracelets to track new arrivals and make sure they stayed at home. That, combined with the widespread use of masks and social distancing measures, worked - Hong Kong went for weeks without a locally transmitted case, and life seemed to be heading back to normal. So how did the ""third wave"" - that has led to more than 100 new cases for nine days in a row - arrive? Hong Kong on verge of 'large-scale' outbreak ""It's quite disappointing and frustrating because Hong Kong had really got things very much under control,"" says Malik Peiris, Chair of Virology at the University of Hong Kong. He believes there were two flaws in the system. First, many returnees opted to quarantine for 14 days at home - an arrangement that's common in many countries including the UK - rather than in quarantine camps. ""There is a weakness there because other people in the home are not under any form of restriction, and will still be coming and going,"" says Prof Peiris. However, he believes the more serious problem came from the government's decision to exempt several groups of people from testing and quarantine when they entered Hong Kong. Hong Kong had exempted about 200,000 people, including seafarers, aircrew and executives of companies listed on the stock exchange, from quarantine. It said the exceptions were needed,externalto ensure normal daily operations continued in Hong Kong, or because their travel was necessary to the city's economic development. As an international city and trading port, Hong Kong has a high number of air links, and many ships change crews there. The territory also depends on imports from mainland China and elsewhere for food and essential goods. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains what ""excess deaths"" reveal about Covid-19 Joseph Tsang, an infectious diseases specialist and doctor, describes the exemptions as a significant ""loophole"" that increased the risk of infection, particularly from seafarers and air crew who also visited tourist spots and used public transport. The government initially said that the quarantine exemptions were not to blame,external, but later admitted there was evidence that the exemptions were behind the latest outbreak. They have now tightened rules for air and sea crews - but it can be difficult to enforce. There was alarm earlier this week whena foreign pilot was reportedly spotted sightseeing,externalwhile awaiting Covid-19 test results. And balancing public health, practical concerns and the economy can be hard - a union representingpilots at FedEx has asked the company to stop flights to Hong Kong,externalbecause it says the stricter Covid-19 measures, including mandatory hospital stays for pilots who test positive, create ""unacceptable conditions for pilots"". Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, says Hong Kong's experience with quarantine problems could also happen in other countries. ""In the UK, you also have a 14-day quarantine at home, so you would have the same potential issue with leakage."" Meanwhile, New Zealand and Australia have a mandatory hotel quarantine policy, which is ""a good conceptâ¦ although there's the issue of who pays for it"", he adds. Like Hong Kong,the UK also exempts certain travellers from border rules,external, including drivers of goods vehicles, seafarers and aircrew. Hong Kong's quarantine exemptions have been around for months, but the third wave didn't hit until July. Prof Peiris believes this is because of a second crucial factor - social distancing measures were significantly rolled back in June. ""As long as social distancing measures were in place the system could cope - but once measures were relaxed"" the imported infections spread rapidly, he says. ""It's a lesson for everybody."" The government has now banned gatherings of more than two people - and briefly banned all dine-in services Dr Tsang recalls that by late June the government had allowed public gatherings of up to 50 people, while there were celebrations for Fathers' Day and Hong Kong's handover anniversary. ""Many citizens were fatigued after months of social distancing, so when the government said things seemed fine and relaxed restrictions, they started meeting with friends and family. ""I think it's very unfortunate - many factors combined at the same time."" However, Prof Peiris stresses that Hong Kongers had been ""extremely compliant"" with social distancing and hygiene measures during in the first and second waves - ""in fact, they were even a step ahead of government instructions, wearing face masks before they were compulsory."" He believes the reintroduction of social distancing measures now are already having an effect, and hopes that Hong Kong will be back to close to zero local infections within four to six weeks. At that point, he adds, the challenge will be to stop imported infections - particularly once social distancing measures are lifted. It's a challenge other countries will also face once they are successful in containing the virus within their borders, because ""when you get to low levels of transmission within your population, having unregulated introductions from outside can lead to disaster."" Many of Hong Kong's pandemic struggles will apply to other cities, but the territory has also experienced another crisis - a political one - over the past year. On 1 July,thousands of people took part in a pro-democracy rally, despite the march being banned by authorities who said it broke social distancing guidelines. Hundreds of thousands also voted inopposition primaries in mid-July, despite the government warning that the primaries could breach a new security law. Thousands marched in Hong Kong on the anniversary of its handover, 1 July Since then,Chinese state media have blamed both events for triggering the third wave,externalof infections, while one politician called it ""absolutely irresponsible behaviour"". However, health experts say there is no evidence of them causing the spike in infections. Prof Cowling says scientists ""are able to link together cases to identify chains of transmission, and there are no clusters attributed to those events,"" while Prof Peiris argues that the events ""may have aggravated things slightly, but I don't think it was a major determinant one way or the other"". Meanwhile, Dr Tsang says research has shown that ""the strain of coronavirus in the third wave is different from those in previous waves"" - in particular, it has type of mutation seen in aircrew and seafarers from the Philippines and Kazakhstan, so he believes the strain was imported. This video can not be played Stephen McDonell explains what the law means, and what people in Hong Kong think There have been similar discussions around the world - particularly in light of anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd - overwhether demonstrations can lead to a spike in infections,external, with some experts suggesting that outdoor events where participants wear masks and take precautions could be lower risk than initially expected. There is widespread speculation that Hong Kong's government could postpone September's elections to Hong Kong's parliament - the Legislative Council - citing the spike in infections. Several local media reports, quoting anonymous sources, say the government is set to postpone elections by a year. Opposition politicians have accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to delay elections, especially as the opposition had performed strongly in local elections late last year. How Singapore prepared for elections during a pandemic Hong Kong bars pro-democracy figures from election Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law However the move has been welcomed by some, including former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang, who told local media: ""The government won't be able to absolve itself of blame if polling stations turn into hotbeds for spreading the virus. ""It's also nearly impossible for candidates to canvass votes given the social distancing rules."" Prof Cowling says that social distancing measures reintroduced by the government have already stopped case numbers from accelerating over the past week. ""I'm not sure it's necessary to delay the elections - certainly not for a year. You could consider delaying them for two weeks or a month, because by then we'd almost certainly have [local infection] numbers back down to zero."" He adds that there are many ways to make elections safer, including increasing the number of polling stations and staff to reduce wait times, ensuring polling stations are well-ventilated, and testing all polling station staff two days before the election. Singapore adopted extra safety measures for its general elections Governments have taken very different approaches to this - at least 68 countries or territories postponed elections due to Covid-19, while 49 places held elections as planned, saysthe International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance,external. Singapore held its general elections earlier this month - and had its highest turnout in recent years, says Eugene Tan, a law professor and political commentator at Singapore Management University. ""There is never a good time for an election during a pandemic,"" he says, but the vote went ahead with several safety measures in place and ""demonstrates that it is possible to protect public health even as people go about exercising their democratic right to vote."" However, he believes that making a decision on whether to proceed with elections is a tough judgement call for governments, particularly if public trust is low. ""If you delay elections you could be accused of waiting for a more favourable time [for the government] - but if you go ahead you could be accused of playing fast and loose with people's lives. The worst thing would be to have an election, and then have a spike in the number of cases.""

PM postpones lockdown easing in EnglandThe reopening of venues such as bowling alleys was among the changes expected to come in from this weekend.,"The further easing of lockdown restrictions in England - due to come in this weekend - has been postponed for at least two weeks, after an increase in coronavirus cases. Casinos and bowling alleys will remain shut, as Boris Johnson said it was time to ""squeeze the brake pedal"". Face coverings will be mandatory in more indoor settings, such as cinemas. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, warned the UK may have hit its limits on easing restrictions. Appearing alongside the prime minister at a special Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said the ""idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control"" is wrong. Asked whether it was safe for England's schools to fully reopen to all pupils in the autumn, he said it was a ""difficult balancing act"" but ""we have probably reached near the limit, or the limits, of what we can do in terms of opening up society."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal"" Speaking at the briefing, Mr Johnson said planned changes to guidance for those who have been shielding during the pandemic, and advice for employers, will still go ahead. The rethink on easing England's lockdown follows new restrictions for people in parts of northern England,after a spike in virus cases. The prime minister said progress in tackling coronavirus continues, with the daily and weekly number of deaths falling, but warned that some European countries are ""struggling"" to control it. The UK must be ready to ""react"", he said. Manchester lockdown rules cause 'confusion and distress' Lockdown heightened in parts of England Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday suggestinfection rates in England are rising, with around 4,200 new infections a day- compared with 3,200 a week ago. The ONS's estimates of daily cases - based on a sample of households completing swab tests - are higher than the figures for lab-confirmed cases reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) because they include people without symptoms who would not otherwise have applied for a test. Highlighting the ONS figures, Mr Johnson added: ""The prevalence of the virus in the community, in England, is likely to be rising for the first time since May.""

Data from the ONS suggests there are around 4,200 new infections a day compared with 3,200 a week ago. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread, and the government's scientific advisers have always warned there was not much wiggle room to lift restrictions and still suppress it. The uptick in infections is a warning we may have already passed the limit of lifting lockdown. That is why Boris Johnson has delayed some of the planned lifting of restrictions in England and face masks will become a more frequent sight. The big question remains around schools. If the current rules are leading to an increase in cases, can we open schools as well? If we open schools will we have to close something else? It is worth noting all this is happening in July and scientists suspect the virus will spread even more easily in the winter months. You can read more from Jameshere. Mr Johnson said the planned reopening of ""higher risk settings"" on 1 August would be delayed for at least a fortnight. This means that the following will not be able to take place until 15 August, at the earliest: the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services indoor performances pilots of larger gatherings in sports venuesand conference centres the expansion of wedding receptions to allow up to 30 people beauty treatmentsthat involve the face, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading treatments Fans will no longer be allowed to attend pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England Fans attended the World Snooker Championship when it started on Friday as part of a pilot to test the return of larger crowds to sports venues.

Mr White said that while businesses such as pubs and restaurants in have been able to reopen, those in the wedding sector ""seem to have been brushed under the carpet"" even though they are ""itching to get back to work"". ""If it continues to next year there are a lot of businesses that are going to close,"" he added. The British Beauty Council said the changes were ""very disappointing for a sector that has already seen delay after delay in reopening"". At-a-glance: What can I do now? Separately, face coverings will be compulsory in more indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from next weekend.

This video can not be played Chris Whitty on lockdown easing: ""We have probably reached near the limit of what we can do"" However, he said the plan to pause shielding for those most vulnerable to the virus will go ahead from Saturday. That means some 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic can return to work, if they cannot work from home, so long as their workplace is Covid-secure. Guidance for employers will also change, as planned, from the start of August,Mr Johnson said.

Visiting people at home banned in parts of England,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We take this action with a heavy heart"" Millions of people in parts of northern England are now facing new restrictions, banning separate households from meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The rules impact people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. The health secretary told the BBC the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Labour criticised the timing of the announcement - late on Thursday night. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing, which he said showed that ""most of the transmission is happening between households visiting each other, and people visiting relatives and friends"". Pubs and restaurants to reopen in Leicester Luxembourg taken off UK travel exemption list What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month. However, pubs, restaurants and other facilities will be allowed to reopen in the city from Monday, as some of the stricter measures are lifted. There is an inescapable fact here - the coronavirus has not gone away and it still thrives on close human contact. The more we come together the easier it will spread. We have seen this happen as national lockdowns have been lifted from Europe, to the US, to Australia and more. Better testing means we can now spot where cases are starting to spike. The warning signs are in the data with cases climbing in areas like Manchester, Trafford, Salford and Tameside. The hope is the government has acted quickly enough to suppress the virus with ""local restrictions"" before it becomes a national problem. It is now the turn of millions of people in northern England to take the hit, but these local lockdown-tightening measures could happen anywhere. This is the ""new normal"" as we buy time until a vaccine is developed. The health secretary said the move was not an attempt to curtail Eid celebrations after Miqdaad Versi, from the Muslim Council of Britain, said the restrictions were likely to have a ""large impact"" on Muslim families celebrating Eid. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the measures were announced late on Thursday night to stop the celebrations from taking place, Mr Hancock said: ""No, my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are."" Also on the Today programme, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham suggested that the rise in transmission had been caused in part by gatherings ""in multi-generational households"". Asked whether he meant predominantly the Asian population of Greater Manchester, Mr Burnham replied: ""Yes, I do mean that."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, while welcoming the measures, condemned the government's decision to announce the changeson Twitter just after 21:00 BST,externalon Thursday as ""a new low for the government's communications during this crisis"". This video can not be played After Matt Hancock appeared to contradict the new rules, Andy Burnham said it was up to the government to clear up the confusion The government published details of the new restrictions two hours after the health secretary tweeted the announcement, and then releasedfurther guidance on the changes,externalon Friday morning. Ministers have said police forces and councils will be given powers to enforce the new rules. The latest announcement in detail: People in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leicester cannot mix with other households (apart from those in their support bubbles) in private homes or gardens People in those areas can only go to pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues with other members of their household From Monday in Leicester, restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers can open but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed Cinemas and museums will also be able to open in Leicester from Monday and religious ceremonies will be able to take place The borough of Oadby and Wigston on the outskirts of Leicester is taken out of local lockdown Also, gyms and leisure centres will remain closed in Blackburn, but they will be able to reopen in Luton -both towns saw the lifting of restrictions paused last week SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Some local Conservative MPs questioned the government's decision to apply the measures to the whole of Greater Manchester, which includes 10 local authority areas - Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport,tweeted,externalthat Greater Manchester was ""not one homogeneous area"" and treating all 10 boroughs the same was ""not the right approach"". The government always warned it would slam on the brakes if it had to. Now it has - on an unprecedented scale, with two-and-a-half hours notice. Liberties recently returned, almost instantly snatched away. And snatched with a rebuke from the health secretary for England - Matt Hancock - who repeatedly said this was necessary because some in the areas affected had failed to stick to social distancing rules. I'm told the change comes without a time limit, but will be reviewed every week. And don't be surprised if the government, from the prime minister down, make the case that this could happen elsewhere too if people are cavalier about the rules. And yet, in Leicester, the local, more severe restrictions imposed there are to be eased. The baby steps back towards normality are going to be hesitant and faltering; messy in their detail and messy in their geography. The virus has robbed us of many things. It continues to rob us of any certainty. The current rules for the rest of England allow two households - up to a maximum of 30 people - to meet indoors. In Wales, indoor meetings between different households are still not allowed, but two households of any size can join up in an ""extended household"". In Northern Ireland, groups of up to 10 people from four different households can meet indoors, while in Scotland, up to eight people from three different households can meet indoors. On Thursday, a further 38 people in the UK died, bringing the total number of Covid-19 associated deaths to 45,999. And 846 cases were reported - the highest number of cases in a day for a month.

PM 'may postpone' lockdown easing in England,"The further easing of lockdown restrictions in England - due to come in this weekend - has been postponed for at least two weeks, after an increase in coronavirus cases. Casinos and bowling alleys will remain shut, as Boris Johnson said it was time to ""squeeze the brake pedal"". Face coverings will be mandatory in more indoor settings, such as cinemas. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, warned the UK may have hit its limits on easing restrictions. Appearing alongside the prime minister at a special Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said the ""idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control"" is wrong. Asked whether it was safe for England's schools to fully reopen to all pupils in the autumn, he said it was a ""difficult balancing act"" but ""we have probably reached near the limit, or the limits, of what we can do in terms of opening up society."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal"" Speaking at the briefing, Mr Johnson said planned changes to guidance for those who have been shielding during the pandemic, and advice for employers, will still go ahead. The rethink on easing England's lockdown follows new restrictions for people in parts of northern England,after a spike in virus cases. The prime minister said progress in tackling coronavirus continues, with the daily and weekly number of deaths falling, but warned that some European countries are ""struggling"" to control it. The UK must be ready to ""react"", he said. Manchester lockdown rules cause 'confusion and distress' Lockdown heightened in parts of England Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday suggestinfection rates in England are rising, with around 4,200 new infections a day- compared with 3,200 a week ago. The ONS's estimates of daily cases - based on a sample of households completing swab tests - are higher than the figures for lab-confirmed cases reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) because they include people without symptoms who would not otherwise have applied for a test. Highlighting the ONS figures, Mr Johnson added: ""The prevalence of the virus in the community, in England, is likely to be rising for the first time since May."" He said that with ""numbers creeping up"" it was time to ""squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control"". Allow Twitter content?

He urged people to ""follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance - and get a test if we have symptoms"", summing the advice up with the slogan: ""Hands, face, space, get a test"". A further120 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK,externalaccording to the latest DHSC figures, bringing the total number of virus deaths to 46,119. Meanwhile, 880 new lab-confirmed cases have been recorded. Cases in England are increasing for the first time since May. Data from the ONS suggests there are around 4,200 new infections a day compared with 3,200 a week ago. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread, and the government's scientific advisers have always warned there was not much wiggle room to lift restrictions and still suppress it. The uptick in infections is a warning we may have already passed the limit of lifting lockdown. That is why Boris Johnson has delayed some of the planned lifting of restrictions in England and face masks will become a more frequent sight. The big question remains around schools. If the current rules are leading to an increase in cases, can we open schools as well? If we open schools will we have to close something else? It is worth noting all this is happening in July and scientists suspect the virus will spread even more easily in the winter months. You can read more from Jameshere. Mr Johnson said the planned reopening of ""higher risk settings"" on 1 August would be delayed for at least a fortnight. This means that the following will not be able to take place until 15 August, at the earliest: the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services indoor performances pilots of larger gatherings in sports venuesand conference centres the expansion of wedding receptions to allow up to 30 people beauty treatmentsthat involve the face, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading treatments Fans will no longer be allowed to attend pilot sports events scheduled for this weekend in England Fans attended the World Snooker Championship when it started on Friday as part of a pilot to test the return of larger crowds to sports venues. The tournament will now go ahead without spectatorsuntil at least 15 August, which is when the final is scheduled to begin. Neil White, 51, from Chorley in Lancashire, owns a wedding photography business. Of the 44 weddings he had scheduled for this year, just three bookings remain.""I think I speak for the rest of the wedding industry in that there is a huge amount of worry and stress about the future,"" he said. Mr White said that while businesses such as pubs and restaurants in have been able to reopen, those in the wedding sector ""seem to have been brushed under the carpet"" even though they are ""itching to get back to work"". ""If it continues to next year there are a lot of businesses that are going to close,"" he added. The British Beauty Council said the changes were ""very disappointing for a sector that has already seen delay after delay in reopening"". At-a-glance: What can I do now? Separately, face coverings will be compulsory in more indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from next weekend. They are already required in shops, banks, airports and other indoor transport hubs. The prime minister saidthe rules for face coveringswould be enforceable in law from 8 August. This video can not be played Chris Whitty on lockdown easing: ""We have probably reached near the limit of what we can do"" However, he said the plan to pause shielding for those most vulnerable to the virus will go ahead from Saturday. That means some 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic can return to work, if they cannot work from home, so long as their workplace is Covid-secure. Guidance for employers will also change, as planned, from the start of August,Mr Johnson said. The latest announcement came shortly after new lockdown rules were introduced in parts of northern England, including Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and parts of West Yorkshire. The rules include a ban on separate households meeting each other inside their homes and private gardens.  How can we celebrate Eid? And other lockdown questions Lockdown rules mean 'spirit of Eid has gone' Scots warned to avoid Covid hotspots in England The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had made the ""right decision"" regarding the new rules for parts of northern England, but urged it to ""improve"" what he called ""extremely poor"" communication. Ministers have said police forces and councils will be given powers to enforce the new rules. In other key developments: Pubs and restaurants in Leicester - which saw the UK's first local lockdown -are set to reopen from Monday as a number of restrictions in the city are lifted A 14-year-old girl is being treated for a life-threatening illnessafter being ""gravely neglected"" by her family during lockdown.

Republicans to Trump: You can't delay electionTop Republicans reject the US president's suggestion that November's vote be put back.,"The president suggested postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results Top Republicans have rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that November's presidential election should be delayed over alleged fraud concerns. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy both dismissed the idea. Mr Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election, as any delay would have to be approved by Congress. Earlier, the president suggested that increased postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results. He floated a delay until people could ""properly, securely and safely"" vote. There is little evidence to support Mr Trump's claims but he has long railed against postal voting, which he has said would be susceptible to fraud. US states want to make mail-in voting easier because of public health concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Could Donald Trump delay the presidential election? Mr Trump's intervention came as new figures showed the US economy had suffered the worst contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Senator McConnell said no US presidential election had ever been delayed before. ""Never in the history of this country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time. We will find a way to do that again this November third,"" he told local Kentucky station WNKY. Mr McCarthy echoed him. ""Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election,"" he said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham meanwhile said a delay was ""not a good idea"". However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to be drawn on Mr Trump's suggestion. Quizzed by reporters on whether a president could delay an election, he said he would not ""enter a legal judgement on the fly"". The spokesman for Mr Trump's re-election campaign, Hogan Gidley, said Mr Trump had just been ""raising a question"". Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now. The president also must know that tweeting about a delay - even framed as an ""I'm just asking!"" question - is sure to ignite a political firestorm, particularly after he has repeatedly refused to say whether he'd accept an adverse result in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump appears to be doing everything in his power to undermine the credibility of November's vote, in which a record number of Americans are predicted to rely on mail-in voting to avoid the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. He's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about the reliability of the mail balloting and suggested broad conspiracy theories. Critics warn that he could be laying the groundwork for contesting the results - although the purpose may be simply to give him a scapegoat if he loses. His tweet could also be an attempt to divert attention away from the truly dismal second-quarter economic numbers just released. He's been relying on a financial turnaround to breathe life into his re-election campaign, and instead the outlook appears exceedingly gloomy. Whatever the reason, tweeting about an election delay is not the move of a candidate confident of victory - and could be a sign of more desperate moves to come. Read Anthony's full analysis At a Thursday afternoon White House news conference, Mr Trump denied he wanted to postpone the election, but argued that mass postal voting would leave the result in doubt. ""I don't want to delay, I want to have the election,"" he said. ""But I also don't want to have to wait for three months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything."" ""I don't want to see a crooked election,"" Mr Trump also told reporters. ""This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens."" In a series of tweets earlier, Mr Trump railed against mass postal voting and warned - without providing evidence - that it would be susceptible to foreign interference. Allow Twitter content?

In June, New York allowed voters to vote by post in the Democratic primary poll for the party's presidential candidate. But there have been long delays in counting the ballots and the results are still unknown. US media report that there are also concerns that many ballots will not be counted because they were not filled in correctly or do not have postmarks on them that show they were sent before voting officially ended. According to the Washington Post,external, US Postal Service workers say backlogs may delay delivery of ballots in time for November's election because of cost-cutting measures under the Trump administration. President Trump does not have the authority to move the date of the election, which by law is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Any change of date would need to be approved by both houses of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats control the House of Representatives and some have already said they will not support any delay to the vote. Any move by Congress to delay the election into 2021 would also require a constitutional amendment, US media quoted constitutional experts as saying. The week when everything changed for Trump Earlier this month, six US states were planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections in November: California, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.Other states are considering it,external, according to a postal voting campaign group. These states will automatically send postal ballots to all registered voters, which then have to be sent back or dropped off on election day - although some in-person voting is still available in certain limited circumstances. About half of US states allow any registered voter to cast their ballot by post on request. Does US postal voting lead to fraud? Does Trump have power to delay election?

Climate change 'driving UK's extreme weather',"A record-breaking temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) was recorded at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in July 2019 Climate change driven by industrial society is having an increasing impact on the UKâs weather, the Met Office says. Its annual UK report confirms that 2019 was the 12th warmest year in a series from 1884. Although it does not make the top 10, the report says 2019 was remarkable for high temperature records in the UK. There was also a severe swing in weather from the soaking winter to the sunny spring. The temperature extremes were: A new UK maximum record (38.7Â° C) on 25 July, in Cambridge A new winter maximum record (21.2Â° C) on 26 February, in Kew Gardens, London - the first time 20C has been reached in the UK in winter A new December maximum record (18.7Â° C) on 28 December, in Achfary, Sutherland A new February minimum record (13.9Â° C) on 23 February, in Achnagart, Highland No national low temperature records were set in the State of the UK Climate report, published by the Royal Meteorological Society. This video can not be played What's the difference between weather and climate? It shows that UK temperatures in 2019 were 1.1Â° C above the 1961-1990 long-term average. Mike Kendon, lead author of the report, said: âOur report shows climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK. âThis year was warmer than any other year in the UK between 1884 and 1990, and to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963.â The Central England Temperature series is the longest instrumental record of temperature in the world, stretching back to 1659. UK warned over coronavirus climate trap A really simple guide to climate change Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Dr Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, added it was a particularly wet year across parts of central and northern England. He said Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Cheshire received between a quarter to one third more rainfall than normal. For northern England this was the ninth wettest year in a series from 1862. He said: ""Itâs worth noting that since 2009 the UK has now had its wettest February, April, June, November and December on record â five out of 12 months."" Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham as days of persistent rain led to almost 50 flood warnings across England in November 2019 Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, identified a number of concerning trends. She said: ""As well as extreme hot temperatures, the stand-out weather events in 2019 were the many different types of floods, causing millions of pounds worth of damage and causing misery to many people. âThe picture that emerges is of the multiple flooding threats that are facing the UK, many of which are exacerbated by climate change."" She cited as examples summer flash floods caused by extreme downpours, extensive autumn and winter river floods caused by persistent heavy rain and storms, and a backdrop of continued sea-level rises heightening the risk of coastal floods. 'Extraordinary' heatwave could break records Summer heatwave 'death spike' seen in UK What are the factors making floods worse? Professor Ilan Kelman, from University College London, said heat would become an increasing problem. He said: ""These UK records show that if we do nothing about stopping climate change we are on track for summer heat and humidity which would be highly dangerous for us to be outdoors - and to be indoors without continual cooling.â Gareth Redmond King from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said: âThese are records we shouldnât be breaking. Tropical temperatures may be nice on occasion, but here in the UK they are a stark reminder that we are in a climate crisis. âThe whole world has to act ahead of next yearâs UN climate conference; and as hosts we must urgently raise our ambition if the UK is to show global leadership. âRight now, that means investing in a green recovery in the coming budget and spending review, for the sake of both people and planet.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external 'GUIDED BY SCIENCE':A dangerous gamble with peopleâs lives or a sound scientific approach?

Pubs to reopen in Leicester,"Restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can reopen from Monday Pubs and restaurants in Leicester are set to reopen from Monday as a number of lockdown restrictions in the city are lifted. It follows an announcement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that conditionshad been tightened in parts of northern England. He said those restrictions on household visits would also apply in Leicester. The borough of Oadby and Wigston, on the city outskirts, will be removed from lockdown from midnight. Initially the government had said it would be Monday. People living in Leicester, Oadby and Wigstonwere told to observe strict measures from 29 Juneafter a localised spike in coronavirus cases. TheDepartment of Health and Social Care said,externalrestaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can trade again from Monday but leisure centres, gyms and pools must remain closed. Cinemas and museums are also allowed to open and religious ceremonies can be held. Leicester and some neighbouring areas were told to observe strict measures from 29 June Ivan Browne, director of public health for Leicester, said the infection rate had fallen to around 55 per 100,000 people, which he said is ""a substantial drop"" from the beginning of the local lockdown, when the number was 135. He said health officials are looking to reduce the rate to below 50 ""because that's kind of an international figure"" with the further aim of ""20 or below"" by September. ""I think from there that would get us in the best position possible for winter that better reflects the national picture - below 10%,"" he said. ""That's what we're setting as our local target and we're pushing hard for that."" Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said there was ""a lot of frustration"" with how the city had been treated Leicester West MP Liz Kendall tweeted that she had spoken to Mr Hancock and called it ""great news"". ""This has been an unbelievably difficult period for our city but people's hard work and sacrifices have paid off,"" the Labour MP said. But she described the government's handling of the lockdown as ""totally shambolic"" and ""lessons must be learnt for the future to prevent others going through the same"". Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday, the mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, said city officials had been ""messed about"" by central government, and following the announcement called for ""clarity"" on what city residents can do. ""What we need is to understand what can open and when it can open, understand what we can do about meeting up with family and friends and where they can do that; and what is particularly unclear is what the travel restrictions are going to be,"" he told a news conference on Friday.

""I think people are going to be very cautious [about going out] from the beginning, because we've had so long where you can't be near people."" Rachael Bradley said the government's handling of the lockdown has been ""absolutely shambolic"" Rachael Bradley, 48, from Knighton, said: ""The way it was handled was absolutely shambolic. ""First it was midday, then 2pm, then 4pm, then finally they announced it at quarter to 10 at night. ""And Leicester was just one sentence.

Julie Jordan, from Jordan Motors on Narborough Road in Leicester, said she has been ""one of the lucky ones"" classed as an essential business and allowed to stay open.

Visiting people at home banned in parts of EnglandMillions face new lockdown rules prohibiting separate households from meeting each other at their homes.,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We take this action with a heavy heart"" Millions of people in parts of northern England are now facing new restrictions, banning separate households from meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The rules impact people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. The health secretary told the BBC the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Labour criticised the timing of the announcement - late on Thursday night. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing, which he said showed that ""most of the transmission is happening between households visiting each other, and people visiting relatives and friends"". Pubs and restaurants to reopen in Leicester Luxembourg taken off UK travel exemption list What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month. However, pubs, restaurants and other facilities will be allowed to reopen in the city from Monday, as some of the stricter measures are lifted. There is an inescapable fact here - the coronavirus has not gone away and it still thrives on close human contact. The more we come together the easier it will spread. We have seen this happen as national lockdowns have been lifted from Europe, to the US, to Australia and more. Better testing means we can now spot where cases are starting to spike. The warning signs are in the data with cases climbing in areas like Manchester, Trafford, Salford and Tameside. The hope is the government has acted quickly enough to suppress the virus with ""local restrictions"" before it becomes a national problem. It is now the turn of millions of people in northern England to take the hit, but these local lockdown-tightening measures could happen anywhere. This is the ""new normal"" as we buy time until a vaccine is developed. The health secretary said the move was not an attempt to curtail Eid celebrations after Miqdaad Versi, from the Muslim Council of Britain, said the restrictions were likely to have a ""large impact"" on Muslim families celebrating Eid. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the measures were announced late on Thursday night to stop the celebrations from taking place, Mr Hancock said: ""No, my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are."" Also on the Today programme, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham suggested that the rise in transmission had been caused in part by gatherings ""in multi-generational households"". Asked whether he meant predominantly the Asian population of Greater Manchester, Mr Burnham replied: ""Yes, I do mean that."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, while welcoming the measures, condemned the government's decision to announce the changeson Twitter just after 21:00 BST,externalon Thursday as ""a new low for the government's communications during this crisis"". This video can not be played After Matt Hancock appeared to contradict the new rules, Andy Burnham said it was up to the government to clear up the confusion The government published details of the new restrictions two hours after the health secretary tweeted the announcement, and then releasedfurther guidance on the changes,externalon Friday morning. Ministers have said police forces and councils will be given powers to enforce the new rules. The latest announcement in detail: People in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leicester cannot mix with other households (apart from those in their support bubbles) in private homes or gardens People in those areas can only go to pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues with other members of their household From Monday in Leicester, restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers can open but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed Cinemas and museums will also be able to open in Leicester from Monday and religious ceremonies will be able to take place The borough of Oadby and Wigston on the outskirts of Leicester is taken out of local lockdown Also, gyms and leisure centres will remain closed in Blackburn, but they will be able to reopen in Luton -both towns saw the lifting of restrictions paused last week SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Some local Conservative MPs questioned the government's decision to apply the measures to the whole of Greater Manchester, which includes 10 local authority areas - Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport,tweeted,externalthat Greater Manchester was ""not one homogeneous area"" and treating all 10 boroughs the same was ""not the right approach"". The government always warned it would slam on the brakes if it had to. Now it has - on an unprecedented scale, with two-and-a-half hours notice. Liberties recently returned, almost instantly snatched away. And snatched with a rebuke from the health secretary for England - Matt Hancock - who repeatedly said this was necessary because some in the areas affected had failed to stick to social distancing rules. I'm told the change comes without a time limit, but will be reviewed every week. And don't be surprised if the government, from the prime minister down, make the case that this could happen elsewhere too if people are cavalier about the rules. And yet, in Leicester, the local, more severe restrictions imposed there are to be eased. The baby steps back towards normality are going to be hesitant and faltering; messy in their detail and messy in their geography. The virus has robbed us of many things. It continues to rob us of any certainty. The current rules for the rest of England allow two households - up to a maximum of 30 people - to meet indoors. In Wales, indoor meetings between different households are still not allowed, but two households of any size can join up in an ""extended household"". In Northern Ireland, groups of up to 10 people from four different households can meet indoors, while in Scotland, up to eight people from three different households can meet indoors. On Thursday, a further 38 people in the UK died, bringing the total number of Covid-19 associated deaths to 45,999. And 846 cases were reported - the highest number of cases in a day for a month.

Prison launches take-away meal delivery service,"The Clink restaurant inside Brixton prison is now delivering take-away meals If you were ordering a take-away meal, you might not expect a prison to offer its services. But Brixton prison in south London is cooking, selling and delivering take-away meals. The intention is to keep its training restaurant functioning during the pandemic. The prison has a professional-standard restaurant, the Clink, which teaches culinary skills to prisoners - to help them get jobs when they are released. But the Covid-19 pandemic has stopped guests coming inside the prison to eat at the restaurant - and its closure took away the inmates' training. So the restaurant has turned to selling take-aways - clink@home - with meals brought to customers in the prison project's delivery van. The training is intended to allow ex-offenders to get work in high-quality restaurants The purpose of the restaurant project is to provide job skills to cut reoffending rates. Chris Moore, chief executive of the Clink charity, says switching to the take-away service allows inmates to keep training for catering qualifications. Customers in a five-mile radius can order a meal online, which will be cooked in the prison restaurant, under the supervision of chefs. After starting last week, the service has all its delivery slots booked for this week. Prison restaurant reduces risk of reoffending The Food Programme visits the Clink restaurant The restaurant is designed to teach work-related skills, leading to City and Guilds catering qualifications, with the professional menu intended to allow ex-offenders to get jobs when they are released. This also makes it an unusual take-away menu, including dishes like ""sun-dried tomato and parmesan arancini with rocket pesto"" as a starter for Â£3.95 and ""sea bream en papillote with Mediterranean vegetables and salsa verde"" as a main course for Â£9. But Mr Moore says that for the first week, the most popular take away orders have been jerk chicken and katsu curry. The Clink restaurant inside Brixton prison has not been able to serve customers in the pandemic Keeping the kitchens open for take aways gives inmates useful work and keeps up their training, says Mr Moore. ""It's investing in someone's future. ""They get a chance to get their life back on track and not be a burden on society,"" he says. ""It's giving someone a second chance."" The project, which has links with 280 employers, has been backed by research from the Ministry of Justice, which wants to reduce the Â£18bn cost to taxpayers of reoffending. Researchers for the ministry found a significant reduction in the risk of reoffending for those who had been through the Clink restaurant training.

But you can still follow the latest coronavirus updates from across the globe on theBBC News website here. I'll leave you with the prime minister's new coronavirus slogan - ""hands, face, space, get a test"". Stay safe. Coronavirus infections are rising in England, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest. A sample of households in England, excluding care homes and hospitals, were swabbed to test for current infection. The ONS says daily cases have risen from an estimated 2,800 to 4,200 since last week. However, there is not enough data to suggest a higher proportion of positive tests in any particular region. The way the public was told about new local lockdown rules coming into force in West Yorkshire was ""chaotic in the extreme"", according to one Bradford MP. Last night, health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say separate households living in areas across northern England, from midnight, would be banned from meeting each other indoors and in their gardens. The Labour MP for Bradford South, Judith Cummins, said the way people were told was ""very chaotic in the extreme"". ""If you're trying to get the public to buy in to a public health message, you need to communicate that effectively and properly with some some time for people to adjust, not a couple of hours. ""I think it's a terrible and appalling way to communicate. We're talking about people's livelihoods and people's lives. To do it with a couple of hours' notice is simply not good enough."" A comedy club boss says the government's decision not to reopen indoor performance venues is a ""huge blow"". Jessica Toomey, director of the Frog
and Bucket Comedy Club in Manchester, said the decision was a blow not just  to her club but ""the industry as a whole."" ""Weâve put in a considerable amount of time
and investment gearing up to reopen again but we have to respect the decision. ""The show will go on. The Frog will return bigger and better,"" she said.  David PittamBBC News Online Gillian Grant, a 55-year-old from Braunstone, echoed the thoughts of many residents in commenting on the confusion caused by the partial lifting of Leicester's lockdown. Pubs and restaurants in Leicester areset to reopen from Mondayas a number of lockdown restrictions in the city are lifted, but restrictions on household visits willapply in the same way as they do in parts of northern England. ""I couldn't
make heads nor tails of it last night to be honest,"" she said. ""You can go the pub and have
a drink now but can't see your family?"" Alex SmithBBC News Online Leicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton has welcomed the government's decision to take Oadby and Wigston out of lockdown from Monday, but said more work needed to be done as infection rates in the borough were ""still too high"". The borough, along with the city of Leicester, has been subject to stricter measures since 29 June and was not included when it was announced that certain suburbs would be released from the lockdown zone on 16 July. Mr Rushton said: ""The announcement signals a move towards a more normal way of life and is great news for local businesses who can open their doors and start trading again. ""The response of residents has been tremendous and the testing rate in the borough is 12 times higher than the rest of the UK â and Iâd like to thank people for heeding our call. ""Unfortunately, rates in the borough are still too high. So let's not be under any illusions - there is still work to do. If you have symptoms get a test, self-isolate if you or anyone in your home has symptoms, keep your distance and wash your hands."" PA Media The mayor of Leicester says the city has been left ""out in the dark, very frustrated and very angry"" following the government's ""shambolic""lockdown announcement. A number of Leicester lockdown restrictions will be lifted from Monday, with Oadby and Wigston set to move out of lockdown altogether. Sir Peter Soulsby described Health Secretary Matt Hancock's words as ""an inadequate response to the last four weeks of lockdown we have had to suffer"". ""Once again, it was shambolic,"" Sir Peter told a news conference on Friday. ""What the government did yesterday, I can't help but feel, was make it up as they went along and frankly that's not the way to deal with this."" The mayor also called for more clarity from the government, adding there were still unanswered questions about people meeting up with family and friends and travel restrictions. The timing ofnew coronavirus lockdown restrictions which have been introduced in parts of northern Englandwill have a major impact on Eid celebrations, an organisation representing Muslims in part of West Yorkshire has said. The restrictions, which ban separate households in areas including Calderdale, Bradford and Kirklees, from meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases, were announced last night and came into force at midnight. Yunus Lunat, from the Indian Muslim Welfare Society in Batley, has criticised what he calls a ""lack of awareness"" at the government level. He says: ""The problem for the Muslim community, certainly that I represent in Batley, with it being Eid today, is what data became available so late in the day last night for this to be announced at three hours' notice? ""Would they do this on Christmas Eve? On the government website it refers to Muslims celebrating Eid this weekend. No, we're celebrating Eid three hours after the announcement."" A woman from Manchester who has been shielding says the ""very sudden"" lockdown measures are ""disappointing"". Jenny Cooper, 36, from
Burnage, lives with Crohn's disease and has been shielding since March. It's really important to keep the vulnerable safe, but it does feel very sudden.  We were on the cusp of freedom. It's disappointing as many of us feel left behind. Jenny Cooper The governmenthas banned separate households in east Lancashire and other parts of northern Englandfrom meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The chair of the Lancashire Council of Mosques said the hastily announced restrictions were going to be ""very, very difficult"" for Muslim communities poised to celebrate Eid. Chair Rafiq Sufi said: ""I can't visit my mum and she lives across the road."" He continued: ""We've been working very hard and we've been trying so much to make sure everything's Covid-19 safe. ""We've been bombarded with texts and messages and it's really difficult for us to try and explain to people that it's a decision for our own safety, but the timing is of such concern. ""The weather's going to be fantastic today and people were expecting to have parties and meet their relatives and suddenly this restriction comes in, it's going to be very, very difficult, but we have to abide by it."" James VincentPolitical Editor, BBC Look North We knew something might
be coming - but not this... Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale in West Yorkshire have been closely watched for weeks.

That's now off the cards - indefinitely - in some parts of Yorkshire. Sam ProffittBBC News Office workers in England can soon go back to their desks - but many want to keep working remotely. According to the ONS, 30% of adults in the UK were exclusively working from home at the start of July. From 1 August, employers in England can allow staff back into offices at their own discretion when they feel it's safe to do so. But will workers want to return? James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Over the past two weeks the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. A total of 45 people have tested positive for coronavirusat the Iceland supermarket distribution centre in Swindon. The borough council confirmed the cases at the site, run by XPO Logistics, and expect the number to rise. The Unite Union says some employees, 150 of whom are self-isolating, are now afraid to return to the premises.

This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,338, NHS England said. Patients were aged between 73 and 92 years old and all but one, aged 75, had underlying health conditions. Plans to reduce the rate of coronavirus cases in Calderdale have been discussed at the highest level of government, the leader of the council says. Calderdale is one of the areas affected by new lockdown rules in parts of West Yorkshire following aspike in coronavirus cases in parts of northern England. The chief executive of Calderdale Council, Robin Tuddenham, said: ""We've been an area of concern now for a week, our neighbouring areas have been a concern a bit longer. ""We do know the rate of infection has been increasing in Calderdale and we've been talking to the government about the kind of action we might take with them and our communities to reduce the risk. ""We are concerned and we do need to get on top of this infection again,"" he added. People who pay council tax to specific councils are affected by the new local coronavirus lockdown rules, according to one West Yorkshire council. Some social media users have expressed confusion over who is affected by new rules which were brought in overnight in Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. Designed to slow the spread of the virus, separate households living in those areas have been banned from meeting each other indoors and in their gardens.

Prison launches take-away meal delivery serviceBrixton prison is taking orders for take-aways from its professional-standard training restaurant.,"The Clink restaurant inside Brixton prison is now delivering take-away meals If you were ordering a take-away meal, you might not expect a prison to offer its services. But Brixton prison in south London is cooking, selling and delivering take-away meals. The intention is to keep its training restaurant functioning during the pandemic. The prison has a professional-standard restaurant, the Clink, which teaches culinary skills to prisoners - to help them get jobs when they are released. But the Covid-19 pandemic has stopped guests coming inside the prison to eat at the restaurant - and its closure took away the inmates' training. So the restaurant has turned to selling take-aways - clink@home - with meals brought to customers in the prison project's delivery van. The training is intended to allow ex-offenders to get work in high-quality restaurants The purpose of the restaurant project is to provide job skills to cut reoffending rates. Chris Moore, chief executive of the Clink charity, says switching to the take-away service allows inmates to keep training for catering qualifications. Customers in a five-mile radius can order a meal online, which will be cooked in the prison restaurant, under the supervision of chefs. After starting last week, the service has all its delivery slots booked for this week. Prison restaurant reduces risk of reoffending The Food Programme visits the Clink restaurant The restaurant is designed to teach work-related skills, leading to City and Guilds catering qualifications, with the professional menu intended to allow ex-offenders to get jobs when they are released. This also makes it an unusual take-away menu, including dishes like ""sun-dried tomato and parmesan arancini with rocket pesto"" as a starter for Â£3.95 and ""sea bream en papillote with Mediterranean vegetables and salsa verde"" as a main course for Â£9. But Mr Moore says that for the first week, the most popular take away orders have been jerk chicken and katsu curry. The Clink restaurant inside Brixton prison has not been able to serve customers in the pandemic Keeping the kitchens open for take aways gives inmates useful work and keeps up their training, says Mr Moore. ""It's investing in someone's future. ""They get a chance to get their life back on track and not be a burden on society,"" he says. ""It's giving someone a second chance."" The project, which has links with 280 employers, has been backed by research from the Ministry of Justice, which wants to reduce the Â£18bn cost to taxpayers of reoffending. Researchers for the ministry found a significant reduction in the risk of reoffending for those who had been through the Clink restaurant training.

BA owner says demand will not recover until 2023,"This video can not be played Willie Walsh said the impact of the pandemic had led to unprecedented levels of disruption in the air industry The boss of British Airways owner IAG says the coronavirus pandemic has hit it harder than anything before. Willie Walsh told the BBC: ""These are extreme times. BA has lost more in a quarter than a record loss for a year."" IAG reported a loss of â¬4.2bn (Â£3.8bn) for the first half of the year, and Mr Walsh said it would take until at least 2023 for passenger levels to recover. Passenger numbers fell 98% in the April-to-June period, and the airline group is planning to cut jobs. Losses for BA outstrip those made in both the credit crisis of 2008 and following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The loss for the second quarter of the year was Â£711m, compared with Â£187m in 2001 and Â£309m after the financial crisis. Airlines call for joint US-EU virus testing scheme IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it planned to raise â¬2.75bn and had support for this from its main shareholder, Qatar Airways. However, shares in IAG were down 7% in morning trading at 167p. BA employs about 45,000 staff and has more than half of these on furlough. Earlier this year it said it was planning to cut up to 12,000 jobs, and the airline is facingthe threat of strike actionby staff whose jobs are under threat. However, Mr Walsh suggested that the job cuts might not be as steep as previously indicated. He told the BBC: ""We are in consultation with the trade unions. We want them to work with us to try to mitigate the measures that we have to take. ""That figure of 12,000 is the maximum that would be required, I would hope that it will be significantly lower than that."" Mr Walsh said: ""The industry will recover from this crisis, though we do not expect this to be before 2023, and there will be opportunities for IAG to capitalise on its strength and leadership positions."" He added that business had begun to pick up as guidance on travel abroad was loosened: ""We have seen evidence that demand recovers when government restrictions are lifted."" But he said the industry would never be the same again: ""Anyone who believes that this is just a temporary downturn and therefore can be fixed with temporary measures, I'm afraid seriously misjudges what the industry is going through. ""This will represent a structurally changed industry and that's why we've taken the action that we've taken and that's why we believe now the the right time to raise additional capital."" Willie Walsh calls this by far the biggest crisis the aviation industry has ever faced - and the figures are certainly eye-watering. If planes can't fly, airlines have no way to make money - yet they still have high costs to cope with. That's why IAG has lost billions over the past few months. It's also the reason IAG and other carriers are desperate for governments to find ways of allowing as many people to travel as possible without needing to quarantine themselves afterwards. They need traffic to recover. IAG also has other problems to contend with. Mr Walsh says the company has no option but to cut thousands of jobs at BA - and pay many of those who remain a lot less. But the company's approach has alienated a large portion of the workforce, and caused a deep rift between staff and management. It now faces the possibility of industrial action - at a time when it really needs to be luring back customers, who may already be nervous of travelling. Mr Walsh said customers with pre-existing bookings were continuing to fly to and from Spain, despite the government's change to guidance advising against non-essential travel to the country and the re-imposition of quarantine for people returning. Some IAG airline passengers are still chasing refunds for cancelled flights. A Civil Aviation Authority review of airlines' performance on refunds said on Thursday that test calls to BA terminated after a recorded message had played out. Mr Walsh told the BBC: ""It's important for us to acknowledge we have disappointed people. We've not been able to refund people as quickly as we would like."" He said the company had paid out Â£1.1bn in refunds and that it aimed to speed up the repayments process so people would receive refunds within seven days of applying. But he said it was a complex process, and much of it had to be done manually. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the results showed the scale of the challenge for IAG: ""While the uncertainty continues, IAG will have more difficult decisions to make and it would be no of surprise if the cut of 12,000 BA employees was just the start. ""With mixed messages on international travel, it will be difficult to convince most to start travelling again any time soon. For now, IAG needs to weather the storm and wait for clearer skies if it's going to stand any chance of recovery.""

for tuning into our coverage today. We'll be back on Saturday with more updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Our
team updating you throughout the day were: Thom Poole, Justin
Parkinson, Jennifer Scott, Joshua Nevett, Joseph Lee, Dulcie Lee, Martha
Buckley, Krutika Pathi, Jo Couzens and Sophie Williams. Hereâs an update on the latest developments in the UK and around the world today: A couple marry in Belfast, where wedding celebrations with as many as 10 people are allowed outdoors Wedding ceremonies or
civil partnerships with as many as 30 guests have been allowed since 4 July in
England but anexpected
relaxation in restrictions to allow the same number of people to attend wedding
receptions has been put back until 15 Augustâ at the earliest. Weddings had been banned
under almost all circumstances since lockdown began on 23 March, prompting
73,600 marriages and same-sex civil partnership ceremonies to be postponed. Northern Ireland has allowed outdoors weddings with 10 people
presentsince early June.WalesandScotlandalso now allow wedding ceremonies to take place, but
social distancing must be observed and big gatherings are not allowed. Wedding photographer, Neil White, from
Chorley, Lancashire, says he was booked to do 44 weddings this year â but now heâs down to three. He told the BBC:  âA lot has been mentioned, quite rightly, about the grief of couples not
able to enjoy their day and the struggles of cancelling or postponing. However,
the wedding industry and its suppliers are taking a huge hit right now, when we
should be enjoying peak season. âWhile many other
industries have been allowed to open, such as pubs and restaurants, the wedding
industry at large has not been given any directives for its future. We seem to
have been forgotten.â He said the longer it
goes on, many venues and suppliers will lose their livelihoods, adding that the
future of the industry is âbleakâ. Fewer than half of adults spending time with family and
friends are sticking tosocial distancing rules when they
meet up, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. Almost three-quarters of adults polled said they'd socialised with others during the last
seven days - with 50% welcoming family or friends into their homes, it said. Of the 1,150 people who reported socialising, 47% said they
had maintained social distancing  - rising to 70% of
those aged 70 and over. Three in 10 (31%) said they often followed the measures, 13%
said they sometimes did and 8% said they rarely or never followed social
distancing. More than a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said they had met up with between
five to 10 people, while 6% said the group had been larger than 10. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""households gathering
and not abiding by the social distancing rules"" was one of the reasons for the stricter rules announced late on Thursday for some parts of England. The ONS also found that 63% of respondents strongly supported targeted lockdown measures to stop the rise of the virus and 57% were in favour of mandatory face
coverings in shops and supermarkets. Cases around the globe rose by 292,527 on Friday Friday has seen a record daily global increase in coronavirus cases, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). The
one-day total rose by 292,527 - up from the previous record daily increase of 284,196 on 24
July. Deaths
on Friday rose by 6,812, according to a daily report. The countries
reporting the largest increases were the US, Brazil, India and South Africa. Guidance saying people with serious medical conditions should stay at home is coming to an end Since March, as many as 2.2m in England with medical conditions that make them ""extremely vulnerable"" have been taking the most extreme measures of self-isolation. Only earlier this month did the government say it was safe for them to leave the house at all. That is due to end tomorrow, with the government ""pausing"" the guidance on shielding. Under the new rules, the government says these people can go to work as long as their workplace meets its Covid-secure standards -  but they should still work from home if they can. Children who are clinically extremely vulnerable can attend school or college in line with the broader plans to reopen educational institutions. But while people who had been shielding can go out, they are advised to keep social interactions low and to maintain social distancing carefully. The end of the shielding guidance also means the end of extra support for extremely vulnerable groups, such as free food parcels and medicine deliveries.

has confirmed 1,525 new cases, the biggest rise since the lockdown was lifted there
last month. It
is the third day in a row that new cases have exceeded 1,000. More
than half of these recent infections are from Aragon and Madrid,according
to El Pais.,external More
than 28,000 people have died in Spain and more than 285,000 cases have been confirmed
since the outbreak began. There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and around 46,000 people have died, according to government figures. However, these numbers only include people who tested positive for the virus and subsequently died. The actual death toll is higher. We take a look
at some of the key figures of the pandemic in the UK- estimates of the
death toll and number of cases. You can also find out more about cases in your area using our

on a Norwegian cruise ship, MS Roald Amundsen, tested positive for Covid-19 and
are now in hospital. The ship is docked in Tromsoe, northern Norway. All 160 quarantined
crew will be tested and the 177 passengers, who have disembarked, have been
urged to self-isolate. The ship, owned by Norwegian firm Hurtigruten,
had been on a week-long voyage to Svalbard in the Arctic. It is scheduled to visit
ports in England and Scotland in September, Reuters reports. In March, Hurtigruten suspended most cruises
because of the pandemic, but it plans to return 14 vessels to service by the
end of September. Early in the pandemic thousands of
passengers were stranded aboard cruise ships in Asian and US waters because of
coronavirus outbreaks onboard. Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens New restrictions affecting millions ofpeople in
parts of northern England have come just as Muslim communities prepare to
celebrate Eidthis weekend. Ash Mohammed, from Hale in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, had been due to meet his siblings in his brother's garden today to celebrate the festival. His sister is driving up from Cardiff and now ""doesn't know whether to turn around or not"". He told the BBC: ""A lot of families were planning to get together. Some sort of warning would have been helpful. ""It's akin to someone saying on Christmas Eve that you can't see your family on Christmas Day. As far as I understand, 20 of us could go to Wetherspoons if we wanted to but a Muslim family can't sit in their garden."" He added that, while no one wanted a second wave, it wasn't as though Eid has been sprung on Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson. ""They could have given us some warning a week ago to say the data is going the wrong way and these restrictions might have to be brought in,"" he said. Vietnam had been proud of its zero death toll Vietnam
has recorded its second Covid-related death, just hours after it recorded its
first. The
fatality was said to be a 61-year-old dialysis patient in Da Nang, the
epicentre of the outbreak there. No
new infections had been reported for more than three months before an outbreak
was reported in the resort town. Itâs
a devastating blow to the country which had been proud of its zero death toll. Vietnam acted before it even had confirmed cases, closing its borders early to almost all travellers, except returning citizens. Anyone entering the country must quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing. Earlier
today the country reported 37 new cases, according to local media. Scientific advisers say for schools to open fully, other measures may need to be tightened At the Downing Street briefing earlier, UK Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty warned that ""the idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong"" - meaning the country faced some ""very, very difficult choices"". Newly released papers from the Sage advisory group reveal a bit more about the scientific thinking, suggesting experts believe there is a trade-off between opening schools and opening other areas of society. On 23 June, scientists said coronavirus measures might need to be changed at the end of summer to keep the R number below 1 - a level at which the epidemic is not growing - while still reopening schools. On 9 July, they said the spread of the virus from children to adults ""appears to be low"" but stressed there needed to be ""enough âroomâ in terms of the epidemic to open schools"". They also warned that areas seeing coronavirus restrictions reimposed - such as parts of northern England today - might not respond in the same way as they did when lockdown was first introduced, due to changing levels of trust, fear and anger. Ryanair claims Ireland's travel restrictions are unlawful Ryanair
says it has launched legal proceedings against the Irish government over its
travel restrictions. Currently,
Ireland has a âgreen listâ of countries in which a 14-day quarantine rule does
not apply. However Britain, France and Spain are not on this list. Ryanair
claims the restrictions are unlawful. It is calling for a review of the list and claims that the Irish parliament was not given the opportunity to scrutinise
it.. The
airline claims the list has been detrimental to its business. It
comes after Ryanair, British Airways and easyJet launched a similar challenge
against the British government, however this was ended after a 14-day quarantine
rule for travellers coming from many tourist spots such as France and Greece
was scrapped. There are currently 50 people in isolation in the country Iceland
has re-introduced restrictions on public gatherings after two infection
clusters were confirmed. Under
the new rules, public gatherings are limited to 100 people and a two-metre
social distancing rule has been re-imposed. It
comes after Icelanders were told that social gatherings of 1,000 people were
allowed and social distancing would become optional from 25 May. Iceland
avoided a full lockdown, choosing to impose social distancing and close schools
and some businesses. According
to the governmentâs Covid website, there are currently 50 people in isolation. A
total of 1,885 cases have been confirmed and 10 people have died since the
pandemic began. Tests on a random sample of the population in England suggest infections are increasing Coronavirus infections in England have risen from an estimated 2,800 to 4,200 since last week,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest. A sample of households in England, excluding care homes and hospitals, were swabbed to test for current infection. However there is not enough data to suggest a higher proportion of positive tests in any particular region. Despite the ONS figures suggesting a rise in infections, the official estimate of the virus's reproduction or R number (a measure of whether cases are rising or falling) for England was between 0.8 and 1 as of 31 July. An R number below one indicates the number of infections is shrinking. It's calculated using a range of different measures, including hospital admissions and deaths. Because it takes more time for someone to end up in hospital due to an infection, it's possible the latest estimate of R isn't capturing more recent upticks in infection. People who should be isolating have been leaving their houses, according to Victoria's premier One
in four people who tested positive for coronavirus in Australiaâs state of
Victoria were not at home when authorities came to check up on them. Victoria
Premier Andrew Daniels said 130 unsuccessful visits had been made to people who should have been in quarantine over the past 24 hours. Last
week, the Victorian government said sick people breaking isolation rules â or not
getting tested in time â was leading to continued spread despite lockdown
measures. Victoria
recorded 623 cases on Friday and eight deaths. Those
who were not at home will receive a follow up from police andcould
face a fine,external, according to Channel 9 News. The socially-distanced reopening of indoor theatre and music venues in England has been delayed until at least 15 August, Boris Johnson announced today. The easing of restrictions had been due to start this weekend but has been postponed amid concerns over a rise in virus cases. Face coverings will also be required in additional settings including museums, galleries and cinemas - enforceable in law from 8 August. Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust, said ""most theatres will not be able to put on productions until we reach stage five [of the roadmap for the return of professional performing arts], which allows fuller audiences, so that is the most critical date for much of the sector"". Read more here James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys. It will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Two weeks ago, Boris Johnson was setting out plansfor normality by Christmas. But since then the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, when there were an estimated 100,000 infections every day, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread. The uptick in infections is a warning that we are passing the limits of lifting lockdown. Read more Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst For three days running, China has recorded more than 100 new cases of Covid-19. In the last 24 hours, 127 cases have been recorded, including 112 in north-west Xinjiang, and 11 in north-east Liaoning province. For eight consecutive days, the number of cases has grown in China, meaning that official media have urged people nationwide not to relax vigilance: to wear a mask and avoid gatherings. But there is limited concern about either of the outbreaks in Xinjiang or Liaoning leading to a second wave in the country. China has experienced a number of localised outbreaks since the beginning of the year â including in the capital Beijing â and media have lauded the co-operation of the public with swift self-isolation procedures, and their willingness to be tested, in keeping the virus under control. Currently, in Xinjiangâs Urumqi and Liaoningâs Dalian, communities where people have tested positive have gone into full lockdown. Other residents have taken advantage of free testing that has been made available to them in public areas with a lot of space. Over the next few days, medical staff will finalise testing 3.5 million people in Urumqi, and six million in Dalian. A further 120 deaths have been recorded in the UK, bringing the total number of people who have died after a positive Covid-19 test to 46,119. There were another 880 cases confirmed by testing in the last 24 hours. The figure for deaths may be different from the sum of newly reported deaths for the four nations, because the UK-wide figure is calculated on a different time frame and includes deaths in all settings, not just hospitals. The government has also launched a review of the UK death figures, over concerns that England may be wrongly including deaths which took place months after the person tested positive for the virus.

"Universal Credit failing millions, say peersLords blame the design of the benefit payment for ""soaring rent arrears and use of food banks"".UK Politics","Universal Credit is ""failing millions of people"", especially the vulnerable, according to a new report from peers.

They also called for a non-repayable two-week grant to be introduced to cut the current five-week wait for a claimant's first payment.

Prison launches take-away meal deliveries,"The Clink restaurant inside Brixton prison is now delivering take-away meals If you were ordering a take-away meal, you might not expect a prison to offer its services. But Brixton prison in south London is cooking, selling and delivering take-away meals. The intention is to keep its training restaurant functioning during the pandemic. The prison has a professional-standard restaurant, the Clink, which teaches culinary skills to prisoners - to help them get jobs when they are released. But the Covid-19 pandemic has stopped guests coming inside the prison to eat at the restaurant - and its closure took away the inmates' training. So the restaurant has turned to selling take-aways - clink@home - with meals brought to customers in the prison project's delivery van. The training is intended to allow ex-offenders to get work in high-quality restaurants The purpose of the restaurant project is to provide job skills to cut reoffending rates. Chris Moore, chief executive of the Clink charity, says switching to the take-away service allows inmates to keep training for catering qualifications. Customers in a five-mile radius can order a meal online, which will be cooked in the prison restaurant, under the supervision of chefs. After starting last week, the service has all its delivery slots booked for this week. Prison restaurant reduces risk of reoffending The Food Programme visits the Clink restaurant The restaurant is designed to teach work-related skills, leading to City and Guilds catering qualifications, with the professional menu intended to allow ex-offenders to get jobs when they are released. This also makes it an unusual take-away menu, including dishes like ""sun-dried tomato and parmesan arancini with rocket pesto"" as a starter for Â£3.95 and ""sea bream en papillote with Mediterranean vegetables and salsa verde"" as a main course for Â£9. But Mr Moore says that for the first week, the most popular take away orders have been jerk chicken and katsu curry. The Clink restaurant inside Brixton prison has not been able to serve customers in the pandemic Keeping the kitchens open for take aways gives inmates useful work and keeps up their training, says Mr Moore. ""It's investing in someone's future. ""They get a chance to get their life back on track and not be a burden on society,"" he says. ""It's giving someone a second chance."" The project, which has links with 280 employers, has been backed by research from the Ministry of Justice, which wants to reduce the Â£18bn cost to taxpayers of reoffending. Researchers for the ministry found a significant reduction in the risk of reoffending for those who had been through the Clink restaurant training.

Will people be rushing back to the gym?,"Gyms have been preparing to reopen by sectioning off equipment to encourage social distancing On Saturday gyms in England will be opening their doors for the first time in four months. But with the rise of online workouts and outdoor exercise during lockdown, will people be rushing to go back? For Lee Chambers keeping fit without the gym has been a struggle. The 35-year-old from Preston has an autoimmune condition which weakened his joints and just six years ago left him unable to walk. He says access to the specialist equipment at gyms has been crucial to his recovery - both mentally and physically. Normally he would go three times a week and can't wait to return. While he's tried home workouts - his wife's handbag weighed down with cans has doubled up as a kettlebell and his children's swing frame has been used for pull-ups - it hasn't quite been the same. How gyms are working out social-distancing rules Half of leisure centres could close, warns trade body As well as being able to use adjustable weights equipment to strengthen the muscles around his joints, Lee says the gym also helps him switch off from the stresses of his work and home life. ""I don't take my phone in - the only inputs and stimulus I have are training my body,"" he says. ""It's almost cathartic because it's just me on my own, pushing my own boundaries. There's no other distractions."" Lee enjoys using the weight machines at his gym Others have missed the social aspect of exercising together. Two years ago, Karen Webber set herself the goal of getting fit before she turned 40. She had never been a sporty person before but after joining her local gym in Stockport she enjoyed being part of a community and meeting new people. ""Being able to exercise with people who share your motivations and encourage you, there's something really powerful in that,"" she says. When lockdown started, like many others, Karen's gym immediately switched to online classes, putting on several sessions a day and loaning equipment to members. There were also monthly challenges, virtual family sports days and even workouts in the gym's car park. Karen's gym, Seven Movement in Stockport, put on outdoor classes when restrictions allowed However, Karen says she still missed the atmosphere of the gym and the motivation it gave her. ""It's very easy when you're slightly off screen or you're not doing a live class to just not go as hard as you would normally,"" she says. ""When you're in the gym you can't get away with just leaving the class when you're tired. "" Karen admits she is still a little apprehensive about returning - she hasn't been indoors with anyone except her family since March. She'll be easing herself in with a weightlifting class on Monday and will stick to online cardio sessions for now, worried about the virus spreading through heavy breathing. Karen switched to online workouts during lockdown Many gyms and personal trainers - including Karen's - are continuing to offer online classes for those who don't yet feel ready to return. But this hasn't been enough to stop some people cancelling their memberships. The Gym Group, one of the UK's biggest companies in this sector,says it has lost about a fifth of its members during lockdown, despite halting payments. Lisa Collins, who used to go to the gym four or five times a week, is one of those who won't be renewing her subscription. Fees had been suspended during lockdown but when her gym emailed to say they would restart in August, she felt it was just too soon. ""Suddenly going into a gym with hundreds of people going in and out feels a bit terrifying,"" the 49-year-old says. Lisa has used a mixture of YouTube videos and live workout classes to keep fit at home But even without the safety concerns, Lisa isn't sure she can still justify the monthly membership fee. ""My life has changed so much since lockdown,"" she says. ""Before I would drop the kids off at school, go to the gym, shower and go out to work. ""But now I'm not out and about as much it just feels so much easier to roll out of bed, put my gym kit on and join a Zoom yoga session instead."" Lisa has enjoyed the flexibility of online classes, where she can pay per session rather than through a monthly subscription. There's also no longer the risk of classes being booked up. Even before lockdown she says it was difficult to get a slot at her local gym but now, with many centres reducing class sizes, it will be even harder. This video can not be played An induction to post-lockdown gyms For Lee, however, the new requirement to book before visiting his gym is appealing - and it's one of the reasons why he's reassured enough to return, along with the extra cleaning measures in place. The limits on numbers will mean the equipment he wants to use is more likely to be available, as well as enabling social distancing. ""It's going to be more hygienic than it's ever been before,"" he says. ""So it's got to the point for me now where the benefits just about outweigh the risks."" Gyms will have to follow strict social distancing guidelines, including: Capacity limits, controlled by a timed booking system Reduced class sizes Equipment spaced out and improved ventilation Temporary floor markings in dance studios where possible Customers encouraged to shower and change at home Indoor gyms are already open in Northern Ireland but no reopening date has been set yet for Scotland or Wales.

One in 10 adults in Wales have said they would not want to be vaccinated against coronavirus if a jab became available. A survey from NHS Wales and Public Health Wales (PHW) said 83% of people would
want to be protected against Covid-19 if a vaccine became available while 10% would not and 7% are unsure. Among those with children, 8% of parents polled wouldn't want their children to be vaccinated while 78% said they would allow their children to have a jab. There is currently no Covid-19 vaccine
available, but PHW says Wales is playing an ""important role in vaccine trials"" in the UK. The survey, which polled 604 people, found nearly
half - 44% of people - said they had come within one
metre with at least three people from outside their household or extended
household in the last seven days. âThere is a huge amount of work under way to
try and develop a vaccine against Covid-19,"" said Prof Karen Hughes, of Public Health Wales. ""It is very positive to see that
more than eight out of 10 people in Wales would want to be vaccinated if such a
vaccine did become available."" British Transport Police Wales is reminding people using trains this weekend to wear face coverings. On Monday, three-layer face coverings became mandatory on all public transport in Wales - buses, trains, and taxis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnnson says the rules on face coverings in England will be extended ""to other indoor settings where you're likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship"". ""We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings and this will become enforceable in law from the 8 August,"" he says. However, this will not apply in Wales. On Monday, three-layer face coverings became mandatory on all public transport in Wales - buses, trains, and taxis. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has remained firm on face coverings for shopping or other activities - it is not happening in Wales. ""The advice of the Welsh Government is that if places are crowded then face coverings are advisory. Where places are not crowded, it is a matter for the individual citizen to make that decision,"" he has said. Four more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales (PHW). It means the number of people who have died with the virus has increased to 1,560. A further 26 new cases of Covid-19 were reported by PHW, meaning 17,258 people have now tested positive for the illness in Wales. According to PHW, 5,491 tests were carried out in the last day in both PHW and non-NHS laboratories. Part of the reason for relaxing lockdown restrictions in Wales is to allow people to make the most of the outdoors âwhile we can,â the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said the situation would be assessed again in the autumn ahead of a period where coronavirus could âthriveâ. Speaking at his weekly briefing, Mr Drakeford said: âThe summer weeks are going through our fingers. ""We still have the whole of August and with a bit of luck most of September in which people will be able to enjoy the outdoors. ""Part of the reason for relaxing some of those restrictions today is to allow people to make more use of that time while we can. ""We will then have to assess in the autumn, when we know we are heading into the time of year - the cold, the dark, the damp - all those conditions that coronavirus thrives in. ""And it will then be incumbent on us all, when we aren't able to be outside as much, to behave inside in a way that mitigates the additional risks that we will all be facing"" It is only possible to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales because of the public's ""willingness to stick with this difficult journey,"" Mr Drakeford says. He said it meant Wales was able to ""go on reopening our economy and finding new opportunities for friends and families to meet, while those opportunities are being closed down in other parts of the United Kingdom"". He rejected a suggestion that a substantial number of people were using the good weather as an excuse to ignore social distancing rules. He said: âIt is perfectly possible to have quite a large number of people in a large park in Cardiff, for example, still observing social distancing. ""So I don't think just the fact that there's a large number of people, means that people are not behaving in the right way. ""But I'm very happy to repeat the message, that despite the fact that coronavirus continues to fall in Wales, none of that is a reason for people not to go on doing all the right things.â Coronavirus cases could rise again rapidly, First Minister Mark Drakeford warned. ""This is a virus where we can go from a position, as we are in Wales today, where the virus is at its lowest ebb and still declining,"" he told his weekly briefing. ""And in a very short number of weeks that position can be transformed, so nobody should think that we are immune from some of the difficulties others are experiencing.â He said the situation in thenorth-west of Englandwould not lead to north and south Wales having different Covid-19 restrictions. âI donât anticipate in a blanket way a different regime for the north of Wales and the south of Wales,"" Mr Drakeford. ""If there are local flare ups we will mobilise our public health effort, our test, trace protect system to bear down on those outbreaks, as we have shown we can to successfully in Anglesey and in Merthyr Tydfil over recent weeks.â Travel restrictions could be reintroduced to control future flare-ups of the virus but ""would be targeted to where we think they would be necessary"", Mr Drakeford says. He said: âWe continue to be willing, were the facts to justify it, to think
about local lockdowns where there are flare ups with considerable community
transmission. ""And if we were to require local lockdowns in Wales, then 'stay
local' might become part of the message... âSo travel restrictions in that sense,
are still part of the repertoire that we could draw on."" Mr Drakeford urged people in Wales to âthink
carefullyâ as lockdown restrictions are eased
further. He said people should take advantage of the outdoors at this time of year but they should âabide by the rulesâ. He also said local authorities would be given stronger enforcement powers âto be able to
take quick and decisive actionâ against businesses flouting the rules. âI am hugely impressed by the efforts I see individual
businesses making to make sure that their premises are properly safe and secure
as far as coronavirus is concerned,"" he said. âAnd we want to support those businesses that are doing
the right thing - they're putting time, energy, money no doubt into making
their premises safe for people to visit. âAnd one of the ways we can support those businesses, is
to take more decisive action in that small minority of cases where it is clear
that those things are not being done."" He said he would ""strengthen the enforcement powers
of local authorities to be able to take quick and decisive action where we come
across instances of people not being prepared to abide by the rules that we
have agreed with that sector"". He said the rules had been drawn up in consultation
with people who represent businesses.   People from outside Wales are âwelcomeâ into the country during the summer holidays, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. That is despiteadvice from the Scottish Governmentfor areas in the north west of England affected by changes to lockdown not to travel to Scotland - and vice versa. But the Welsh Government is not offering similar advice. âMy advice to people who travel across our very permeable border, travelling into England and into Wales, is simply that if you come to Wales, please help us to keep Wales safe,"" Mr Drakeford told his weekly press conference. He called for visitors âto maintain the social distance, make sure you wash your hands, if you're using shared facilities do so carefully and consciously, because in that way we can go on keeping Wales safe and open for everybody to enjoy.â He said he had discussed the measures in the north west of England with the Prime Minister Boris Johnson this morning. He saidEngland's moveâby and large brings the position there into line with the position that we already have here in Walesâ. Newcoronavirus restrictions in the northern Englandhave given First Minister Mark
Drakeford ""pause for thought"" before easing the rules further in Wales, he
admitted today. Mr Drakeford is
looking at how people can meet more of their family and friends indoors, possibly
as soon as 15 August. At present, people can
only form an extended or ""bubble"" household with one other household. But Mr Drakeford said
evidence suggested increased indoor contact was risky as it could lead to more
cases of the virus. âThis
is one of the most difficult areas from a public health perspective because as
people have more contact with one another indoors, the risk of transmission
increases,â he said. âMore
than half of the cases our contract tracers identified in July in north Wales
were linked to household contacts. âToday,
we have seen indoor meetings curtailed in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire
and parts of West Yorkshire following a spike in coronavirus cases there too. âAll of this is bound
to give us pause for thought.â He
also stressed that action would be taken against the âsmall minorityâ of
businesses or individuals who are breaking the rules. âIgnoring
the guidance cannot be an option â we have legal powers, which allow us and
others to take action if some peopleâs behaviour becomes a threat to other
peopleâs health,â he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford has thanked the Welsh public for ""everything you
     have done to reduce the spread of coronavirus"" which has allowed him to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales. While UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has""put the brakes on"" lockdown restrictions being eased in England, in Wales some restrictions are to be lifted on Monday. From Monday, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales can reopen indoors, up to 30 people can meet outdoors, children under 11 won't have to socially distance and licensed weddings can start again. ""The virus is
     continuing to decline in Wales and we can once again, carefully and
     cautiously, go on lifting the lockdown,"" Mr Drakeford told his weekly briefing. ""But coronavirus has not
     gone away. This pandemic will not be over by Christmas. That is why is so important that we all protecting one another from the virus."" British Airways owner IAG has said it willtake until at least 2023 for
passenger levels to recoverfrom the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, posted a â¬4.2bn (Â£3.8bn) loss in the first half of the year as demand collapsed. Passenger numbers fell 98% in the April-to-June period, and the group is planning to cut jobs. IAG said it planned to raise â¬2.75bn, and had support for this from its main shareholder, Qatar Airways. However, shares in IAG, which also owns Spain's Iberia, fell 6% to 170p in early trading on Friday. BA employs about 45,000 staff and has more than half of these on furlough. It is planning to cut up to 12,000 jobs and is facingthe threat of strike actionby staff whose jobs are under threat.

Orders allowing alcohol to be confiscated and fines issued could be imposed by a Welsh council, following disorder on beaches and in parks. The Vale of Glamorgan council said it is considering the measures after incidents, including a mass brawl at Ogmore-by-Sea. It comes after police in other parts of Waleswere forced to issue dispersal orders to combat anti-social behaviour. The latest measures in the Valewould affect six areas, including Ogmore,external. With warm weather and sunshine expected for much of Friday and Saturday, large crowds are expected to head for Welsh beaches. The Vale's deputy leader Lis Burnett said police estimated between 20,000 and 25,000 were on Barry Island on Thursday, with large crowds anticipated over the coming days. South Wales Police had to issue a dispersal order there last week after a series of disturbances in the town. ""We want a suite of measures available to us that both we and the police working together can enforce, to make sure that we can clamp down on anti-social behaviour in mass gatherings,"" added Ms Burnett. Warm weather means crowds have been flocking to places such as Barry Island Mark HutchingsBBC Wales parliamentary correspondent Iâm told that the prime minister held a four-nation call with the first ministers this morning at his instigation.

Home visits banned in parts of northern England,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We take this action with a heavy heart"" Millions of people in parts of northern England are now facing new restrictions, banning separate households from meeting each other at home after a spike in Covid-19 cases. The rules impact people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. The health secretary told the BBC the increase in transmission was due to people visiting friends and relatives. Labour criticised the timing of the announcement - late on Thursday night. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government had taken ""targeted"" action based on information gathered from contact tracing, which he said showed that ""most of the transmission is happening between households visiting each other, and people visiting relatives and friends"". Pubs and restaurants to reopen in Leicester Luxembourg taken off UK travel exemption list What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? The new lockdown rules, which came into force at midnight, mean people from different households will not be allowed to meet in homes or private gardens. They also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs and restaurants, although individual households will still be able to visit such hospitality venues. The changes come as Muslim communities prepare to celebrate Eid this weekend, and nearly four weeks after restrictions were eased across England - allowing people to meet indoors for the first time since late March. The same restrictions will apply in Leicester, where a local lockdown has been in place for the last month. However, pubs, restaurants and other facilities will be allowed to reopen in the city from Monday, as some of the stricter measures are lifted. There is an inescapable fact here - the coronavirus has not gone away and it still thrives on close human contact. The more we come together the easier it will spread. We have seen this happen as national lockdowns have been lifted from Europe, to the US, to Australia and more. Better testing means we can now spot where cases are starting to spike. The warning signs are in the data with cases climbing in areas like Manchester, Trafford, Salford and Tameside. The hope is the government has acted quickly enough to suppress the virus with ""local restrictions"" before it becomes a national problem. It is now the turn of millions of people in northern England to take the hit, but these local lockdown-tightening measures could happen anywhere. This is the ""new normal"" as we buy time until a vaccine is developed. The health secretary said the move was not an attempt to curtail Eid celebrations after Miqdaad Versi, from the Muslim Council of Britain, said the restrictions were likely to have a ""large impact"" on Muslim families celebrating Eid. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the measures were announced late on Thursday night to stop the celebrations from taking place, Mr Hancock said: ""No, my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are."" Also on the Today programme, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham suggested that the rise in transmission had been caused in part by gatherings ""in multi-generational households"". Asked whether he meant predominantly the Asian population of Greater Manchester, Mr Burnham replied: ""Yes, I do mean that."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, while welcoming the measures, condemned the government's decision to announce the changeson Twitter just after 21:00 BST,externalon Thursday as ""a new low for the government's communications during this crisis"". This video can not be played After Matt Hancock appeared to contradict the new rules, Andy Burnham said it was up to the government to clear up the confusion The government published details of the new restrictions two hours after the health secretary tweeted the announcement, and then releasedfurther guidance on the changes,externalon Friday morning.

The latest announcement in detail: People in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leicester cannot mix with other households (apart from those in their support bubbles) in private homes or gardens People in those areas can only go to pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues with other members of their household From Monday in Leicester, restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers can open but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed Cinemas and museums will also be able to open in Leicester from Monday and religious ceremonies will be able to take place The borough of Oadby and Wigston on the outskirts of Leicester is taken out of local lockdown Also, gyms and leisure centres will remain closed in Blackburn, but they will be able to reopen in Luton -both towns saw the lifting of restrictions paused last week SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

I'm told the change comes without a time limit, but will be reviewed every week. And don't be surprised if the government, from the prime minister down, make the case that this could happen elsewhere too if people are cavalier about the rules. And yet, in Leicester, the local, more severe restrictions imposed there are to be eased. The baby steps back towards normality are going to be hesitant and faltering; messy in their detail and messy in their geography. The virus has robbed us of many things. It continues to rob us of any certainty. The current rules for the rest of England allow two households - up to a maximum of 30 people - to meet indoors. In Wales, indoor meetings between different households are still not allowed, but two households of any size can join up in an ""extended household"". In Northern Ireland, groups of up to 10 people from four different households can meet indoors, while in Scotland, up to eight people from three different households can meet indoors. On Thursday, a further 38 people in the UK died, bringing the total number of Covid-19 associated deaths to 45,999. And 846 cases were reported - the highest number of cases in a day for a month.

England tops Europe excess deaths,"The UK saw some of the biggest rises in deaths rates in Europe in the months until the middle of June, official analysis shows. England saw the largest increase in death rates in Europe, with Scotland seeing the third largest increase. TheOffice for National Statistics says,externalthat Spain saw the highest peak in rates of death in Europe. But the UK had the longest period of above-average deaths and so overall saw higher death rates. By 29 May, the death rate in England was 7.5% higher than it has been in recent years. Spain's increase, 6.7%, was the second highest in the countries studied followed by Scotland's rise of 5.1%. Wales and Northern Ireland both also featured in the list of hardest-hit countries. The ONS analysis also looked at how individual cities were affected. Cities in Spain and Italy, like Barcelona, Milan and Madrid, were harder hit than any city in the UK. But the analysis also shows the epidemic in the UK was more widespread than in other countries. Seven of the 15 cities with the biggest rise in death rates are in the UK. Edward Morgan of the ONS said the wide spread of the virus combined with the relatively slow downward ""tail"" of the pandemic in the UK were key reasons that England saw 'the highest overall relative excess mortality out of all the European countries compared"". Is Europe having a 'second wave'? Virus isolation extended from seven to 10 days 'Covid took nine of the people I care for' What do global death patterns reveal about the UK? During a visit to North Yorkshire, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if he was ashamed that England had the highest excess death rate in Europe. He said: ""We mourn every loss of life that we've had throughout the coronavirus epidemic."" Karren Fraser-Knight's identical twin sister Paula Greenhough was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport with coronavirus symptoms in March. The 55-year-old was put on a ventilator but died on 3 April. ""This is not grief, it is trauma, it is PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), I live my sister's death every single day of my life,"" Ms Fraser-Knight told the BBC. ""If they (the government) had acted immediately, thousands of people including Paula Greenhough would not be dead today. ""These people should not have died and the government must accept responsibility for not locking down [fast enough], for not closing airports, we must have an inquiry."" Boris Johnsoncommitted to an independent inquiry earlier this monthinto the coronavirus pandemic. The prime minister said that the country owes it to the families of those who died ""to continue our work in driving the virus down"", adding that it had ""massive success"" in reducing the number of deaths. The virus was ""under some measure of control"" while ""we're looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries"" as well as in the US, Mr Johnson said. The new analysis adds to previous studies of excess deaths by taking account of the ages of the population in each country. At its worst, the death rate in Spain was nearly 2.5 times its usual level. That was worse than in the UK where the peak number of deaths was nearly 2.1 times its usual level. But deaths in Spain returned to normal levels faster, so over the whole year so far, England has seen more deaths compared with previous years. 14,000 45,200 Let's use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. This is known asexpected deathsand is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years. 14,000 45,200 Any deaths above those expected are known asexcess deaths. During the coronavirus pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year. 14,000 45,200 Many of these excess deaths can be explained by the number of people who were officially confirmed to have hadCovid-19. But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths. 14,000 45,200 Theseother excess deathsmay have been, directly or indirectly, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 14,000 45,200 The total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the coronavirus outbreak.

"Tech giants thriving in lockdownApple and Amazon saw sales surge during lockdown, while the number of Facebook users jumped.Business","Amazon's Jeff Bezos testifies to Congress by remote video The coronavirus crisis might be causing widespread economic upheaval around the world, but the world's biggest tech firms are thriving. Amazon sales soared 40% in the three months ending June, while Apple saw a surge in purchases of its iPhones and other hardware. At Facebook, the number of people on its platforms, which include WhatsApp and Instagram, jumped by 15%. The gains come as the firms face scrutiny over their size and power. At a hearing in Washington on Wednesday, lawmakers grilled the companies about whether they were abusing their dominance to quash rivals, noting the sharp contrast between their fortunes and many other firms. Their positions are likely to become even stronger, as the pandemic pushes even more activity online, said Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat who leads the committee. Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google face claims of 'harmful' power Apple has â¬13bn Irish tax bill overturned Amazon, Google and Wish remove neo-Nazi products ""Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,""  he said. ""In the wake of COVID-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before."" The gains weren't a surprise to analysts - though just how well many of the firms did, was. At Amazon, the quarterly profit of $5.2bn (Â£4bn) was the biggest since the company's start in 1994 and came despite heavy spending on protective gear and other measures due to the virus. ""This is an exceptional quarter on all fronts under extreme circumstances,"" Moody's vice president Charlie O'Shea said of Amazon's blockbuster rise. The e-commerce firm's sales surged 40% for the three months ending 30 June to $88.9bn (Â£67.9bn) - its strongest year-on-year growth in years. Profits rose to $5.2bn from 2.6bn for the same period in 2019. Amazon says it is running out of space due to a surge in online shopping orders The flood of online shopping has strained the firm's capacity. Amazon hired about 175,000 people in the quarter and is working to expand its warehouse space in anticipation of continued growth. ""We've run out of space,"" chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts about the results. Meanwhile, Apple said quarterly revenues jumped 11% year-on-year to $59.7bn. The shift to remote work and school helped drive demand for new devices, such as Macs and iPads, both of which saw double-digit gains. Profits hit $11.25bn, up from $10bn in the same period a year ago. Apple said the release of the low-cost iPhone SE in April had helped to boost sales and put the electronics giant in a better position, despite the financial impacts of the coronavirus crisis. ""The last few months have underlined the importance of users - and households alike - to own better quality devices, connections and services,"" said Paolo Pescatore, tech analyst at PP Foresight. ""Apple smashed it."" At Facebook, revenues rose 11% - slower than other quarters - but were still ahead of analysts' expectations, as small businesses continued to turn to the company to advertise. The firm's profits hit almost $5.2bn for the quarter. Could a boycott kill Facebook? Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? The resilience was helped by a spike in users, which makes the firm attractive to advertisers, said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The firm said 2.4 billion people were active on its social media platforms and messaging apps on average in June, up 15% from last year. That included nearly 1.79 billion daily active users on Facebook, up 12% year-on-year. As lockdowns have eased, Facebook said it was ""seeing signs of normalisation in user growth and engagement"", warning those figures could flatten or decline in the months to come. Ms Lund-Yates said the firm also remains vulnerable to social and political pressure, which could just as quickly push users away again. ""But this isn't the first time Facebook's navigated regulatory or social speed bumps, and it has deep pockets to throw at fixing problems,"" she said. Google's offices in New York City, boarded up to prevent looting in June Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, was the weakest of the four. The search giant said revenues were $38.3bn, down 2% from a year ago, as businesses cut back on ad spending. It was the first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue for the search giant, since Google became a publicly-listed company in 2004. Profits dropped about 30% year-on-year to roughly $7bn. But even those falls failed to faze analysts, who had expected damage.
