Record GCSE results after second year of no exams,"Sharing the exam news at Ark Burlington Danes Academy in west London GCSE students have received another set of record grades, in the second year of Covid disruption to exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Top grades (7/As and above) rose to 28.9% from 26.2% last year, while grades 4/Cs and above  - seen as passes - rose to 77.1% up from 76.3%. This is a smaller rise than last year, the first time exams were cancelled and teacher assessed grades were used. Exams regulators have insisted the process has been fair and thorough. Teachers submitted grades for the more than half a million pupils on GCSE courses this year, using evidence such as mock exams, course work and tests. There were more top GCSE grades, but the increase was not as sharp as at A-level Girls moved further ahead of boys - 33.4% of girls' results grade 7/A, 24.4% for boys Northern Ireland had highest grades In England, independent schools had biggest increase in top grades -  61.2% of results at grade 7/A, compared with 26.1% in comprehensives, 28.1% in academies Pupils eligible for free school meals slipped slightly further behind London had most top grades in England, north east the least 3,606 pupils got all grade 9s Olympic twins celebrate grades success GCSEs 2021: The big divides becoming even wider There are different devolved systems for GCSEs: English exam boards use a numeric 1-9 for grades Wales uses alphabetic A to G grading system pupils in Northern Ireland take a combination of both How does the GCSE grading system work? The two years of replacement grades, after exams were cancelled in the pandemic, have had significantly higher results, for GCSEs and A-levels. Exam officials say it reflects that no one has had a bad day in an exam and that pupils had multiple chances to show their best potential. England's exam watchdog Ofqual said the system was fair, each centre had its assessment policy reviewed and samples of work were checked during a ""quality assurance"" process. Exam boards say that below 1% of grades were changed in the checking process. Opening exam results in Core's city academy in Birmingham As well as getting GCSEs, more than half a million vocational qualifications were also issued, including for 230,000 BTec students. Record top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland Wales has another year of rising GCSE grades A-levels have record top grades BBC Bitesize guide to GCSE results day Examageddon: BBC podcast on how exams felt for parents Schools Minister Nick Gibb defended the way GCSE results had been awarded, saying this had been a ""very different year"" and it was right that exams were cancelled. ""This was the best alternative to exams,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I think people can be confident of the grades that have been awarded this year."" Mr Gibb said longer term, he wanted to get back to a pre-pandemic system where there are no ""significant changes"" year-on-year in the grades awarded to students. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the exam results were a ""stark warning"" of a widening social divide. This video can not be played GCSE results day: ""It's amazing, I can't believe it"" ""Children on free school meals have been abandoned by this government and students in state schools are again being outstripped by their more advantaged private school peers,"" she said. Jon Andrews of the Education Policy Institute think tank warned the higher results should not ""distract us from the huge learning losses that students have faced"". This video can not be played Schools minister: ""People can be confident of the grades awarded"" ""There is a risk that higher grades awarded to young people conceal the underlying losses that they have experienced from the pandemic."" Prof Alan Smithers, of the Centre of Education and Employment Research, at Buckingham University, said it would be difficult for the government to reverse the trend of increasing grades over the coming years - as the higher grades are popular with parents and schools. ""It will be quite a task for the government to put the genie back into the bottle,"" he said. This video can not be played It is ""pretty astonishing"" that the education secretary is still in his job, says the Labour leader. But head teachers say the replacement grades used this year will allow pupils to progress to the next stage of their education. National Association of Head Teachers leader Paul Whiteman said it was important that these pupils have access to any additional academic or pastoral support they need as they progress into the next stage of their education. Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""It is important to focus on the achievements of this cohort rather than fixate on comparisons with other years, which are somewhat meaningless."" Syeda in Dagenham got all grade 9s in her GCSE results Syeda had been hoping for high grades after sitting 62 assessments, instead of the usual exams, at Sydney Russell School in Dagenham, east London. And her hopes have been realised. ""I did it. I got all 9s in my GCSEs and two distinctions,"" she said. ""It's the best possible results and I'm so proud of myself. I think there is a big sense of relief."" Her mum, Shahima came to the school with her to share the experience. She says: ""I'm extremely, extremely proud of Syeda. She's put so much effort and hard work into this and lots of sleepless nights."" ""It has been a bit crazy for everyone involved in this process this year,"" she says. Roman says he would have preferred the regular exam system Roman is celebrating four grade 7s and four grade 8s in his GCSEs. ""I'm definitely satisfied, but in a sense I feel I've been bumped down a few grades due to some exams being very different and out of the ordinary this year compared to other years."" He says the challenges he's faced over the past two years have had an impact. ""It's been a rollercoaster. So many ups and downs and so many battles, both mental battles and physical ones."" He says he would actually have preferred to sit exams as he feels one exam at the end would have been easier than the constant pressure of lots of tests. ""I don't think anyone could have ever imagined stuff like this,"" she says ""But the fact is that we have got through it - and hopefully our results tomorrow will prove that we have worked hard."" To those people who criticise the value of this year's grades, Syeda says: ""I would tell them they should try and be in our place."" ""I don't think anyone can know what it is like unless you are experiencing it yourself."" She is aiming to sit A-levels next year and study English literature at the University of Cambridge.

Britney Spears' father steps down as conservator,"Jamie Spears has been his daughter's conservator since 2008 Britney Spears' father has agreed to step down as the singer's conservator, pledging to participate in an ""orderly transition"" to a new legal arrangement. The pop star's lawyer said it was ""a major victory for Britney Spears and another step toward justice"". However, Jamie Spears' lawyer insisted there were ""no actual grounds"" for him to step back and gave no timetable for when he would relinquish his role. The singer's career has been in the hands of legal guardians since 2008. She filed a petitionto stop her father controlling her estate in July and has said she will not perform again while he remains in the role. In court papers filed on Thursday in response to the star's petition, Mr Spears' lawyer said he would be ""in a position to step aside"" when certain matters were resolved, and ""when the time is right"". Mr Spears, the 15-page filing states, ""intends to work with the court and his daughter's new attorney to prepare for an orderly transition to a new conservator"". Britney Spears is in a legal battle to end the conservatorship Mr Spears' lawyer said he did not believe ""a public battle with his daughter... would be in her best interests"" and that he had been ""the unremitting target of unjustified attacks"". Nevertheless, he called for his daughter's ""flawed"" petition to be denied, saying it was ""unjustified"" and that there were ""no urgent circumstances justifying Mr Spears' immediate suspension"". Jamie Spears' response to his daughter's petition was welcomed by her lawyer Mathew Rosengart, who called it a ""vindication"" for his client. ""We are pleased that Mr Spears and his lawyer have today conceded in a filing that he must be removed,"" he said in a statement. Yet he accused Jamie Spears of his own ""shameful and reprehensible attacks"" and said he should stop ""making false accusations and taking cheap shots"". He said the singer's father should instead ""remain silent and step aside immediately"". Mr Rosengart added that an investigation into the actions of those involved in managing her estate throughout the conservatorship would continue. The news was welcomed by one of her fellow celebrities, the model and heiress Paris Hilton. ""I'm so happy to hear this news,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""It's been so long overdue but I'm so glad that Britney is on her way to finally being free."" But some of the singer's supporters, who have campaigned for her to regain autonomy over her affairs using the #FreeBritney hashtag, expressed scepticism. Campaigner Leanne Simmons,externaldismissed the move as ""another manipulation tactic"", whileanother fan said,externalthere was ""still plenty of work to do"". This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Lisa MacCarley, a US conservatorship lawyer and #FreeBritney advocate, said it was a ""significant"" development in the ongoing dispute. ""I'm sure Britney is feeling a lot of relief,"" she told BBC Breakfast on Friday. ""The only question is how soon this is going to take place. ""It really depends on what conditions Jamie's attorneys put on his resignation."" The conservatorship arrangement was imposed in 2008 when concerns were raised over her mental health. The court-ordered agreement gave Jamie Spears control over his daughter's estate and other aspects of her life. The conservatorship is split into two parts. One is for her estate and financial affairs, while the other is for her as a person. Mr Spears stepped down as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health issues but has continued to oversee her business arrangements. The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Britney: I won't perform while father rules career In recent months, she has sought to remove him from his role and has called for him to be charged with ""conservatorship abuse"". The 39-year-old told a judge that she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children. Mr Spears has consistently denied any accusations of wrongdoing and has expressed concern for his daughter's wellbeing. The prolonged legal row gained renewed attention earlier this year following the release of Framing Britney Spears, a documentary that centred on the conflict over the singer's guardianship.

Multiple fatalities in Plymouth shooting,"Six people, including a suspected gunman, have died in a shooting in Plymouth. Devon and Cornwall Police said three females, two males and the suspect had died in the Keyham area of the city on Thursday evening. One of the dead was a child under 10, according to an MP, but the shooting is not terror-related, police confirmed. The death toll means it is the worst mass shooting in the UK for more than a decade. Emergency services were called to Biddick Drive shortly after 18:00 BST on Thursday. People were told to stay inside and follow police advice as the emergency response developed. Eyewitness Sharron, who lives nearby and did not want to give her full name, said what happened was ""horrendous and so sad"". ""Firstly, there was shouting, followed by gunshots - three possibly four to begin with,"" she said. ""This was when the shooter kicked in the door of a house and randomly started shooting. He ran from the house shooting as he ran and proceeded to shoot at a few people in the linear park up from the drive."" She said the ""shooter proceeded along Royal Navy Avenue still shooting"". Another witness, Robert Pinkerton, said he ""walked around the corner"" and ""bumped into a bloke with a shotgun"". He said the man was dressed all in black. Road closures remained in place overnight after Thursday's shooting In a statement, Devon and Cornwall Police said two females and the three males died at the scene, while one female died shortly after in hospital. It added: ""The area has been cordoned off and police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident."" Plymouth Sutton & Devonport MP Luke Pollard said the incident was ""unspeakably awful"" and that he was ""utterly devastated"" to learn one of those killed was a child. The last mass shooting in Britainhappened in 2010when taxi driver Derrick Bird killed 12 people in Cumbria. Police said two females and three males died at the scene Scenes of crime officers in white suits could be seen using cameras in the street and members of the public who lived locally were not allowed into their homes, PA Media reported. Officers appealed to the public not to speculate or share pictures of the scene on social media or anywhere else. Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,external: ""The incident in Plymouth is shocking and my thoughts are with those affected. ""I have spoken to the chief constable and offered my full support. ""I urge everyone to remain calm, follow police advice and allow our emergency services to get on with their jobs."" Multiple air ambulances attended the scene, including from Devon and Cornwall Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""There's much we don't know about the shocking events in Plymouth. However it's clear tragedy has hit Keyham. ""My thoughts are with the families and neighbours of those caught up in this nightmare. I pay tribute to our emergency services who ran towards events we'd all run from."" Mr Pollard added Ford Primary School and St Mark's Church on Cambridge Road would be open from 09:00 on Friday as a ""safe place for our community to come together"".

UK troops sent to get Britons out of Afghanistan,"About 600 UK troops are to be sent to Afghanistan to assist British nationals to leave, the government has announced. It comes as the Talibanseized the country's second-largest city, Kandahar, as well as the cities of Ghazni and Herat. Military personnel will provide protection and help relocate UK nationals, Afghan staff and interpreters. Last week the Foreign Office advised all British nationals to leave. It is estimated that about 4,000 British citizens were still in the country. Who are the Taliban? Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the security of British nationals, military personnel and former Afghan staff was the government's first priority and that it ""must do everything we can to ensure their safety"". Mr Wallace said deployment of troops, who will be arriving in the coming days, was a ""pre-planned phase"" and was to ""enable the next step of leaving"". Thousands of civilians have been displaced during the fighting But the Ministry of Defence said the additional deployment was ""in light of the increasing violence and rapidly deteriorating security environment in the country"". The UK's ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, will continue to lead a small team in Afghanistan which will relocate within Kabul to a more secure location, the MoD said. As well as British nationals, the embassy will help the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), which has already supported more than 3,100 former Afghan staff and their families to move to the UK, including 1,800 in the last few weeks, the MoD said. The US has also said it is sending 3,000 military troops to the airport in Kabul to help evacuate a ""significant"" amount of embassy staff on special flights. By Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent It was always likely, this close to the end of the Nato mission to Afghanistan, that events would appear to accelerate. We are, after all, getting out. But as they made their careful arrangements, planners did not necessarily anticipate the speed of the Taliban's advance, or the weakness of an Afghan military the US and its allies spent almost two decades building up. What they wanted was an orderly withdrawal, with the Afghan government able to hold its own. What we're facing, instead, is something altogether more chaotic. Perverse though it might sound, sending troops in to get people out was always going to be part of the plan. So too was the relocation of the British embassy to a more secure (and as yet undisclosed) location. But the withdrawal of an unspecified number of embassy personnel, with the Americans making a similar move, is clearly being driven by events on the ground. With US officials warning that the Afghan government could fall in as little as 30 days (a worst case scenario, it has to be noted), these feel like the crisis plans everyone hoped they wouldn't have to use. Thousands of civilians have been displaced and fled to Kabul to try to escape the fighting. And the UN estimates that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month. Makeshift camps have been established on the outskirts of the capital, while many others have reportedly been sleeping on the streets or in abandoned warehouses. This video can not be played The BBC speaks to two high profile figures in the Taliban chain of command who have very different messages Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the MoD had his party's full backing on sending troops to help the evacuation. ""We share widespread dismay that the security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating so much faster than forecast,"" he said, adding that while the UK's forces were withdrawing ""we cannot walk away from the people of Afghanistan"". In a heartfelt series of posts,,externalConservative chairman of the Commons Foreign Select Committee Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, tweeted that the decision to withdraw was ""like a rug pulled from under the feet of our partners"". ""That's why I'm angry. It's wasteful and unnecessary. And why it's personal? Because I've seen what it costs and what sacrifices are being thrown away,"" he wrote. Tory colleague Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Defence Select Committee and also served in the Army, told the BBC we ""should really be reconsidering what's going on"" in Afghanistan. He warned the withdrawal of troops was leaving the country to a ""massive humanitarian disaster"" and said that it would allow terrorism to ""raise its ugly head again"". The Taliban has moved with speed, seizing new territories and cities almost daily, as the US and other foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan after 20 years of military operations. They now control around a third of the country's regional cities and most of northern Afghanistan. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? IN MAPS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:An al-Qaeda resurgence? On Thursday the Taliban took control of Herat, the third largest city, followed by the second-largest city, Kandahar. Sources have told the BBC that the southern city of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, has also been taken by the militants, although this has also not been confirmed.

Major cities fall to Taliban amid heavy fighting,"Thousands of people are living in makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the Taliban insurgency The Taliban seized the cities of Ghazni and Herat on Thursday, in the most dramatic string of captures since launching their offensive. Taking the strategically important Ghazni increases the likelihood the Taliban could take the capital Kabul. There is also heavy fighting in the second largest city, Kandahar. The insurgents have moved at speed, seizing new territories almost daily, as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations. The city of Qala-I-Naw also fell to the Taliban, who now control about a third of the country's regional cities and most of northern Afghanistan. The group's rapid advance has dealt a crushing blow to government security forces. Sources have told the BBC that Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, is also now in the hands of the Taliban, though this has not been confirmed. Thousands of civilians have been displaced, fleeing to Kabul to try and escape the fighting. Taking Ghazni is a significant gain due to its location - it is 150km (93 miles) from Kabul, and is on the major Kabul-Kandahar motorway, linking militant strongholds in the south to Kabul. A provincial council member in the city told the BBC that the Taliban had taken most of the centre, with only a police base on the outskirts controlled by the Afghan security forces. FEATURE:The displaced people hoping for safety PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? Herat, which has been under siege for weeks, is also a major win for the militants. It is Afghanistan's third largest city, lies on significant ancient trade routes and is seen as the gateway to Iran. On Thursday, video on social media showed the insurgents running through a central Herat street firing their weapons, and the Taliban flag was seen flying over the police headquarters. A regional council member confirmed to the BBC that the city had fallen to the militants. This video can not be played The BBC's  Secunder Kermani reports on life in a town recently taken by the Taliban Meanwhile in Kandahar, once the Taliban's stronghold, heavy fighting was reported and the militants claimed to have taken over its prison and released all of the inmates, although this has not been confirmed. If Kandahar falls into militant hands, it will be the biggest loss yet for Afghan security forces. ""Life as we know it is getting harder day by day,"" a woman in Kandahar told the BBC, adding ""both sides are just usingâ¦ us as pawns in their own power-hungry games"". The US embassy in Kabul said it was hearing reports that the Taliban was executing Afghan troops who were surrendering, saying it was ""deeply disturbing and could constitute war crimes.""

The US said it was sending 3,000 troops to the airport in Kabul to help evacuate a ""significant"" amount of embassy staff on special flights. The UK later said it was deploying about 600 troops on a short-term basis to provide support to British nationals leaving the country. The number of staff working at the British embassy in Kabul hasabeen reduced to a core team. More than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month, according to the UN. Just this week thousands of people from northern provinces have become internally displaced, travelling to Kabul to seek safety. An estimated 72,000 children arrived in the capital in recent days and are mostly sleeping on the streets, according to Save the Children. Makeshift camps have been established on scrubland on the outskirts of the capital, while many others have reportedly been sleeping on the streets or in abandoned warehouses. ""We have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child,"" a 35-year-old street vendor who fled Kunduz province after the Taliban set fire to his home told the BBC. In response to the insurgency, the German government has threatened to end its annual financial support of $500m (Â£360m) to Afghanistan if the Taliban gains complete control of the country. Germany has also suspended the forced repatriation of Afghan citizens whose asylum applications have failed. The French and Danish governments said they would follow the same policy. On Wednesday, Afghanistan replaced its army chief, General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, who had only been in the post since June. Also on Wednesday, President Ashraf Ghani flew to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif - traditionally an anti-Taliban bastion - to try to rally pro-government forces there. Mazar-i-Sharif lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and its loss would mark the complete collapse of government control over northern Afghanistan. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? ON THE GROUND:Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power President Ghani held crisis talks in Mazar-i-Sharif with ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor about defending the city. Mr Dostum, a veteran commander, was quoted as saying: ""The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped."" For years, Mr Ghani tried to sideline the warlords in an attempt to boost the Afghan National Army, and now he is turning to them in his hour of need, the BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan says. Earlier this week, the president also agreed to arm pro-government militia. Are you in Afghanistan? Do you have links to Ghazni? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Sturgeon urges PM to reassess Cambo oil field plan,"An offshore oil exploration rig, in the Scottish sector of the North Sea, burns off oil and natural gas Nicola Sturgeon has written to the prime minister to urge him to reassess the development of a new North Atlantic oil field west of Shetland. The first minister said proposals for the Cambo field should be re-examined over ""the severity of the climate emergency"". Her letter comes after a UN report issued a""code red for humanity"". The UK government wants to reduce the use of fossil fuels, but says there is still ""ongoing demand"" for oil and gas. In her letter, Ms Sturgeon asked Boris Johnson to commit to ""significantly enhancing the climate conditionality"" associated with offshore oil and gas production. Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Virus hits plans for huge oil field development She added: ""I am also asking that the UK government agrees to reassess licences already issued but where field development has not yet commenced. That would include the proposed Cambo development. ""Such licences, some of them issued many years ago, should be reassessed in light of the severity of the climate emergency we now face, and against a compatibility checkpoint that is fully aligned with our climate change targets and obligations."" The first minister's intervention is her first on the issue. On a visit to Scotland, Boris Johnson said contracts should not be ""ripped up"" Ms Sturgeon also urged the prime minister to host to a four-nations conference ahead ofNovember's COP26 summit in Glasgow. Environmental groups have accused ministers of ""hypocrisy"" over the summit, after it emerged that the Cambo development could get the green light. The oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m to 1,100m. It contains more than 800 million barrels of oil. When asked about Cambo during a visit to Scotland last week, the prime minister told BBC Scotland that contracts should not be ""ripped up"". But Mr Johnson added that ""we need to transition as fast as we reasonably can"" to renewable energy sources. The UK government says the original exploration licence for Cambo dates back to 2001. This licence granted permission to search for oil and gas in the area. There is then a lengthy process - involving field development plans, environmental statements and approval from relevant bodies - before production activity can begin. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at Cambo could start as early as 2022. The field is expected to produce oil and gas for approximately 25 years. Nicola Sturgeon has been sitting on the fence on Cambo and today she edged towards coming off it. While her reassessment call is not a straightforward ""no"" to the new field, it does lean in that direction. It is hard to imagine how Cambo and projects like it would pass ""robust"" new climate tests, as proposed by the first minister. If that amounts to a ""presumption against"" new oil and gas extraction it would be a major policy shift. It's not so long since the Scottish government endorsed plans to extract maximum remaining value from the North Sea and the SNP has championed the oil industry for decades. But Nicola Sturgeon has stopped short of outright opposition because she knows that jobs, investments and energy security are also at stake. Greenpeace UK branded Ms Sturgeon's letter a ""PR exercise"" and called on the first minister to make her ""own stance clear"". Campaigner Sam Chetan-Walsh said: ""The first minister must stop hiding behind Boris Johnson. If she wants to show leadership on climate she must clearly say, 'Stop Cambo'."" Scottish Labour net-zero spokeswoman Monica Lennon said the first minister had taken ""a baby step"" towards having a position. She added: ""Now is not the time to reassess. It's time for Nicola Sturgeon to firmly and loudly oppose Cambo, once and for all."" The Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow will host the COP26 conference in November Scottish Green environment spokesman Mark Ruskell said: ""It is welcome to see the Scottish government start to come off the fence when it comes to the Cambo oil field. ""But it is clear there are still far too many hopes pinned on the oil and gas industry to get us out of the climate emergency."" The Scottish Conservatives said the first minister was putting a ""nationalist alliance with the Greens"" ahead of the economy. Scottish Conservative Net Zero spokesman Liam Kerr added:  ""The oil and gas sector supports over 100,000 Scottish jobs and the development of the Cambo field could create thousands more. ""It's a real shame the SNP government are too busy virtue signalling to work with the industry on the transition to renewables, as the UK government are doing."" Industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said the sector was ""committed"" to the Scottish and UK climate targets. OGUK energy policy manager, Will Webster, added: ""Regarding Cambo and other future oil and gas investments, it is already demonstrated in projections by government and independent agencies that these are compatible with net zero."" A UK government spokeswoman said it was supporting the oil and gas industry's transition to green energy by 2050. She said: ""Even though demand for fossil fuels is falling and we continue to break records on our use of renewable energy, the advice of the independent Climate Change Committee is that we will continue to need oil and gas in the coming years as it is still vital to the production of many everyday essentials like medicines. ""We have already ended support for fossil fuels overseas, and are already designing a climate compatibility checkpoint which will ensure any future licences will only be granted if they are aligned with the UK's climate change objectives.""

KFC warns menu items missing due to supply issues,"KFC has warned that supply chain issues are disrupting both their food and packaging stocks nationwide. In atweet on Wednesday,,externalthe fast-food chain said some items would not be available because there's been ""some disruption"" over the last few weeks. The statement did not mention which items on its menus have been affected or the reason for the disruption. It said the situation is ""not ideal"" and that they were ""working hard to keep things running smoothly"". 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets Beyond Meat boss: Tax on negative impacts 'does appeal' Pingdemic: âI'm losing hundreds of pounds in tipsâ ""Please be patient with our teams...they''re doing a brilliant job despite the disruption,"" it continued. The company did not say which of its restaurants would be affected. The majority (80%) of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. Replying to the tweet, customers said that there were no cups or lids on drinks. It is not known how long the disruption will last. It comes after aprevious supply chain problem in 2018when the company had to close 750 restaurants after a delivery contract with DHL led to shortages. Disruptions across the food and delivery industries are currently being caused by a shortage of HGV drivers, with a combination of fewer drivers from EU member states post Brexit and enforced isolation with drivers being contacted by NHS Test and Trace. The Road Haulage Association believes there is a shortfall of about 100,000 lorry drivers across the country. Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said on Thursday it would pay new lorry drivers a Â£1,500 bonus amid the shortage. Existing drivers will get a Â£1,500 retention bonus, while those who refer a friend for a driver vacancy will get Â£1,000. In addition, it will launch a scheme where over 21-year-olds who have held a drivers licence for more than a year will get the costs of training and tests paid for by the company. Last month dairy giant Arla, which supplies milk to all major UK supermarkets, said a lorry driver shortage has forced it to cut back on its deliveries. Recently M&S also warned it could be forced to reduce opening hours. Tesco also said in July it would offer a Â£1,000 joining bonus for new drivers, and Arla pays Â£2,000 to drivers willing to work weekends. In July, Transport Secretary Grant Shappsannounced a temporary extensionof lorry drivers' working hours, from nine to 10 hours a day. However, the RHA said the relaxation was a ""sticking plaster"". From 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are contacted by NHS Test and Trace when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"'Right owner' sought for historic island lodgeNatureScot says it has been working to find a ""beneficial owner"" of Rum's Kinloch Castle over the past few years.","Kinloch Castle was built in the 1890s as a hunting lodge The ""right owner"" is being sought for a 19th Century island castle off the west coast of Scotland. Kinloch Castle is a former hunting lodge on the Isle of Rum - one of the Small Isles, south of Skye. The castle and most of the island are owned by NatureScot, formerly Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). It says Kinloch Castle is not for sale on the open market but it is looking for a ""beneficial owner"" for the property and its grounds. NatureScot said the lodge requires restoration work and a future owner would need to conserve and preserve the property, while minimising its impact on the environment. Bid to take over Rum's Kinloch Castle rejected Castle plans expected in summer A Fort William-based businessman has submitted a plan to the Scottish government for the refurbishment of Kinloch Castle. Angus MacDonald, who owns a bookshop and a cinema is a former vice president of National Trust for Scotland, said his plan would require some public money along with funds he would raise. NatureScot manages land it owns on Rum as a national nature reserve Two years ago, Kinloch Castle Friends Association (KCFA) proposed developing part of the castle into a 51-bed B&B and later turning other areas into a museum. But SNH rejected a request to transfer the property to KCFA as a community asset. The agency said it was concerned the group did not have funds to maintain the castle. NatureScot said over the past nine years it had been delivering a conservation plan to maintain and protect the castle, in agreement with Historic Environment Scotland and Highland Council. A spokeswoman said: ""We feel the castle will best support the community with the right owner, and we have been working towards that goal over the past few years. ""While Kinloch Castle is not currently on the open market for sale we continue to work to identify a beneficial owner for the castle and grounds."" NatureScot said any future owner would need to contribute towards ""three key objectives"". The spokeswoman said they were securing the conservation and preservation of the castle, contributing to the sustainability of the Rum community and enhancing nature on Rum and, thirdly, minimising the castle's impact on the natural environment. Kinloch Castle was built in 1897 as a hunting lodge for Lancastrian industrialist George Bullough and he had it luxuriously furnished. The property fell into decline after World War One and was taken over by SNH's predecessor, the Nature Conservancy, in 1957. It has required extensive restoration work over the years.

UK inhaler firm backs Â£1bn bid by tobacco giant,"Directors at UK inhaler company Vectura have recommended shareholders accept a Â£1bn bid from tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI). The Marlboro cigarette maker's offer of Â£1.65 per share beat a rival bid from US private equity group Carlyle, whose final offer was Â£1.55 per share. Vectura makes inhaled medicines and devices to treat respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Dozens of health groups had urged Vectura to reject the firm's offer. No auction showdown in battle to buy asthma firm Tobacco giant raises bid for respiratory drugmaker The health groups warned that the deal would significantly harm the future prospects of the healthcare company, as it will deter top lung researchers and scientists unwilling to work for a tobacco company. Shares in Vectura, which counts Novartis and GSK among its customers, have soared 33% in value since Carlyle's first offer in May. Philip Morris recently said itcould stop selling cigarettes in the UK in 10 years' time as it focuses on alternatives, such as heated tobacco. The firm indicated it would welcome a government ban on cigarettes and said ""strong regulation"" was needed to ""help solve the problem of cigarette smoking once and for all"". However, health charity Ash said it was hard to take such claims seriously from the firm responsible for selling over a tenth of cigarettes globally. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Philip Morris's attempted takeover of a key player in lung health products beggars belief. It is bitterly disappointing that Vectura have so far failed to exercise duty of care to patients and scientists and reject this takeover by big tobacco. ""This is now a test for Sajid Javid. When we know smoking causes so much serious illness and premature death, it's time this government takes the right course, stands up to this tobacco giant and blocks this takeover."" Sources close to the deal tell me the company feels their primary duty is to shareholders and note that PMI must be allowed a chance to transition to its stated goal of deriving half its revenue from non tobacco products within a decade. Some have also questioned whether this deal is any different in principle from oil and gas companies investing in renewable energy. However, this decision will be treated with dismay by health groups and will disappoint many shareholder groups who hoped this deal be an acid test of whether shareholders really prized wider societal goals over getting the best price. PMI will need to convince 51% of shareholders to take the money for it to take control. Many other shareholders may feel uncomfortable being a minority shareholder in a tobacco company subsidiary. A letter sent by more than 20 UK, US and European health organisations on Thursday had urged Vectura's board to ""put sustainability and ethics first"". The signatories included the bosses of Asthma UK, the British Lung Foundation, the Royal Society for Public Health and the Royal College of Physicians, as well as public health directors of several councils and some distinguished medical professors from King's College, Imperial College and University College London (UCL). ""If PMI were to acquire Vectura, PMI could then profit from treating the very illnesses that its products cause,"" they wrote. One of the health groups' key concerns is that Vectura's research links with various universities and hospitals could be compromised. The signatories warned that Vectura could be blocked from participating in clinical trials, thus ""disrupting crucial drug development"". They added that professional partnerships could also be affected, since Vectura won the most contracts in 2020 to develop treatments for respiratory disease and lung cancer. The takeover battle began in May with a Â£958m bid from Carlyle, which received early backing from Vectura's board. But on 8 August, Philip Morris increased its offer to Â£1.65 per share, which totalled a bid of about Â£1.02bn ($1.41bn) from the Marlboro cigarette-maker. London-listed shares of Vectura closed at Â£1.63 on Thursday after hitting a more than five-year high of Â£1.76 pence on Tuesday.

Exams: This year the usual rules don't apply,"It won't just be teenagers with great A-level grades jumping in the air in celebration. Away from the photographers, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the exam boards and watchdogs might be tempted to have a quiet results' day leap of their own. Because after thechaotic U-turns of last year's exams, this year has been a much smoother run. It might be because results are way above anything ever seen before, thus fewer reasons to complain. Last year, the algorithm process saw about 40% of teacher assessed grades being downgraded, this time exam boards only intervened to change 1% of grades. It feels as though the exam system has given as many chances as possible to students who have survived two years of unprecedented disruption at school. As exam officials said in a briefing, these results reflect an ideal world where no one had a bad day in an exam hall and everyone had multiple chances to do well. A-level results show record top grades Examageddon: How exams in the pandemic felt for parents A rollercoaster year for students How the grades were decided this year Quite right too, say head teachers, who have been irritated at talk of grade inflation, when they say comparisons with other years are meaningless. Ministers who once fulminated against such rising grades have looked the other way. But there will be consequences for those chasing university places - with warnings of a crush for top places in a year when more people than ever have applied. The sorting process for the most sought-after universities is usually based on the limited number getting top grades. But over the last two years the proportion of top grades has soared from about 25% to about 45%. In independent schools, it's over 70%, compared with 39% in comprehensives. Exam results are handed over in a second year of replacement results The Russell Group of top universities has already said that those who narrowly missed out on required grades will find it harder to get a place - because so many will already have been filled. Once today's celebrations have finished, there will nervous glances ahead to next year. Because having allowed results to rise like a kite, at what point and how do you pull them down again? Will there be a long-term plan to get grades back to pre-pandemic levels? And would that mean years of artificially lowered grades? How would that be fair? None of that will be of much concern to those getting their results today. Whether celebrating or commiserating, or a bit of both, this has been the strangest of times to be in an exam year. What's it really about? Maybe put the percentages aside. Even when writing this in the office, there was a parent disappearing into a corner with their mobile phone. I heard him taking a moment to speak to his son who had got his results. He was telling his son how proud he was. There was a bit of a wobble in his voice when he said he'd give him a big hug when he got home. There are no results in a spreadsheet for that. What are your plans after A-levels?

Fleeing the Taliban,"Humanitarian organisations warn that women and children will be badly affected With violence surging in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking new territories in the north, thousands of people are fleeing their homes to seek safety in the capital Kabul. When they get there, many of these people face sleeping in abandoned warehouses or on the streets. They're struggling to find food, shelter and other basic necessities, such as medicine and sanitary items. But they feel they have little choice - it is either hardship in Kabul, or potential death in their home region. Now, thousands have gathered in makeshift camps on scrubland on the city's outskirts. Asadullah, a 35-year-old street vendor from Kunduz province, travelled to the capital with his wife and two young daughters earlier this week after the Taliban set fire to his home. ""I was a street worker, I sold food and spices... but when the Taliban attacked we came to Kabul,"" he tells the BBC. ""Now we have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child."" Asadullah was a street worker in Kunduz province, selling food and spices Asadullah, his two daughters (pictured) and wife slept on the streets after arriving in Kabul Asadullah and his young family spent the night on the streets. ""All of our home and belongings caught fire, so we came to Kabul and pray to God to help us. Rockets and mortars hit our home... there were heavy clashes in the past seven days, we had no bread to eat and all the bakeries, shops and bazaars were closed."" A woman, who didn't give her name, told the BBC she fled her home in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri with her husband and children. Her husband, she says, was wounded in the war. ""We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home and came here,"" she says. ""We left our home with only one dress and no money."" This woman said her family had a good life in Pul-e-Khumri, but they've now lost everything Humanitarian organisations have been warning of a rise in internally displaced persons in Afghanistan since US-led forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year, following 20 years of military operations. The campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil. Now, most of the foreign troops have pulled out. Since then, clashes between the Taliban and government forces have escalated. The Taliban have taken at least eight of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening to seize more. The Washington Post has also cited unnamed US officials saying that even Kabul could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, based on US military assessments. This unrest has caused a rise in people fleeing their homes for the capital. In July the UN warned that around 270,000 more people were internally displaced in the country after troops started to leave - this number is estimated to have surged in just the last few days. Amid all of this more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, according to the UN. Thousands of people are camped in scrubland on the outskirts of Kabul NGOs say that this mass displacement will hit women and children particularly hard. ""We're seeing a lot of increased reporting around health protection needs, gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and trafficking,"" Jared Rowell, Country Director of the Danish Refugee Council in Afghanistan, tells the BBC. ""Early marriage will become a larger problem too as girls and young women are sold off in order to get cash to provide for their families. Those types of issues, which have always been a problem, are going to get more and more severe."" EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? As well as food, shelter and health and sanitary items, Mr Rowell says, displaced people in Kabul are in desperate need of cash. ""It's really important people have access to multi-purpose cash,"" he says. ""Meaning an agency like DRC would give them a cash distribution that they have the autonomy to determine what they spend that money on in order to best support their needs. ""Cash is also particularly important at this point in time, especially when they're relocating to a large city like Kabul with high food prices and markets with fluctuating prices due to the current instability."" For Asadullah, his main hope now is that his family can one day return to their normal life in Kunduz. ""We want to go back and continue our lives there,"" he says.

Taliban take 11th provincial capital in a week,"Thousands of people are living in makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the Taliban insurgency The Taliban seized the cities of Ghazni and Herat on Thursday, in the most dramatic string of captures since launching their offensive. Taking the strategically important Ghazni increases the likelihood the Taliban could take the capital Kabul. There is also heavy fighting in the second largest city, Kandahar. The insurgents have moved at speed, seizing new territories almost daily, as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations. The city of Qala-I-Naw also fell to the Taliban, who now control about a third of the country's regional cities and most of northern Afghanistan. The group's rapid advance has dealt a crushing blow to government security forces. Sources have told the BBC that Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, is also now in the hands of the Taliban, though this has not been confirmed. Thousands of civilians have been displaced, fleeing to Kabul to try and escape the fighting. Taking Ghazni is a significant gain due to its location - it is 150km (93 miles) from Kabul, and is on the major Kabul-Kandahar motorway, linking militant strongholds in the south to Kabul. A provincial council member in the city told the BBC that the Taliban had taken most of the centre, with only a police base on the outskirts controlled by the Afghan security forces. FEATURE:The displaced people hoping for safety PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? Herat, which has been under siege for weeks, is also a major win for the militants. It is Afghanistan's third largest city, lies on significant ancient trade routes and is seen as the gateway to Iran. On Thursday, video on social media showed the insurgents running through a central Herat street firing their weapons, and the Taliban flag was seen flying over the police headquarters. A regional council member confirmed to the BBC that the city had fallen to the militants. This video can not be played The BBC's  Secunder Kermani reports on life in a town recently taken by the Taliban Meanwhile in Kandahar, once the Taliban's stronghold, heavy fighting was reported and the militants claimed to have taken over its prison and released all of the inmates, although this has not been confirmed. If Kandahar falls into militant hands, it will be the biggest loss yet for Afghan security forces. ""Life as we know it is getting harder day by day,"" a woman in Kandahar told the BBC, adding ""both sides are just usingâ¦ us as pawns in their own power-hungry games"". The US embassy in Kabul said it was hearing reports that the Taliban was executing Afghan troops who were surrendering, saying it was ""deeply disturbing and could constitute war crimes.""

The US said it was sending 3,000 troops to the airport in Kabul to help evacuate a ""significant"" amount of embassy staff on special flights. The UK later said it was deploying about 600 troops on a short-term basis to provide support to British nationals leaving the country. The number of staff working at the British embassy in Kabul hasabeen reduced to a core team. More than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month, according to the UN. Just this week thousands of people from northern provinces have become internally displaced, travelling to Kabul to seek safety. An estimated 72,000 children arrived in the capital in recent days and are mostly sleeping on the streets, according to Save the Children. Makeshift camps have been established on scrubland on the outskirts of the capital, while many others have reportedly been sleeping on the streets or in abandoned warehouses. ""We have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child,"" a 35-year-old street vendor who fled Kunduz province after the Taliban set fire to his home told the BBC. In response to the insurgency, the German government has threatened to end its annual financial support of $500m (Â£360m) to Afghanistan if the Taliban gains complete control of the country. Germany has also suspended the forced repatriation of Afghan citizens whose asylum applications have failed. The French and Danish governments said they would follow the same policy. On Wednesday, Afghanistan replaced its army chief, General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, who had only been in the post since June. Also on Wednesday, President Ashraf Ghani flew to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif - traditionally an anti-Taliban bastion - to try to rally pro-government forces there. Mazar-i-Sharif lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and its loss would mark the complete collapse of government control over northern Afghanistan. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? ON THE GROUND:Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power President Ghani held crisis talks in Mazar-i-Sharif with ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor about defending the city. Mr Dostum, a veteran commander, was quoted as saying: ""The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped."" For years, Mr Ghani tried to sideline the warlords in an attempt to boost the Afghan National Army, and now he is turning to them in his hour of need, the BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan says. Earlier this week, the president also agreed to arm pro-government militia. Are you in Afghanistan? Do you have links to Ghazni? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets","Humanitarian organisations warn that women and children will be badly affected With violence surging in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking new territories in the north, thousands of people are fleeing their homes to seek safety in the capital Kabul. When they get there, many of these people face sleeping in abandoned warehouses or on the streets. They're struggling to find food, shelter and other basic necessities, such as medicine and sanitary items. But they feel they have little choice - it is either hardship in Kabul, or potential death in their home region. Now, thousands have gathered in makeshift camps on scrubland on the city's outskirts. Asadullah, a 35-year-old street vendor from Kunduz province, travelled to the capital with his wife and two young daughters earlier this week after the Taliban set fire to his home. ""I was a street worker, I sold food and spices... but when the Taliban attacked we came to Kabul,"" he tells the BBC. ""Now we have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child."" Asadullah was a street worker in Kunduz province, selling food and spices Asadullah, his two daughters (pictured) and wife slept on the streets after arriving in Kabul Asadullah and his young family spent the night on the streets. ""All of our home and belongings caught fire, so we came to Kabul and pray to God to help us. Rockets and mortars hit our home... there were heavy clashes in the past seven days, we had no bread to eat and all the bakeries, shops and bazaars were closed."" A woman, who didn't give her name, told the BBC she fled her home in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri with her husband and children. Her husband, she says, was wounded in the war. ""We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home and came here,"" she says. ""We left our home with only one dress and no money."" This woman said her family had a good life in Pul-e-Khumri, but they've now lost everything Humanitarian organisations have been warning of a rise in internally displaced persons in Afghanistan since US-led forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year, following 20 years of military operations. The campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil. Now, most of the foreign troops have pulled out. Since then, clashes between the Taliban and government forces have escalated. The Taliban have taken at least eight of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening to seize more. The Washington Post has also cited unnamed US officials saying that even Kabul could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, based on US military assessments. This unrest has caused a rise in people fleeing their homes for the capital. In July the UN warned that around 270,000 more people were internally displaced in the country after troops started to leave - this number is estimated to have surged in just the last few days. Amid all of this more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, according to the UN. Thousands of people are camped in scrubland on the outskirts of Kabul NGOs say that this mass displacement will hit women and children particularly hard.

KFC suffers supply shortage for food and packaging,"KFC has warned that supply chain issues are disrupting both their food and packaging stocks nationwide. In atweet on Wednesday,,externalthe fast-food chain said some items would not be available because there's been ""some disruption"" over the last few weeks. The statement did not mention which items on its menus have been affected or the reason for the disruption. It said the situation is ""not ideal"" and that they were ""working hard to keep things running smoothly"". 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets Beyond Meat boss: Tax on negative impacts 'does appeal' Pingdemic: âI'm losing hundreds of pounds in tipsâ ""Please be patient with our teams...they''re doing a brilliant job despite the disruption,"" it continued. The company did not say which of its restaurants would be affected. The majority (80%) of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. Replying to the tweet, customers said that there were no cups or lids on drinks. It is not known how long the disruption will last. It comes after aprevious supply chain problem in 2018when the company had to close 750 restaurants after a delivery contract with DHL led to shortages. Disruptions across the food and delivery industries are currently being caused by a shortage of HGV drivers, with a combination of fewer drivers from EU member states post Brexit and enforced isolation with drivers being contacted by NHS Test and Trace. The Road Haulage Association believes there is a shortfall of about 100,000 lorry drivers across the country. Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said on Thursday it would pay new lorry drivers a Â£1,500 bonus amid the shortage. Existing drivers will get a Â£1,500 retention bonus, while those who refer a friend for a driver vacancy will get Â£1,000. In addition, it will launch a scheme where over 21-year-olds who have held a drivers licence for more than a year will get the costs of training and tests paid for by the company. Last month dairy giant Arla, which supplies milk to all major UK supermarkets, said a lorry driver shortage has forced it to cut back on its deliveries. Recently M&S also warned it could be forced to reduce opening hours. Tesco also said in July it would offer a Â£1,000 joining bonus for new drivers, and Arla pays Â£2,000 to drivers willing to work weekends. In July, Transport Secretary Grant Shappsannounced a temporary extensionof lorry drivers' working hours, from nine to 10 hours a day. However, the RHA said the relaxation was a ""sticking plaster"". From 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are contacted by NHS Test and Trace when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

UK economy rebounds as Covid restrictions ease,"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: 'Still work to be done' The UK economy grew by 4.8% between April and June, according to official figures, as most businesses emerged from lockdown. Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that the expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) was fuelled by retail, restaurants and hotels. Education also boosted the economy as schools reopened in the second quarter. However, the figure was slightly below the 5% the Bank of England expected. The UK economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic. What is GDP and how is it measured? Growth in the second quarter contrasts with the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank by 1.6% while Covid restrictions were still in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that the economy is recovering very strongly, exceeding many people's expectations. ""But I'm not complacent. The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that."" Capital Economics said it expected the economy to return to pre-Covid levels later this year. ""We are comfortable with our view that monthly GDP will return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic size by October and that the economy may yet surprise most forecasters by emerging from the pandemic without much scarring,"" said senior UK economist Ruth Gregory. In April, non-essential retailers reopened, as well as gyms, hairdressers and outdoor dining. In May, pubs, restaurants and cafes were allowed to serve customers indoors, while theatres, galleries and cinemas were allowed to open their doors. The main driver of growth was consumer spending, which rose by 7.3% over the quarter, ahead of expectations. The UK is not just a nation of shopkeepers, but social animals. And it's that large proportion of ""social spending"" - on hotels, restaurants and leisure - that made our economy so vulnerable to lockdowns. The UK was the fastest shrinking of the G7 nations in 2020 and conversely, maybe one of the fastest of the big players to recover in 2021 as restrictions lift. The consumer has led the way, driving output to within 5% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the Delta variant of Covid. It's growth that some feared just months ago would take far longer to materialise. But what happens next is still uncertain. The safety net that has protected livelihoods - the furlough scheme - ends in October. Economists think there will be some job losses, albeit far fewer than assumed a year ago. The biggest risk, however, will come from further variants and a resurgence in infections and restrictions. Policymakers are assuming we're done with the latter. A year ago, they were predicting there'd be no more national lockdowns: let's hope they're right this time. If so, the impressive vaccination rate in the UK should stand the economy in good stead - others are not that fortunate. Be it health or wealth, it's access to vaccinations that may increasingly make the difference between the haves and have-nots as we try to escape the grip of this pandemic. At the end of the quarter in June, the monthly growth is estimated at 1%, slightly more than most economists expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that nearly half of the economic expansion in June came from activity in the health sector, ""reportedly due primarily to a surge in people visiting their GP"". Hargreaves Lansdowne said: ""Fears that the arrival of the Delta variant and the 'pingdemic' that followed might impact growth have so far not really materialised."" However, the ONS revised down its figure for May from 0.8% to 0.6% during a month of heavy rainfall. The UK economy has been supported by the government's wage support scheme. But from July, employers have had to make contributions to staff wages and the scheme is set to close by the end of September. The economy is rebounding, but the pandemic is still having an impact on the restaurant trade, according to Asma Khan, founder and owner of Darjeeling Express, a family-owned Indian restaurant in London's Covent Garden. ""It's been very tough,"" she told the BBC. ""The insecurity has been very hard to deal with, the way the lockdown happened in March of last year."" Mrs Khan said that she was ""grateful"" for the furlough scheme which allowed her to keep her entire staff on. Even so, ""I was still liable for all the rents and all the financial costs mounted up,"" she added. There is, however, ""a lot of optimism"", Mrs Khan said. People are booking months in advance to dine at her restaurant, which recently welcomed comic actors Paul Rudd, of the US, and Canadian Dan Levy. Asma Khan (L) recently welcomed US actors Paul Rudd (R) and Dan Levy (C) to Darjeeling Express ""We had, I think, 1,300 bookings in five hours when we started opening all up all the other dates,"" she said. Mrs Khan said the changing nature of the UK's travel restrictions remained a concern. She said businesses like hers in central London were ""completely dependent on tourists"". ""People are worried because this whole insecurity of the red list, the amber list. This fluctuation is basically deterring a lot of people, except the very brave, to want to come in because they don't know whether the status of their country is going to change by the time they're ready to go back."" Following the release of second-quarter GDP figures, Mr Sunak said the UK had ""the fastest quarterly growth rate among the G7 economies"". But Pantheon Macroeconomics said: ""The UK economy almost certainly was the hardest hit by Covid-19 in the G7."" While UK GDP is still 4.4% smaller than its pre-pandemic level, the US has seen its economy recover, making it 0.8% larger than before Covid. Pantheon also said France's economy was 3.3% below pre-pandemic levels, Germany was 3.6% below and Italy's GDP was 3.8% lower. Japan and Canada have yet to report up-to-date figures, but Pantheon said: ""Both economies had fared much better than the UK in previous quarters.""

Growth in the second quarter contrasts with the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank by 1.6% while Covid restrictions were still in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that the economy is recovering very strongly, exceeding many people's expectations. ""But I'm not complacent. The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that."" Capital Economics said it expected the economy to return to pre-Covid levels later this year. ""We are comfortable with our view that monthly GDP will return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic size by October and that the economy may yet surprise most forecasters by emerging from the pandemic without much scarring,"" said senior UK economist Ruth Gregory. In April, non-essential retailers reopened, as well as gyms, hairdressers and outdoor dining. In May, pubs, restaurants and cafes were allowed to serve customers indoors, while theatres, galleries and cinemas were allowed to open their doors. The main driver of growth was consumer spending, which rose by 7.3% over the quarter, ahead of expectations. The UK is not just a nation of shopkeepers, but social animals. And it's that large proportion of ""social spending"" - on hotels, restaurants and leisure - that made our economy so vulnerable to lockdowns. The UK was the fastest shrinking of the G7 nations in 2020 and conversely, maybe one of the fastest of the big players to recover in 2021 as restrictions lift. The consumer has led the way, driving output to within 5% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the Delta variant of Covid. It's growth that some feared just months ago would take far longer to materialise. But what happens next is still uncertain. The safety net that has protected livelihoods - the furlough scheme - ends in October. Economists think there will be some job losses, albeit far fewer than assumed a year ago. The biggest risk, however, will come from further variants and a resurgence in infections and restrictions. Policymakers are assuming we're done with the latter. A year ago, they were predicting there'd be no more national lockdowns: let's hope they're right this time. If so, the impressive vaccination rate in the UK should stand the economy in good stead - others are not that fortunate. Be it health or wealth, it's access to vaccinations that may increasingly make the difference between the haves and have-nots as we try to escape the grip of this pandemic. At the end of the quarter in June, the monthly growth is estimated at 1%, slightly more than most economists expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that nearly half of the economic expansion in June came from activity in the health sector, ""reportedly due primarily to a surge in people visiting their GP"". Hargreaves Lansdowne said: ""Fears that the arrival of the Delta variant and the 'pingdemic' that followed might impact growth have so far not really materialised."" However, the ONS revised down its figure for May from 0.8% to 0.6% during a month of heavy rainfall. The UK economy has been supported by the government's wage support scheme. But from July, employers have had to make contributions to staff wages and the scheme is set to close by the end of September. The economy is rebounding, but the pandemic is still having an impact on the restaurant trade, according to Asma Khan, founder and owner of Darjeeling Express, a family-owned Indian restaurant in London's Covent Garden. ""It's been very tough,"" she told the BBC. ""The insecurity has been very hard to deal with, the way the lockdown happened in March of last year."" Mrs Khan said that she was ""grateful"" for the furlough scheme which allowed her to keep her entire staff on. Even so, ""I was still liable for all the rents and all the financial costs mounted up,"" she added. There is, however, ""a lot of optimism"", Mrs Khan said. People are booking months in advance to dine at her restaurant, which recently welcomed comic actors Paul Rudd, of the US, and Canadian Dan Levy. Asma Khan (L) recently welcomed US actors Paul Rudd (R) and Dan Levy (C) to Darjeeling Express ""We had, I think, 1,300 bookings in five hours when we started opening all up all the other dates,"" she said. Mrs Khan said the changing nature of the UK's travel restrictions remained a concern. She said businesses like hers in central London were ""completely dependent on tourists"". ""People are worried because this whole insecurity of the red list, the amber list. This fluctuation is basically deterring a lot of people, except the very brave, to want to come in because they don't know whether the status of their country is going to change by the time they're ready to go back."" Following the release of second-quarter GDP figures, Mr Sunak said the UK had ""the fastest quarterly growth rate among the G7 economies"". But Pantheon Macroeconomics said: ""The UK economy almost certainly was the hardest hit by Covid-19 in the G7."" While UK GDP is still 4.4% smaller than its pre-pandemic level, the US has seen its economy recover, making it 0.8% larger than before Covid. Pantheon also said France's economy was 3.3% below pre-pandemic levels, Germany was 3.6% below and Italy's GDP was 3.8% lower. Japan and Canada have yet to report up-to-date figures, but Pantheon said: ""Both economies had fared much better than the UK in previous quarters.""

Taliban take 10th provincial capital in a week,"Thousands of people are living in makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the Taliban insurgency The Taliban seized the cities of Ghazni and Herat on Thursday, in the most dramatic string of captures since launching their offensive. Taking the strategically important Ghazni increases the likelihood the Taliban could take the capital Kabul. There is also heavy fighting in the second largest city, Kandahar. The insurgents have moved at speed, seizing new territories almost daily, as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations. The city of Qala-I-Naw also fell to the Taliban, who now control about a third of the country's regional cities and most of northern Afghanistan. The group's rapid advance has dealt a crushing blow to government security forces. Sources have told the BBC that Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, is also now in the hands of the Taliban, though this has not been confirmed. Thousands of civilians have been displaced, fleeing to Kabul to try and escape the fighting. Taking Ghazni is a significant gain due to its location - it is 150km (93 miles) from Kabul, and is on the major Kabul-Kandahar motorway, linking militant strongholds in the south to Kabul. A provincial council member in the city told the BBC that the Taliban had taken most of the centre, with only a police base on the outskirts controlled by the Afghan security forces. FEATURE:The displaced people hoping for safety PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? Herat, which has been under siege for weeks, is also a major win for the militants. It is Afghanistan's third largest city, lies on significant ancient trade routes and is seen as the gateway to Iran. On Thursday, video on social media showed the insurgents running through a central Herat street firing their weapons, and the Taliban flag was seen flying over the police headquarters. A regional council member confirmed to the BBC that the city had fallen to the militants. This video can not be played The BBC's  Secunder Kermani reports on life in a town recently taken by the Taliban Meanwhile in Kandahar, once the Taliban's stronghold, heavy fighting was reported and the militants claimed to have taken over its prison and released all of the inmates, although this has not been confirmed. If Kandahar falls into militant hands, it will be the biggest loss yet for Afghan security forces. ""Life as we know it is getting harder day by day,"" a woman in Kandahar told the BBC, adding ""both sides are just usingâ¦ us as pawns in their own power-hungry games"". The US embassy in Kabul said it was hearing reports that the Taliban was executing Afghan troops who were surrendering, saying it was ""deeply disturbing and could constitute war crimes.""

The US said it was sending 3,000 troops to the airport in Kabul to help evacuate a ""significant"" amount of embassy staff on special flights. The UK later said it was deploying about 600 troops on a short-term basis to provide support to British nationals leaving the country. The number of staff working at the British embassy in Kabul hasabeen reduced to a core team. More than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month, according to the UN. Just this week thousands of people from northern provinces have become internally displaced, travelling to Kabul to seek safety. An estimated 72,000 children arrived in the capital in recent days and are mostly sleeping on the streets, according to Save the Children. Makeshift camps have been established on scrubland on the outskirts of the capital, while many others have reportedly been sleeping on the streets or in abandoned warehouses. ""We have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child,"" a 35-year-old street vendor who fled Kunduz province after the Taliban set fire to his home told the BBC. In response to the insurgency, the German government has threatened to end its annual financial support of $500m (Â£360m) to Afghanistan if the Taliban gains complete control of the country. Germany has also suspended the forced repatriation of Afghan citizens whose asylum applications have failed. The French and Danish governments said they would follow the same policy. On Wednesday, Afghanistan replaced its army chief, General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, who had only been in the post since June. Also on Wednesday, President Ashraf Ghani flew to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif - traditionally an anti-Taliban bastion - to try to rally pro-government forces there. Mazar-i-Sharif lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and its loss would mark the complete collapse of government control over northern Afghanistan. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? ON THE GROUND:Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power President Ghani held crisis talks in Mazar-i-Sharif with ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor about defending the city. Mr Dostum, a veteran commander, was quoted as saying: ""The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped."" For years, Mr Ghani tried to sideline the warlords in an attempt to boost the Afghan National Army, and now he is turning to them in his hour of need, the BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan says. Earlier this week, the president also agreed to arm pro-government militia. Are you in Afghanistan? Do you have links to Ghazni? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

'Right owner' sought for historic island lodge,"Kinloch Castle was built in the 1890s as a hunting lodge The ""right owner"" is being sought for a 19th Century island castle off the west coast of Scotland. Kinloch Castle is a former hunting lodge on the Isle of Rum - one of the Small Isles, south of Skye. The castle and most of the island are owned by NatureScot, formerly Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). It says Kinloch Castle is not for sale on the open market but it is looking for a ""beneficial owner"" for the property and its grounds. NatureScot said the lodge requires restoration work and a future owner would need to conserve and preserve the property, while minimising its impact on the environment. Bid to take over Rum's Kinloch Castle rejected Castle plans expected in summer A Fort William-based businessman has submitted a plan to the Scottish government for the refurbishment of Kinloch Castle. Angus MacDonald, who owns a bookshop and a cinema is a former vice president of National Trust for Scotland, said his plan would require some public money along with funds he would raise. NatureScot manages land it owns on Rum as a national nature reserve Two years ago, Kinloch Castle Friends Association (KCFA) proposed developing part of the castle into a 51-bed B&B and later turning other areas into a museum. But SNH rejected a request to transfer the property to KCFA as a community asset. The agency said it was concerned the group did not have funds to maintain the castle. NatureScot said over the past nine years it had been delivering a conservation plan to maintain and protect the castle, in agreement with Historic Environment Scotland and Highland Council. A spokeswoman said: ""We feel the castle will best support the community with the right owner, and we have been working towards that goal over the past few years. ""While Kinloch Castle is not currently on the open market for sale we continue to work to identify a beneficial owner for the castle and grounds."" NatureScot said any future owner would need to contribute towards ""three key objectives"". The spokeswoman said they were securing the conservation and preservation of the castle, contributing to the sustainability of the Rum community and enhancing nature on Rum and, thirdly, minimising the castle's impact on the natural environment. Kinloch Castle was built in 1897 as a hunting lodge for Lancastrian industrialist George Bullough and he had it luxuriously furnished. The property fell into decline after World War One and was taken over by SNH's predecessor, the Nature Conservancy, in 1957. It has required extensive restoration work over the years.

Former B&M worker settles discrimination case,"Harvey Spence says he found it hard to stand up for himself A former B&M worker has settled a disability discrimination case against his past employer. Harvey Spence, who has a learning disability, took a case alleging harassment against the retailer. Mr Spence, from east Belfast, settled the case for Â£5,000 without his former employer admitting liability. The 19-year-old claims he was excluded from conversations, subjected to derogatory remarks and constantly told he was useless. Mr Spence said he worked for B&M for 18 months in a stock-filling role and had enjoyed the job. However, he said that changed when he received ""disability harassment"" from some of his colleagues. He claims he was also told that no other company would want him because he was stupid and that everything about him was bad. ""I liked going out to work and earning my own money, it was important to me,"" he said. ""After a year in my job, some new people I worked with started being horrible to me and it became really hard and very upsetting. I dreaded going to work. ""Some of the people I worked with wouldn't speak to me at all and others would tell me to go away by saying horrible things, they used really bad language and called me names. ""I found it hard to stand up for myself and in the end I had to leave my job as it was making me feel very sick. ""I don't know if I'll ever be able to get another job because I'm really afraid other people will treat me like that again."" Mr Spence's case was supported by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Dr Evelyn Collins, chief executive of the commission, said the 37.3% employment rate for disabled people in Northern Ireland was the lowest of all UK regions. ""Harvey's experience at work highlights that much remains to be done to challenge barriers to employment for many disabled people and to ensure they can secure and retain paid employment,"" she said. ""Employers have a responsibility to provide and promote a good and harmonious working environment. ""Harvey did not experience that, he felt he had no option but to go off on sick leave and then it appears that no-one contacted him to check if he was OK or to offer support."" As part of the settlement, B&M agreed to liaise with the commission to review its equal opportunities policies and practices, and agreed to consider reasonable adjustments within an agreed timetable.

Rise in Northern Ireland's top GCSE grades,"Pupils use their GCSE results to progress to A-level, courses in Further Education, training or employment There has been a rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland. Grades A* and A were awarded to just under 40% of entries, which is up from 37.1% in 2020. As exams were cancelled for a second year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pupils' results werebased on grades calculated by schools. Similar arrangements for A-levels saw arecord number of entries awarded top gradeson Tuesday but the rise in results at GCSE has been less dramatic. Ian Bell, principal at Movilla High School in Newtownards, said his pupils had done ""remarkably well in some very difficult circumstances"". ""Sometimes I think it's very easy for people to jump to conclusions where they think 'oh it seems that they were easier' or 'it was an easier process' and I would certainly refute that and I'm sure every other principal in the province would refute that too,"" he said. Ian Bell said pupils had had to deal with events ""over which they had no control"" ""Hopefully, things as they start to return to normal, we will be able to get back to our normal procedures, but I don't think the examination systems have anything to lose from learning some of the lessons we've had, especially over the last two years."" The pupils at the high school said their whole summer had ""been leading up to results day"" and that there were a lot of nerves in the last few days. ""Last night I was really nervous, but I was excited to come and see everybody, "" one pupil said. The pupils at Movilla High School say they dealt with a lot of uncertainty ""It was hard going into this year because you're going into uncertainty and you didn't know would exams go on or would exams be cancelled, but I think we had to just go head on and do the best that we possibly could."" About 29,000 students in Northern Ireland received their GCSE results on Thursday. Others received results for BTec, vocational or entry level qualifications. Aaron (left) and Angus (right) celebrate their results with parents Bill and Cathy at Campbell College Teachers will have used evidence like classwork, homework, coursework and in-class tests to provide grades for pupils. Grades calculated by schools were also used to give pupils their GCSE results in 2020 after exams were cancelled. There has been some criticism that the assessment system used has led to a grade-inflation, but one Londonderry principal believes there are some benefits for pupils not having to sit traditional GCSE exams. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in the Waterside, said there was ""certainly elements I prefer"" about using an evidence-based method for the determination of grades. Michael Allen said there were some positive aspects to exams being cancelled ""Examinations and grades are pre-determined by the exam boards so the number of kids who achieve an A*, A or B is already pre-determined,"" he said. ""By removing the algorithm I think we are actually seeing what young people are actually capable of before examination boards are in a position to manipulate results."" 2019 was the most recent year in which a full exam series took place. Pupils had to come in to collect their GCSE results Just under a third of all GCSEs in Northern Ireland were awarded A* or A in 2019, and that has risen to 39.9% of entries this year. About nine in every 10 (89.6%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, similar to 2020. Girls continue to outperform boys in achieving the top grades. Just under half of entries from girls in 2021 received A* or A grades compared to about a third of entries from boys. Pupils shared news of their results with family and friends In 2020, almost one in every eight GCSE entries (12.4%) in Northern Ireland was awarded the top A* grade, a rise from 8.1% of entries in 2019. More than one in three GCSE entries (37.1%) received the top A* or A grades in 2020. The vast majority of GCSEs in Northern Ireland are taken by pupils through the exams board CCEA and results were available from 08:30 BST on Thursday. Record rate of top A-level grades for NI students Exams to resume in the next school year Many pupils went to their school to pick up results as unlike A-levels, they cannot receive them online. About 98% of entries are through CCEA, with the remainder through English and Welsh exam boards. That means some pupils in Northern Ireland received results in the form of numbers as well as letters. That is because GCSEs in England aregraded numerically from nine to one. Pupils use their GCSE results to progress to A-level, courses in further education, training or employment.

Australian capital goes into snap lockdown,"People have been queuing in shops as the lockdown approaches The Australian capital Canberra is going into a snap one-week lockdown after recording its first case of Covid-19 in more than a year. It will come into effect at 17:00 local time on Thursday (07:00 GMT). The lockdown was called for the whole of the Australian Capital Territory - home to around 400,000 people - because authorities do not know how the infected person caught the virus. Residents will only be able to leave home for essential reasons. Queues were reported at supermarkets as the lockdown approached. Australia is struggling to get on top of the highly infectious Delta strain, which has resulted in two of its largest cities - Sydney and Melbourne - going into strict lockdowns. Large parts of New South Wales are locked down, and in Victoria there are similar restrictions on Melbourne for at least another week. Extra military reinforcements could be called upon to ensure compliance with lockdown rules in Sydney, the New South Wales state government said. ""We are making sure that we do not leave any stone unturned in relation to extra (military) resources,"" state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told a media conference. Some 580 unarmed army personnel are already assisting police in enforcing quarantine orders in areas of Sydney. How Delta burst Australia's Covid bubble What's gone wrong with Australia's vaccine rollout? Despite seven weeks of lockdown in Sydney, infections remain near their highest. A total of 345 new locally acquired cases were recorded in New South Wales on Thursday, while two men in their 90s died. Fewer than a quarter of Australians are vaccinated. Despite avoiding the worst of the pandemic, frustration over restrictions has led to several large anti-lockdown protests.

"Price rise surge temporary, insists Bank governor","The recent surge in consumer prices will be a temporary phenomenon as the UK emerges from the pandemic, the Bank of England's governor has insisted. Andrew Bailey told the BBC the jump in inflation was understandable given the ""bumpy"" economic recovery. On Thursday, the Bank warned inflation will hit 4% this year, higher than previously forecast and double the 2% rate it aims for. But policymakers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.1%. The Consumer Prices Index hit its highest for almost three years in June, at 2.5%, as food and energy costs rose. Rate-setters on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have diverged over whether rising prices fuelled by the economic recovery are temporary and when they might start to fall. However, the committee, currently made up of eight members, not the usual nine, voted unanimously in favour of holding rates at their record low. Mr Bailey said the rapid recovery in demand for some goods was outstripping supply, contributing to price increases, but many of the inflation drivers are ""temporary"". But he added: ""I want to emphasise that we don't take this [inflation rise] lightly by any means. We at the Bank of England are very focussed on inflation. But we do expect it to come back to target."" Some economists argue the Bank should rein in its economic stimulus programme - quantitative easing - but there was also no change on Thursday. The central bank will keep up its Â£875bn QE following a seven to one vote in favour. Michael Saunders was the one vote against. He argued that the government bond purchases should be cut from Â£875bn to Â£830bn. The Bank's former chief economist Andy Haldane called for a Â£50bn cut in QE before he left the committee after its June meeting. Petrol prices at eight-year high, says RAC What is inflation and why does it matter? IMF upgrades UK economic forecast Despite rising prices, the MPC concluded that it would start to fall back to the target rate of 2%. ""The Committee's central expectation is that current elevated global and domestic cost pressures will prove transitory,"" the Bank said in a statement. But it added: ""Nonetheless, the economy is projected to experience a more pronounced period of above-target inflation in the near term than expected in the May Report."" Separately, the Bank's latest economic growth outlook published on Thursday forecast a gross domestic product (GDP) rebound of 7.25% in 2021. Although this is unchanged from the previous estimate of 7.25% in May, it is still the fastest growth rate for 70 years. However, the Bank now expects the economy to then grow by 6% in 2022, compared with a previous 5.75% forecast. Mr Bailey said he was very confident about the economic recovery. ""We were criticised a year a go for being over-optimistic about the bounce-back,"" he said. ""But the element that has come out much better than anybody forecast is unemployment."" With more than 70% of adults in Britain now fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and most social-distancing rules lifted, Britain's economy has recovered strongly since its 10% crash in 2020. A resounding headache is not just a common symptom for those suffering from coronavirus but for those who have to deal with the economic fallout. Inflation's usually the last thing central bankers worry about after a recession - particularly one that's the deepest since the Great Frost of 1709. But this isn't a typical crisis. The Bank of England is bracing for inflation, to hit 4% by year-end, twice its target. However activity and employment have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels, the path of recovery uncertain once furlough ceases and given the risk of renewed restrictions. How to balance those? The Bank is betting on the spike in inflation being transitory, reflected in the main bottlenecks in supply chains and the like as the economy adjusts. So it's opted for a wait-and-see approach rather than risk undermining the recovery, leaving not just rates but its asset buying programme, QE, alone. Economists think the first rate hike may still be at least a year off. The Bank may well be right but if not, there could be a steep price for inaction. Interest rates changes typically take anything up to two years to impact prices. Leave it too late, and they may have to rise further and faster than otherwise - a fresh headache, this time for borrowers. Petrol prices at eight-year high, says RAC Why are prices rising in the UK?

"'Right owner' sought for historic island lodgeNatureScot says it has been working to find a ""beneficial owner"" of Rum's Kinloch Castle over the past few years.Highlands & Islands","Kinloch Castle was built in the 1890s as a hunting lodge The ""right owner"" is being sought for a 19th Century island castle off the west coast of Scotland. Kinloch Castle is a former hunting lodge on the Isle of Rum - one of the Small Isles, south of Skye. The castle and most of the island are owned by NatureScot, formerly Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). It says Kinloch Castle is not for sale on the open market but it is looking for a ""beneficial owner"" for the property and its grounds. NatureScot said the lodge requires restoration work and a future owner would need to conserve and preserve the property, while minimising its impact on the environment. Bid to take over Rum's Kinloch Castle rejected Castle plans expected in summer A Fort William-based businessman has submitted a plan to the Scottish government for the refurbishment of Kinloch Castle. Angus MacDonald, who owns a bookshop and a cinema is a former vice president of National Trust for Scotland, said his plan would require some public money along with funds he would raise. NatureScot manages land it owns on Rum as a national nature reserve Two years ago, Kinloch Castle Friends Association (KCFA) proposed developing part of the castle into a 51-bed B&B and later turning other areas into a museum. But SNH rejected a request to transfer the property to KCFA as a community asset. The agency said it was concerned the group did not have funds to maintain the castle. NatureScot said over the past nine years it had been delivering a conservation plan to maintain and protect the castle, in agreement with Historic Environment Scotland and Highland Council. A spokeswoman said: ""We feel the castle will best support the community with the right owner, and we have been working towards that goal over the past few years. ""While Kinloch Castle is not currently on the open market for sale we continue to work to identify a beneficial owner for the castle and grounds."" NatureScot said any future owner would need to contribute towards ""three key objectives"". The spokeswoman said they were securing the conservation and preservation of the castle, contributing to the sustainability of the Rum community and enhancing nature on Rum and, thirdly, minimising the castle's impact on the natural environment. Kinloch Castle was built in 1897 as a hunting lodge for Lancastrian industrialist George Bullough and he had it luxuriously furnished. The property fell into decline after World War One and was taken over by SNH's predecessor, the Nature Conservancy, in 1957. It has required extensive restoration work over the years.

Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand'The boss of fast fashion retailer Boohoo tells the BBC it is committed to being more sustainable.Business,"This video can not be played With fast-fashion brands under growing pressure, the boss of Boohoo says it's taking action to be more sustainable The boss of fast fashion online retailer Boohoo has insisted its clothing brands are ""not throwaway"". In an exclusive interview withBBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money podcast,John Lyttle said Boohoo had a ""clear strategy"" for being more sustainable.

However, sustainability targets the company has set itself could take some time to meet, he said, adding there were ""lots of pieces still to answer.""

Mr Lyttle, a former chief operating officer at Primark, defended Boohoo's ultra-low advertised prices for its clothing: ""We're not down in the cheap end. Even on our lower price brand our selling price is higher."" He added: ""Our data doesn't suggest people are buying every day or buying once and wearing something new."" Former Labour MP and Environmental Audit Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said Boohoo's environmental policy claims and 20% sustainability target amounted to ""greenwashing"". ""We've consistently seen them play cat and mouse with lawmakers and public opinion on the issue of sustainable working practices and sustainable consumption,"" she said. ""Boohoo in particular has to reduce the volume of clothes it makes and accurately price their garments to reflect the environmental cost of fashion production.""

Quarantine hotel rules face legal challenge,"Travellers quarantine at the Radisson Blu hotel near Heathrow airport A law firm representing travellers is challenging the UK's quarantine hotel policy and seeking a judicial review. Currently, passengers must spend 11 nights in quarantine hotels on returning from red list countries, despite being fully vaccinated and testing negative for Covid. London-based firm PGMBM says this is an ""unlawful deprivation of liberty"". On Thursday, the cost of staying in a quarantine hotel jumped from Â£1,750 to Â£2,285. The firm has begun legal proceedings. PGMBM managing partner Tom Goodhead said: ""Mandatory hotel quarantine is a fundamental breach of human rights. It has led to the false imprisonment of people who are fully vaccinated and have tested negative. ""Prisoners are entitled to more liberty than those forced to quarantine in hotels."" Student nurse 'crying for water' in Covid hotel Quarantine-free travel from France to UK resumes Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean More than 60 locations including Turkey, Mexico, Kenya and many countries in Africa are currently on the red list. The other European countries with mandatory quarantine involving hotel detentions - Ireland and Norway - have amended their schemes so fully vaccinated travellers are exempt from needing to quarantine. A government spokesperson said: ""We are determined to protect our country and the progress we have made thanks to the vaccine rollout. That is why the government has taken decisive action at the border, including the introduction of the managed quarantine system. ""Every essential check we've introduced has strengthened our defences against the risk of new coronavirus variants. ""Countries around the world are taking equivalent action and apply a fixed charge for quarantine costs. The cost for travelling back from a red list country covers transport from the port of arrival to the designated hotel, food, accommodation, security, other essential services and testing."" The legal team are seeking compensation, not only for those they represent, but also for anyone who has been double-jabbed in the UK and has stayed at a quarantine hotel. In addition to compensation for the alleged breach in human rights, the law firm is also seeking refunds of the cost of the quarantine hotel stays. This is the second case PGMBM has brought about quarantine hotels. The first was on the grounds of financial hardship and resulted in the government offering the option to pay in 12 monthly instalments for those facing financial hardship. ""We want to see this draconian policy scrapped and those affected to be properly compensated,"" he continued. Mr Goodhead added that the majority of the people who got in touch with the law firm were not travelling to or from red list countries for holidays or for leisure. ""They are often travelling for emergency or urgent reasons and would not be travelling unless they felt it was absolutely necessary,"" he explained.

Warning UK climate spending is behind target,"A new analysis suggests the current level of UK spending to combat climate change is lagging behind what advisers say is needed. A study by the pressure group WWF says new green policies in the March 2021 Budget add up to just 0.01% ofGDP. But the government's own advisory Climate Change Committee has said 1% of national wealth - or GDP - must be spent every year in the UK to ensure climate targets are met. In November the prime minister promised Â£12bn for a 10-point plan""green industrial revolution"",external. WWF says its research also shows that some Budget policies that encourage pollution totalled Â£40bn - far more than the PM's green plan. It says that thefreeze on fuel duty,externalis costing the Treasury some Â£11.2bn in the financial year 2019-20 alone, rising to Â£13.9bn in 2022-23 if the freeze continues. Climate report is 'code red for humanity' How serious is the government about COP26? Time nearly up to stop climate catastrophe - Sharma A Treasury spokesman defended the government's record and said a comprehensive strategy for financing the ""green revolution"" would be outlined in the autumn. But WWF says the UK won't remotely deliver on its own promise of a78% CO2 cut by 2035at the current rate of annual spending. Isabella O'Dowd from WWF said: ""It's not yet too late to prevent global warming from rising above 1.5Â°C - it is in our hands. ""But to do that, the UK government must play its part by keeping every climate promise it has made."" The government's aim is to reduce UK emissions to almost nil by 2050 - that's a trajectory theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changesaid would save the world from the very worst catastrophes that lie ahead. A Treasury spokesman said: """"The UK is a world leader in the global effort to tackle climate change, growing our economy by 78% while cutting emissions by 44% over the past three decades and being the first major economy to legislate to reach net zero emissions by 2050."" The government has been urged recently bysome of its own backbench MPto spell out exactly how the low-carbon transition will be funded. They fear the UK may take expensive action to cut emissions when other nations sit back. The Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC recently that policies to shield poor families from higher heating bills would be published soon. Chris Stark, head of the advisory Climate Change Committee, told BBC News the WWF report is ""an interesting snapshot"" of government spending on the net zero transition. He continued: ""We estimate the cost of reaching net zero to be around 1% of GDP per year, a mixture of public and private money. ""Not all of that funding will be reflected in the government's Budget, but it's vital that a net zero test is applied to the Treasury spending review in the Autumn if we are to have a fighting chance of delivering net zero."" Recent analysis for the All-Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group suggests the government is also falling short at a policy level on net zero ambitions. Its report,externalsaid ministers have fully or partially met just 61 out of 135 policies recommended by the advisory Climate Change Committee. The prime minister has promised a full suite of policies before the vital climate summit known as COP26 that he's hosting in Glasgow in November. Experts say if the UK must prove how it can decarbonise its own economy to show other nations that it's economically possible. One of the government's new policy initiatives is to promote hydrogen as a power source. A hydrogen strategy is due soon. Lobby groups are pressing for widespread hydrogen use in home heating. But a report from Cornell and Stanford Universities warns thatusing hydrogen could increase emissions overall,externalunless it's made by electrolysis from surplus wind power. That's because the most common current method of getting hydrogen is to split it from natural gas, which produces high carbon emissions.

UK economy grows 4.8% as Covid restrictions ease,"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: 'Still work to be done' The UK economy grew by 4.8% between April and June, according to official figures, as most businesses emerged from lockdown. Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that the expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) was fuelled by retail, restaurants and hotels. Education also boosted the economy as schools reopened in the second quarter. However, the figure was slightly below the 5% the Bank of England expected. The UK economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic. What is GDP and how is it measured? Growth in the second quarter contrasts with the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank by 1.6% while Covid restrictions were still in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that the economy is recovering very strongly, exceeding many people's expectations. ""But I'm not complacent. The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that."" Capital Economics said it expected the economy to return to pre-Covid levels later this year. ""We are comfortable with our view that monthly GDP will return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic size by October and that the economy may yet surprise most forecasters by emerging from the pandemic without much scarring,"" said senior UK economist Ruth Gregory. In April, non-essential retailers reopened, as well as gyms, hairdressers and outdoor dining. In May, pubs, restaurants and cafes were allowed to serve customers indoors, while theatres, galleries and cinemas were allowed to open their doors. The main driver of growth was consumer spending, which rose by 7.3% over the quarter, ahead of expectations. The UK is not just a nation of shopkeepers, but social animals. And it's that large proportion of ""social spending"" - on hotels, restaurants and leisure - that made our economy so vulnerable to lockdowns. The UK was the fastest shrinking of the G7 nations in 2020 and conversely, maybe one of the fastest of the big players to recover in 2021 as restrictions lift. The consumer has led the way, driving output to within 5% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the Delta variant of Covid. It's growth that some feared just months ago would take far longer to materialise. But what happens next is still uncertain. The safety net that has protected livelihoods - the furlough scheme - ends in October. Economists think there will be some job losses, albeit far fewer than assumed a year ago. The biggest risk, however, will come from further variants and a resurgence in infections and restrictions. Policymakers are assuming we're done with the latter. A year ago, they were predicting there'd be no more national lockdowns: let's hope they're right this time. If so, the impressive vaccination rate in the UK should stand the economy in good stead - others are not that fortunate. Be it health or wealth, it's access to vaccinations that may increasingly make the difference between the haves and have-nots as we try to escape the grip of this pandemic. At the end of the quarter in June, the monthly growth is estimated at 1%, slightly more than most economists expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that nearly half of the economic expansion in June came from activity in the health sector, ""reportedly due primarily to a surge in people visiting their GP"". Hargreaves Lansdowne said: ""Fears that the arrival of the Delta variant and the 'pingdemic' that followed might impact growth have so far not really materialised."" However, the ONS revised down its figure for May from 0.8% to 0.6% during a month of heavy rainfall. The UK economy has been supported by the government's wage support scheme.

"UK economy grows 4.8% as Covid restrictions easeRetail, restaurants and hotels show strong growth between April and June but data misses forecasts.","This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: 'Still work to be done' The UK economy grew by 4.8% between April and June, according to official figures, as most businesses emerged from lockdown. Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that the expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) was fuelled by retail, restaurants and hotels. Education also boosted the economy as schools reopened in the second quarter. However, the figure was slightly below the 5% the Bank of England expected. The UK economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic. What is GDP and how is it measured? Growth in the second quarter contrasts with the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank by 1.6% while Covid restrictions were still in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that the economy is recovering very strongly, exceeding many people's expectations. ""But I'm not complacent. The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that."" Capital Economics said it expected the economy to return to pre-Covid levels later this year. ""We are comfortable with our view that monthly GDP will return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic size by October and that the economy may yet surprise most forecasters by emerging from the pandemic without much scarring,"" said senior UK economist Ruth Gregory. In April, non-essential retailers reopened, as well as gyms, hairdressers and outdoor dining. In May, pubs, restaurants and cafes were allowed to serve customers indoors, while theatres, galleries and cinemas were allowed to open their doors. The main driver of growth was consumer spending, which rose by 7.3% over the quarter, ahead of expectations. The UK is not just a nation of shopkeepers, but social animals. And it's that large proportion of ""social spending"" - on hotels, restaurants and leisure - that made our economy so vulnerable to lockdowns. The UK was the fastest shrinking of the G7 nations in 2020 and conversely, maybe one of the fastest of the big players to recover in 2021 as restrictions lift. The consumer has led the way, driving output to within 5% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the Delta variant of Covid. It's growth that some feared just months ago would take far longer to materialise. But what happens next is still uncertain. The safety net that has protected livelihoods - the furlough scheme - ends in October. Economists think there will be some job losses, albeit far fewer than assumed a year ago. The biggest risk, however, will come from further variants and a resurgence in infections and restrictions. Policymakers are assuming we're done with the latter. A year ago, they were predicting there'd be no more national lockdowns: let's hope they're right this time. If so, the impressive vaccination rate in the UK should stand the economy in good stead - others are not that fortunate. Be it health or wealth, it's access to vaccinations that may increasingly make the difference between the haves and have-nots as we try to escape the grip of this pandemic. At the end of the quarter in June, the monthly growth is estimated at 1%, slightly more than most economists expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that nearly half of the economic expansion in June came from activity in the health sector, ""reportedly due primarily to a surge in people visiting their GP"". Hargreaves Lansdowne said: ""Fears that the arrival of the Delta variant and the 'pingdemic' that followed might impact growth have so far not really materialised."" However, the ONS revised down its figure for May from 0.8% to 0.6% during a month of heavy rainfall. The UK economy has been supported by the government's wage support scheme. But from July, employers have had to make contributions to staff wages and the scheme is set to close by the end of September.
