How patient 'tsunamiâ threatens to overwhelm GPs,"Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning. It comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year. Analysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded. Doctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is ""undoable"". The analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21: The total number of appointments dropped by 10% - meaning 31 million fewer consultations with GPs and practice nurses Major shift from face-to-face to remote consultation, with the proportion seen in practices dropping from 79% to 54% The number of patients referred by GPs for urgent cancer check-ups dropped by 15%, putting lives at risk The escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through. This video can not be played Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster, opened his doors to the BBC to show the pressures facing practices Doncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: ""We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. ""It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. ""They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now."" Dr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record. But he says he worries most about the ""hidden wave of patients who don't get through"". One of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions. She says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. ""When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life."" She was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital. There could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. The biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis. The data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. This much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations. Sara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a ""devastating impact"", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances. And it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too. ""Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most."" She says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those ""ricocheting"" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. Latest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began. ""I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months"" added Dr Fisher. One of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations. The number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were. One of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back. ""It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. National Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place. ""Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes."" The issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too. But the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. BMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left ""angry, frustrated and disappointed"" by the letter, especially given the ""incredible contribution"" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings. In many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply ""undoable"". ""General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.""

Swiss abandon years of EU talks and reject treaty,"The Swiss-EU trading relationship is governed by more than 120 deals After years of talks, Switzerland has scrapped efforts aimed at agreeing an over-arching treaty with the EU. Switzerland is not in the European Union but has signed up to many of its policies, such as freedom of movement. The relationship is currently governed by more than 120 bilateral deals, and a failure to replace them with one framework deal could harm ties. ""We regret this decision,external, given the progress that has been made over the last years,"" the EU Commission said. The EU-Switzerland free trade agreement dates back to 1972. The Commission - the executive body for the EU's 27 member states - said that without an EU-Swiss framework agreement, modernising that relationship would not be possible. Existing deals were ""not up to speed"" and the impact of Switzerland's decision would have to be analysed, it warned. The Swiss government has highlighted three issues,external: protection of wages, rules governing state aid, and the right of EU citizens working in Switzerland to claim Swiss welfare benefits as part of freedom of movement. Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said Switzerland could not accept EU demands for equal rights for EU workers as it would have meant an unwanted ""paradigm shift"" in Switzerland's migration policy. The government also feared it could lead to higher social security costs. The two sides can rely on the patchwork of bilateral agreements but those deals will eventually go out of date, so Switzerland will not have access to a potential electricity union or other areas of the single market that change. However, one bilateral deal lapsed only this week on trade in medical technology products and the Swiss MedTech organisation saidit would cost the industry 114m Swiss francs,external(Â£90m; â¬104m) and 75m every year afterwards. The right-wing Swiss People's Party last year pushed for an end to freedom of movement with the EU The right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) welcomed the breakdown of talks as ""a victory for Swiss self-determination"", while trade unions were also pleased as they had been concerned about the impact on wage protection and public services. But most political parties in Switzerland were critical: Socialist party president Roger Nordmann described it as ""Black Wednesday"". Allow Twitter content?

Swiss confederation President Guy Parmelin rejected the term ""Black Wednesday"" and said he hoped for a fruitful ""reset in our relations"", adding that the Switzerland and the EU remained first-class partners. Even without a treaty, it was in their shared interests to maintain their ""proven bilateral approach"", he said. The Swiss fiercely guard their traditions and independence from their EU neighbours Unlike the UK, which left the European Union and gave up membership of the single market and customs union, Switzerland is part of the single market as well as the EU's Schengen passport-free zone. The Bern government says 1.4 million EU citizens live in Switzerland and has promised to urge parliament to approve the release of CHF1.3bn (Â£1bn; $1.4bn) to the EU's fund for poorer member states, which was frozen in 2019 and is is a key condition for Swiss membership of the single market. 1972:Free Trade Agreement 1992:Swiss vote narrowly against joining European Economic Area 1992-2002:Switzerland negotiates, then signs first bilateral agreements with EU - they are interdependent, and include free movement of people - backed by a vote in 2000.

The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans,"British subscription site OnlyFans is failing to prevent underage users from selling and appearing in explicit videos, a BBC investigation has found. Under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts, and police say a 14-year-old used a grandmother's passport. The UK's most senior police officer for child protection also says children are being ""exploited"" on the platform. OnlyFans says its age verification systems go over and above regulatory requirements. The platform has more than a million ""creators"" who share video clips, photos and messages directly with subscribers for a monthly fee. In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments. Warning: Story contains adult themes and language There is a range of content on the site but it is best known for pornography, and requires users to be over 18. OnlyFans was a big winner during the pandemic, exploding in popularity as much of the world was housebound. The social media platform has grown nearly 10-fold since 2019, and now has more than 120 million users. Some creators have become millionaires from their accounts, yet for most it has been a lifeline or a second income during the pandemic. But BBC News has investigated concerns that under-18s are selling explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for individuals to post or share indecent images of children. Have you had an experience on OnlyFans? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external As part of our investigation, we found that one 17-year-old from a suburb in the south-east of England had sold videos of herself masturbating and playing with sex toys, while an under-18 participated in graphic videos hosted on an adult account in Nevada, US, in breach of the company's terms and conditions. We were also able to set up an account for an underage creator, by using a 26-year-old's identification, showing how the site's age-verification process could be cheated. OnlyFans says it has now shut down the accounts. But BBC News has also heard from child protection experts across the UK and US, spoken to dozens of police forces and schools, and obtained anonymised extracts from Childline counsellor notes, about underage experiences on OnlyFans. The notes included one girl who told counsellors she had accessed the site when she was just 13. These sources told BBC News about a number of serious cases: Schools have shared anonymous reports of pupils using the site, including a 16-year-old who boasted to her careers adviser about the amount of money she made on the site, and showed off her ""exuberant"" spending on Instagram. Underage creators and users of the site include victims of prior sexual abuse and those with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, according to Childline counsellor notes. UK police forces say children have complained about their images being uploaded to the site without consent, and one 17-year-old reported being blackmailed. Missing children are appearing in OnlyFans videos, according to a US watchdog, which also says it has received reports of child sexual exploitation. ""It is increasingly clear that OnlyFans is being used by children,"" says chief constable Simon Bailey, the UK's child protection lead. ""The company is not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited."" In a statement, OnlyFans says it could not respond specifically to the anonymous reports we were told about without the account details. It says its efforts to stop children accessing its site limits the likelihood of them being exposed to blackmail or exploitation, and if it is notified about these behaviours it takes swift action and disables accounts. Leah, 17, was able to set up an account using a fake driving licence and sell explicit videos. She told her mum Caitlyn about being on OnlyFans, on the way to Tesco's near their home in south-east England in January. That week Leah's bank account had been frozen after she received a payment of more than Â£5,000 from selling explicit videos on the site, Caitlyn says. Caitlyn says she was as shocked as ""any parent"" would be. ""I don't understand why people are paying so much money for this,"" she told the BBC. Leah had ""big issues"" growing up and missed a lot of education, Caitlyn says. Naked photographs of her were once shared around school without her consent. She told her mum she originally intended to only post pictures of her feet after making money selling them on Snapchat. But this soon escalated to explicit videos of her masturbating and playing with sex toys. In tweets advertising her OnlyFans account - some of which include teaser videos - people call her ""beautiful"" and ""sexy"", and ask if she would meet up. ""Post a pussy shot and I'll subscribe,"" is another typical response. Caitlyn says she doesn't approve of her daughter using the site, but can see why people go on it, given how much money can be made. Leah used most of the money to buy presents for her boyfriend, including more than Â£1,000 on designer clothes. They have since broken up. In a statement, OnlyFans said that Leah's ability to access the site was an ""oversight"", and her fake driving licence did not trigger a red flag. It said her account was approved during a transition ""from one effective ID and age verification system to a new exceptionally effective"" one. Leah's age was directly reported to OnlyFans by an anonymous social media account in late January. The company says this led to a moderator reviewing the account and double-checking her ID. As it appeared legitimate, no further action was taken. Caitlyn says it was stated ""everywhere"" on other online accounts that her daughter was 17. There is no obligation for a website to investigate, but OnlyFans told the BBC it checks social media when verifying accounts. Leah stopped posting on OnlyFans, but her account remained active on the site four months later, with more than 50 archived pictures and videos. She had logged on as recently as late April. Have you had an experience on OnlyFans? Please share your story by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external After being contacted by BBC News, OnlyFans shut down her page. It says it has also refunded all active subscriptions to her account. But images from her account have already been leaked all across the internet. Leah's now anxious about leaving the house for fear of being recognised, her mum says. Her plans to go to college have been delayed. ""She won't go out at all, really,"" Caitlyn says. ""She doesn't want to be seen."" BBC News also heard of other cases of underage children gaining access to OnlyFans. Hertfordshire Police told us that a 14-year-old girl had managed to use her grandmother's passport and bank details to sell explicit images. They say she then redirected money from that account to her own. OnlyFans says the account was ""fraudulent"" and involved the help of others. The site says it is assisting police and has since updated its age-verification system to ""further reduce the chance"" of this happening again. But BBC News tested the site's ""new exceptionally effective"" system in April. While a fake ID did not work, we were able to set up an OnlyFans account for a 17-year-old by using her 26-year-old sister's passport. The girl never had access to the account. The site requires applicants to pose next to an ID card and then submit a photograph holding it up to their face. But the age verification system failed to distinguish between them at any stage of the process, despite the age gap. After setting up an account, creators must provide bank details to receive payment through OnlyFans. However, this does not prevent them posting images and videos. BBC News has found that creators can share content and then arrange payments through alternative providers, in violation of company guidelines. One of the most popular is Cash App, which allows users to transfer money by mobile phone. We found scores of accounts advertising this. We were then able to send a direct message to a subscriber and request payment through Cash App, using a common alternative spelling (Ca$happ). OnlyFans says its list of prohibited words on the site already includes a number of variations of ""Cash App"". It says this list has now been expanded. OnlyFans requires creators making ""co-authored"" material to have documentation showing that all participants are over 18 years old. All contributors must also be registered creators on the site. BBC News has discovered that under-18s are also appearing in explicit videos on accounts run by adults in violation of OnlyFans' guidelines. Aaron was 17 when he started making videos on the site with his girlfriend in Nevada, US. According to his friend Jordan, Aaron didn't have his own account, but instead ""got sucked into"" appearing in explicit videos posted by his girlfriend, Cody, who was a year older than him. Aaron soon started bragging about the amount of money he was making. ""He was actually very proud of doing it,"" Jordan says. The content included sex filmed in one of their bedrooms. They shared $5,000 between them from a single video, his friends say. ""[He] was elated that they were making such an amazing amount of money for just having sex on camera for other people to watch,"" says a woman who has known Aaron for many years. She says he had a tough childhood and was ""very vulnerable to exploitation"". Cody had previously showered him with gifts on his 16th birthday, and admitted to earning the money by selling nudes online ""to some old guy"", she added. Jordan says Aaron had encouraged him to make videos on OnlyFans, even though he was also underage. ""He used to say: 'Bro, you can do it, we make so much money a week, it's easy, you don't have to work ever.'"" BBC News was told the account was reported to police in the US in October 2020 but had not been removed until we contacted OnlyFans about the case this month. In its response, OnlyFans says all active subscriptions would now be refunded. It said it is now liaising with the police, but had not previously been contacted about the account. Aaron is now 18 and has broken up with Cody. His friends say he now plans to begin his own OnlyFans account. As a part of the investigation, we also spoke to schools, police forces and child protection experts who told us they are hearing from under 18-year-olds whose experiences on the site have had serious consequences. One school in London says it became aware of the site after a 16-year-old pupil openly boasted to her careers adviser about how much money she was making from it, asking why she should listen to their advice. The girl later revealed to staff that she had been posting ""very sexualised, pornographic"" images, says the school's head of safeguarding, who also told us about a 12 year-old girl who said she had used the site to contact adult creators and asked to meet up. The deputy head asked to be anonymous to protect the identities of the children. He said the 16-year-old girl had used Instagram to show-off her ""exuberant"" spending and build a large number of followers. Childline counsellors have come across a number of cases in which under-18s, some of whom are vulnerable, reference their use of OnlyFans. It shared anonymised extracts from counsellor notes with BBC News. Children using the site who contacted the service reported being victims of prior sexual abuse, while others presented ""mental health issues including anger, low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide ideation"". One girl told a counsellor she had been on OnlyFans since she was 13. If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. ""I don't wanna talk about the types of pictures I post on there and I know it's not appropriate for kids my age to be doing this, but it's an easy way to make money,"" she said according to the notes, which have identifying details removed. ""Some of the girls have thousands of followers on Instagram and they must be raking it in,"" she added. ""I wanna be just like them."" While most of Childline's cases referred to girls, counsellors also heard from boys who said they subscribed to the site, including one who said it had affected his opinions of sex. Another, who was 16, said he had lost sleep and was ""worried to the point of throwing up"" about someone discovering he had bought nudes on the site. Because the reports were provided to the BBC without any identifying details of the children or OnlyFans accounts in question, we were unable to provide the platform with account names. It said it could not comment on the cases without those details. It also said it manually reviews every application to stop under-age access, and has increased staffing numbers in compliance, in line with the growth of the site. The UK's national lead for child protection policing Chief Constable Simon Bailey, says it is ""increasingly clear"" that OnlyFans is being used by children. While it is illegal to post or share explicit images of someone under the age of 18, Mr Bailey says the police are extremely reluctant to criminalise children for such offences. He says he is more concerned about the risks children are exposing themselves to by appearing on the site. ""The company are not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited,"" Mr Bailey says. BBC News asked police forces about complaints they had received involving children appearing on the site. One 17-year-old girl in South Wales complained to police that she was blackmailed into continuing to post nudes on OnlyFans, or face photographs from the site being shared with her family. Three children also complained to police that their images had been uploaded to the site without consent, including a 17-year-old in Surrey who said her face had been edited onto someone else's body. OnlyFans says it cannot respond to these cases without being provided with account details, which the police were unable to pass on to us. It says it has a number of systems in place to prevent children from accessing the site and continues to look for new ways to enhance them. But there are also concerns about the welfare of vulnerable young people outside UK. Missing children are increasingly being linked to OnlyFans videos, says the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), known as a global clearing house for reports of child sexual exploitation. ""In 2019 there were around a dozen children known to be missing being linked with content on OnlyFans,"" says its vice president, Staca Shehan. ""Last year the number of those cases nearly tripled."" While much of the content on OnlyFans featuring children involves teenagers uploading their own content, NCMEC says it is also finding evidence of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. In January, a couple from Florida who were in their 20s were charged with human trafficking after allegedly selling a topless photograph of a 16-year-old girl on OnlyFans. OnlyFans says it works with online exploitation agencies like NCMEC to raise any potential issues with the relevant authorities. Stories about OnlyFans have become a fixture in the press. Tabloids are fascinated by the fortunes made on the site, and the intrigue of nurses and teachers signing up. Elsewhere, broadsheets have marvelled at the platform's business model and impact on the digital landscape. The Financial Times recently called it ""the hottest social media platform in the world"". The newspaper reported that OnlyFans' revenue grew by 553% in the year to November 2020, and users spent Â£1.7bn on the site. Men's lifestyle magazine GQ says ""innovations like OnlyFans have undoubtedly changed Internet culture and, by extension, social behaviour forever"". Andy Burrows, the NSPCC's head of policy for child safety online, sees its impact differently. He says the site blurs the lines between influencer culture and sexualised behaviour on social media for young people, and presents a ""toxic cocktail of risks"". ""OnlyFans underlines why it's so important that we see regulation so that it's no longer a choice for platforms about whether and how they protect children using their services,"" he says. Two years ago, the UK government published a proposal to tackle the dangers posed by online content. The Online Safety Bill, announced in May, would see companies fined Â£18m or 10% of their global turnover if they fail to keep children safe on their platforms. But there are concerns about how long it will take for the law to come into effect and whether the deterrent is sufficient for wealthy tech companies. The NSPCC says there is no accountability placed on senior managers, unlike the regulation of financial services where directors of companies can be criminally liable. In a statement in response to our investigation, the government was highly critical of OnlyFans. The website has ""failed to properly protect children and this is completely unacceptable"", a spokesperson said. ""Our new laws will make sure this no longer happens."" We asked the department for culture, media and sport what specifically in the draft online safety bill would stop such underage use of OnlyFans and similar websites in the future. It said all companies hosting user-generated content would need to put measures in place to prevent underage users seeing inappropriate content. ""The question is whether or not this bill will have sufficient teeth and power,"" says John Carr, secretary of the Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety. ""That is still far from clear."" He believes there are still no guarantees that legislation will require OnlyFans to do more than it currently does and says it's ""a bit rich"" of the government to blame companies themselves. ""In a sense, the real culprit here is the government for not having acted sooner and that's why the prospect of three, four years further delay is [itself] completely unacceptable,"" he added. OnlyFans declined our request for an interview. In a statement it said: ""We use a combination of state-of-the-art technology together with human monitoring and review to prevent children under the age of 18 from sharing content on OnlyFans. ""This is something that we take very seriously. We constantly review our systems to ensure they are as robust as possible."" It added that its systems continue to evolve as new technology becomes available to ""help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds becoming OnlyFans users"". The pandemic has transformed many people's online lives in ways they might never have imagined. But the consequences of children sharing explicit images - especially when the content could be leaked - may continue to haunt them for a long time to come. All names of children and adults associated with them have been changed to protect their identities. Additional reporting by Chris Bell.

Holiday islands considered for green listIslands such as the Canary Islands and Majorca may be put on the UK's green list of holiday destinations.BusinessComments,"Islands such as the Canary Islands and Majorca could be placed on the UK green list of destinations for holidaymakers, a government minister has said. The move may happen from 7 June, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. At present, people from England can holiday in green list countries without having to quarantine on their return. But travel operators and airlines have been pushing to be allowed to fly to holiday islands when the rest of the country is on the amber list. So, that could mean people could holiday in popular destinations such as the Canary Islands and Majorca even if mainland Spain stays on the amber list. Mr Shapps told the transport select committee that he has ""asked The Joint Biosecurity Centre to consider islands within their criteria and where possible they would look to include if them if facts stacked up"". When pushed on whether this was possible by the review on 7 June, Mr Shapps replied: ""technically that is possible, but I actually don't know because I don't have the data yet as to whether islands make the grade."" People across the UK can legally take foreign holidays - althoughWelsh residents have been asked not to travel abroad. On England's traffic light list, foreign countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests in place for each. Government guidance is that you should not holiday in red or amber countries - which include Spain and most other countries. Are you planning to travel to the Canary Islands or Majorca? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Holidays to countries on the green list - including Portugal - can go ahead without a need to quarantine when you return. The list is reviewed every three weeks and countries can change status at short notice. There are similar rules for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Read more here. Mr Shapps was pushed to explain why so few countries were on the green list when UK vaccination levels were high. He said: ""If you send people, even vaccinated people, to other countries, given vaccinations are not 100% reliable, then you are exposing them to risks that they don't have if they stay in the UK. ""'That's fine', you might say, 'That's their risk'. But not if they bring that back, then that is all of our risk, so we do have to move with the science."" Mr Shapps said there is scientific analysis of each destination when decisions are made to include countries on the list, including vaccination levels, virus levels and ability to track how the virus is evolving. At the moment this is a waiting game, he said, and that travel would change when other countries catch up with UK levels of vaccinations. ""Part of this is having the patience to let this come through the system."" He also said deaths in Germany and France are now higher per day than in the UK and allowing UK citizens to travel there exposes them to risk. Mr Shapps added: ""I am the Secretary of State for Transport, I want people to be able to travel, I have no other agency than [to] get people travelling, but we also recognise as a responsible government that it has to be safe."" Mr Shapps added that people may be able to use vaccine certificates rather than tests to travel later on in June. Earlier on Wednesday, the bosses of Tui, Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport called on the government to expand the green list of destinations. The holiday bosses didn't feel that Portugal, the only mass-market tourist destination on the green list, is enough of an offering for the summer. Tour operators want the British holidaymakers' favourites of Majorca, Tenerife and Gran Canaria opened up, destinations they believe have good health protocols in place. They want UK holidaymakers back on some of their favourite beaches. Steve Heapy, the chief executive of Jet2, said: ""We feel the government is overly cautious and that the list of green countries could be expanded with little increase in risk."" He said that there was currently no benefit of the vaccination programme when travelling, adding: ""People need a break, people want to get back to normal."" How are travel rules being relaxed?

Hillsborough aftermath trial collapses,"L-R: Alan Foster, Donald Denton and Peter Metcalf were accused of altering police statements Two retired police officers and an ex-solicitor accused of altering police statements after the Hillsborough disaster have been acquitted. Retired Ch Supt Donald Denton, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster and former solicitor Peter Metcalf had denied perverting the course of justice. Mr Justice William Davis ruled they had no case to answer. Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said the ruling was ""an absolute mockery"" and a ""shambles"". ""We're always the losers no matter what the outcome today,"" she said. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the crush at the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground on 15 April 1989. Why the Hillsborough prosecutions collapsed Timeline of the Hillsborough disaster Mr Denton, Mr Foster and Mr Metcalf were accused of trying to minimise the blame placed on South Yorkshire Police in the aftermath of the disaster by altering statements. However, the judge said the statements had been prepared for the public inquiry chaired by Lord Taylor in 1990. He said this was not a statutory inquiry and therefore not considered ""a court of law"", so it was not a ""course of public justice"" which could be perverted. Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said they would not seek leave to appeal against the judge's decision. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the disaster on 15 April 1989 Speaking at the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield, Ms Aspinall said: ""We've got the death certificate with 96 unlawfully killed but yet not one person has been held to account."" She said she felt there was ""a cover-up over a cover-up"" but she said the Hillsborough families ""could go no further"". ""They are tired, they are getting old, a lot of them have gone to their graves tormented and to me that is a disgrace,"" she said. Mary Corrigan, whose 17-year-old son Keith McGrath died in the tragedy, said she was ""so angry"". She also criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for their lack of support for the families. Hillsborough fans unlawfully killed How the disaster unfolded Remembering the 96 victims Liverpool FC said the decision was a ""huge disappointment"" and victims had been ""let down yet again"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who campaigned with the Hillsborough families, said: ""We've all given it our all but our all was not enough to secure any accountability for the 96 unlawful deaths on British soil."" He said the scales of justice were ""weighed against ordinary people"" and called forHillsborough Lawto be introduced. It would place a duty of candour on all public officials and require parity of legal funding for bereaved families and public bodies, he said. Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was a ""stain on the judicial system"" and ""yet another kick in the teeth"" for the families. This video can not be played ""This is the angriest I've ever really felt"" Sue Hemming, from the CPS, said they were ""right to bring this case and for a court to hear the evidence of what happened in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster"". She said what had been heard in court would have been ""surprising to many"". ""That a publicly funded authority can lawfully withhold information from a public inquiry charged with finding out why 96 people died at a football match, in order to ensure that it never happened again - or that a solicitor can advise such a withholding, without sanction of any sort - may be a matter which should be subject to scrutiny."" Flowers and tributes were left at the Hillsborough Memorial after the collapse of the trial Claire Bassett, from the IOPC, added: ""Serious questions must remain over the public and moral duty of police in helping authorities to understand and prevent a further disaster like Hillsborough."" Mr Denton, 83, of Sheffield; Mr Foster, 74, of Harrogate; and Mr Metcalf, 71, of Ilkley, had all denied two counts of perverting the course of justice. The three men were on trial at the Nightingale Court at the Lowry Theatre in Salford for more than four weeks. By Judith Moritz, BBC North of England correspondent The collapse of this trial will anger and distress many of those who've spent 32 years campaigning for ""Justice for the 96"". It's likely that it will mark the end of the legal road for them, which has been long and winding, with few ups and many downs. In 2016 they celebrated the inquests verdicts which found that the 96 had been unlawfully killed, and that the fans were not to blame. There were high hopes for accountability. But the match commander David Duckenfield was acquitted after two trials, and the collapse of this aftermath trial means that no one has been convicted for the alleged cover-up. Over the last three decades there have been four trials, two sets of inquests, a public inquiry and several other investigations and reviews. Despite all of those proceedings, it remains the case that the bereaved families feel let down by the system. They feel that they know the truth of what happened to their loved ones, but they haven't had justice. Jonathan Goldberg QC, who represented Mr Metcalf, said ""there was no cover-up at Hillsborough"" and the three men had been exonerated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1998. ""Despite this, the witch hunt has continued to resurrect the same tired accusations by prosecuting three old men,"" he said. Mike Rainford, solicitor for Mr Denton, said the pain and suffering for the families was ""unimaginable"" but this trial ""should never have taken place at all"". The ruling brought an end to the ""myth of the Hillsborough cover-up once and for all"", he said, after ""years of lies, half-truths and rumours"". Mr Foster's solicitor Paul Harris said the trial had been a ""shameful waste of public resources"". ""This narrative of an alleged cover-up, when every document was meticulously preserved and maintained, was not borne out by the evidence,"" he said. Andy Burnham, Margaret Aspinall and Steve Rotheram gave their reaction outside Anfield stadium The Hillsborough inquests concluded in 2016 that the 96 football fans who died as a result of the crush were unlawfully killed. The original inquests in 1991 had ruled the deaths were accidental but those conclusions were quashed following the 2012Hillsborough Independent Panel's damning reportinto the disaster. Three other men were also charged in 2017 following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into allegations of a cover-up by police following the tragedy. All charges against Sir Norman Bettison, who was accused of trying to blame Liverpool fans,were dropped in 2018. Sheffield Wednesday's former club secretary Graham Mackrellwas found guilty of a health and safety offencein May 2019. The match commander on the day, David Duckenfield,was cleared of gross negligence manslaughterin November 2019.

Swiss abandon years of EU talks and reject treatySwitzerland's decision to halt efforts on reaching an over-arching treaty could harm ties with the EU.Europe,"The Swiss-EU trading relationship is governed by more than 120 deals After years of talks, Switzerland has scrapped efforts aimed at agreeing an over-arching treaty with the EU. Switzerland is not in the European Union but has signed up to many of its policies, such as freedom of movement. The relationship is currently governed by more than 120 bilateral deals, and a failure to replace them with one framework deal could harm ties. ""We regret this decision,external, given the progress that has been made over the last years,"" the EU Commission said. The EU-Switzerland free trade agreement dates back to 1972. The Commission - the executive body for the EU's 27 member states - said that without an EU-Swiss framework agreement, modernising that relationship would not be possible. Existing deals were ""not up to speed"" and the impact of Switzerland's decision would have to be analysed, it warned. The Swiss government has highlighted three issues,external: protection of wages, rules governing state aid, and the right of EU citizens working in Switzerland to claim Swiss welfare benefits as part of freedom of movement. Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said Switzerland could not accept EU demands for equal rights for EU workers as it would have meant an unwanted ""paradigm shift"" in Switzerland's migration policy. The government also feared it could lead to higher social security costs. The two sides can rely on the patchwork of bilateral agreements but those deals will eventually go out of date, so Switzerland will not have access to a potential electricity union or other areas of the single market that change. However, one bilateral deal lapsed only this week on trade in medical technology products and the Swiss MedTech organisation saidit would cost the industry 114m Swiss francs,external(Â£90m; â¬104m) and 75m every year afterwards. The right-wing Swiss People's Party last year pushed for an end to freedom of movement with the EU The right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) welcomed the breakdown of talks as ""a victory for Swiss self-determination"", while trade unions were also pleased as they had been concerned about the impact on wage protection and public services. But most political parties in Switzerland were critical: Socialist party president Roger Nordmann described it as ""Black Wednesday"". Allow Twitter content?

Even without a treaty, it was in their shared interests to maintain their ""proven bilateral approach"", he said.

Russia starts giving animals Covid jabRussia has started vaccinating animals with what it says is the world's first animal-specific jab.,"Several regions have now started vaccinations at veterinary clinics (stock photo) Russia has started vaccinating animals against coronavirus, officials say. In March, Russia announced it had registered what it said was the world's first animal-specific jab. Several regions have now started vaccinations at veterinary clinics, Russia's veterinary watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor, told local media. Interest has been shown in the Carnivak-Cov vaccine by the EU, Argentina South Korea and Japan, the agency said. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to humans, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and mink. Will your pet need a coronavirus vaccine? The period of immunity after a Carnivak-Cov jab is an estimated six months. Julia Melano, adviser to the head of Rosselkhoznadzor, said clinics were seeing an increase in vaccination requests from ""breeders, pet-owners who travel frequently and also citizens whose animals roam freely"",according to the RIA news agency.,external Another vaccine is being developed by the US veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis. Covid-19 has been a serious problem for mink - semi-aquatic mammals farmed for their fur. Multiple countries have reported infections in farmed mink which, in some cases, have fallen severely ill or died. The largest mink outbreak happened in Denmark,which culled millions of animalsand shut down the industry completely until 2022. There is also some evidencethat mink have passed the virus back to humans in a mutated form.

Biden orders urgent new report on Covid origins,"President Biden asked intelligence agencies to report back to him within 90 days on the virus's origin US President Joe Biden has ordered intelligence officials to ""redouble"" efforts to investigate the origins of Covid-19, including the theory that it came from a laboratory in China. He said the US intelligence community was split on whether it came from a lab accident or emerged from human contact with an infected animal. Mr Biden asked the groups to report back to him within 90 days. China has rejected the laboratory theory. ""Smear campaigns and blame shifting are making a comeback, and the conspiracy theory of 'lab leak' is resurfacing,"" its embassy in the US said in a statement on Thursday. Since it was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, more than 168 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide and at least 3.5 million deaths reported. Wuhan: City of silence Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim Has India's deadly second wave peaked? Authorities linked early Covid cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. But recent US media reports have suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a laboratory in China, perhaps through an accidental leak. In what passes for relative transparency in the US government, the Biden administration has conceded the American intelligence community is split on Covid-19's origins - it could be the lab or animal-to-human contact - and no-one is near certain about it. That marks a big shift from the derision heaped on the lab theory by many in the media and politics last year, when Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senator Tom Cotton and others floated the idea. Mr Trump and Mr Pompeo didn't help the situation, however, as they were coy about the grounds for their suspicion. And their theories floating alongside more far-fetched ones, such as that the disease was manufactured as a bioweapon in a Chinese lab. That possibility still seems highly unlikely. The public may never know the full truth about the virus' origins, particularly if China continues to be uncooperative. Mr Biden is pledging a full investigation, however, and if the US finds conclusive evidence of a lab leak, it will mean more than just a few prominent figures having to eat crow and re-evaluate their trust in authoritative ""conclusions"". It could place very real strain on US-China relations for years to come. Ina statement on Wednesday,external, President Biden said he had asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office, ""including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident"". On receiving it this month, he asked for ""additional follow-up"". Mr Biden said the majority of the intelligence community had ""coalesced"" around those two scenarios, but ""do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other"". The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was linked to early Covid cases The president has now asked agencies to ""redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"". He concluded by saying the US would ""keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation"". Beijing has previously suggested Covid-19 could have come from a US laboratory instead. In its statement, the Chinese embassy said it supported a full investigation into ""some secretive bases and biological laboratories all over the world"". A spokesman for China's foreign ministry on Thursday hit out at the ""dark history"" of the US intelligence community, and said the Biden administration's ""motive and purposes"" were clear. Mr Biden's statement came asCNN reported,externalthat the president's administration this spring shut down a state department investigation into whether the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab, deeming the probe an ineffective use of resources. Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. In April 2020, US State Department cables came to light that showed embassy officials wereworried about biosecurity at the lab. The leak allegations were widely dismissed as a fringe conspiracy theory. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report written jointly with Chinese scientists on the origins of Covid-19 which saidthe chances of it having started in a lab were ""extremely unlikely"". It said the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal, but more research was needed. However, questions have persisted and recent reports attributed to US intelligence sources say three members of the Wuhan Institute of Virology were admitted to hospital in November 2019, several weeks before China acknowledged the first case of the new disease in the community. Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial 'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, has maintained he believes the virus was passed from animals to humans, though he conceded this month he was no longer confident Covid-19 had developed naturally. This video can not be played In January 2021, the BBC's Robin Brant visited the Wuhan market where Covid-19 was first traced - a year after the first outbreak Mr Biden's statement came the day after Xavier Becerra, US secretary for health and human services, urged the WHO to ensure a ""transparent"" investigation into the virus's origins. ""Phase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak,""he said. Bat scientists find new coronavirus evidence On Tuesday, Mr Trump sought to take credit ina statement to the New York Post,external.

Uber recognises union for first time in landmark dealTrade union GMB can negotiate for drivers after it was recognised by the ride-hailing giant.Business,"Ride-hailing giant Uber has agreed to recognise a trade union for the first time, in a landmark deal that should benefit gig economy workers. The GMB union will have the power to represent UK drivers in discussions over earnings, pensions, benefits and their health and wellbeing. Mick Rix, national officer at GMB, said it could be ""the first step to a fairer working life for millions of people"". Uber said the move showed its commitment to its 70,000 UK drivers. ""While Uber and GMB may not seem like obvious allies, we've always agreed that drivers must come first, and today we have struck this important deal to improve workers' protections,"" said Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe. For years Uber resisted calls to recognise unions, which had criticised the firm for not granting drivers basic rights such as sick pay or a minimum wage. Uber had argued its drivers were freelancers and not entitled to these benefits. But in March it changed its stance after the Supreme Court ruled that its drivers should be classified as workers - a category entitling them to better pay and conditions. Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage Now it provides them with a National Living Wage guarantee, holiday pay and a pension. And by recognising GMB, the ride-hailing giant has gone a step further, giving a union the right to negotiate on behalf of drivers for the first time. The two sides will meet quarterly to discuss driver issues and concerns while Uber has agreed access rights for GMB representatives at driver hubs. Under the agreement, GMB and Uber will discuss topics such as Uber's National Living Wage guarantee, pensions and holiday pay. Drivers won't automatically become members, and to be represented by the union, they will have to sign up. GMB called on other operators to follow suit, saying the deal offered a golden opportunity to improve workers' rights. ""This agreement shows gig economy companies don't have to be a Wild West on the untamed frontier of employment rights,"" said Mr Rix. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the agreement would give Uber drivers ""a real voice at work"". Uber worker benefits 'will make a difference' But the organisation that brought the Supreme Court employment case against Uber, the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU), said there was ""good reason for workers and their unions to be cautious"". It said Uber was still not providing a minimum wage for all working time and holiday pay in the UK, ""despite the recent UK Supreme Court ruling in our favour"". ""At this time ADCU is not prepared to enter into a recognition agreement with Uber,"" it added. The UK is the only country in which Uber has recognised a union, and its is still being challenged by its drivers in many other markets over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed.

People buying homes before viewing in 'mad' market,"Estate agent Mel John said times were tough for first time buyers House buyers are making offers on homes before viewing them in order to gain an edge in a ""mad"" housing market, estate agents and sellers have said. Wales has seen the biggest house price growth in the UK, up by an average of 11% in the past year. Many estate agents claim some properties sell within hours, sometimes with dozens of offers on the table. But the rapid sales have also left some sellers stuck as they have not had enough time to find new homes. Megan Davies, 32, a midwife and mother-of-two from Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is hoping to find a family home with her partner. Last month demand for some properties in the town sawpeople queueing overnightoutside an estate agents. Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses House sales and prices see early spring surge Ms Davies sold her house within hours of putting it on the market and her partner was made an offer on his property before any viewings. However the pair have now been unable to find anywhere to move on to. ""The properties that we've been to see, they're going for Â£20,000 to Â£30,000 over the asking price,"" Ms Davies toldBBC Wales Live. ""There's so much competition out there at the moment and Aberdare is just mad, it's just gone mad. ""We've seen a house today that's gone live 15 minutes ago, we were told 'we've got no bookings left'. ""We've gone through agents, we've gone through social media, we've gone through the selling pages for houses, Rightmove etc. This video can not be played 'Somebody just would always pip you to the post' ""I'm at the point now where I think, do we do flyers in the estates that we want to live on? That's the point we're at. There's nothing around. It really does take over your life."" Rhiannon Williams, 30, said she had given up trying to buy her first home near Caerphilly after struggling for months with high asking prices. ""The first house viewing looked amazing on the photos, but when I viewed I wasn't sold by the property. The estate agent said someone had put an offer in on the house and hadn't viewed it,"" she said. ""I thought that was absolutely insane as the asking price was already the top end for that area. ""I had two viewings booked for this week, both have been cancelled as they have now been sold. ""It's a huge step to purchase your first home, I think the prices are so high at the moment and people are offering over the asking price too, so I don't stand a chance to get on the ladder."" Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses Buyer demand outstrips homes on market Mel John, an estate agent in Caerphilly, said she had been hearing more stories of practices like ""gazumping"" - where a seller goes back on a verbal agreement and accepts a higher offer. ""I've walked away from a number of properties where the sellers would have encouraged gazumping, as an estate agent I wouldn't want to be any part of that,"" she said. ""I don't think it's ethical really for anybody to go down that route."" Ms John said the property market boom was great news for many, but she had sympathy for buyers who were frequently missing out. ""There's a lot of buyers out there,"" she said. ""When a property comes on the market we'll do a block booking of viewings on that property and whoever makes an offer, we'd be looking for their best and final offer. ""Of course it's not nice telling people that they can't buy the properties, that the seller has decided to go with someone else. Many people want to move to Wales from over the border, estate agents say ""It is really difficult and especially with young first-time buyers who can only afford a certain amount - which is more or less in the investors price range. ""They're desperate to get on the property ladder and they've got so much competition."" In north and west Wales the current housing market boom has re-energised debates around second homes. However James Skudder, the director of Country Living Estate Agents in Pembrokeshire, said the landscape among his clients had significantly shifted from second-home buyers, with many now moving over the border to make Wales their permanent home. ""Since Covid has hit, the market hasn't stopped,"" said Mr Skudder. ""I would say on a daily basis 95% of the enquires are from people outside of the area. ""Pembrokeshire has always had a pull with second-home buyers, whereas now people are relocating for their primary residence. ""What we're finding is if you've holidayed in an area for 20 or 30 years and now you're finding you can work from home - people are saying to each other 'look let's make the dream move we've always wanted to'. ""People are relocating themselves and they're relocating their businesses. ""They're now moving their businesses online because it's an easier way to live and it can bring happiness to the business and the family. ""People have just had an awakening to what's going on surrounding Covid and certainly this is what's helping push the pricing in the area, people being unhappy over working long hours and being stuck in the city. An area like this is being pushed through the roof."" He added: ""It's a crazy market, right the way from low end, right up to the premium market.""

Russia starts giving animals Covid jab,"Several regions have now started vaccinations at veterinary clinics (stock photo) Russia has started vaccinating animals against coronavirus, officials say. In March, Russia announced it had registered what it said was the world's first animal-specific jab. Several regions have now started vaccinations at veterinary clinics, Russia's veterinary watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor, told local media. Interest has been shown in the Carnivak-Cov vaccine by the EU, Argentina South Korea and Japan, the agency said. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to humans, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and mink. Will your pet need a coronavirus vaccine? The period of immunity after a Carnivak-Cov jab is an estimated six months. Julia Melano, adviser to the head of Rosselkhoznadzor, said clinics were seeing an increase in vaccination requests from ""breeders, pet-owners who travel frequently and also citizens whose animals roam freely"",according to the RIA news agency.,external Another vaccine is being developed by the US veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis. Covid-19 has been a serious problem for mink - semi-aquatic mammals farmed for their fur. Multiple countries have reported infections in farmed mink which, in some cases, have fallen severely ill or died. The largest mink outbreak happened in Denmark,which culled millions of animalsand shut down the industry completely until 2022.

Amazon buys Hollywood studio MGM for $8.45bn,"MGM is home to the James Bond movie franchise and the Handmaid's Tale TV series Amazon has agreed to buy the historic MGM studios for $8.45bn (Â£5.97bn). MGM is one of Hollywood's most famous studios, having produced classic films such as Some Like It Hot and Singin' In The Rain. The sale will give the tech giant's Prime streaming service access to a huge back catalogue of content. An Amazon executive said on Wednesday: ""It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling."" Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, added: ""The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of Intellectual Property in the deep catalogue that we plan to re-imagine and develop together with MGM's talented team."" The deal will boost Amazon Prime Video's offering with about 4,000 films, including the James Bond franchise and Legally Blonde, as well as 17,000 television shows such as the Handmaid's Tale TV series. The producers behind James Bond have said, however, that the sale would not affect the upcoming release of No Time to Die in cinemas,according to Variety magazine.,external ""We are committed to continuing to make James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience,"" said Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson. Netflix shares plunge amid fears virus boom is over AT&T and Discovery to create new streaming giant MGM Holdings, the parent company of MGM Studios, had reportedly been exploring a sale since 2020. Amazon said in a statement that the deal would allow MGM, founded in 1924 and recognised by its roaring Leo the Lion logo, ""to continue to do what they do best: great storytelling."" Kevin Ulrich, Chairman of the Board of Directors of MGM, said: ""I am very proud that MGM's Lion, which has long evoked the Golden Age of Hollywood, will continue its storied history. ""The opportunity to align MGM's storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination."" But Amazon's streaming service now faces a long list of competitors, such as Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV - all hoping that any binge-watching habits developed during lockdown will stick. Amazon Studios is looking to build on the success of some of its original films, such as the Oscar-winner Sound of Metal ""Amazon is seeking to become a more prominent player in the entertainment world, and there's no better way to do that than by buying one of the most iconic movie studios in Hollywood,"" said Jesse Cohen, a senior financial analyst at Investing.com. ""It's all about content as the streaming war heats up."" The Amazon-MGM deal comes within weeks oftelecoms giant AT&T agreeing a $43bn dealto combine its WarnerMedia unit with Discovery to create a new streaming giant. The tie-up brings one of Hollywood's biggest studios and Discovery's channels under the same ownership - but also marks the entry of another player into the market.

Who is the PM's former adviser?,"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis.

This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

M&S to close 30 more shops as Ocado deal pays offThe store chain has reported big losses for last year as the pandemic took its toll on clothing sales.BusinessComments,"Marks & Spencer has said it plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan. M&S has already closed or relocated 59 main stores, as well ascutting 7,000 jobsacross stores and management. The chain has reported big losses for last year as the pandemic took its toll on clothing sales. But food sales were up thanks to its Ocado tie-up, contributing to ""a resilient financial performance in a year of disruption"". M&S made a pre-tax loss of Â£201.2m in the 52 weeks to 27 March, down from a Â£67.2m profit in the previous year. The High Street stalwart currently has 254 full-line stores, selling clothing, homewares and food. It says that a number of them are in long-term decline and cannot justify future investment. About 30 stores will gradually close over the next decade, while another 80 will be moved to better locations or merged with nearby shops. The group will open 17 new or expanded main stores over the next two years, including a number of former Debenhams sites. ""We are committed to stores and believe they can be a true source of competitive advantage,"" chief executive Steve Rowe told investors and journalists on a conference call. ""But they need to be the right stores, in the right location, with the right services."" After accounting for one-off restructuring costs, the business made a profit of Â£41.6m, but this was still down almost 90% on the previous year. The M&S losses were mainly due to the performance of its clothing division, which suffered as non-essential retail was closed during lockdown. The 137-year-old chain said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 31.5%, reflecting the ""heavy impact"" of lockdowns on stores. ""In most of this time, our operations have been severely constrained by the change in day-to-day living, the effects of social distancing and partial or full closure of large parts of our store estate,"" M&S said. ""This has resulted in substantial changes to the mix of products customers have bought and a wide divergence of store formats and channels."" However, M&S said clothing and home sales had been growing since reopening. The store chain also took heart from improved figures in its food division as its tie-up with online grocer Ocado took effect. It said food delivered ""strong underlying like-for-like growth"" of 6.9%, after adjusting for the closure of hospitality and the adverse impact on franchise sales. ""In a year like no other, we have delivered a resilient trading performance,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. ""In addition, by going further and faster in our transformation through the Never the Same Again programme, we moved beyond fixing the basics to forge a reshaped M&S. ""With the right team in place to accelerate change in the trading businesses and build a trajectory for future growth, we now have a clear line of sight on the path to make M&S special again. The transformation has moved to the next phase."" Like many other retailers, Marks & Spencer has endured a difficult 12 months thanks to the pandemic. But there are signs in these results that the ordeal may have started to forge a stronger company, one more attuned to customer tastes and the move to online shopping. M&S traded profitably, but posted an overall loss of Â£201m because of the cost of its restructuring plans. It is closing shops, laying off staff and investing heavily in the internet. Food sales were up 7%, clothing sales down by one third, with sales in High Street and city centre outlets sharply down. One of the new online ventures, a joint venture with Ocado, is proving a success. One quarter of every Ocado delivery is now M&S products, and the partnership contributed Â£78m of profit. Investors liked the idea of a revival plan at M&S that for once seems to have some bite: the shares were up 4% at 162p in early trading. M&S said it had received government support of Â£306.1m, which had partly offset the effect of lost trade and enabled it to keep its employees on. ""The figures show the catastrophic effect the pandemic has had on business with retail stores on the High Street,"" Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail consultancy Savvy Marketing, told the BBC's Today programme. ""There is some glimmer of hope as we come out of it, but it's one of those years that we can't draw too many conclusions from, because it's been so unbelievably different and something that no retailer could have reasonably planned for."" But she added that ""real benefits"" were starting to come from the M&S turnaround programme. ""Ocado's driven an awful lot of income and is really introducing a whole new group of shoppers to M&S and there's never a better time than to tie up with a food delivery business than during a pandemic,"" she added.

Dominic Cummings: who is the PM's former adviser?,"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London.

M&S to close 30 more shops as Ocado deal pays offThe store chain has reported big losses for last year as the pandemic took its toll on clothing sales.,"Marks & Spencer has said it plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan.

Russia starts giving animals Covid jabRussia has started vaccinating animals with what it says is the world's first animal-specific jab.Europe,"Several regions have now started vaccinations at veterinary clinics (stock photo) Russia has started vaccinating animals against coronavirus, officials say. In March, Russia announced it had registered what it said was the world's first animal-specific jab. Several regions have now started vaccinations at veterinary clinics, Russia's veterinary watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor, told local media. Interest has been shown in the Carnivak-Cov vaccine by the EU, Argentina South Korea and Japan, the agency said. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to humans, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and mink. Will your pet need a coronavirus vaccine? The period of immunity after a Carnivak-Cov jab is an estimated six months. Julia Melano, adviser to the head of Rosselkhoznadzor, said clinics were seeing an increase in vaccination requests from ""breeders, pet-owners who travel frequently and also citizens whose animals roam freely"",according to the RIA news agency.,external Another vaccine is being developed by the US veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis. Covid-19 has been a serious problem for mink - semi-aquatic mammals farmed for their fur. Multiple countries have reported infections in farmed mink which, in some cases, have fallen severely ill or died. The largest mink outbreak happened in Denmark,which culled millions of animalsand shut down the industry completely until 2022. There is also some evidencethat mink have passed the virus back to humans in a mutated form.

Shell ordered to cut emissions by Dutch courtCampaigners say it is the first time a company has been legally bound by the Paris climate accord.,"Activists hugged in court after the judge delivered the verdict A court in the Netherlands has ruled in a landmark case that the oil giant Shell must reduce its emissions. By 2030, Shell must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels, the civil court ruled. The Shell group is responsible for its own CO2 emissions and those of its suppliers, the verdict said. It is the first time a company has been legally obliged to align its policies with the Paris climate accords, says Friends of the Earth (FoE). The environmental group brought the case to court in 2019, alongside six other bodies and more than 17,000 Dutch citizens. Though the decision only applies in the Netherlands, it could have wider effects elsewhere. BBC Netherlands correspondentAnna Holligan tweeted that it was a ""precedent-setting judgement"",external. A Shell spokesperson said they ""fully expect to appeal today's disappointing court decision"" and added that they are stepping up efforts to cut emissions. ""Urgent action is needed on climate change, which is why we have accelerated our efforts to become a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Shell was investing ""billions of dollars in low-carbon energy, including electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, renewables and biofuels"". ""This is really great news and a gigantic victory for the earth, our children and for all of us,"" FoE directorDonald Pols said in a statement,external. ""The judge leaves no doubt about it: Shell is causing dangerous climate change and must now stop it quickly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Under the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. The legally binding treaty came into force on 4 November 2016. The US withdrew under former President Donald Trump but has since rejoined under President Joe Biden. Why did the US rejoin the Paris climate agreement? A really simple guide to climate change A number of groups around the world are now trying to force companies and governments to comply with the accords through the courts. Shell has previously saidit wants net zero emissions for itselfand from products used by its customers by 2050. In December its defence lawyers told the Dutch court the company was already taking ""serious steps"" to move away from fossil fuels, and said there was no legal basis for the case. Other major oil companies are also making changes amid a greater global focus on cutting emissions. On Wednesday Chevron investors voted in favour of a proposal to cut its customer emissions, while shareholders at Exxon elected two climate activists to its board after months of wrangling over its business direction. The Shell verdict is a massive win for environmental campaigners, and other industrial giants will be scrambling to figure out how it could affect them. Because suddenly it's not good enough for firms to comply with the law on their emissions - in an extraordinary case like this, they have to comply with global climate policy too. The company's defence is that if people feel progress towards cutting emissions is too slow, they should lobby governments - not Shell - to change policies and introduce financial incentives. The judges have clearly decided that Shell should be taking responsibility itself for cutting emissions much faster. The firm will surely appeal - and it might well win the case in a higher court. But this verdict alone will be a warning to companies round the world that the battle against climate change may be spelling the end of anything resembling ""business as usual"". Shell - full name Royal Dutch Shell - is a British-Dutch multinational. Because its headquarters are in The Hague, FoE was able to bring a case to a Dutch court. Earlier this year another Dutch court ruled that Shell was responsible for damage caused by oil leaks in the Niger Delta, and ordered the company to pay compensation to farmers. Shell, however, has said the leaks were the result of ""sabotage"".

received 132,000 Astra Zeneca doses from Covax in late March. The

"Boy, 16, fatally stabbed in street","Police said paramedics tried to save Rayon Pennycook, but he died at the scene A 16-year-old boy has been stabbed to death, with three teenagers arrested on suspicion of his murder. Rayon Pennycook was killed on Constable Road in Corby on Tuesday evening. Northamptonshire Police was called at about 19:00 BST and, despite the best efforts of paramedics, he died at the scene. Officers have arrested three boys, one aged 15 and two aged 17, on suspicion of murder and the force said the inquiry was moving at a ""fast pace"". A police forensics team was working inside a large cordoned-off area on Constable Road/Reynolds Road on Wednesday Rayon's family said his death had left them ""devastated"". ""There are no words which can accurately describe the pain we are suffering,"" they said in a statement. ""It is unbearable."" The family said the teenager had ""his whole life ahead of him"" and was in the process of applying for an apprenticeship.

Floral tributes have been left at the scene on the town's Hazel Leys estate A wide cordon remained in place on Wednesday and an officer was standing guard outside a property on the adjacent Reynolds Road.

M&S to close 30 more shops as Ocado deal pays off,"Marks & Spencer has said it plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan. M&S has already closed or relocated 59 main stores, as well ascutting 7,000 jobsacross stores and management. The chain has reported big losses for last year as the pandemic took its toll on clothing sales. But food sales were up thanks to its Ocado tie-up, contributing to ""a resilient financial performance in a year of disruption"". M&S made a pre-tax loss of Â£201.2m in the 52 weeks to 27 March, down from a Â£67.2m profit in the previous year. The High Street stalwart currently has 254 full-line stores, selling clothing, homewares and food. It says that a number of them are in long-term decline and cannot justify future investment. About 30 stores will gradually close over the next decade, while another 80 will be moved to better locations or merged with nearby shops. The group will open 17 new or expanded main stores over the next two years, including a number of former Debenhams sites. ""We are committed to stores and believe they can be a true source of competitive advantage,"" chief executive Steve Rowe told investors and journalists on a conference call. ""But they need to be the right stores, in the right location, with the right services."" After accounting for one-off restructuring costs, the business made a profit of Â£41.6m, but this was still down almost 90% on the previous year. The M&S losses were mainly due to the performance of its clothing division, which suffered as non-essential retail was closed during lockdown. The 137-year-old chain said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 31.5%, reflecting the ""heavy impact"" of lockdowns on stores. ""In most of this time, our operations have been severely constrained by the change in day-to-day living, the effects of social distancing and partial or full closure of large parts of our store estate,"" M&S said. ""This has resulted in substantial changes to the mix of products customers have bought and a wide divergence of store formats and channels."" However, M&S said clothing and home sales had been growing since reopening. The store chain also took heart from improved figures in its food division as its tie-up with online grocer Ocado took effect. It said food delivered ""strong underlying like-for-like growth"" of 6.9%, after adjusting for the closure of hospitality and the adverse impact on franchise sales. ""In a year like no other, we have delivered a resilient trading performance,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. ""In addition, by going further and faster in our transformation through the Never the Same Again programme, we moved beyond fixing the basics to forge a reshaped M&S. ""With the right team in place to accelerate change in the trading businesses and build a trajectory for future growth, we now have a clear line of sight on the path to make M&S special again. The transformation has moved to the next phase."" Like many other retailers, Marks & Spencer has endured a difficult 12 months thanks to the pandemic. But there are signs in these results that the ordeal may have started to forge a stronger company, one more attuned to customer tastes and the move to online shopping. M&S traded profitably, but posted an overall loss of Â£201m because of the cost of its restructuring plans. It is closing shops, laying off staff and investing heavily in the internet. Food sales were up 7%, clothing sales down by one third, with sales in High Street and city centre outlets sharply down. One of the new online ventures, a joint venture with Ocado, is proving a success. One quarter of every Ocado delivery is now M&S products, and the partnership contributed Â£78m of profit. Investors liked the idea of a revival plan at M&S that for once seems to have some bite: the shares were up 4% at 162p in early trading. M&S said it had received government support of Â£306.1m, which had partly offset the effect of lost trade and enabled it to keep its employees on. ""The figures show the catastrophic effect the pandemic has had on business with retail stores on the High Street,"" Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail consultancy Savvy Marketing, told the BBC's Today programme. ""There is some glimmer of hope as we come out of it, but it's one of those years that we can't draw too many conclusions from, because it's been so unbelievably different and something that no retailer could have reasonably planned for."" But she added that ""real benefits"" were starting to come from the M&S turnaround programme. ""Ocado's driven an awful lot of income and is really introducing a whole new group of shoppers to M&S and there's never a better time than to tie up with a food delivery business than during a pandemic,"" she added.

A really simple guide to climate change A number of groups around the world are now trying to force companies and governments to comply with the accords through the courts. Shell has previously saidit wants net zero emissions for itselfand from products used by its customers by 2050. In December its defence lawyers told the Dutch court the company was already taking ""serious steps"" to move away from fossil fuels, and said there was no legal basis for the case. Other major oil companies are also making changes amid a greater global focus on cutting emissions. On Wednesday Chevron investors voted in favour of a proposal to cut its customer emissions, while shareholders at Exxon elected two climate activists to its board after months of wrangling over its business direction. The Shell verdict is a massive win for environmental campaigners, and other industrial giants will be scrambling to figure out how it could affect them. Because suddenly it's not good enough for firms to comply with the law on their emissions - in an extraordinary case like this, they have to comply with global climate policy too. The company's defence is that if people feel progress towards cutting emissions is too slow, they should lobby governments - not Shell - to change policies and introduce financial incentives. The judges have clearly decided that Shell should be taking responsibility itself for cutting emissions much faster. The firm will surely appeal - and it might well win the case in a higher court. But this verdict alone will be a warning to companies round the world that the battle against climate change may be spelling the end of anything resembling ""business as usual"". Shell - full name Royal Dutch Shell - is a British-Dutch multinational. Because its headquarters are in The Hague, FoE was able to bring a case to a Dutch court. Earlier this year another Dutch court ruled that Shell was responsible for damage caused by oil leaks in the Niger Delta, and ordered the company to pay compensation to farmers. Shell, however, has said the leaks were the result of ""sabotage"".

Holiday islands considered for green listIslands such as the Canary Islands and Majorca may be put on the UK's green list of holiday destinations.Business,"Islands such as the Canary Islands and Majorca could be placed on the UK green list of destinations for holidaymakers, a government minister has said. The move may happen from 7 June, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. At present, people from England can holiday in green list countries without having to quarantine on their return. But travel operators and airlines have been pushing to be allowed to fly to holiday islands when the rest of the country is on the amber list. So, that could mean people could holiday in popular destinations such as the Canary Islands and Majorca even if mainland Spain stays on the amber list. Mr Shapps told the transport select committee that he has ""asked The Joint Biosecurity Centre to consider islands within their criteria and where possible they would look to include if them if facts stacked up"". When pushed on whether this was possible by the review on 7 June, Mr Shapps replied: ""technically that is possible, but I actually don't know because I don't have the data yet as to whether islands make the grade."" People across the UK can legally take foreign holidays - althoughWelsh residents have been asked not to travel abroad. On England's traffic light list, foreign countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests in place for each. Government guidance is that you should not holiday in red or amber countries - which include Spain and most other countries. Are you planning to travel to the Canary Islands or Majorca? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Holidays to countries on the green list - including Portugal - can go ahead without a need to quarantine when you return. The list is reviewed every three weeks and countries can change status at short notice. There are similar rules for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Read more here. Mr Shapps was pushed to explain why so few countries were on the green list when UK vaccination levels were high. He said: ""If you send people, even vaccinated people, to other countries, given vaccinations are not 100% reliable, then you are exposing them to risks that they don't have if they stay in the UK. ""'That's fine', you might say, 'That's their risk'. But not if they bring that back, then that is all of our risk, so we do have to move with the science."" Mr Shapps said there is scientific analysis of each destination when decisions are made to include countries on the list, including vaccination levels, virus levels and ability to track how the virus is evolving. At the moment this is a waiting game, he said, and that travel would change when other countries catch up with UK levels of vaccinations. ""Part of this is having the patience to let this come through the system."" He also said deaths in Germany and France are now higher per day than in the UK and allowing UK citizens to travel there exposes them to risk. Mr Shapps added: ""I am the Secretary of State for Transport, I want people to be able to travel, I have no other agency than [to] get people travelling, but we also recognise as a responsible government that it has to be safe."" Mr Shapps added that people may be able to use vaccine certificates rather than tests to travel later on in June. Earlier on Wednesday, the bosses of Tui, Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport called on the government to expand the green list of destinations. The holiday bosses didn't feel that Portugal, the only mass-market tourist destination on the green list, is enough of an offering for the summer. Tour operators want the British holidaymakers' favourites of Majorca, Tenerife and Gran Canaria opened up, destinations they believe have good health protocols in place. They want UK holidaymakers back on some of their favourite beaches. Steve Heapy, the chief executive of Jet2, said: ""We feel the government is overly cautious and that the list of green countries could be expanded with little increase in risk."" He said that there was currently no benefit of the vaccination programme when travelling, adding: ""People need a break, people want to get back to normal."" How are travel rules being relaxed?

"DIY and building projects hit by materials shortageIndustry warns people to delay home improvement due to shortage of cement, electric components, timber and steel.Business","Building materials are running short in the UK, leaving DIY projects in doubt and building companies under pressure. The Construction Leadership Councilhas warned,externalthat cement, some electrical components, timber, steel and paints are all in short supply. It blamed ""unprecedented levels of demand"" that are set to continue. The Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. ""Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,"" said chief executive Brian Berry. ""We can't build our way to recovery from the pandemic if we don't have the materials."" Roland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn. ""The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,"" he said. The supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials. There are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer. There has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs, said Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association. ""Shipping costs have risen sharply due a shortage of empty containers from Covid-19-related issues and the sharp recovery in global demand,"" he told the BBC. For instance the cost of shipping a 40ft container from Asia to Northern Europe soared from $1,500 (Â£1,061) in summer 2020 to more than $8,300 (Â£5,873) by May 2021, he said. With demand globally increasing and the UK importing many of its raw materials, lead times for orders are lengthening while prices are shooting up. Mohsen Kashan of Milton Keynes has been waiting nine months to have his bathroom renovated after a leak. But with problems getting parts and tradespeople he told the BBC he now simply can't afford the rising costs he is being quoted. ""It's a simple job for a small bathroom just 2 metres by 2.5 meters. But we have been quoted Â£10,000 for what used to be less than Â£5,000. ""To expect to pay between Â£8,000 and Â£10,000 for a small bathroom seems too much,"" Mohsen said. He's been struggling since September to get the repairs done. ""We've tried B&Q, a couple of other stores, as well as installers and half a dozen fitters. ""Either the cost of the materials has been too high, the cost of labour too high or materials are simply unavailable."" The Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double during the course of the year. ""My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement,"" said Mr Berry. Amy Archer says her firm has never experienced such severe shortages ""It is really challenging in terms of supplies. It's nothing that we've ever experienced before,"" said Amy Archer, deputy managing director of the Swift Group, based in Cottingham near Hull, which makes caravans, motorhomes and holiday homes. She said there are two issues: ""The first is a shortage of materials in the first place and the delays that we've seen through the ports because of shipping container shortages."" The second is rising prices: ""Commodity prices are going up because there's such a huge demand for products."" Booming activity domestically hasn't helped too, she said. ""Lots of people are doing home improvements such as new kitchens and that's all draining the materials that are available."" Bayram Timber's Chris Husband says wood prices are rising fast. ""This really is unprecedented,"" said Chris Husband, commercial director at wood supplier Bayram Timber. ""The sheer volume of timber that's being demanded at the moment, they are struggling to keep pace with it in Scandinavia, where we source most of our raw material."" His company, based in North Ferriby near Hull. competes against others across the globe for the timber and is ""having to wait in line"", he said. ""It's having a huge inflationary effect on the raw material price and obviously the lead times as well."" Is the current situation here to stay? ""We're pretty much certain that this is with us for the rest of this year,"" he said. Brexit has also affected the UK's timber supply as 80% of softwood comes from Europe, said Thomas Goodman, construction expert, from MyJobQuote. Steel is also in short supply, as global demand exceeds supply. ""Many steel manufacturers have stopped taking orders, as they are worried that panic buying will result in extremely low stock,"" he said. The shipping costs issue is likely to subside in the next three to six months but global demand is likely to remain high for the next six to nine months, predicted Mr Francis. Mr Berry pointed out that small builders can't stockpile or plan jobs far in advance, unlike larger firms, so they need to be assured that the materials will be at the merchants when they need them. ""Consumers must be aware that shortages are causing delays to projects, and that costs may change in the months ahead because of this pressure,"" he said. Building materials supplier Travis Perkins said: ""In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to ensure healthy stock availability for our customers."" But with higher material prices for the moment, many homeowners and builders are choosing to delay work until the necessary resources become more affordable.

Hillsborough aftermath trial collapsesTwo ex-police officers and a force solicitor are acquitted of perverting the course of justice.Liverpool,"L-R: Alan Foster, Donald Denton and Peter Metcalf were accused of altering police statements Two retired police officers and an ex-solicitor accused of altering police statements after the Hillsborough disaster have been acquitted. Retired Ch Supt Donald Denton, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster and former solicitor Peter Metcalf had denied perverting the course of justice. Mr Justice William Davis ruled they had no case to answer. Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said the ruling was ""an absolute mockery"" and a ""shambles"". ""We're always the losers no matter what the outcome today,"" she said. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the crush at the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground on 15 April 1989. Why the Hillsborough prosecutions collapsed Timeline of the Hillsborough disaster Mr Denton, Mr Foster and Mr Metcalf were accused of trying to minimise the blame placed on South Yorkshire Police in the aftermath of the disaster by altering statements. However, the judge said the statements had been prepared for the public inquiry chaired by Lord Taylor in 1990. He said this was not a statutory inquiry and therefore not considered ""a court of law"", so it was not a ""course of public justice"" which could be perverted. Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said they would not seek leave to appeal against the judge's decision. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the disaster on 15 April 1989 Speaking at the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield, Ms Aspinall said: ""We've got the death certificate with 96 unlawfully killed but yet not one person has been held to account."" She said she felt there was ""a cover-up over a cover-up"" but she said the Hillsborough families ""could go no further"". ""They are tired, they are getting old, a lot of them have gone to their graves tormented and to me that is a disgrace,"" she said. Mary Corrigan, whose 17-year-old son Keith McGrath died in the tragedy, said she was ""so angry"". She also criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for their lack of support for the families. Hillsborough fans unlawfully killed How the disaster unfolded Remembering the 96 victims Liverpool FC said the decision was a ""huge disappointment"" and victims had been ""let down yet again"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who campaigned with the Hillsborough families, said: ""We've all given it our all but our all was not enough to secure any accountability for the 96 unlawful deaths on British soil."" He said the scales of justice were ""weighed against ordinary people"" and called forHillsborough Lawto be introduced. It would place a duty of candour on all public officials and require parity of legal funding for bereaved families and public bodies, he said. Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was a ""stain on the judicial system"" and ""yet another kick in the teeth"" for the families. This video can not be played ""This is the angriest I've ever really felt"" Sue Hemming, from the CPS, said they were ""right to bring this case and for a court to hear the evidence of what happened in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster"". She said what had been heard in court would have been ""surprising to many"". ""That a publicly funded authority can lawfully withhold information from a public inquiry charged with finding out why 96 people died at a football match, in order to ensure that it never happened again - or that a solicitor can advise such a withholding, without sanction of any sort - may be a matter which should be subject to scrutiny."" Flowers and tributes were left at the Hillsborough Memorial after the collapse of the trial Claire Bassett, from the IOPC, added: ""Serious questions must remain over the public and moral duty of police in helping authorities to understand and prevent a further disaster like Hillsborough."" Mr Denton, 83, of Sheffield; Mr Foster, 74, of Harrogate; and Mr Metcalf, 71, of Ilkley, had all denied two counts of perverting the course of justice. The three men were on trial at the Nightingale Court at the Lowry Theatre in Salford for more than four weeks. By Judith Moritz, BBC North of England correspondent The collapse of this trial will anger and distress many of those who've spent 32 years campaigning for ""Justice for the 96"". It's likely that it will mark the end of the legal road for them, which has been long and winding, with few ups and many downs. In 2016 they celebrated the inquests verdicts which found that the 96 had been unlawfully killed, and that the fans were not to blame. There were high hopes for accountability. But the match commander David Duckenfield was acquitted after two trials, and the collapse of this aftermath trial means that no one has been convicted for the alleged cover-up. Over the last three decades there have been four trials, two sets of inquests, a public inquiry and several other investigations and reviews. Despite all of those proceedings, it remains the case that the bereaved families feel let down by the system. They feel that they know the truth of what happened to their loved ones, but they haven't had justice. Jonathan Goldberg QC, who represented Mr Metcalf, said ""there was no cover-up at Hillsborough"" and the three men had been exonerated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1998. ""Despite this, the witch hunt has continued to resurrect the same tired accusations by prosecuting three old men,"" he said. Mike Rainford, solicitor for Mr Denton, said the pain and suffering for the families was ""unimaginable"" but this trial ""should never have taken place at all"". The ruling brought an end to the ""myth of the Hillsborough cover-up once and for all"", he said, after ""years of lies, half-truths and rumours"". Mr Foster's solicitor Paul Harris said the trial had been a ""shameful waste of public resources"". ""This narrative of an alleged cover-up, when every document was meticulously preserved and maintained, was not borne out by the evidence,"" he said. Andy Burnham, Margaret Aspinall and Steve Rotheram gave their reaction outside Anfield stadium The Hillsborough inquests concluded in 2016 that the 96 football fans who died as a result of the crush were unlawfully killed. The original inquests in 1991 had ruled the deaths were accidental but those conclusions were quashed following the 2012Hillsborough Independent Panel's damning reportinto the disaster. Three other men were also charged in 2017 following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into allegations of a cover-up by police following the tragedy. All charges against Sir Norman Bettison, who was accused of trying to blame Liverpool fans,were dropped in 2018. Sheffield Wednesday's former club secretary Graham Mackrellwas found guilty of a health and safety offencein May 2019. The match commander on the day, David Duckenfield,was cleared of gross negligence manslaughterin November 2019.

Funding boost for rail services announced,"A section of the TransPennine line will be electrified as part of the plan New stations, faster journeys and more reliable services have been promised as part of a Â£401m government investment in rail travel. Most of the money will be used to upgrade the TransPennine route between York, Leeds and Manchester. The plan will also see new stations in Leeds and Exeter and increased freight capacity at the Port of Southampton. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the money would help deliver services ""passengers can count on"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said a Â£317m boost would see the TransPennine line electrified between York and Church Fenton andtracks doubled around Leeds and Huddersfieldto ""improve connectivity"". About Â£69m will pay for the first stage of the Oxford Phase 2 project to improve freight capacity from Southampton into the Midlands and the North and the final Â£15m will provide new stations at Marsh Barton in Exeter, and White Rose and Thorpe Park in Leeds. Mr Shapps said the aim was to create ""a modern, green and innovative railway"". The funding announcement coincided with the completion of the first phase of the Â£1.5bn Midland Main Line Upgrade, which has supported the launch of East Midlands Railway's (EMR) first electric services on the route between Corby in Northamptonshire and London St Pancras. The project will see journey times between Sheffield and London cut by up to 30 minutes, the DfT said. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

UK experiment could sweep aside fusion hurdleResults from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial fusion power.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Artwork: Mast Upgrade has been testing an innovative design Initial results from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial power based on nuclear fusion, experts say. The researchers believe they now have a better way to remove the excess heat produced by fusion reactions. This intense heat can melt materials used inside a reactor, limiting the amount of time it can operate for. The system, which has been likened to a car exhaust, resulted in a tenfold reduction in the heat. The tests were carried out at the Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade nuclear fusion experiment at Culham in Oxfordshire. The Â£55m device began operating in October last year, after a seven-year build. UK fusion experiment used in hunt for clean energy Largest nuclear fusion project begins assembly Nuclear fusion: 'A question of when, not if' Nuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes that power the Sun - and other stars - here on planet Earth. But the trick is getting more energy out of the reactions than you put in. This goal continues to elude teams of scientists and engineers around the world, who are working to make fusion power a reality. Existing nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. One common fusion approach uses a reactor design called a tokamak, in which powerful magnetic fields are used to control charged gas - or plasma - inside a doughnut-shaped container. Inside the tokamak, where plasmas are controlled by magnetic fields An international fusion megaproject called Iter is currently under construction in southern France. Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said it would be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of bringing fusion power to the grid. But he added that Iter's size and cost meant that ""if every time you wanted to build a unit, you had to raise that sum of money, then the penetration into the market would be determined by economics, not technology"". Mast Upgrade is one attempt to come up with a template for more compact, cheaper fusion reactors. It makes use of an innovative design known as a spherical tokamak to squeeze the fuel into a 4.4m-tall, 4m-wide space. By comparison, the containment vessel Iter will use to control its fusion reactions is 11.4m tall and 19.4m wide. But Mast Upgrade's bijou dimensions come at a price: ""You're making something that's hotter than the Sun... in a smaller volume. How you then get the heat out becomes a big challenge,"" said Prof Chapman. The core of the plasma within the tokamak reaches temperatures of 100 million C. Without an exhaust system that can handle this unimaginable heat, materials in the design would have to be regularly replaced - significantly affecting the amount of time a power plant could operate for. The new exhaust system being trialled at Culham is known as a Super-X divertor. This would allow components in future commercial tokamaks to last for much longer; greatly increasing the power plant's availability, improving its economic viability and reducing the cost of fusion electricity. Tests at Mast Upgrade have shown at least a tenfold reduction in the heat on materials with the Super-X system. Researchers said the results were a ""game-changer"" for the promise of fusion power plants that could provide affordable, efficient electricity. Against the background of climate change, fusion could offer a clean and virtually limitless source of energy. Dr Andrew Kirk, lead scientist on Mast Upgrade, said the results were ""the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade"". ""We built Mast Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded. ""Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant."" The success of the exhaust system for Mast Upgrade delivers a boost to plans for a prototype fusion power plant in the UK called Step. It is expected to come online sometime in the 2040s. The Mast Upgrade facility will have its official opening ceremony on Wednesday, where guest of honour, astronaut Tim Peake, will create his own artificial star by running a plasma test on the machine.

The Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. ""Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,"" said chief executive Brian Berry. ""We can't build our way to recovery from the pandemic if we don't have the materials."" Roland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn. ""The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,"" he said. The supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials. There are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer. There has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs, said Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association. ""Shipping costs have risen sharply due a shortage of empty containers from Covid-19-related issues and the sharp recovery in global demand,"" he told the BBC. For instance the cost of shipping a 40ft container from Asia to Northern Europe soared from $1,500 (Â£1,061) in summer 2020 to more than $8,300 (Â£5,873) by May 2021, he said. With demand globally increasing and the UK importing many of its raw materials, lead times for orders are lengthening while prices are shooting up. Mohsen Kashan of Milton Keynes has been waiting nine months to have his bathroom renovated after a leak. But with problems getting parts and tradespeople he told the BBC he now simply can't afford the rising costs he is being quoted. ""It's a simple job for a small bathroom just 2 metres by 2.5 meters. But we have been quoted Â£10,000 for what used to be less than Â£5,000. ""To expect to pay between Â£8,000 and Â£10,000 for a small bathroom seems too much,"" Mohsen said. He's been struggling since September to get the repairs done. ""We've tried B&Q, a couple of other stores, as well as installers and half a dozen fitters. ""Either the cost of the materials has been too high, the cost of labour too high or materials are simply unavailable."" The Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double during the course of the year. ""My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement,"" said Mr Berry. Amy Archer says her firm has never experienced such severe shortages ""It is really challenging in terms of supplies. It's nothing that we've ever experienced before,"" said Amy Archer, deputy managing director of the Swift Group, based in Cottingham near Hull, which makes caravans, motorhomes and holiday homes. She said there are two issues: ""The first is a shortage of materials in the first place and the delays that we've seen through the ports because of shipping container shortages."" The second is rising prices: ""Commodity prices are going up because there's such a huge demand for products."" Booming activity domestically hasn't helped too, she said. ""Lots of people are doing home improvements such as new kitchens and that's all draining the materials that are available."" Bayram Timber's Chris Husband says wood prices are rising fast. ""This really is unprecedented,"" said Chris Husband, commercial director at wood supplier Bayram Timber. ""The sheer volume of timber that's being demanded at the moment, they are struggling to keep pace with it in Scandinavia, where we source most of our raw material."" His company, based in North Ferriby near Hull. competes against others across the globe for the timber and is ""having to wait in line"", he said. ""It's having a huge inflationary effect on the raw material price and obviously the lead times as well."" Is the current situation here to stay? ""We're pretty much certain that this is with us for the rest of this year,"" he said. Brexit has also affected the UK's timber supply as 80% of softwood comes from Europe, said Thomas Goodman, construction expert, from MyJobQuote. Steel is also in short supply, as global demand exceeds supply. ""Many steel manufacturers have stopped taking orders, as they are worried that panic buying will result in extremely low stock,"" he said. The shipping costs issue is likely to subside in the next three to six months but global demand is likely to remain high for the next six to nine months, predicted Mr Francis. Mr Berry pointed out that small builders can't stockpile or plan jobs far in advance, unlike larger firms, so they need to be assured that the materials will be at the merchants when they need them. ""Consumers must be aware that shortages are causing delays to projects, and that costs may change in the months ahead because of this pressure,"" he said. Building materials supplier Travis Perkins said: ""In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to ensure healthy stock availability for our customers."" But with higher material prices for the moment, many homeowners and builders are choosing to delay work until the necessary resources become more affordable.

UK experiment could sweep aside fusion hurdle,"Artwork: Mast Upgrade has been testing an innovative design Initial results from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial power based on nuclear fusion, experts say. The researchers believe they now have a better way to remove the excess heat produced by fusion reactions. This intense heat can melt materials used inside a reactor, limiting the amount of time it can operate for. The system, which has been likened to a car exhaust, resulted in a tenfold reduction in the heat. The tests were carried out at the Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade nuclear fusion experiment at Culham in Oxfordshire. The Â£55m device began operating in October last year, after a seven-year build. UK fusion experiment used in hunt for clean energy Largest nuclear fusion project begins assembly Nuclear fusion: 'A question of when, not if' Nuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes that power the Sun - and other stars - here on planet Earth. But the trick is getting more energy out of the reactions than you put in. This goal continues to elude teams of scientists and engineers around the world, who are working to make fusion power a reality. Existing nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. One common fusion approach uses a reactor design called a tokamak, in which powerful magnetic fields are used to control charged gas - or plasma - inside a doughnut-shaped container. Inside the tokamak, where plasmas are controlled by magnetic fields An international fusion megaproject called Iter is currently under construction in southern France. Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said it would be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of bringing fusion power to the grid. But he added that Iter's size and cost meant that ""if every time you wanted to build a unit, you had to raise that sum of money, then the penetration into the market would be determined by economics, not technology"". Mast Upgrade is one attempt to come up with a template for more compact, cheaper fusion reactors. It makes use of an innovative design known as a spherical tokamak to squeeze the fuel into a 4.4m-tall, 4m-wide space. By comparison, the containment vessel Iter will use to control its fusion reactions is 11.4m tall and 19.4m wide. But Mast Upgrade's bijou dimensions come at a price: ""You're making something that's hotter than the Sun... in a smaller volume. How you then get the heat out becomes a big challenge,"" said Prof Chapman. The core of the plasma within the tokamak reaches temperatures of 100 million C. Without an exhaust system that can handle this unimaginable heat, materials in the design would have to be regularly replaced - significantly affecting the amount of time a power plant could operate for. The new exhaust system being trialled at Culham is known as a Super-X divertor. This would allow components in future commercial tokamaks to last for much longer; greatly increasing the power plant's availability, improving its economic viability and reducing the cost of fusion electricity. Tests at Mast Upgrade have shown at least a tenfold reduction in the heat on materials with the Super-X system. Researchers said the results were a ""game-changer"" for the promise of fusion power plants that could provide affordable, efficient electricity. Against the background of climate change, fusion could offer a clean and virtually limitless source of energy. Dr Andrew Kirk, lead scientist on Mast Upgrade, said the results were ""the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade"". ""We built Mast Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded. ""Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant."" The success of the exhaust system for Mast Upgrade delivers a boost to plans for a prototype fusion power plant in the UK called Step. It is expected to come online sometime in the 2040s. The Mast Upgrade facility will have its official opening ceremony on Wednesday, where guest of honour, astronaut Tim Peake, will create his own artificial star by running a plasma test on the machine.

"Millions cannot afford water bills, says watchdog","More than a million households are struggling to pay their water bills, a consumer group has said. Some people have even had to skip meals to pay for water, the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) said. It is calling for a single ""social tariff"", based on a percentage of people's incomes to lower the costs. The government said it would work with industry to ""build a stronger, better and fairer water service for those who need it most"". According to the CCW, there are about 1.7 million people in ""water poverty"", which it defines as having to spend more than 5% of their income after housing costs on water bills. However, about three million households are in danger of slipping into this category. Covid inequality: 'I struggled with the bills and my health' Covid: The baby bank helping families living in poverty These include people on Universal Credit, where any small shocks to their income could tip them over the edge, said Andy White, senior policy manager at CCW. He said about 260,000 people were getting help with their bills from a patchwork of social schemes run by water companies. However, it is a ""postcode lottery"" as to how much help people can get - and the watchdog believes a social tariff would tackle this. There has been significant focus in recent years on fuel poverty, and pressure placed on private companies to make sure the most vulnerable are protected. This research shifts that spotlight onto the affordability of another essential utility - water. Whether you are part of the 1.5 million households classed as currently in water poverty or the 3 million who are on the cusp of it, where you live can make a huge difference to the help you receive. Some companies ask struggling households to pay just 20% of a bill, while in other areas they still face the full charge. Some have a lowest bill guarantee, but many companies don't, and only half of the providers have a crisis fund for those most in need. Although most of these changes could be implemented immediately by companies themselves, the government would have to bring in new laws to create a social tariff which standardised that basic payment rate. CCW chief executive Emma Clancy said: ""We have a golden opportunity to create a simpler and fairer system and end the indignity of people skipping meals or other essentials to pay their water bill. ""Many people are craving certainty in these difficult times and these proposed changes would give millions of households one less thing to worry about and greater peace of mind - whatever the future holds."" The tariff would either be taxpayer funded, or taken from a single pot created by taking money from everyone's water bill in England and Wales. CCW has conducted independent reviews of water affordability in England and Wales. It found that five out of six customers who cannot afford their water bills are not getting the help they need, despite a significant rise in company support schemes over the past decade. It also found that some of the schemes were hampered by insufficient funding and large regional variations in eligibility criteria. Those who are eligible get an average bill reduction of Â£190. CCW also urged the industry to do more to prevent households slipping into water poverty. That could include giving customers greater choice over how they pay their water bills through technology, and providing tailored financial help. Companies should also write off water charges while benefits claimants are awaiting their first Universal Credit payment, it added. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said she would consider the recommendations and work with the sector ""to build a stronger, better and fairer water service"". Christine McGourty, chief executive of Water UK, which represents water companies, said: ""Levels of support for customers have never been greater. ""Over the past year water companies have gone to unprecedented lengths to help hundreds of thousands of household customers who could least afford their bills, with support such as payment breaks and extra assistance for those most in need - but we know there's more to be done."" Gillian Cooper from Citizens Advice said: ""Water is essential, but sadly we know not everyone can easily afford it. ""As households continue to feel the impact of the pandemic, people facing financial difficulties need better support to help them pay their bills. ""CCW's proposal to establish a single social tariff would help make water bills affordable for all households on low incomes.""

Abortion paper blocked from executive discussion,"Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019 after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution Delays in implementing Northern Ireland's abortion laws have been a ""deeply troubling exercise in finger-pointing"", a court has heard. Abortion became legal in 2020, following a vote by MPs during the collapse of devolution. Stormont has since been under pressure to establish a permanent, central abortion service, but this has not happened yet. It is being challenged in a judicial review at the High Court in Belfast. The NI Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is taking the case against the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Representing the NIHRC, David Blundell QC said there had been an ""abdication of legal responsibility"" by all three parties. He told Mr Justice Colton that the main factor in taking the case was the protection of women's human rights. Mr Blundell said without a fully-funded and staffed model, Northern Ireland health trusts have only been able to operate a ""skeleton service"" for early medical abortions - up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Women seeking a termination beyond that gestation have still been required, in some circumstances, to travel to England during the coronavirus pandemic, the court was told. The judicial review has been brought by the NI Human Rights Commission against Stormont and Westminster ""Much was known about the truly terrible impact on such women, but has not led to any service being provided,"" said Mr Blundell. He also said the Northern Ireland secretary had a ""clear statutory obligation"" in law to ensure full abortion services were commissioned by Stormont ""expeditiously"", and that this had not happened. In March, Mr Lewistook powers that would allow him to direct Stormont to set up servicesbut he has not done so yet. The government has said itwanted ""concrete progress"" from the executive by this summer. Mr Blundell said the NIHRC is calling for the laws to be implemented fully by September, but that the Department of Health has suggested that it could take eight to 12 months to establish services. ""In practice, women in Northern Ireland do not have access to abortion services to which they're entitled by law - it's been 14 months without them,"" he added. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland The court was also told the Northern Ireland Executive had ""totally failed to engage"" with the Department of Health in relation to the commissioning of services. Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann has maintained that he cannot set it up without support from the Stormont Executive,as the matter is controversial and cross-cutting- the responsibility of more than one department. The court heard that evidence from the department suggested the First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party opposes abortion, had ""made clear"" that proposals were not going to be passed by the executive. Robin Swann maintains he cannot set up full abortion services without executive consent Mr Blundell said the executive's position was a ""driving factor"" in contributing to the delays, along with financial challenges raised by the health minister with Westminster. The case is scheduled to last for two days. It is expected to hear from representatives for the secretary of state, as well as lawyers for the Department of Health and the Stormont Executive. Reserved judgement is expected to be delivered in the next few months. Meanwhile, in a separate development, BBC News NI understands that a paper from Mr Swann on the commissioning of abortion services was blocked from executive discussion last week. One short-term option suggested exploring if Irish health authorities could provide Northern Ireland women with early medical abortion access. It is believed Mr Swann had proposed whether it would be possible for Northern Ireland to quickly commission a limited early medical abortion service. That would allow women in the early stages of a pregnancy - up to 10 weeks - to take abortion pills at home following a consultation with a doctor. The service, known as telemedicine, hasbeen in place in other parts of the UK and the Republic of Irelandsince the start of the coronavirus pandemic. However, BBC News NI understands that Mr Swann's paper did not make it onto the executive's agenda to be considered by all ministers. Any paper can be blocked from discussion, if it does not have support of both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP is staunchly opposed to abortion. Sinn FÃ©in has previously called for abortion services to be commissioned promptly.

Rayon Pennycook was killed on Constable Road in Corby on Tuesday evening. Northamptonshire Police was called at about 19:00 BST and, despite the best efforts of paramedics, he died at the scene. Officers have arrested three boys, one aged 15 and two aged 17, on suspicion of murder and the force said the inquiry was moving at a ""fast pace"".

Cummings to be questioned by MPs over coronavirusBoris Johnson's ex-adviser will be answering questions about the government's handling of the pandemic.UK Politics,"The whiteboard picture, tweeted by Dominic Cummings, ahead of his committee hearing Former adviser Dominic Cummings is to be questioned by MPs about the government's response to the pandemic. Mr Cummings, who left Downing Street last autumn, has been highly critical of the government in recent weeks. He is also expected to claim later that Boris Johnson was keen to visit the Queen in person five days before the first Covid lockdown began. Downing Street has denied this happened and said their conversation on 18 March last year took place on the telephone. The Queen went from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle shortly afterwards. This happened in order to protect the then 93-year-old monarch from the danger of catching coronavirus. LIVE: Follow the question session Dominic Cummings: Who is the PM's former adviser? Cummings testimony: What is herd immunity? Mr Cummingswill appear before a joint parliamentary committeelooking into the handling of the pandemic. He has already claimed that ""secrecy"" within Whitehall ""contributed greatly to the catastrophe"". Ahead of his meeting,Mr Cummings tweeted a picture,externalwhich he called the ""first sketch of Plan B, PM study, Fri 13/3 eve - shown PM Sat 14/4"". It appears to show a whiteboard with sketches from attendees at the meeting. Mr Cummings promised to reveal further details later. The questioning of Mr Cummings will take place at a joint session of Parliament's health and social care and the science and technology select committees. Mr Cummings - who gave evidence to one committee in March - will be grilled by MPs at 09:30 BST for around four hours, with live coverage taking place on the BBC News website. Questions are expected to cover a range of topics including decision-making in the early months, the timings of lockdowns and other restrictions and the procurement processes. It is likely that Mr Cummings will also face questions about his controversial trip to Barnard Castle during the first lockdown in 2020, when he said he wanted to check his eyesight before driving back to London. This video can not be played Who is Dominic Cummings and does he matter? Last week, he tweeted the government's pandemic plan had been""part disaster, part non-existent""and he called for more scrutiny of policy to ensure the Indian variant is dealt with. And in March, he described the department of health as a""smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE (personal protective equipment)""at the start of the pandemic. Ahead of Mr Cummings's committee appearance, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would ""leave others to judge how reliable a witness that former adviser happens to be"". Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Cummings: Health department 'smoking ruin' on Covid ""I think most people will have come to their own conclusions a long time ago about [this] particular adviser and the reliability of statements and the rest of it,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""There was no manual to deal with a pandemic - and it's easy to be captain of hindsight on these things but we had to work on things day by day,"" he added. Dominic Cummings was in the room when decisions about lives and deaths were made during the Covid emergency. He's made no secret of his frustration now, at the speed of decision-making when the virus had arrived in the UK, blasting the level of preparations and the government's original plan. The former adviser's real fire today is expected to be turned on the prime minister's attitude to bringing back restrictions in September when Covid was again taking hold, but No 10 did not act until later on. It is understood he will share his belief that the failure to toughen the rules led to a much bigger outbreak of the disease. And he will suggest that was Boris Johnson's terrible mistake because the government by then had a much better understanding of the virus, could have predicted what would happen and could have prevented much of it. Yet Mr Cummings cannot extricate himself from what went wrong. Few others had more influence over the decisions that were made. Read more from Laura.

M&S swings to big loss as pandemic takes its toll,"Marks & Spencer has said it plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan. M&S has already closed or relocated 59 main stores, as well ascutting 7,000 jobsacross stores and management. The chain has reported big losses for last year as the pandemic took its toll on clothing sales. But food sales were up thanks to its Ocado tie-up, contributing to ""a resilient financial performance in a year of disruption"". M&S made a pre-tax loss of Â£201.2m in the 52 weeks to 27 March, down from a Â£67.2m profit in the previous year. The High Street stalwart currently has 254 full-line stores, selling clothing, homewares and food. It says that a number of them are in long-term decline and cannot justify future investment. About 30 stores will gradually close over the next decade, while another 80 will be moved to better locations or merged with nearby shops. The group will open 17 new or expanded main stores over the next two years, including a number of former Debenhams sites. ""We are committed to stores and believe they can be a true source of competitive advantage,"" chief executive Steve Rowe told investors and journalists on a conference call. ""But they need to be the right stores, in the right location, with the right services."" After accounting for one-off restructuring costs, the business made a profit of Â£41.6m, but this was still down almost 90% on the previous year. The M&S losses were mainly due to the performance of its clothing division, which suffered as non-essential retail was closed during lockdown. The 137-year-old chain said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 31.5%, reflecting the ""heavy impact"" of lockdowns on stores. ""In most of this time, our operations have been severely constrained by the change in day-to-day living, the effects of social distancing and partial or full closure of large parts of our store estate,"" M&S said. ""This has resulted in substantial changes to the mix of products customers have bought and a wide divergence of store formats and channels."" However, M&S said clothing and home sales had been growing since reopening. The store chain also took heart from improved figures in its food division as its tie-up with online grocer Ocado took effect. It said food delivered ""strong underlying like-for-like growth"" of 6.9%, after adjusting for the closure of hospitality and the adverse impact on franchise sales. ""In a year like no other, we have delivered a resilient trading performance,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. ""In addition, by going further and faster in our transformation through the Never the Same Again programme, we moved beyond fixing the basics to forge a reshaped M&S. ""With the right team in place to accelerate change in the trading businesses and build a trajectory for future growth, we now have a clear line of sight on the path to make M&S special again. The transformation has moved to the next phase."" Like many other retailers, Marks & Spencer has endured a difficult 12 months thanks to the pandemic. But there are signs in these results that the ordeal may have started to forge a stronger company, one more attuned to customer tastes and the move to online shopping. M&S traded profitably, but posted an overall loss of Â£201m because of the cost of its restructuring plans. It is closing shops, laying off staff and investing heavily in the internet. Food sales were up 7%, clothing sales down by one third, with sales in High Street and city centre outlets sharply down. One of the new online ventures, a joint venture with Ocado, is proving a success. One quarter of every Ocado delivery is now M&S products, and the partnership contributed Â£78m of profit. Investors liked the idea of a revival plan at M&S that for once seems to have some bite: the shares were up 4% at 162p in early trading. M&S said it had received government support of Â£306.1m, which had partly offset the effect of lost trade and enabled it to keep its employees on. ""The figures show the catastrophic effect the pandemic has had on business with retail stores on the High Street,"" Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail consultancy Savvy Marketing, told the BBC's Today programme. ""There is some glimmer of hope as we come out of it, but it's one of those years that we can't draw too many conclusions from, because it's been so unbelievably different and something that no retailer could have reasonably planned for."" But she added that ""real benefits"" were starting to come from the M&S turnaround programme. ""Ocado's driven an awful lot of income and is really introducing a whole new group of shoppers to M&S and there's never a better time than to tie up with a food delivery business than during a pandemic,"" she added.

Funding boost for rail services announcedA Â£401m government investment will see routes electrified and new stations for Leeds and Exeter.England,"A section of the TransPennine line will be electrified as part of the plan New stations, faster journeys and more reliable services have been promised as part of a Â£401m government investment in rail travel. Most of the money will be used to upgrade the TransPennine route between York, Leeds and Manchester. The plan will also see new stations in Leeds and Exeter and increased freight capacity at the Port of Southampton. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the money would help deliver services ""passengers can count on"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said a Â£317m boost would see the TransPennine line electrified between York and Church Fenton andtracks doubled around Leeds and Huddersfieldto ""improve connectivity"". About Â£69m will pay for the first stage of the Oxford Phase 2 project to improve freight capacity from Southampton into the Midlands and the North and the final Â£15m will provide new stations at Marsh Barton in Exeter, and White Rose and Thorpe Park in Leeds. Mr Shapps said the aim was to create ""a modern, green and innovative railway"". The funding announcement coincided with the completion of the first phase of the Â£1.5bn Midland Main Line Upgrade, which has supported the launch of East Midlands Railway's (EMR) first electric services on the route between Corby in Northamptonshire and London St Pancras. The project will see journey times between Sheffield and London cut by up to 30 minutes, the DfT said. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Cummings to be questioned by MPs over coronavirus,"The whiteboard picture, tweeted by Dominic Cummings, ahead of his committee hearing Former adviser Dominic Cummings is to be questioned by MPs about the government's response to the pandemic. Mr Cummings, who left Downing Street last autumn, has been highly critical of the government in recent weeks. He is also expected to claim later that Boris Johnson was keen to visit the Queen in person five days before the first Covid lockdown began. Downing Street has denied this happened and said their conversation on 18 March last year took place on the telephone. The Queen went from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle shortly afterwards. This happened in order to protect the then 93-year-old monarch from the danger of catching coronavirus. LIVE: Follow the question session Dominic Cummings: Who is the PM's former adviser? Cummings testimony: What is herd immunity? Mr Cummingswill appear before a joint parliamentary committeelooking into the handling of the pandemic. He has already claimed that ""secrecy"" within Whitehall ""contributed greatly to the catastrophe"". Ahead of his meeting,Mr Cummings tweeted a picture,externalwhich he called the ""first sketch of Plan B, PM study, Fri 13/3 eve - shown PM Sat 14/4"". It appears to show a whiteboard with sketches from attendees at the meeting. Mr Cummings promised to reveal further details later. The questioning of Mr Cummings will take place at a joint session of Parliament's health and social care and the science and technology select committees. Mr Cummings - who gave evidence to one committee in March - will be grilled by MPs at 09:30 BST for around four hours, with live coverage taking place on the BBC News website. Questions are expected to cover a range of topics including decision-making in the early months, the timings of lockdowns and other restrictions and the procurement processes. It is likely that Mr Cummings will also face questions about his controversial trip to Barnard Castle during the first lockdown in 2020, when he said he wanted to check his eyesight before driving back to London. This video can not be played Who is Dominic Cummings and does he matter? Last week, he tweeted the government's pandemic plan had been""part disaster, part non-existent""and he called for more scrutiny of policy to ensure the Indian variant is dealt with. And in March, he described the department of health as a""smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE (personal protective equipment)""at the start of the pandemic. Ahead of Mr Cummings's committee appearance, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would ""leave others to judge how reliable a witness that former adviser happens to be"". Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Cummings: Health department 'smoking ruin' on Covid ""I think most people will have come to their own conclusions a long time ago about [this] particular adviser and the reliability of statements and the rest of it,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""There was no manual to deal with a pandemic - and it's easy to be captain of hindsight on these things but we had to work on things day by day,"" he added. Dominic Cummings was in the room when decisions about lives and deaths were made during the Covid emergency. He's made no secret of his frustration now, at the speed of decision-making when the virus had arrived in the UK, blasting the level of preparations and the government's original plan.

UK experiment could sweep aside fusion hurdleResults from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial fusion power.,"Artwork: Mast Upgrade has been testing an innovative design Initial results from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial power based on nuclear fusion, experts say. The researchers believe they now have a better way to remove the excess heat produced by fusion reactions. This intense heat can melt materials used inside a reactor, limiting the amount of time it can operate for. The system, which has been likened to a car exhaust, resulted in a tenfold reduction in the heat. The tests were carried out at the Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade nuclear fusion experiment at Culham in Oxfordshire. The Â£55m device began operating in October last year, after a seven-year build. UK fusion experiment used in hunt for clean energy Largest nuclear fusion project begins assembly Nuclear fusion: 'A question of when, not if' Nuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes that power the Sun - and other stars - here on planet Earth. But the trick is getting more energy out of the reactions than you put in. This goal continues to elude teams of scientists and engineers around the world, who are working to make fusion power a reality. Existing nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. One common fusion approach uses a reactor design called a tokamak, in which powerful magnetic fields are used to control charged gas - or plasma - inside a doughnut-shaped container. Inside the tokamak, where plasmas are controlled by magnetic fields An international fusion megaproject called Iter is currently under construction in southern France. Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said it would be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of bringing fusion power to the grid. But he added that Iter's size and cost meant that ""if every time you wanted to build a unit, you had to raise that sum of money, then the penetration into the market would be determined by economics, not technology"". Mast Upgrade is one attempt to come up with a template for more compact, cheaper fusion reactors. It makes use of an innovative design known as a spherical tokamak to squeeze the fuel into a 4.4m-tall, 4m-wide space. By comparison, the containment vessel Iter will use to control its fusion reactions is 11.4m tall and 19.4m wide. But Mast Upgrade's bijou dimensions come at a price: ""You're making something that's hotter than the Sun... in a smaller volume. How you then get the heat out becomes a big challenge,"" said Prof Chapman. The core of the plasma within the tokamak reaches temperatures of 100 million C. Without an exhaust system that can handle this unimaginable heat, materials in the design would have to be regularly replaced - significantly affecting the amount of time a power plant could operate for. The new exhaust system being trialled at Culham is known as a Super-X divertor. This would allow components in future commercial tokamaks to last for much longer; greatly increasing the power plant's availability, improving its economic viability and reducing the cost of fusion electricity. Tests at Mast Upgrade have shown at least a tenfold reduction in the heat on materials with the Super-X system. Researchers said the results were a ""game-changer"" for the promise of fusion power plants that could provide affordable, efficient electricity. Against the background of climate change, fusion could offer a clean and virtually limitless source of energy. Dr Andrew Kirk, lead scientist on Mast Upgrade, said the results were ""the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade"". ""We built Mast Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded. ""Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant."" The success of the exhaust system for Mast Upgrade delivers a boost to plans for a prototype fusion power plant in the UK called Step. It is expected to come online sometime in the 2040s. The Mast Upgrade facility will have its official opening ceremony on Wednesday, where guest of honour, astronaut Tim Peake, will create his own artificial star by running a plasma test on the machine.

LiveLiveCummings quizzed about key government Covid decisions1 minute ago,"The PM's former chief adviser faced questions about his time working in No 10 during the pandemic He said by October 2020 he regarded Boris Johnson as ""unfit"" for the job of PM Mr Cummings said ""senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me, fell disastrously short"" ""Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,"" he claimed He also accused the PM of being like an out-of-control shopping trolley Mr Cummings said Health Secretary Matt Hancock should have been sacked for ""15 or 20 things"" He also said Mr Hancock insisted people would be tested before being sent into care homes - but weren't The ex-adviser said he was ""extremely sorry"" for visiting Barnard Castle last year Edited by Johanna Howitt London's Evening Standard We are going to close our coverage of today's revelations from Westminster. The team on board with you were: Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay, Owen Amos, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us - goodbye. Dominic Cummings, chief adviser to Minister Boris Johnson listens to the PM during a news conference in Downing Street in March 2020 The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is still a big name in Westminster, even though he's no longer at No 10. The former Vote Leave campaign director helped Boris Johnson to a Conservative election victory in 2019, and then became the prime ministerâs chief adviser in Downing Street. Always a figure of fascination in Westminster, he briefly became a household name last summer, when it emerged he had broken lockdown rules to travel from London to his parentsâ home in County Durham. Despite intense pressure to resign, with the support of the prime minister, he managed to keep his job â only to leave at the end of the year amid reports of infighting at No 10. There has since been speculation that he is the source of several damaging stories about Mr Johnson, including the row about the funding of the refurbishment of the prime ministerâs Downing Street flat. And now he has re-emerged on the political scene with damaging claims about the early handling of the pandemic. Read our full profile here. After a marathon seven hours plus of evidence here's a summary of Dominic Cummings' most explosive claims: Radio 4 PM Stephen Reicher, Professor of Psychology at St Andrews University -  who sits on the government's behaviour advisory group known as SPI-B -  has been speaking to BBC Radio Four's PM programme He said Cumming' committee appearance ""was a magnificent piece of political theatre - a revenge tragedy, a knife in every back."" He added: ""It was useful that he confirmed from the inside what we know on the outside - we know they delayed in March too long to lockdown, we know they didn't put a test and trace system in place, we know they didn't control borders - all problems that are still going on"". ""I found it more problematic when he began to attribute blame or say who said what or did what. Reicher says ""it is absolutely untrue"" that behaviour scientists said people would not tolerate lockdowns. ""In fact, when the idea of behavioural fatigue came out, SPI-B said 'this is nonsense' - you can see it in the minutes of the 12 March - Sage said it the next day. ""600 behaviour scientists came out and said 'this is complete tosh', we don't recognise that idea"". International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has defended her cabinet colleague Matt Hancock following Dominic Cummings' testimony. At an online event hosted by POLITICO, she said she hasn't ""had time to look at it yet,"" but added: ""I'm not going to engage with the false claims that have been made today"". ""Matt Hancock is an excellent colleague who is doing a very good job in what has been a very tough global pandemic,"" she added. The campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice hastweeted its response,externalto Dominic Cummings' select committee appearance. It says his evidence showed ""the governmentâs combination of grotesque chaos and uncaring flippancy is directly responsible for many of our loved ones not being with us today - and the refusal to have an urgent statutory inquiry risks others joining them"". ""The governmentâs statutory inquiry now has to start immediately, and include regular interim reporting"". Dominic Cummings leaves the Houses of Parliament after giving evidence to the joint session of the Health, and Science and Technology committees.  A spokesman for Matt Hancock has just issued a statement in response to Dominic Cumming's appearance: âAt all times throughout this pandemic the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and everyone in the Department for Health and Social Care has worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives. âWe absolutely reject Mr. Cummings's claims about the health secretary. âThe health secretary will continue to work closely with the prime minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by variants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.â Mr Hancock is expected to host a press conference in Downing Street tomorrow. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said he will ask Matt Hancock to come to the Commons tomorrow to answer MPs' questions in the wake of Cumming's committee appearance today.

Dominic Cummings has been speaking to MPs about the UK government's handling of Covid-19. The PM's former chief adviser said Boris Johnson had initially dismissed Covid as a ""scare story"" and the UK had been too slow to lock down. At PMQs earlier Boris Johnson hit back at some of the allegations, insisting that the government's priority had always been to ""save lives"". Here are our five takeaways from the session: This video can not be played Dominic Cummings: Five things he told MPs about Covid response Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last few hours have been
extraordinary. But there are two remarks that really stand out for me. Firstly, the claim that tens of thousands
of people died who didn't need to. That is a damning conclusion for a man who
was around the table when the big decisions were made. It is an allegation the
government is likely to face intense pressure over in the coming days and week. Secondly, Dominic Cummings' claim that he
believed by October 2020 that Boris Johnson was not fit to be prime minister,
because he had refused to implement a second lockdown earlier. Cummings says he only stayed in his
Downing Street job to try and limit the damage. The fact Boris Johnson's top
adviser believed he shouldn't be in Downing Street is quite remarkable. After just over seven hours - with a couple of loo breaks - Dominic Cummings' time in front of MPs has ended. Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee, says its joint inquiry with the science committee will continue in two weeks' time, when they will be hearing from Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Health committee chair Jeremy Hunt asks Dominic Cummings if thinks he did his job in a ""fit and proper"" way last year. Cummings says it is ""inarguable"" that there are many other people who could have done his job better. Science committee chair Greg Clark says people can deal with most things with the benefit of hindsight. Cummings replies the lesson of everything that's happened over the past year is the importance of ""openness"". He says he took the view that he should attend Sage meetings in February because his ""sense"" was that there wasn't a proper set of channels for information between Sage, the Department for Health and No 10. Asked what lessons should be learned from the crisis, Cummings says there should be more transparency over advice given to ministers and more competition for roles in the Civil Service. He also says the pandemic posed an ""obvious question"" about who is ""actually in charge of things"" within the system of government. Confusion over responsibility proved ""completely fatal"" in situations like the pandemic, he says. He says there is a ""culture"" within Whitehall that encourages officials to ""keep their head down"" and where there is an effort not to ""embarrass"" people. Science Committee Chair Greg Clark asks if the possibility of Covid variants were being discussed in September. Cummings says he knew of variants in September, and if he knew about it then others would have too. ""I had specific warnings... from scientists who had been repeatedly proved right"" on the possibility of Covid variants, he states. ""The government is still not acting properly, we still don't have a proper border policy,"" he warns. Cummings says ""as soon as you make the decision that you have to lock down"" then the decision needs to be enacted ""today"". He says this is what the data team was saying to the prime minister in September. He says the PM was ""enraged"" when in September it looked like cases had risen again. Cummings says he was of the view that ""you need to whack [Covid] hard"" immediately. Labour's Sarah Owen asks Cummings if he thinks Boris Johnson ""is a fit and proper person to get us through this pandemic""? Cummings replies with one word - ""no"". Labour's Sarah Owen asks if the chancellor provided scientific evidence for the safety of his scheme, Eat Out To Help Out. Cummings says he didn't have too much involvement in the scheme, he adds ""there were powerful voices in the Treasury"" who were complaining about the economic damage of lockdowns, but the chancellor ""never tried to stop [lockdowns] happening"". He says the chancellor was ""at his wit's end about the shopping trolley,"" referring to his earlier comments describing the prime minister as a ""shopping trolley"" who went from one side to the other. Sarah Owen says it his striking that his testimony today has been praising of Rishi Sunak, she asks if he is aiming for a future job in a Sunak administration.

Cummings says there were no ""meaningful"" discussions within the cabinet ahead of the second lockdown, although he says he didn't attend cabinet in 2020. ""I was in the meeting when it was actually decided, it was just the prime minister, cabinet secretary, [Patrick] Vallance, [Chris] Whitty and other officials there arguing this stuff out - and it was the prime minister's decision,"" he adds.

Throughout today's session Dominic Cummings has repeated accused Health Secretary Matt Hancock of lying.

Cummings says he would be ""happy"" to discuss how to provide"" it and explain what happened. Greg Clark notes that the health secretary will give evidence to the committee himself in two weeks. Cummings is asked whether the government acted quickly enough to raise the Covid tier system in areas where there was an increase in cases. He says the whole point of tiering was to shift  away from a world were you had no real data or testing and so were forced to take a national approach. The tier system was the result of a  more targeted approach, he says. He says this was the right approach to take and that's how other successful countries have done it. But he says ""like lots of things the thinking was done too late"" and he says operationally, things were not done properly. Â© 2025 BBC.

The team on board with you were: Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay, Owen Amos, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us - goodbye. Dominic Cummings, chief adviser to Minister Boris Johnson listens to the PM during a news conference in Downing Street in March 2020 The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is still a big name in Westminster, even though he's no longer at No 10. The former Vote Leave campaign director helped Boris Johnson to a Conservative election victory in 2019, and then became the prime ministerâs chief adviser in Downing Street. Always a figure of fascination in Westminster, he briefly became a household name last summer, when it emerged he had broken lockdown rules to travel from London to his parentsâ home in County Durham. Despite intense pressure to resign, with the support of the prime minister, he managed to keep his job â only to leave at the end of the year amid reports of infighting at No 10. There has since been speculation that he is the source of several damaging stories about Mr Johnson, including the row about the funding of the refurbishment of the prime ministerâs Downing Street flat. And now he has re-emerged on the political scene with damaging claims about the early handling of the pandemic. Read our full profile here. After a marathon seven hours plus of evidence here's a summary of Dominic Cummings' most explosive claims: Radio 4 PM Stephen Reicher, Professor of Psychology at St Andrews University -  who sits on the government's behaviour advisory group known as SPI-B -  has been speaking to BBC Radio Four's PM programme He said Cumming' committee appearance ""was a magnificent piece of political theatre - a revenge tragedy, a knife in every back."" He added: ""It was useful that he confirmed from the inside what we know on the outside - we know they delayed in March too long to lockdown, we know they didn't put a test and trace system in place, we know they didn't control borders - all problems that are still going on"". ""I found it more problematic when he began to attribute blame or say who said what or did what. Reicher says ""it is absolutely untrue"" that behaviour scientists said people would not tolerate lockdowns. ""In fact, when the idea of behavioural fatigue came out, SPI-B said 'this is nonsense' - you can see it in the minutes of the 12 March - Sage said it the next day. ""600 behaviour scientists came out and said 'this is complete tosh', we don't recognise that idea"". International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has defended her cabinet colleague Matt Hancock following Dominic Cummings' testimony. At an online event hosted by POLITICO, she said she hasn't ""had time to look at it yet,"" but added: ""I'm not going to engage with the false claims that have been made today"". ""Matt Hancock is an excellent colleague who is doing a very good job in what has been a very tough global pandemic,"" she added. The campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice hastweeted its response,externalto Dominic Cummings' select committee appearance. It says his evidence showed ""the governmentâs combination of grotesque chaos and uncaring flippancy is directly responsible for many of our loved ones not being with us today - and the refusal to have an urgent statutory inquiry risks others joining them"". ""The governmentâs statutory inquiry now has to start immediately, and include regular interim reporting"". Dominic Cummings leaves the Houses of Parliament after giving evidence to the joint session of the Health, and Science and Technology committees.  A spokesman for Matt Hancock has just issued a statement in response to Dominic Cumming's appearance: âAt all times throughout this pandemic the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and everyone in the Department for Health and Social Care has worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives. âWe absolutely reject Mr. Cummings's claims about the health secretary. âThe health secretary will continue to work closely with the prime minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by variants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.â Mr Hancock is expected to host a press conference in Downing Street tomorrow. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said he will ask Matt Hancock to come to the Commons tomorrow to answer MPs' questions in the wake of Cumming's committee appearance today.

Dominic Cummings has been speaking to MPs about the UK government's handling of Covid-19. The PM's former chief adviser said Boris Johnson had initially dismissed Covid as a ""scare story"" and the UK had been too slow to lock down. At PMQs earlier Boris Johnson hit back at some of the allegations, insisting that the government's priority had always been to ""save lives"". Here are our five takeaways from the session: This video can not be played Dominic Cummings: Five things he told MPs about Covid response Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last few hours have been
extraordinary. But there are two remarks that really stand out for me. Firstly, the claim that tens of thousands
of people died who didn't need to. That is a damning conclusion for a man who
was around the table when the big decisions were made. It is an allegation the
government is likely to face intense pressure over in the coming days and week. Secondly, Dominic Cummings' claim that he
believed by October 2020 that Boris Johnson was not fit to be prime minister,
because he had refused to implement a second lockdown earlier. Cummings says he only stayed in his
Downing Street job to try and limit the damage. The fact Boris Johnson's top
adviser believed he shouldn't be in Downing Street is quite remarkable. After just over seven hours - with a couple of loo breaks - Dominic Cummings' time in front of MPs has ended. Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee, says its joint inquiry with the science committee will continue in two weeks' time, when they will be hearing from Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Health committee chair Jeremy Hunt asks Dominic Cummings if thinks he did his job in a ""fit and proper"" way last year. Cummings says it is ""inarguable"" that there are many other people who could have done his job better. Science committee chair Greg Clark says people can deal with most things with the benefit of hindsight. Cummings replies the lesson of everything that's happened over the past year is the importance of ""openness"". He says he took the view that he should attend Sage meetings in February because his ""sense"" was that there wasn't a proper set of channels for information between Sage, the Department for Health and No 10. Asked what lessons should be learned from the crisis, Cummings says there should be more transparency over advice given to ministers and more competition for roles in the Civil Service. He also says the pandemic posed an ""obvious question"" about who is ""actually in charge of things"" within the system of government. Confusion over responsibility proved ""completely fatal"" in situations like the pandemic, he says. He says there is a ""culture"" within Whitehall that encourages officials to ""keep their head down"" and where there is an effort not to ""embarrass"" people. Science Committee Chair Greg Clark asks if the possibility of Covid variants were being discussed in September. Cummings says he knew of variants in September, and if he knew about it then others would have too. ""I had specific warnings... from scientists who had been repeatedly proved right"" on the possibility of Covid variants, he states. ""The government is still not acting properly, we still don't have a proper border policy,"" he warns. Cummings says ""as soon as you make the decision that you have to lock down"" then the decision needs to be enacted ""today"". He says this is what the data team was saying to the prime minister in September. He says the PM was ""enraged"" when in September it looked like cases had risen again. Cummings says he was of the view that ""you need to whack [Covid] hard"" immediately. Labour's Sarah Owen asks Cummings if he thinks Boris Johnson ""is a fit and proper person to get us through this pandemic""? Cummings replies with one word - ""no"". Labour's Sarah Owen asks if the chancellor provided scientific evidence for the safety of his scheme, Eat Out To Help Out. Cummings says he didn't have too much involvement in the scheme, he adds ""there were powerful voices in the Treasury"" who were complaining about the economic damage of lockdowns, but the chancellor ""never tried to stop [lockdowns] happening"". He says the chancellor was ""at his wit's end about the shopping trolley,"" referring to his earlier comments describing the prime minister as a ""shopping trolley"" who went from one side to the other. Sarah Owen says it his striking that his testimony today has been praising of Rishi Sunak, she asks if he is aiming for a future job in a Sunak administration. Cummings says most people in Westminster and Whitehall probably think - and his wife would agree - that ""the less they see of me, the better"". Cummings says there were no ""meaningful"" discussions within the cabinet ahead of the second lockdown, although he says he didn't attend cabinet in 2020. ""I was in the meeting when it was actually decided, it was just the prime minister, cabinet secretary, [Patrick] Vallance, [Chris] Whitty and other officials there arguing this stuff out - and it was the prime minister's decision,"" he adds.

AI emotion-detection software tested on UyghursA software engineer tells BBC's Panorama about installing the system in police stations in Xinjiang.Technology,"A gate of what is officially known as a ""vocational skills education centre"" in Xinjiang A camera system that uses AI and facial recognition intended to reveal states of emotion has been tested on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the BBC has been told. A software engineer claimed to have installed such systems in police stations in the province. A human rights advocate who was shown the evidence described it as shocking. The Chinese embassy in London has not responded directly to the claims but says political and social rights in all ethnic groups are guaranteed. Xinjiang is home to 12 million ethnic minority Uyghurs, most of whom are Muslim. Citizens in the province are under daily surveillance. The area is also home to highly controversial ""re-education centres"", called high security detention camps by human rights groups, where it is estimated that more than a million people have been held. Beijing has always argued that surveillance is necessary in the region because it says separatists who want to set up their own state have killed hundreds of people in terror attacks. Xinjiang is believed to be one of the most surveilled areas in the world The software engineer agreed to talk to the BBC's Panorama programme under condition of anonymity, because he fears for his safety. The company he worked for is also not being revealed. But he showed Panorama five photographs of Uyghur detainees who he claimed had had the emotion recognition system tested on them. Data from the system purports to indicate a person's state of mind, with red suggesting a negative or anxious state of mind ""The Chinese government use Uyghurs as test subjects for various experiments just like rats are used in laboratories,"" he said. And he outlined his role in installing the cameras in police stations in the province: ""We placed the emotion detection camera 3m from the subject. It is similar to a lie detector but far more advanced technology."" He said officers used ""restraint chairs"" which are widely installed in police stations across China. ""Your wrists are locked in place by metal restraints, and [the] same applies to your ankles."" He provided evidence of how the AI system is trained to detect and analyse even minute changes in facial expressions and skin pores. According to his claims, the software creates a pie chart, with the red segment representing a negative or anxious state of mind. He claimed the software was intended for ""pre-judgement without any credible evidence"". The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to questions about the use of emotional recognition software in the province but said: ""The political, economic, and social rights and freedom of religious belief in all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully guaranteed. ""People live in harmony regardless of their ethnic backgrounds and enjoy a stable and peaceful life with no restriction to personal freedom."" The evidence was shown to Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch. ""It is shocking material. It's not just that people are being reduced to a pie chart, it's people who are in highly coercive circumstances, under enormous pressure, being understandably nervous and that's taken as an indication of guilt, and I think, that's deeply problematic."" According to Darren Byler, from the University of Colorado, Uyghurs routinely have to provide DNA samples to local officials, undergo digital scans and most have to download a government phone app, which gathers data including contact lists and text messages. ""Uyghur life is now about generating data,"" he said. ""Everyone knows that the smartphone is something you have to carry with you, and if you don't carry it you can be detained, they know that you're being tracked by it. And they feel like there's no escape,"" he said. Most of the data is fed into a computer system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which Human Rights Watch claims flags up supposedly suspicious behaviour. ""The system is gathering information about dozens of different kinds of perfectly legal behaviours including things like whether people were going out the back door instead of the front door, whether they were putting gas in a car that didn't belong to them,"" said Ms Richardson. ""Authorities now place QR codes outside the doors of people's homes so that they can easily know who's supposed to be there and who's not."" There has long been debate about how closely tied Chinese technology firms are to the state. US-based research group IPVM claims to have uncovered evidence in patents filed by such companies that suggest facial recognition products were specifically designed to identify Uyghur people. A patent filed in July 2018 by Huawei and the China Academy of Sciences describes a face recognition product that is capable of identifying people on the basis of their ethnicity. Huawei said in response that it did ""not condone the use of technology to discriminate or oppress members of any community"" and that it was ""independent of government"" wherever it operated. The group has also found a document which appears to suggest the firm was developing technology for a so-called One Person, One File system. ""For each person the government would store their personal information, their political activities, relationships... anything that might give you insight into how that person would behave and what kind of a threat they might pose,"" said IPVM's Conor Healy. Hikvision makes a range of products including cameras ""It makes any kind of dissidence potentially impossible and creates true predictability for the government in the behaviour of their citizens. I don't think that [George] Orwell would ever have imagined that a government could be capable of this kind of analysis."" Huawei did not specifically address questions about its involvement in developing technology for the One Person, One File system but said: ""Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination. ""As a privately-held company, Huawei is independent of government wherever we operate. We do not condone the use of technology to discriminate against or oppress members of any community."" The Chinese embassy in London said it had ""no knowledge"" of these programmes. IPVM also claimed to have found marketing material from Chinese firm Hikvision advertising a Uyghur-detecting AI camera, and a patent for software developed by Dahua, another tech giant, which could also identify Uyghurs. Dahua said its patent referred to all 56 recognised ethnicities in China and did not deliberately target any one of them. It added that it provided ""products and services that aim to help keep people safe"" and complied ""with the laws and regulations of every market"" in which it operates, including the UK. Hikvision said the details on its website were incorrect and ""uploaded online without appropriate review"", adding that it did not sell or have in its product range ""a minority recognition function or analytics technology"". Dr Lan Xue, chairman of China's National committee on AI governance, said he was not aware of the patents. ""Outside China there are a lot of those sorts of charges. Many are not accurate and not true,"" he told the BBC. ""I think that the Xinjiang local government had the responsibility to really protect the Xinjiang people... if technology is used in those contexts, that's quite understandable,"" he said. The UK's Chinese embassy had a more robust defence, telling the BBC: ""There is no so-called facial recognition technology featuring Uyghur analytics whatsoever."" Hu Liu feels his life is under constant surveillance China is estimated to be home to half of the world's almost 800 million surveillance cameras. It also has a large number of smart cities, such as Chongqing, where AI is built into the foundations of the urban environment. Chongqing-based investigative journalist Hu Liu told Panorama of his own experience: ""Once you leave home and step into the lift, you are captured by a camera. There are cameras everywhere."" ""When I leave home to go somewhere, I call a taxi, the taxi company uploads the data to the government. I may then go to a cafe to meet a few friends and the authorities know my location through the camera in the cafe. ""There have been occasions when I have met some friends and soon after someone from the government contacts me. They warned me, 'Don't see that person, don't do this and that.'

"DIY and building projects hit by materials shortageIndustry warns people to delay home improvement due to shortage of cement, electric components, timber and steel.","Building materials are running short in the UK, leaving DIY projects in doubt and building companies under pressure. The Construction Leadership Councilhas warned,externalthat cement, some electrical components, timber, steel and paints are all in short supply. It blamed ""unprecedented levels of demand"" that are set to continue. The Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. ""Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,"" said chief executive Brian Berry. ""We can't build our way to recovery from the pandemic if we don't have the materials."" Roland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn. ""The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,"" he said. The supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials. There are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer. There has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs, said Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association. ""Shipping costs have risen sharply due a shortage of empty containers from Covid-19-related issues and the sharp recovery in global demand,"" he told the BBC. For instance the cost of shipping a 40ft container from Asia to Northern Europe soared from $1,500 (Â£1,061) in summer 2020 to more than $8,300 (Â£5,873) by May 2021, he said. With demand globally increasing and the UK importing many of its raw materials, lead times for orders are lengthening while prices are shooting up. Mohsen Kashan of Milton Keynes has been waiting nine months to have his bathroom renovated after a leak. But with problems getting parts and tradespeople he told the BBC he now simply can't afford the rising costs he is being quoted. ""It's a simple job for a small bathroom just 2 metres by 2.5 meters. But we have been quoted Â£10,000 for what used to be less than Â£5,000. ""To expect to pay between Â£8,000 and Â£10,000 for a small bathroom seems too much,"" Mohsen said. He's been struggling since September to get the repairs done. ""We've tried B&Q, a couple of other stores, as well as installers and half a dozen fitters. ""Either the cost of the materials has been too high, the cost of labour too high or materials are simply unavailable."" The Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double during the course of the year. ""My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement,"" said Mr Berry. Amy Archer says her firm has never experienced such severe shortages ""It is really challenging in terms of supplies. It's nothing that we've ever experienced before,"" said Amy Archer, deputy managing director of the Swift Group, based in Cottingham near Hull, which makes caravans, motorhomes and holiday homes. She said there are two issues: ""The first is a shortage of materials in the first place and the delays that we've seen through the ports because of shipping container shortages."" The second is rising prices: ""Commodity prices are going up because there's such a huge demand for products."" Booming activity domestically hasn't helped too, she said. ""Lots of people are doing home improvements such as new kitchens and that's all draining the materials that are available."" Bayram Timber's Chris Husband says wood prices are rising fast. ""This really is unprecedented,"" said Chris Husband, commercial director at wood supplier Bayram Timber. ""The sheer volume of timber that's being demanded at the moment, they are struggling to keep pace with it in Scandinavia, where we source most of our raw material."" His company, based in North Ferriby near Hull. competes against others across the globe for the timber and is ""having to wait in line"", he said. ""It's having a huge inflationary effect on the raw material price and obviously the lead times as well."" Is the current situation here to stay? ""We're pretty much certain that this is with us for the rest of this year,"" he said. Brexit has also affected the UK's timber supply as 80% of softwood comes from Europe, said Thomas Goodman, construction expert, from MyJobQuote. Steel is also in short supply, as global demand exceeds supply. ""Many steel manufacturers have stopped taking orders, as they are worried that panic buying will result in extremely low stock,"" he said. The shipping costs issue is likely to subside in the next three to six months but global demand is likely to remain high for the next six to nine months, predicted Mr Francis. Mr Berry pointed out that small builders can't stockpile or plan jobs far in advance, unlike larger firms, so they need to be assured that the materials will be at the merchants when they need them. ""Consumers must be aware that shortages are causing delays to projects, and that costs may change in the months ahead because of this pressure,"" he said. Building materials supplier Travis Perkins said: ""In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to ensure healthy stock availability for our customers."" But with higher material prices for the moment, many homeowners and builders are choosing to delay work until the necessary resources become more affordable.

AI emotion-detection software tested on Uyghurs,"A gate of what is officially known as a ""vocational skills education centre"" in Xinjiang A camera system that uses AI and facial recognition intended to reveal states of emotion has been tested on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the BBC has been told. A software engineer claimed to have installed such systems in police stations in the province. A human rights advocate who was shown the evidence described it as shocking. The Chinese embassy in London has not responded directly to the claims but says political and social rights in all ethnic groups are guaranteed. Xinjiang is home to 12 million ethnic minority Uyghurs, most of whom are Muslim. Citizens in the province are under daily surveillance. The area is also home to highly controversial ""re-education centres"", called high security detention camps by human rights groups, where it is estimated that more than a million people have been held. Beijing has always argued that surveillance is necessary in the region because it says separatists who want to set up their own state have killed hundreds of people in terror attacks. Xinjiang is believed to be one of the most surveilled areas in the world The software engineer agreed to talk to the BBC's Panorama programme under condition of anonymity, because he fears for his safety. The company he worked for is also not being revealed. But he showed Panorama five photographs of Uyghur detainees who he claimed had had the emotion recognition system tested on them. Data from the system purports to indicate a person's state of mind, with red suggesting a negative or anxious state of mind ""The Chinese government use Uyghurs as test subjects for various experiments just like rats are used in laboratories,"" he said. And he outlined his role in installing the cameras in police stations in the province: ""We placed the emotion detection camera 3m from the subject. It is similar to a lie detector but far more advanced technology."" He said officers used ""restraint chairs"" which are widely installed in police stations across China. ""Your wrists are locked in place by metal restraints, and [the] same applies to your ankles."" He provided evidence of how the AI system is trained to detect and analyse even minute changes in facial expressions and skin pores. According to his claims, the software creates a pie chart, with the red segment representing a negative or anxious state of mind. He claimed the software was intended for ""pre-judgement without any credible evidence"". The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to questions about the use of emotional recognition software in the province but said: ""The political, economic, and social rights and freedom of religious belief in all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully guaranteed. ""People live in harmony regardless of their ethnic backgrounds and enjoy a stable and peaceful life with no restriction to personal freedom."" The evidence was shown to Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch. ""It is shocking material. It's not just that people are being reduced to a pie chart, it's people who are in highly coercive circumstances, under enormous pressure, being understandably nervous and that's taken as an indication of guilt, and I think, that's deeply problematic."" According to Darren Byler, from the University of Colorado, Uyghurs routinely have to provide DNA samples to local officials, undergo digital scans and most have to download a government phone app, which gathers data including contact lists and text messages. ""Uyghur life is now about generating data,"" he said. ""Everyone knows that the smartphone is something you have to carry with you, and if you don't carry it you can be detained, they know that you're being tracked by it. And they feel like there's no escape,"" he said. Most of the data is fed into a computer system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which Human Rights Watch claims flags up supposedly suspicious behaviour. ""The system is gathering information about dozens of different kinds of perfectly legal behaviours including things like whether people were going out the back door instead of the front door, whether they were putting gas in a car that didn't belong to them,"" said Ms Richardson. ""Authorities now place QR codes outside the doors of people's homes so that they can easily know who's supposed to be there and who's not."" There has long been debate about how closely tied Chinese technology firms are to the state. US-based research group IPVM claims to have uncovered evidence in patents filed by such companies that suggest facial recognition products were specifically designed to identify Uyghur people. A patent filed in July 2018 by Huawei and the China Academy of Sciences describes a face recognition product that is capable of identifying people on the basis of their ethnicity. Huawei said in response that it did ""not condone the use of technology to discriminate or oppress members of any community"" and that it was ""independent of government"" wherever it operated. The group has also found a document which appears to suggest the firm was developing technology for a so-called One Person, One File system. ""For each person the government would store their personal information, their political activities, relationships... anything that might give you insight into how that person would behave and what kind of a threat they might pose,"" said IPVM's Conor Healy. Hikvision makes a range of products including cameras ""It makes any kind of dissidence potentially impossible and creates true predictability for the government in the behaviour of their citizens. I don't think that [George] Orwell would ever have imagined that a government could be capable of this kind of analysis."" Huawei did not specifically address questions about its involvement in developing technology for the One Person, One File system but said: ""Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination. ""As a privately-held company, Huawei is independent of government wherever we operate. We do not condone the use of technology to discriminate against or oppress members of any community."" The Chinese embassy in London said it had ""no knowledge"" of these programmes. IPVM also claimed to have found marketing material from Chinese firm Hikvision advertising a Uyghur-detecting AI camera, and a patent for software developed by Dahua, another tech giant, which could also identify Uyghurs. Dahua said its patent referred to all 56 recognised ethnicities in China and did not deliberately target any one of them. It added that it provided ""products and services that aim to help keep people safe"" and complied ""with the laws and regulations of every market"" in which it operates, including the UK. Hikvision said the details on its website were incorrect and ""uploaded online without appropriate review"", adding that it did not sell or have in its product range ""a minority recognition function or analytics technology"". Dr Lan Xue, chairman of China's National committee on AI governance, said he was not aware of the patents. ""Outside China there are a lot of those sorts of charges. Many are not accurate and not true,"" he told the BBC. ""I think that the Xinjiang local government had the responsibility to really protect the Xinjiang people... if technology is used in those contexts, that's quite understandable,"" he said. The UK's Chinese embassy had a more robust defence, telling the BBC: ""There is no so-called facial recognition technology featuring Uyghur analytics whatsoever."" Hu Liu feels his life is under constant surveillance China is estimated to be home to half of the world's almost 800 million surveillance cameras. It also has a large number of smart cities, such as Chongqing, where AI is built into the foundations of the urban environment. Chongqing-based investigative journalist Hu Liu told Panorama of his own experience: ""Once you leave home and step into the lift, you are captured by a camera. There are cameras everywhere."" ""When I leave home to go somewhere, I call a taxi, the taxi company uploads the data to the government. I may then go to a cafe to meet a few friends and the authorities know my location through the camera in the cafe. ""There have been occasions when I have met some friends and soon after someone from the government contacts me. They warned me, 'Don't see that person, don't do this and that.' ""With artificial intelligence we have nowhere to hide,"" he said. Find out more about this on Panorama's Are you Scared Yet, Human? -available on iPlayerfrom 26 May Who are the Uyghurs?

China overtakes Germany as UKâs top import market,"China has overtaken Germany to become the UK's biggest single import market for the first time since records began. Goods imported from China rose 66% from the start of 2018 to Â£16.9bn ($24bn) in the first quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics said. Imports from Germany fell by a quarter to Â£12.5bn in the same period. The change came as trade with the European Union was disrupted by Brexit and the pandemic boosted demand for Chinese goods. China exports soar as US recovers and India stalls China's economy grows 18.3% in post-Covid comeback Car production slumps to lowest level since 1984 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report,externalaimed to assess the impacts of Brexit and the coronavirus on the UK's trade in goods. It found evidence that trade had been disrupted at the start of the new relationship between the UK and the EU. The ONS said German imports to the UK had fallen since April 2019, amid uncertainty over the details of Britain's exit from the EU. Germany's motor industry also felt the impact of the pandemic as both vehicle production and global exports were hit. In the UK, demand for new vehicles slumped as car showrooms were shut due to lockdown measures. Exports of goods to Ireland saw the greatest proportionate fall of the UK's top five exporting partners after the EU transition period, the ONS said. Since modern records began in 1997, Germany had been the UK's biggest source of imports, except for a six month period at the end of 2000 and the start of the following year when the US briefly took the top spot. Despite a 23.1% fall in total trade with European Union countries as a whole in the period, the EU remains the UK's biggest trading partner, the report found. This video can not be played Why does Chinaâs economy matter to you? The figures also showed there was a jump in imports from China of textiles used for face masks and other personal protective equipment, as well as stronger demand for electrical devices. China was the only major economy to see its global trade grow last year as it became the first big country to emerge from the pandemic.

Families in anguish over pair held in Belarus,"Videos have emerged of journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega The families of a dissident journalist and his girlfriend, held after a plane was diverted to Belarus, have spoken of their concern for their safety. Roman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega are now in detention. ""I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,"" said his mother Natalia Protasevich. A video of Ms Sapega was released on Tuesday as authorities said they would hold her for at least two months. In the video, Ms Sapega says she edits a Telegram channel which publishes personal information of Belarusian policemen. However, it is likely she is speaking under duress. Ms Sapega and Mr Protasevich were detained on Sunday, when a plane flying from Athens to Vilnius, in neighbouring Lithuania, was diverted to land in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. Western countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane that was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat. Several European airlines have said that they will not fly over Belarus as a result. Belarus plane: What we know and what we don't Who is Roman Protasevich? ''Perfect storm' prompts EU to act fast on Belarus ""Today Sofia was interrogated. She was accused of committing a criminal offence. A preventive measure was chosen - detention for a period of two months,"" her lawyer, Alexander Filanovich, told the BBC's Russian service on Tuesday. Ms Sapega is now in a KGB pre-trial detention centre in the Belarusian capital, he said. In the video, Ms Sapega states that she is the editor of the Black Book of Belarus Telegram channel, which publishes the personal data of the country's security forces. Sapega is currently in a pre-trial detention centre But Ms Sapega's mother cast doubt on how freely her daughter is speaking in the video, released by a pro-government Telegram channel. ""Even my friends called me and said ... this is an unusual manner for her,"" she told the BBC. ""She sways, eyes in the sky - as if afraid of forgetting something."" ""I enlarged [the video] as much as possible - it seems that [she looks] okay. We are now packing warm clothes, we will go to Minsk. I want to try to give her a parcel - I saw she only had a thin jacket."" Passengers describe panic on plane What happens with a military jet interception? Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus It comes after Belarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress. The 26-year-old faces charges related to his reporting of last August's disputed election and subsequent crackdown on mass opposition protests, and has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Minsk To a casual observer, Minsk seems relaxed. On Tuesday evening, there were teenagers with guitars on the embankment, young rappers practising on a city square and no hint of the political turmoil that swept this country after last summer's disputed presidential election. But behind closed doors, people say the audacious arrest of Roman Protasevich has only shown the outside world the reality and the risk that opposition activists inside Belarus have been living with. Just on Tuesday, another seven activists were handed long prison sentences. Last week, the country's best-known independent news website was taken offline, with multiple arrests for supposed financial irregularities. Since the protests were crushed, bloggers and businesspeople, politicians and protesters have all ended up behind bars and no-one knows who might be next. That's why many who would once have spoken freely here are now nervous. They prefer to lie low and keep quiet, just in case. Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners. Mr Protasevich's mother Natalia told the AFP news agency that she had not slept since her son's arrest. ""I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,"" she said, breaking down in tears during an interview in Wroclaw, southern Poland. ""He's only one journalist, he's only one child but please, please... I am begging for help. Please save him! They're going to kill him in there!"" This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC he is fearful his son may be tortured She added that her son is a ""fighter for justice"". ""They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism, I don't think you can call it anything else. He's been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!"" she said. Her voice breaking, she added: ""My son, this young man just wanted to tell the truth about the situation. He didn't do anything wrong."" Belarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday. Police then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was ""super scared"", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. On Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on Sunday's Ryanair flight. According to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on ""our recommendation"". This appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, the leaders of the 27 European Union member states called for the overflight ban, and promised further economic sanctions. Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile. What happens with a military jet interception?

High Court case on NI abortion law delay to start,"Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019 after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution Delays in implementing Northern Ireland's abortion laws have been a ""deeply troubling exercise in finger-pointing"", a court has heard. Abortion became legal in 2020, following a vote by MPs during the collapse of devolution. Stormont has since been under pressure to establish a permanent, central abortion service, but this has not happened yet. It is being challenged in a judicial review at the High Court in Belfast. The NI Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is taking the case against the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Representing the NIHRC, David Blundell QC said there had been an ""abdication of legal responsibility"" by all three parties. He told Mr Justice Colton that the main factor in taking the case was the protection of women's human rights. Mr Blundell said without a fully-funded and staffed model, Northern Ireland health trusts have only been able to operate a ""skeleton service"" for early medical abortions - up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Women seeking a termination beyond that gestation have still been required, in some circumstances, to travel to England during the coronavirus pandemic, the court was told. The judicial review has been brought by the NI Human Rights Commission against Stormont and Westminster ""Much was known about the truly terrible impact on such women, but has not led to any service being provided,"" said Mr Blundell. He also said the Northern Ireland secretary had a ""clear statutory obligation"" in law to ensure full abortion services were commissioned by Stormont ""expeditiously"", and that this had not happened. In March, Mr Lewistook powers that would allow him to direct Stormont to set up servicesbut he has not done so yet. The government has said itwanted ""concrete progress"" from the executive by this summer. Mr Blundell said the NIHRC is calling for the laws to be implemented fully by September, but that the Department of Health has suggested that it could take eight to 12 months to establish services. ""In practice, women in Northern Ireland do not have access to abortion services to which they're entitled by law - it's been 14 months without them,"" he added. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland The court was also told the Northern Ireland Executive had ""totally failed to engage"" with the Department of Health in relation to the commissioning of services. Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann has maintained that he cannot set it up without support from the Stormont Executive,as the matter is controversial and cross-cutting- the responsibility of more than one department. The court heard that evidence from the department suggested the First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party opposes abortion, had ""made clear"" that proposals were not going to be passed by the executive. Robin Swann maintains he cannot set up full abortion services without executive consent Mr Blundell said the executive's position was a ""driving factor"" in contributing to the delays, along with financial challenges raised by the health minister with Westminster. The case is scheduled to last for two days. It is expected to hear from representatives for the secretary of state, as well as lawyers for the Department of Health and the Stormont Executive. Reserved judgement is expected to be delivered in the next few months. Meanwhile, in a separate development, BBC News NI understands that a paper from Mr Swann on the commissioning of abortion services was blocked from executive discussion last week. One short-term option suggested exploring if Irish health authorities could provide Northern Ireland women with early medical abortion access. It is believed Mr Swann had proposed whether it would be possible for Northern Ireland to quickly commission a limited early medical abortion service. That would allow women in the early stages of a pregnancy - up to 10 weeks - to take abortion pills at home following a consultation with a doctor. The service, known as telemedicine, hasbeen in place in other parts of the UK and the Republic of Irelandsince the start of the coronavirus pandemic. However, BBC News NI understands that Mr Swann's paper did not make it onto the executive's agenda to be considered by all ministers. Any paper can be blocked from discussion, if it does not have support of both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP is staunchly opposed to abortion. Sinn FÃ©in has previously called for abortion services to be commissioned promptly.

"People buying homes before viewing in 'mad' marketWales has seen the biggest house price growth in the UK, up by an average of 11% in the past year.Wales","Estate agent Mel John said times were tough for first time buyers House buyers are making offers on homes before viewing them in order to gain an edge in a ""mad"" housing market, estate agents and sellers have said. Wales has seen the biggest house price growth in the UK, up by an average of 11% in the past year. Many estate agents claim some properties sell within hours, sometimes with dozens of offers on the table. But the rapid sales have also left some sellers stuck as they have not had enough time to find new homes. Megan Davies, 32, a midwife and mother-of-two from Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is hoping to find a family home with her partner. Last month demand for some properties in the town sawpeople queueing overnightoutside an estate agents. Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses House sales and prices see early spring surge Ms Davies sold her house within hours of putting it on the market and her partner was made an offer on his property before any viewings. However the pair have now been unable to find anywhere to move on to. ""The properties that we've been to see, they're going for Â£20,000 to Â£30,000 over the asking price,"" Ms Davies toldBBC Wales Live. ""There's so much competition out there at the moment and Aberdare is just mad, it's just gone mad. ""We've seen a house today that's gone live 15 minutes ago, we were told 'we've got no bookings left'. ""We've gone through agents, we've gone through social media, we've gone through the selling pages for houses, Rightmove etc. This video can not be played 'Somebody just would always pip you to the post' ""I'm at the point now where I think, do we do flyers in the estates that we want to live on? That's the point we're at. There's nothing around. It really does take over your life."" Rhiannon Williams, 30, said she had given up trying to buy her first home near Caerphilly after struggling for months with high asking prices. ""The first house viewing looked amazing on the photos, but when I viewed I wasn't sold by the property. The estate agent said someone had put an offer in on the house and hadn't viewed it,"" she said. ""I thought that was absolutely insane as the asking price was already the top end for that area. ""I had two viewings booked for this week, both have been cancelled as they have now been sold. ""It's a huge step to purchase your first home, I think the prices are so high at the moment and people are offering over the asking price too, so I don't stand a chance to get on the ladder."" Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses Buyer demand outstrips homes on market Mel John, an estate agent in Caerphilly, said she had been hearing more stories of practices like ""gazumping"" - where a seller goes back on a verbal agreement and accepts a higher offer. ""I've walked away from a number of properties where the sellers would have encouraged gazumping, as an estate agent I wouldn't want to be any part of that,"" she said. ""I don't think it's ethical really for anybody to go down that route."" Ms John said the property market boom was great news for many, but she had sympathy for buyers who were frequently missing out. ""There's a lot of buyers out there,"" she said. ""When a property comes on the market we'll do a block booking of viewings on that property and whoever makes an offer, we'd be looking for their best and final offer. ""Of course it's not nice telling people that they can't buy the properties, that the seller has decided to go with someone else. Many people want to move to Wales from over the border, estate agents say ""It is really difficult and especially with young first-time buyers who can only afford a certain amount - which is more or less in the investors price range. ""They're desperate to get on the property ladder and they've got so much competition."" In north and west Wales the current housing market boom has re-energised debates around second homes. However James Skudder, the director of Country Living Estate Agents in Pembrokeshire, said the landscape among his clients had significantly shifted from second-home buyers, with many now moving over the border to make Wales their permanent home. ""Since Covid has hit, the market hasn't stopped,"" said Mr Skudder. ""I would say on a daily basis 95% of the enquires are from people outside of the area. ""Pembrokeshire has always had a pull with second-home buyers, whereas now people are relocating for their primary residence. ""What we're finding is if you've holidayed in an area for 20 or 30 years and now you're finding you can work from home - people are saying to each other 'look let's make the dream move we've always wanted to'. ""People are relocating themselves and they're relocating their businesses. ""They're now moving their businesses online because it's an easier way to live and it can bring happiness to the business and the family. ""People have just had an awakening to what's going on surrounding Covid and certainly this is what's helping push the pricing in the area, people being unhappy over working long hours and being stuck in the city. An area like this is being pushed through the roof."" He added: ""It's a crazy market, right the way from low end, right up to the premium market.""

Psychoactive drugs bought at 'click of a button',"The substances mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as ecstasy and cannabis Psychoactive drugs such as Spice are easier than ever to buy, despite a ban which came into force five years ago, drugs charities have warned. They said trade had gone to the dark web, making them ""more available"" and ""more dangerous"" for problem users. Since it became illegal to make, sell or supply such drugs, just 28 people have been convicted in Wales. The Home Office said the new law had ""eliminated"" the open sale of drugs in shops and on UK-based websites. The offence carries a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. The drugs are known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), but used to be called ""legal highs"". Data obtained from Welsh police forces by BBC Wales under the Freedom of Information Act showed 124 arrests were made in the past five years, leading to 86 charges and 28 convictions. Spice taskforce 'saved my life' Ban on legal highs comes into force Police boss wants prisoners to be given cannabis Former North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said psychoactive substances were ""under the radar"", with enforcement more concentrated on heroin and cocaine. Mr Jones, who is also a campaigner on drugs, believes the legislation is counter-productive and the UK should look to decriminalisation. ""Psychoactive substances is very much a problem in two countries, the UK and Turkey,"" he said. ""Look at the Netherlands, where they decriminalised cannabis many years ago, would Spice and mamba be a problem in the UK if we decriminalised cannabis 30 years ago? I think not."" This video can not be played Craig uses the drop-in centre but said it is hard to kick the Spice habit Drugs charity Kaleidoscope said the legislation had ""failed in its first objective to reduce harm"" because the number of users in Wales had not gone down. Chief executive Martin Blakebrough said it had made the job of drug agencies more difficult as - before the ban - new psychoactive drugs were being sold openly in head shops. He said if a ""bad batch"" of drugs was causing overdoses or deaths, sellers could be warned to take them off the market. The legislation has ""driven this market underground, but also made it incredibly accessible"", he added. He said hundreds of anonymous websites, mainly linked to large manufacturers in China, were selling directly into the UK market so, with the ""click of a button, the postman will deliver these drugs to you within 24 hours, causing people who have problems with drugs more significant issues"". Mr Blakebrough called the legislation ""purely a publicity stunt to show the UK government was doing something"". Nicky Lane has experienced the impact substances such as Spice have on lives Nicky Lane, 40, from Newport, struggled with an addiction to Spice for three years and ended up living on the streets before being sent prison. He said even after it was made illegal it was ""easy to get a hold of and quite cheap"" but as his addiction worsened he was spending up to Â£40 a day. Nicky said Spice was being smuggled into prison, with a liquid form being sprayed onto personal letters to prisoners. ""I was having money sent to people that were selling it on the wing so as soon as the money landed your Spice landed,"" he said. ""So it's as easy as that if you've got the money."" Nicky said Spice leaves people ""totally out of it"" so some homeless use it to numb themselves from the pain and boredom of life on the streets. He said Spice ""ripped away everything"" from his life and he warned people to ""leave it alone"". He added: ""I believe they made the right decision in banning it because it's one of the worst drugs out there, but for people addicted it's hard."" Mr Blakebrough added: ""But let's be honest,when we saw the scenes of Spice being used in Wrexham, for example, you know where people were zombies - I mean that terrified local communities, much more than if you're selling it from a head shop. ""America is now legalising cannabis and, across Europe, it's a similar picture. ""Britain is standing on its own by still saying the best way of controlling drugs is by hitting people with legal sanctions when the evidence doesn't show that is effective and we've got the highest drug-related deaths in Europe. ""I don't want to see a free-for-all of drugs in our streets, but what we need to do is regulate it."" Figures from the Office for National Statistics indicated there were seven deaths in Wales involving an NSP in 2019, nearly as high as the eight deaths in 2015, a year before they were banned. NPS deaths made up just over 3% of the 240 drug-related deaths in Wales in 2019, below the number caused by opiates (121), cocaine (30), benzodiazepine (22), amphetamine (12) and Ecstasy/MDMA (8). The drug analysis laboratory in Cardiff, Wedinos, said most NPS deaths were now linked to Spice. Public Health Wales' head of substance misuse, Josie Smith, said making psychoactive substances illegal had deterred some users. She said substance missuse also needed to be treated as a ""health issue"" with problem users quickly identified and given help. ""We are now in a global borderless environment in terms of the manufacturing and transport of drugs, and psychoactive drugs, particularly,"" she said. ""We need to address the challenges to that in a much more holistic way."" The Home Office said the UK government was committed to preventing drug use in communities, including tackling the supply of illegal drugs. A spokesman added: ""Since thePsychoactive Substances Act,externalhas come into force, hundreds of suppliers have been arrested and convicted, retailers have either stopped selling psychoactive substances or closed down and action by the National Crime Agency has resulted in the removal of psychoactive substances being sold by UK-based websites.""

Brussels 'must use common sense' on NI ProtocolLondon says it is disappointing that the European Commission is not recognising the protocol's effects.Northern IrelandComments,"The European Commission said there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. It said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol. It is the part of the Brexit dealthat puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. Ms von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the protocol. The UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market. Technical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. It was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. However, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened. Earlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it washard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland The UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a ""pragmatic, risk-based approach"" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. ""The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,"" said the spokesman. ""While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? NI Protocol 'legally rotten to the core' Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' Speaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market"". She added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had ""a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland"". She said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland. Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would ""spiral"" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods. ""This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday. ""I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland."" DUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday. The trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was ""clear and unambiguous"". ""The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,"" Sir Jeffrey added. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a ""tin ear"" to concerns about the protocol. ""It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,"" she said. Arlene Foster says Mrs von der Leyen's comments show a 'tin ear' ""The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland."" Outgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were ""tone deaf"", and urged her to engage with his party, ""the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement"". He said: ""She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. ""Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London."" But Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted ""the protections the protocol provides"". ""It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,"" he said. ""We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs."" During Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority. It meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU. But after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market. So, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021. The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments ""showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". The LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities. Loyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it. LCC Chairman David Campbell said: ""I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union."" When Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. Officials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. They're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. But the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. It's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. Last week, an LCC member told MPsviolence could not be ruled outif the protocol remained. The organisation also met Lord Frostto discuss the protocol earlier this month. A small protest against the protocol outside Belfast City Hall in early May Rioting erupted insome loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April- withtensions around the protocol partly blamed. Since then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303unlawful parades against the protocol. Meanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal adviceover the DUP's absence at north-south meetings. The DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol. Ms Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventinganother north-south ministerial meeting from taking place.

Families in anguish over pair held in BelarusRoman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained after a plane was diverted to Minsk.Europe,"Videos have emerged of journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega The families of a dissident journalist and his girlfriend, held after a plane was diverted to Belarus, have spoken of their concern for their safety. Roman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega are now in detention. ""I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,"" said his mother Natalia Protasevich. A video of Ms Sapega was released on Tuesday as authorities said they would hold her for at least two months. In the video, Ms Sapega says she edits a Telegram channel which publishes personal information of Belarusian policemen. However, it is likely she is speaking under duress. Ms Sapega and Mr Protasevich were detained on Sunday, when a plane flying from Athens to Vilnius, in neighbouring Lithuania, was diverted to land in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. Western countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane that was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat. Several European airlines have said that they will not fly over Belarus as a result. Belarus plane: What we know and what we don't Who is Roman Protasevich? ''Perfect storm' prompts EU to act fast on Belarus ""Today Sofia was interrogated. She was accused of committing a criminal offence. A preventive measure was chosen - detention for a period of two months,"" her lawyer, Alexander Filanovich, told the BBC's Russian service on Tuesday. Ms Sapega is now in a KGB pre-trial detention centre in the Belarusian capital, he said. In the video, Ms Sapega states that she is the editor of the Black Book of Belarus Telegram channel, which publishes the personal data of the country's security forces. Sapega is currently in a pre-trial detention centre But Ms Sapega's mother cast doubt on how freely her daughter is speaking in the video, released by a pro-government Telegram channel. ""Even my friends called me and said ... this is an unusual manner for her,"" she told the BBC. ""She sways, eyes in the sky - as if afraid of forgetting something."" ""I enlarged [the video] as much as possible - it seems that [she looks] okay. We are now packing warm clothes, we will go to Minsk. I want to try to give her a parcel - I saw she only had a thin jacket."" Passengers describe panic on plane What happens with a military jet interception? Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus It comes after Belarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress. The 26-year-old faces charges related to his reporting of last August's disputed election and subsequent crackdown on mass opposition protests, and has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Minsk To a casual observer, Minsk seems relaxed. On Tuesday evening, there were teenagers with guitars on the embankment, young rappers practising on a city square and no hint of the political turmoil that swept this country after last summer's disputed presidential election. But behind closed doors, people say the audacious arrest of Roman Protasevich has only shown the outside world the reality and the risk that opposition activists inside Belarus have been living with. Just on Tuesday, another seven activists were handed long prison sentences. Last week, the country's best-known independent news website was taken offline, with multiple arrests for supposed financial irregularities. Since the protests were crushed, bloggers and businesspeople, politicians and protesters have all ended up behind bars and no-one knows who might be next. That's why many who would once have spoken freely here are now nervous. They prefer to lie low and keep quiet, just in case. Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners. Mr Protasevich's mother Natalia told the AFP news agency that she had not slept since her son's arrest. ""I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,"" she said, breaking down in tears during an interview in Wroclaw, southern Poland. ""He's only one journalist, he's only one child but please, please... I am begging for help. Please save him! They're going to kill him in there!"" This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC he is fearful his son may be tortured She added that her son is a ""fighter for justice"". ""They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism, I don't think you can call it anything else. He's been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!"" she said. Her voice breaking, she added: ""My son, this young man just wanted to tell the truth about the situation. He didn't do anything wrong."" Belarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday. Police then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was ""super scared"", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. On Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on Sunday's Ryanair flight. According to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on ""our recommendation"". This appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, the leaders of the 27 European Union member states called for the overflight ban, and promised further economic sanctions. Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile. What happens with a military jet interception?

UK experiment could sweep aside fusion hurdleResults from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial fusion power.Science & Environment,"Artwork: Mast Upgrade has been testing an innovative design Initial results from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial power based on nuclear fusion, experts say. The researchers believe they now have a better way to remove the excess heat produced by fusion reactions. This intense heat can melt materials used inside a reactor, limiting the amount of time it can operate for. The system, which has been likened to a car exhaust, resulted in a tenfold reduction in the heat. The tests were carried out at the Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade nuclear fusion experiment at Culham in Oxfordshire. The Â£55m device began operating in October last year, after a seven-year build. UK fusion experiment used in hunt for clean energy Largest nuclear fusion project begins assembly Nuclear fusion: 'A question of when, not if' Nuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes that power the Sun - and other stars - here on planet Earth. But the trick is getting more energy out of the reactions than you put in. This goal continues to elude teams of scientists and engineers around the world, who are working to make fusion power a reality. Existing nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. One common fusion approach uses a reactor design called a tokamak, in which powerful magnetic fields are used to control charged gas - or plasma - inside a doughnut-shaped container. Inside the tokamak, where plasmas are controlled by magnetic fields An international fusion megaproject called Iter is currently under construction in southern France. Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said it would be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of bringing fusion power to the grid. But he added that Iter's size and cost meant that ""if every time you wanted to build a unit, you had to raise that sum of money, then the penetration into the market would be determined by economics, not technology"". Mast Upgrade is one attempt to come up with a template for more compact, cheaper fusion reactors. It makes use of an innovative design known as a spherical tokamak to squeeze the fuel into a 4.4m-tall, 4m-wide space. By comparison, the containment vessel Iter will use to control its fusion reactions is 11.4m tall and 19.4m wide. But Mast Upgrade's bijou dimensions come at a price: ""You're making something that's hotter than the Sun... in a smaller volume. How you then get the heat out becomes a big challenge,"" said Prof Chapman. The core of the plasma within the tokamak reaches temperatures of 100 million C. Without an exhaust system that can handle this unimaginable heat, materials in the design would have to be regularly replaced - significantly affecting the amount of time a power plant could operate for. The new exhaust system being trialled at Culham is known as a Super-X divertor. This would allow components in future commercial tokamaks to last for much longer; greatly increasing the power plant's availability, improving its economic viability and reducing the cost of fusion electricity. Tests at Mast Upgrade have shown at least a tenfold reduction in the heat on materials with the Super-X system. Researchers said the results were a ""game-changer"" for the promise of fusion power plants that could provide affordable, efficient electricity. Against the background of climate change, fusion could offer a clean and virtually limitless source of energy. Dr Andrew Kirk, lead scientist on Mast Upgrade, said the results were ""the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade"". ""We built Mast Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded. ""Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant."" The success of the exhaust system for Mast Upgrade delivers a boost to plans for a prototype fusion power plant in the UK called Step. It is expected to come online sometime in the 2040s. The Mast Upgrade facility will have its official opening ceremony on Wednesday, where guest of honour, astronaut Tim Peake, will create his own artificial star by running a plasma test on the machine.

"Italy seeks to try four over student's murderFive years after Giulio Regeni's body was found in Cairo, a judge says four Egyptians should be tried.Europe","Regeni's mutilated body was left in a ditch on the outskirts of Cairo More than five years after an Italian student's body was found in Cairo, a Rome judge says four senior Egyptian security officials should face trial over his kidnap, torture and murder. Giulio Regeni, a Cambridge University postgraduate student, disappeared in January 2016. His body was so badly disfigured his mother could barely identify him. The four members of the Egyptian security forces are unlikely to travel to Rome for the 14 October trial. The murder has heightened tensions between the two countries. Italian and Egyptian investigators had originally tried to work on the case together but when Rome prosecutors pushed for a trial in late 2020, their counterparts in Cairo said there was ""insufficient evidence to support the accusation in court"". Egypt said evidence had been found that Regeni had been robbed by a criminal gang but that the killer had not been identified. Egypt shelves probe of Cambridge student's murder Italian murdered in Egypt 'over research' At the time of his disappearance, the 28-year-old PhD student was researching Egypt's independent trade unions, a controversial subject in a country where unofficial protest movements have faced a crackdown in recent years. His body was found dumped in a ditch by a road near Cairo on 3 February 2016. An Italian post-mortem examination found he had been tortured ""in stages"" between 25 January and the day of his death. Giulio Regeni's parents, Claudio and Paola, have campaigned for justice for their son for more than five years Rome prosecutors went further, detailing ""acute physical suffering"" from kicks, punches, beatings, cuts and even burns from red-hot objects. Egyptian officials have admitted Regeni was being monitored and Italian investigators said in 2018 that people he had met while doing his research had betrayed him. The four Egyptians all deny involvement in the student's disappearance and killing. Cairo prosecutors dropped all proceedings against them and a fifth suspect last December. Gen Tariq Sabir, Col Usham Helmi, Col Athar Kamel Mohamed Ibrahim and Maj Magdi Ibrahim Abdelal Sharif all face charges in Italy of kidnapping Regeni. Maj Sharif is also accused of conspiring to inflict aggravated injuries and murder. The student's parents, Paola Deffendi and Claudio Regeni, were at Tuesday's hearing to hear Judge Pierluigi Balestrieri rule that there was sufficient evidence to indict the four men. Their lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini, told reporters that all the young man's rights had been violated, ""but today we have the well-founded hope that at least the right to the truth will not be denied Giulio"". ""It has taken us 64 months. But it is a good goal and a good starting point,"" she said. Egyptian officials did not comment immediately on the decision and as the four suspects' home details have not been given to the Italians, there is little chance of contacting them or that the Cairo government will agree to them attending the trial.

"Millions cannot afford water bills, says watchdogOverhauling water tariffs could help struggling families, the Consumer Council for Water says.Business","More than a million households are struggling to pay their water bills, a consumer group has said. Some people have even had to skip meals to pay for water, the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) said. It is calling for a single ""social tariff"", based on a percentage of people's incomes to lower the costs. The government said it would work with industry to ""build a stronger, better and fairer water service for those who need it most"". According to the CCW, there are about 1.7 million people in ""water poverty"", which it defines as having to spend more than 5% of their income after housing costs on water bills. However, about three million households are in danger of slipping into this category. Covid inequality: 'I struggled with the bills and my health' Covid: The baby bank helping families living in poverty These include people on Universal Credit, where any small shocks to their income could tip them over the edge, said Andy White, senior policy manager at CCW. He said about 260,000 people were getting help with their bills from a patchwork of social schemes run by water companies. However, it is a ""postcode lottery"" as to how much help people can get - and the watchdog believes a social tariff would tackle this. There has been significant focus in recent years on fuel poverty, and pressure placed on private companies to make sure the most vulnerable are protected. This research shifts that spotlight onto the affordability of another essential utility - water. Whether you are part of the 1.5 million households classed as currently in water poverty or the 3 million who are on the cusp of it, where you live can make a huge difference to the help you receive. Some companies ask struggling households to pay just 20% of a bill, while in other areas they still face the full charge. Some have a lowest bill guarantee, but many companies don't, and only half of the providers have a crisis fund for those most in need. Although most of these changes could be implemented immediately by companies themselves, the government would have to bring in new laws to create a social tariff which standardised that basic payment rate. CCW chief executive Emma Clancy said: ""We have a golden opportunity to create a simpler and fairer system and end the indignity of people skipping meals or other essentials to pay their water bill. ""Many people are craving certainty in these difficult times and these proposed changes would give millions of households one less thing to worry about and greater peace of mind - whatever the future holds."" The tariff would either be taxpayer funded, or taken from a single pot created by taking money from everyone's water bill in England and Wales. CCW has conducted independent reviews of water affordability in England and Wales. It found that five out of six customers who cannot afford their water bills are not getting the help they need, despite a significant rise in company support schemes over the past decade. It also found that some of the schemes were hampered by insufficient funding and large regional variations in eligibility criteria. Those who are eligible get an average bill reduction of Â£190. CCW also urged the industry to do more to prevent households slipping into water poverty. That could include giving customers greater choice over how they pay their water bills through technology, and providing tailored financial help. Companies should also write off water charges while benefits claimants are awaiting their first Universal Credit payment, it added. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said she would consider the recommendations and work with the sector ""to build a stronger, better and fairer water service"". Christine McGourty, chief executive of Water UK, which represents water companies, said: ""Levels of support for customers have never been greater. ""Over the past year water companies have gone to unprecedented lengths to help hundreds of thousands of household customers who could least afford their bills, with support such as payment breaks and extra assistance for those most in need - but we know there's more to be done."" Gillian Cooper from Citizens Advice said: ""Water is essential, but sadly we know not everyone can easily afford it. ""As households continue to feel the impact of the pandemic, people facing financial difficulties need better support to help them pay their bills. ""CCW's proposal to establish a single social tariff would help make water bills affordable for all households on low incomes.""

"Mothers demand apology over forced adoptionsSome of the 250,000 unmarried women forced to give up babies say it led to a lifetime of grief.UK","Jill Killington says she was told as a pregnant 16-year-old being an unmarried mother was a ""fate worse than death"" Hundreds of women forced into giving up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s have called on the prime minister to issue a government apology. Up to 250,000 women in Britain were coerced into handing over their babies because they were unmarried. Many of the women never had more children and say the loss caused them to lead a lifetime of grief. They want the UK to follow Australia, which in 2013 was the first country to apologise for forced adoptions. 'A lifelong legacy of pain and suffering' Irish PM apologises over mother and baby homes 'They called us fallen women, bad women' ""It was the most shameful thing that could happen,"" says Jill Killington from Leeds. She became pregnant in 1967, aged 16, and says being an unmarried mother ""was described as a fate worse than death"". She recalls having to stay upstairs at her home to hide her growing tummy, so she was out of sight when anyone visited. ""My mother asked me to wear a wedding ring when I went out. It was a deeply humiliating time,"" she says. This video can not be played Judy Baker gave birth aged 18 and was pressured into giving up her baby for adoption Veronica Smith became pregnant in 1965 while working as a nurse at a Butlin's Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis in West Sussex. The chilling reality of her situation hit home when she broke the news to her mother. ""My mother told me if my father found out it would kill him, so I never told him, ever."" Instead, Veronica was secretly sent to a mother and baby home in a part of London not far from her parents' house and she would meet up with her mother on Wimbledon railway station every Saturday. ""She would bring a blank airmail envelope and I would write a letter saying I was in Spain enjoying work and life. She would then take the letter home and show it to my father, who believed I was in Spain."" Lawyers examining the birth mothers' cases have focused on the period between 1945 and 1975 - before a change in adoption law - when around 500,000 babies were adopted in Britain, mostly from mothers who were under 24 and unmarried. Their research suggests about half of those women faced sustained pressure to give up their babies from professionals, including doctors, midwives, workers in mother and baby homes and adoption staff in religious and council-run homes. Ann Keen was 17 when she became pregnant in 1966 and recalls a particularly cruel moment during the birth of her son. ""I wasn't given any pain relief,"" she says. ""The midwife said 'you'll remember this, so you won't be wicked again'."" Ann Keen - who later became an MP - was forced to give birth as a teenager without pain relief Ann says she wasn't even given the opportunity to say goodbye to her son. ""Eight days after giving birth, I went to the hospital nursery to see him and he wasn't there,"" she says. ""The midwife told me 'he's gone. He's in that room over there. They'll be happy and that's the last you'll see of him'."" Ann says: ""It was coercion. The phrase they used was, 'This is for the best' and 'if you really love your baby, you should give him up'."" For Diana Defries, who was 16 when she became pregnant, it was a different kind of trauma. She says the moment after she gave birth someone in the delivery room announced, ""this baby is flagged for adoption and I'll take her away"". ""I yelled to bring her back,"" says Diana. ""But the nurse then just walked past me and put my daughter on a table out of my reach. They all then left the room with just me and my crying baby. All I could croak was 'help me, please'. ""At that moment, I remember thinking, it would be better for me to die."" Diana says: ""I do feel my social worker used coercion. The bullying wore me down"". Diana Defries says she pleaded for her baby to be brought back to her To enable an adoption, the women were supposed to sign consent forms. But some experts have doubts about the legality of some of the consent processes.â¯ Solicitor Carolynn Gallwey, who has acted for the birth mothers, says all of those she has spoken to said they had no choice but to sign the consent form. She says there is also evidence to show some mothers' forms may have been signed by other people, such as their parents or even their GP. One document, shown to the BBC by a woman who didn't want to be named, suggests a judge in one of the adoption hearings questioned the authenticity of a signature. Ms Gallwey said the women were also not told they were entitled to financial help or other kinds of support that might have meant they could have kept their children. Many of the adoptees who were given to new families in forced adoptions have also spoken of their shock at what happened to their birth mothers. Some of them say it has added to their own sense of loss. Gaynor Weatherly, whose mother was 16 when she was born in 1963, says: ""It's like a piece of me has been missing. It can eat you up."" Gaynor says she has found happiness through her own marriage and children but that she feels ""cheated out of a different life"". Gaynor Weatherly says the loss of being taken from her mother ""can eat you up"" Some of the adoptees were eventually reunited with their birth mothers, but it often took decades. Rachel Langham, who was born to Veronica Smith, went to live in Canada after she was adopted. She had a loving relationship with her adoptive parents, but says what happened to Veronica was ""inhumane"". ""I feel terrible empathy and sorrow for her and someone should apologise,"" Rachel says. Rachel Langham, pictured as a child and now, says the treatment of her birth mother was ""inhumane"" In her 40s, Rachel was reunited with Veronica. But building a relationship after so many years has been hard, and Veronica says these lifelong repercussions are one more reason why an apology is so essential. Hundreds of women have now written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say they deserve one from the UK government, on behalf of the institutions and individuals who treated them so badly. Birth mothers in Australia received the world's first government apology in 2013 when Julia Gillard, the prime minister at the time, apologised to around 150,000 women whose babies were taken from them. And three years ago, the Canadian Senate recommended the federal government issue an apology to 300,000 Canadian women. In January of this year, the Irish Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades. The women in Britain, most of whom are now in their 70s and 80s, say an apology would bring lasting comfort. Ann Keen, who went on to become an MP and junior minister, says: ""I did not give up my son or abandon him. An apology would clear my name and my son's name. An historical injustice is what happened. It's time to say sorry."" In a statement, Children and Families minister Vicky Ford said: ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. We cannot undo the past, but we can be reassured that our legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since then.""â¯ â¯The 1975â¯and 1989 Children Actsâ¯and the 1976 Adoption Act were among the laws that have made it easier forâ¯adopted childrenâ¯and their birth mothers to regain contact with each other.

Cummings to be quizzed by MPs on pandemic handling,"The whiteboard picture, tweeted by Dominic Cummings, ahead of his committee hearing Former adviser Dominic Cummings is to be questioned by MPs about the government's response to the pandemic. Mr Cummings, who left Downing Street last autumn, has been highly critical of the government in recent weeks. He is also expected to claim later that Boris Johnson was keen to visit the Queen in person five days before the first Covid lockdown began. Downing Street has denied this happened and said their conversation on 18 March last year took place on the telephone. The Queen went from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle shortly afterwards. This happened in order to protect the then 93-year-old monarch from the danger of catching coronavirus. LIVE: Follow the question session Dominic Cummings: Who is the PM's former adviser?

Ahead of his meeting,Mr Cummings tweeted a picture,externalwhich he called the ""first sketch of Plan B, PM study, Fri 13/3 eve - shown PM Sat 14/4"". It appears to show a whiteboard with sketches from attendees at the meeting. Mr Cummings promised to reveal further details later. The questioning of Mr Cummings will take place at a joint session of Parliament's health and social care and the science and technology select committees. Mr Cummings - who gave evidence to one committee in March - will be grilled by MPs at 09:30 BST for around four hours, with live coverage taking place on the BBC News website. Questions are expected to cover a range of topics including decision-making in the early months, the timings of lockdowns and other restrictions and the procurement processes.

Last week, he tweeted the government's pandemic plan had been""part disaster, part non-existent""and he called for more scrutiny of policy to ensure the Indian variant is dealt with.

Dominic Cummings was in the room when decisions about lives and deaths were made during the Covid emergency. He's made no secret of his frustration now, at the speed of decision-making when the virus had arrived in the UK, blasting the level of preparations and the government's original plan. The former adviser's real fire today is expected to be turned on the prime minister's attitude to bringing back restrictions in September when Covid was again taking hold, but No 10 did not act until later on. It is understood he will share his belief that the failure to toughen the rules led to a much bigger outbreak of the disease. And he will suggest that was Boris Johnson's terrible mistake because the government by then had a much better understanding of the virus, could have predicted what would happen and could have prevented much of it. Yet Mr Cummings cannot extricate himself from what went wrong. Few others had more influence over the decisions that were made. Read more from Laura.
