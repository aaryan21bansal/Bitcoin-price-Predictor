Concern over neurologist's contacts with patient,"Dr Michael Watt is at the centre of Northern Ireland's biggest patient recall Interactions with a patient by former Belfast Trust neurologist Dr Michael Watt have raised serious concerns, according to a medical ethics expert. London-based barrister Daniel Sokol has reviewed evidence obtained by BBC Spotlight, including text messages between Dr Watt and the woman that were sent between 2017 and 2020. Concerns over Dr Watt's clinical practice at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital promptedthe biggest ever patient recall in Northern Irelandin 2018. His work and its oversight is the subject of three ongoing high-level inquiries. WATCH: Patient Recall, The Search for Answers Spotlight has asked Dr Watt for his account of his interactions but his solicitor told us Dr Watt's mental health had worsened over the past two years and he could not respond. The woman, Jane, whose identity Spotlight has chosen not to reveal, first met Dr Watt in 2002. He diagnosed her with epilepsy. Jane had suffered a miscarriage in the 1990s and later discovered tissue from her baby had been kept at the Royal Victoria Hospital without her knowledge. She said she was traumatised and did not want to go back to the hospital. She told Spotlight she then met Dr Watt in coffee shops and, for a time, the meetings were also medical consultations. Barrister Daniel Sokol said: ""A coffee shop is somewhere where you go and meet friends. It's not somewhere where you go and see a doctor. ""It's difficult in such a location to maintain privacy, it's difficult to maintain confidentiality. I think it does suggest a lapse of judgement on the part of the doctor here."" Jane told Spotlight that after a meeting with him in 2016, Dr Watt kissed her on the lips. She said although she felt the kiss was inappropriate, she laughed it off because she did not like confrontation and still needed Dr Watt as her neurologist. Recall neurologist will not appear at inquiry Fifth of neurologist's patients misdiagnosed Dr Michael Watt inquiry is given public status Mr Sokol said all medical codes of conduct forbid a doctor pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with a patient. ""Kissing on the lips clearly is an overstepping of the boundary - in fact it's not an overstepping, the boundary is a tiny line in the distance."" Dr Watt worked at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital as a neurologist Later in 2016, a GP raised a red flag over Dr Watt's care. Then in June 2017, the neurologist was withdrawn from seeing patients. Spotlight has obtained texts Dr Watt exchanged with Jane between October 2017 and January 2020. Mr Sokol told Spotlight he believes that even though Dr Watt was withdrawn from patient care during the period covered by the texts, he should have been behaving as though 'Jane' was still his patient. ""It appears this patient wants to re-establish the relationship, the therapeutic relationship, as soon as it's permitted and so therefore this doctor should treat this individual as a patient."" The messages show Dr Watt inviting Jane to his house when he is alone, adding ""entirely safe"" and ""and no funny business x"" via text message. According to Jane, the ""no funny business"" meant ""basically he won't attempt to kiss me again as he had done previously"", which she did not trust would be the case, declining his invitation. Dr Watt exchanged a number of texts with Jane (reconstruction of actual text) Having reviewed the text exchange, Mr Sokol said that Jane could be considered vulnerable and dependent on Dr Watt and it was ""particularly troubling"" that Dr Watt had insisted she come to his house, saying at one point ""oh go on"". But it's messages Dr Watt exchanged with Jane in the summer of 2019 that are most extraordinary. At that time, patients and their families were anxiously awaiting a delayed report on the recall of patients, unaware it had been postponed because Dr Watt had been assessed as at risk of suicide. He texted Jane around the time of that assessment, firstly indicating that he was off sick for financial reasons. ""Still hanging together. Now off on sick to try and prevent the buggers stopping paying me,"" he wrote. Reconstruction of actual text Dr Watt then mentioned to Jane that he had upcoming appointments with occupational health and psychiatry. Then, a couple of weeks later, he sent the most extraordinary message of all after Jane texted to ask him how those appointments had gone. ""They've concluded a significant risk of me topping myself and have postponed the publication of the recall results,"" he wrote, followed by two 'crying with laughter' emojis. We asked Dr Watt for his account of all of the text exchanges but his solicitor said the deterioration in his mental health over the past two years left him unable to respond. So while Spotlight has seen the text messages, we only have 'Jane's' account of the circumstances and not Dr Watt's. And it's important to remember that a single text message does not provide a clear and detailed insight into Dr Watt's mental state either then or now. Spotlight showed some messages from summer 2019 to Therese Ward, a former patient of Dr Watt, who, like others, has been anxiously awaiting the publication of the recall results. ""It's just incredible. That he would put in a message, in a Whatsapp message to a former patient, that there was 'a significant risk of me topping myself and have postponed the publication of the recall results' and he laughs. ""He is laughing at us patients. I find that outrageous, absolutely outrageous that he finds this funny."" In a statement, Dr Watt's former employer, the Belfast Trust, said it was co-operating with all inquiries related to Dr Watt's care and would ensure the matters raised by Spotlight would be brought to the attention of all relevant bodies.

Britney Spears' father suspended as conservator,"This video can not be played Cheers and cries: Fans react to the news A judge has suspended Britney Spears' father from the legal arrangement that gave him control of her life after Spears accused him of years of abuse. Jamie Spears was appointed her guardian in 2008, amid concerns over her mental health. On Wednesday, a judge handed the role to a man appointed by Spears. Fans around the world have supported her through the #FreeBritney campaign. Those outside the court in Los Angeles cheered and whooped when they heard the news. And there was jubilation from some of Spears' high-profile supporters on social media, including Cher, LaToya Jackson and Dionne Warwick. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Spears, who denies any abuse, had filed to end the conservatorship after Spears requested another guardian. A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one for her estate and financial affairs, the other for her as a person. Under this legal agreement, she has not controlled her finances since 2008. Britney Spears pictured at a film screening in 2019 Jamie Spears was initially in charge of both parts of the conservatorship but stepped down as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 for health reasons. Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, replaced him in that role on what has been a temporary basis. In a court hearing in Los Angeles, Judge Brenda Penny formally ended the conservatorship that the star had with her father, but left in place a separate conservatorship with an accountant chosen by Spears' legal team. Mr Spears had argued that this accountant, John Zabel, was not qualified to oversee the singer's $59m (Â£46m) fortune. Judge Penny ruled that the singer's care be turned over to Mr Zabel ""forthwith"", adding that it ""is in the best interest of the conservatee"". The singer's lawyers also requested that a new hearing be held in the next 30 to 45 days to decide whether to end Spears' conservatorship altogether. Britney 'on cloud nine' after ruling The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Spears' struggles with mental health and the courts have attracted massive public interest, with three documentaries on her life released in just the past week alone. Ahead of the hearing on Wednesday, fans held a rally outside the court where they sang her classic ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"". Fans in London's Trafalgar Square also held a Free Britney rally on Wednesday. Spears herself did not call into the hearing. After quietly simmering for years, the case exploded this summer amid a flurry of legal filings. On 23 June, Spears delivered a 20-minute emotional testimony in court, blasting the arrangement with her father. She accused him of holding her in a mental health facility against her will and forcing her to use medications and birth control to prevent her from getting pregnant. ""I just want my life back,"" she said. ""I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive."" Spears spoke in court again on 14 July, telling the judge she wanted to charge her father with conservatorship abuse.  ""If this is not abuse, I don't know what is,"" she added. Mr Spears and his lawyers have denied all allegations of abuse, saying in court filings that ""all he wants is what is best for his daughter"". ""If Ms Spears wants to terminate the conservatorship and believes that she can handle her own life, Mr Spears believes that she should get that chance,"" his lawyers told the judge earlier this month. Mathew Rosengart, a lawyer hired by Ms Spears in July, has accused Mr Spears of trying to extort $2m from his daughter as a condition of ending the conservatorship. In a surprise move in September, Mr Spears himself filed to end the 13-year arrangement. It came about two months after he offered to step down and allow another guardian to replace him. During Wednesday's hearing, Mr Rosengart argued that Spears' should continue to be temporarily overseen by Mr Zabel until Mr Spears' alleged abuse is fully investigated. Mr Spears' lawyer, Vivian Thoreen objected, calling Mr Zabel a ""stranger"" to the case. After the ruling, her fiancÃ© Sam Asgharitook to Instagram to cheer the decision,external. Spears ""burst into tears upon hearing the judge's decision,"" a source close to the singer told Page Six. ""She's in shock and at a loss for words but literally jumping for joy. She hasn't felt joy like this in 13 years,"" the person added. Britney fans cry and cheer at conservator news.

Three more energy firms go bust amid gas price rise,"Three more energy suppliers have gone bust amid the surge in wholesale gas prices, the regulator Ofgem has said. Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy said they would stop trading on Wednesday. The trio are the latest companies to go under as soaring gas prices have made price promises by suppliers to customers undeliverable. Together, the suppliers represent less than 1% of the UK market with a total of about 233,000 customers, Ofgem said. Enstroga supplies gas and electricity to about 6,000 domestic customers, while Igloo has about 179,000. Symbio Energy has roughly 48,000 in the UK and a small number overseas. The three energy supplies follow six others which have collapsed in recent weeks. A total of nearly 1.73m customers have been affected in September. Ofgem said customers of Enstroga, Igloo and Symbio would continue to receive energy supplies and any credit to their accounts would be protected. Affected customers will be switched to a new tariff by Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier, the regulator said. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. No chance lights will go out, says government Energy regulator says gas crisis not its fault Former US vice-president buys stake in energy firm Ofgem added that consumers will also be protected by the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas, once switched to a new tariff. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said: ""Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers. ""I want to reassure customers of Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy that they do not need to worry. ""Ofgem will choose a new supplier for you and while we are doing this our advice is to wait until we appoint a new supplier and do not switch in the meantime. You can rely on your energy supply as normal."" On Monday, Ofgem announced Shell Energy had been appointed as the new supplier for 255,000 gas and electricity customers of Green, which collapsed last week. Green ceased trading on the same day as another supplier, Avro, whose 580,000 customers have been moved to Octopus Energy. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, previously told the BBC the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up,"" he said. Mr Brearley has rejected claims from the industry the current crisis represents a failure to adequately regulate the market. The government has said it is looking at issuing loans to bigger energy firms to help them take on stranded customers. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and added he does ""not expect supply emergencies"". Consumers' attention may have been drawn to the queues for petrol this week, but this news is evidence the gas crisis is far from over. It is a crisis that many more suppliers are not expected to survive. The pressure on them is increasing as wholesale gas prices are continuing to go up. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of customers of these three collapsed companies will now wait to be moved automatically onto new, dedicated - but undoubtedly more expensive - tariffs. Millions more face price rises on Friday, when Ofgem's higher price cap for variable tariffs kicks in. As more and more suppliers fold, the cost of dealing with their customers will mean further price rises for everyone in the future are inevitable.

Firmus gas prices to rise by a third,"More than 50,000 customers will be affected, with the average household bill set to increase by Â£182 a year Gas supplier firmus energy has announced that tariffs in the Greater Belfast Network will increase by 32.98%. The change will take effect from 22 October. More than 50,000 customers will be affected by the increase, with the average household bill set to increase by Â£182 a year. Firmus energy said the move was due to global gas commodity prices increasing by 200% since the beginning of April. Wednesday'sannouncement comes after a tariff increasein April. The Greater Belfast Network area covers Belfast, Lisburn, Bangor, Holywood, Donaghadee, Larne, Groomsport, Millisle, Newtownards, Carryduff, Comber, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus, and east Down. Firmus Managing director Michael Scott apologised for the price rise, which he said was down to the huge increases in the cost of purchasing natural gas on the global markets. ""It is simply unavoidable, as these costs are totally beyond our control,"" he said. ""With the world starting to reopen again, following the Covid-19 restrictions, this is leading to increased demand for natural gas and that has been driving the prices up. ""We will continue to monitor and review our tariffs to ensure customers are getting the best prices possible. Mr Scott acknowledged the increase would hit customers ""at a particularly difficult time for many"", and said Firmus was committed to working with consumer bodies to support its customers, especially over the winter months. Raymond Gormley, head of energy policy at the Consumer Council, said that while the price rise was expected ""it makes it no less challenging for household budgets to absorb"". ""Gas consumers in the Belfast area have the opportunity to switch supplier and the Consumer Council would encourage customers to check they have the best deal before 21 October when the opt-out period ends,"" said Mr Gormley in a statement. ""We would encourage all consumers to think about ways they can reduce their energy costs. Switching payment option, changing billing method or switching supplier can save some money."" Mr Gormley added that customers struggling with their energy bills should contact their supplier directly for help. The announcement came as EirGrid, which operates the electricity grids in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland has warned of a ""challenging"" winter,saying low availability of power plants continued to be a concern. Energy prices have continued to rise significantly with many households set to pay more for electricity and heating this winter.

New boss of Sports Direct group could net Â£100m,"Michael Murray Frasers' shareholders have backed a Â£100m pay deal for upcoming boss Michael Murray, Mike Ashley's prospective son-in-law. Around 85% voted for the package, which could hand Mr Murray a Â£100m bonus on top of his annual Â£1m salary. He'll get the bumper bonus if the company's shares reach Â£15 in the next four years. The 31-year-old is set to take over from retail tycoon Mike Ashley, who will become chairman of the group. Mr Murray is currently ""head of elevation"" at the group, which owns brands including Sports Direct, House of Frasers and Flannels, and is in charge of modernising stores and transforming the business. He is due to become chief executive on 1 May 2022. Sports Direct's Mike Ashley to hand reins to future son-in-law Mr Murray is engaged to be married to Mr Ashley's daughter Anna and will receive the Â£100m bonus if the Â£15 share target is reached for a consecutive 30-day period at any point over the next four years. The company's shares are currently trading just below Â£7 and reached an all-time high of more than Â£9 in April 2014. It listed its shares on the stock exchange in 2007, with shares priced at Â£3. Shareholders were given the chance to vote on the deal and a number of other issues during Wednesday's annual general meeting. More than 15% voted against the proposal with just under 85% voting in favour. The package needed to pass a 50% threshold to be approved. The move was expected to get the thumbs up, particularly given that Newcastle United owner Mr Ashley - who founded Sports Direct in 1982 - owns an almost 60% stake in Frasers. That was despite Influential advisory groups Pirc and Glass Lewis advising shareholders to vote against the remuneration plan, highlighting ""excessive pay-outs"" at the company. The approved pay package could also see Frasers' finance director Chris Wootton in line for up to Â£9m if certain requirements are hit. Frasers said the new share bonus scheme had targets which were both ""stretching and achievable"". When announcing the package last month it said: ""The board believes that the significant increase in value of the shares to be achieved before Michael's share option award vests is suitably challenging but achievable and would be evidence of the success of the group's elevation strategy and Michael's leading role in this."" The pay deals come after the retailer group claimed Â£97m in business rates relief and roughly Â£80m in furlough payments from the government.

Reserve tankers deployed to boost fuel deliveries,"This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said.

No more visa schemes for staff shortages - sources,"The UK will not introduce visa schemes for any other sectors facing staff shortages, sources have told the BBC. On Sunday,the government set uptemporary visa schemes for HGV drivers and poultry workers to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas. Staff shortages in areas including hospitality and care have led to calls for a similar relaxation of post-Brexit immigration rules for other sectors. But government sources said firms should improve pay and conditions. What's in short supply and why? Prezzo gives staff pay rise and Boxing Day off Next warns of staff shortages and price rises Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? Kate Nicholls from UK Hospitality warned that without measures such as temporary visas the recovery from the pandemic would ""falter"". She said the sector was helping people into apprenticeships, offering training schemes and noted that wages had risen by 19% over the last five years. However she said a ""chronic shortage of staff is a significant barrier to the hospitality industry's recovery"", and urged the government to consider ""all reasonable measures"". But the BBC has been told the Home Office and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy are not discussing the possibility of visas for other sectors. And one UK government source said: ""In order to move to a high-wage, high-skilled economy, businesses should invest in their workforce and improve pay and conditions."" The government introduced temporary visas for HGV drivers after staff shortages led to a delay in fuel supply Ms Nicholls is a member of the government's new hospitality council which met on Wednesday. It assembles industry experts to help pubs, cafes and restaurants recover from the pandemic. Another government insider stressed the view was that in the years since Brexit ministers had been telling businesses to move away from relying on cheaper labour to a high-skill, high-wage economy and some businesses had not accepted this. On Tuesday,the Financial Times published a letter,externalfrom more than 65 hospitality leaders to the prime minister demanding that immigration requirements for hospitality workers be urgently loosened. A day later, the chief executive of retailers Next Lord Wolfson said: ""Without some relaxation of immigration rules, we are likely to experience some degradation in our service in the run up to Christmas."" Meanwhile some food chains like Itsu and Prezzo have been already offering pay rises and other incentives to try attract more workers. Earlier this year, hospitality bodies saidone in five workers had left the sector during the coronavirus pandemic, with Covid and Brexit often cited as exacerbating the problem. Others have also suggested that long working-hours and low pay in the industry could be putting applicants off. A government spokesperson said they were ""closely monitoring labour supply"" but ""the government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options wage increases and investment."" Last week, government introduced visas for HGV drivers, when a lack of staff led to delays in getting fuel to petrol stations. However, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, Andrew Opie, has warned that the 5,000 new visas created by the government for HGV drivers would ""barely scratch the surface on alleviating the problem"". He urged the government to ""rapidly extend its visa scheme"" adding ""without action, millions of households over the country will be disappointed this Christmas"".

Sarah Everard's family 'tormented' by her murder,"Sarah Everard's mother Susan said she had kept her daughter's dressing gown because of its familiar smell The mother of Sarah Everard has told a court she is ""tormented"" at the thought of what her daughter endured. The 33-year-old marketing executive was abducted by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as he falsely arrested her for breaching Covid guidelines. Couzens drove for several hours before raping and strangling her, and setting fire to her body. Ms Everard's mother Susan told the Old Bailey she had kept her daughter's dressing gown as it smelled like her. The sentencing hearing, which has been adjourned until Thursday, earlier heard how, on 3 March this year, Couzens used his police warrant cardto trick Ms Everard into being handcuffed and getting in his hire car. She had been walking from a friend's house in Clapham to her own home in Brixton at about 21:00 GMT. CCTV was shown to the courtwhich captured the moments leading up to Ms Everard being put in Couzens' car. Two witnesses saw him handcuff her but believed he was acting legitimately as a police officer. Reading a victim impact statement in court, Mrs Everard said: ""She spent the last hours on this Earth with the very worst of humanity. ""Sarah died in horrendous circumstances. I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger. ""Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. Jeremy Everard asked for this photograph of his daughter to be shown at the Old Bailey as he read his victim impact statement ""Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled. ""I yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her: she was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautiful dancer. She was a wonderful daughter."" In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Everard's father Jeremy asked for a photograph of his daughter to be shown to the courtroom as he read his impact statement. He first, though, told Couzens to look at him, saying: ""No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us."" Prof Everard told the killer ""there can be no redemption"" for what he had done. ""All my family want is Sarah back with us. We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life. ""The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day."" This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Couzens' two-day sentencing hearing has been told that Ms Everard's ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". He had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. Mrs Everard said: ""In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: 'Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run.'"" Prof Jeremy Everard addressed the courtroom after telling Couzens to look at him The family of Sarah Everard were dignified as they described losing a daughter, a sister and even future generations of children. Ms Everard's sister Katie, mother Susan and father Jeremy all read out victim impact statements. Ms Everard's father and sister both directly addressed Couzens - who had his head bowed - demanding he look at them as they spoke. Jeremy Everard told him: ""I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from usâ¦ she was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. ""You burnt our daughter's body - you further tortured us - so that we could not see her again. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sisters, family and friends."" Katie Everard asked Couzens: ""What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? ""When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night?"" A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. The Metropolitan Police hasreleased footage from an interview with Couzensin his home on 9 March where he claimed not to know Ms Everard after being shown her picture. Ms Everard's sister Katie described packing up her younger sister's ""whole life"" when collecting her possessions from the Brixton flat she never returned to: ""Washing was left hanging and packages were waiting to be opened when she got home. ""But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. ""My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. ""I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing. ""All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaid, meeting her babies and being an aunty, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. ""You took her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. ""Her future no longer exists."" Couzens, who could be given a whole-life term, has admitted kidnap, murder and rape. He will be sentenced on Thursday. New footage released in Sarah Everard case.

"Don't say 'panic' amid fuel crisis, councils told","The government has advised councils not to use the phrases ""panic"" or ""panic buying"" about fuel supply problems, documents seen by the BBC reveal. Slides prepared by the Cabinet Office's Behavioural Science Team also advised against using language that morally judges people buying petrol. A Green Party council leader called the recommendations ""nonsensical"". The government said it worked ""closely with councils... on communications to encourage a co-ordinated response."" The advice sent to local authorities from central government comes after days of long queues at petrol stations which began after fears a lorry driver shortage would hit fuel supplies triggered a surge in demand. On Wednesday the government deployed a reserve tanker fleet to boost deliveries and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the situation was ""stabilising"". Reserve tankers going on the road to deliver fuel Is the petrol shortage improving? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? In a power point presentation marked ""official sensitive"" the Cabinet Office warns against using the terms ""panic"", ""panic buying"" and ""stockpiling"". The document - labelled ""considerations for local authorities"" - explains that people don't recognise their own behaviour as ""panic buying"" and that the use of such phrases can cause panic which can become contagious. Instead it recommends using phrases like ""filling up earlier than usual"" or ""changed patterns in demand"". Other tips include avoiding language that morally judges those queuing for petrol as ""framing all individuals who stock up as 'selfish' or 'irrational' is likely to receive some backlash"". ""Framing people buying excess fuel as 'taking away from those who need it/ the NHS etc.' is likely to lead to them feeling like their freedom has been threatened, leading them to more readily engage in 'panic buying' behaviour,"" the document says. The advice also says councils could encourage petrol stations to take down signs saying ""abuse will not be tolerated"" - which could lead customers to expect confrontation on arrival. Speaking to BBC Radio Sussex, PhÃ©lim Mac Cafferty, the Green Party leader of Brighton and Hove City Council said the recommendations amounted to asking councils to ""help the government cover up the fuel crisis"". ""Instead of guidance to help us, help our communities navigate the fuel crisis, we have been given platitudes. ""This is beyond not good enough. It's a disgrace.""

Reserve tankers going on the road to deliver fuel,"This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said.

Lava engulfs house that survived La Palma eruptionThe owners of the so-called miracle house are devastated after it succumbed to the lava flow.,"The residence had been dubbed a ""miracle house"" for escaping the lava A house that miraculously survived an erupting volcano on La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands for days has now been consumed by lava. The retired Danish couple who owned the house, Inge Bergedorf and Ranier Cocq, told Spanish media on Tuesday it had been swallowed by the flow. ""Everything is destroyed,"" Mr Cocq told the El Mundo newspaper. The property became known as the ""miracle house"" after escaping lava flowing from the Cumbre Vieja volcano. The lava has flattened hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of more than 6,000 people since it started pouring from the volcano on 19 September. On Tuesday nightthe lava reached the Atlantic Ocean, on the west coast of the island, raising fears of explosions and the release of toxic gases. This video can not be played Clouds of steam can be seen as scorching lava enters the Atlantic Ocean Mr Cocq and his wife were not on the island when their house succumbed to the volcano. They live on the Jutland peninsula in Denmark and have not visited La Palma since the Covid-19 pandemic began. ""We have lost everything on our beloved island,""Mr Cocq told El Mundo,external. ""It is very sad. Inge and I are devastated."" 'Miracle house' escapes Canary Islands lava 'You can hear the volcano rumbling in the background' La Palma volcano lava engulfs homes and swimming pools The modest house was built on a 3,000 sq m (32,200 sq ft) plot of land the couple bought decades ago. Had the volcano not erupted, the retired couple said they would have been packing their bags for a getaway in La Palma this autumn. ""We used to go in October and November to collect the grapes that we have in our vineyards. But now there is nothing left,"" Mr Cocq said. One of his daughters, Yenny Cocq, told the BBC the lot her father loved will probably become a wasteland now. ""My mother still looks at old images she finds online and says there is still hope. My father insists [we] rebuild in exactly that location. Although I tell them there won't be a way to get there."" The Cumbre Vieja volcano has been erupting since 19 September A striking image of their home on a small sliver of land, untouched by lava, was seen as a symbol of hope when it spread across the internet last week. The image was taken with a drone by photographer Alfonso Escalero. In an Instagram post, he wrote: ""We will look for another sign that does not make us lose hope in these difficult days."" Many families on the island have lost their homes. On Wednesday the EU's Copernicus service estimated that the lava had destroyed 656 homes on its way to the ocean. The Spanish authorities have declared La Palma a disaster zone, pledging financial support for all those affected by the volcanic activity.

Five things we learned from Labour conference,"It's been a rollercoaster ride by the Brighton seaside for Labour, as the party enjoyed its first full conference in two years. Here are some things we didn't know a week ago. Sir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"" There have been a lot of headlines this week about rows between the leadership and the left. Sir Keir may have largely avoided direct confrontation with his Corbynite critics, but he did manage to push through rule changes which will have a big effect on how the party governs itself. Then came Wednesday's speech. Sir Keir faced down hecklers in the hall and told them that under his leadership, Labour would never stand on a manifesto that wasn't a serious plan for government. Old hands watching the speech detected shades of former leader Neil Kinnock - who famously took on the far left Militant tendencyat a Labour conference in 1985,external. Sir Keir and his wife Victoria took a stroll on the Brighton seafront ahead of his speech We'veheard stories about his family before, but Sir Keir looked back at his upbringing in his main conference speech. He spoke about his mum's illness - she was diagnosed with Still's disease when he was young - and he recalled going into the intensive care unit to visit. ""Mum's bed was a riot of tubes and temperature devices. I could sense the urgency in the conversation of the four nurses on my mum's bed. I knew without being told that they were keeping her alive. I can hardly convey to you the emotion of seeing your mum in that condition,"" he said. He went on to praise the nurses who looked after her. And he spoke movingly about his dad, a tool maker, who, he said, gave him a ""deep respect for the dignity of work"". This video can not be played Labourâs shadow chancellor says she would invest in ""good jobs in the green industries of the future"" Patience was wearing thinin some Labour circlesover Sir Keir Starmer's apparent determination not to reveal policies until the next election. This week has seen some big announcements, although there is still a long way to go before we get the full picture. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had most of the blockbusters - including a pledge to spend Â£28bn a year on greening the economy. She also promised to scrap business rates and replace them with... something that has yet to be decided. Sir Keir meanwhile announced plans for a major investment in education - to be funded by taxing private schools - as well as mental health services and to insulate 19 million homes in England to save energy. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer responded: ""Shouting slogans or changing lives?"" to hecklers Cries of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" regularly rang out in Brighton this week - and Sir Keir was barracked during his speech by left-wingers who believe he has trashed his predecessor's radical legacy. He had some put-downs ready for them, saying he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"". He appears very comfortable with the fact that he will never be loved by many party members, in the way that Corbyn is. Mr Corbyn himself was much in evidence at fringe events and Q&A sessions - despite still being suspended from the Parliamentary party, a situation which shows little sign of being resolved. He publicly backedAndy McDonald, the sole surviving member of his shadow cabinet, who dramatically quit his role on Monday in protest at Sir Keir's leadership and his failure to back a Â£15-an-hour minimum wage. This video can not be played Angela Rayner on her 'scum' comments: ""I am bombastic and I apologise if it offended the public."" Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, ensured the word ""scum"" floated to the top of the social media pond after an outburst at a party event on Saturday night. In a masterclass in how to keep a furore going, she doubled down on the attack on Boris Johnson, saying she would apologise for calling the prime minister ""scum"" if he said sorry for his past controversies. OK, so some shadow cabinet colleagues - including Sir Keir - seemed less than impressed by her choice of language, but it went down a lot better among party members in Brighton. A GMB delegate got a round of applause on Tuesday when he read out the Oxford English Dictionary definition of scum: ""A very bad or immoral person or group of people"" - an accurate description of the government, he said. Conference was rounded off with a final volley from Ms Rayner, who said she understood people being upset by her language and said she was just ""bombastic"".

The posts were written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald. Our live page will be coming to a close soon. But before we go, here's a round-up of the latest on the fuel supply crisis.  Read more in our story here We've been hearing that many in the industry and government believe the fuel supply issues will ease now that a lot of people have filled up their cars. That's because it's difficult, and dangerous, to store fuel. Steve Duffield, from the Humberside Rescue Service, says if you're storing canisters at home, you're taking a risk. ""Petrol is inherently a dangerous substance, itâs a highly flammable liquid, it gives off vapours that can be very very easily ignited and any leak of that petrol can lead to obviously, from our perspective, a serious fire and potentially an explosion,"" he says. The RAC says the fuel supply issue is ""improving"" - but the situation for drivers has not yet returned to normal. Spokesman Simon Williams says: âWhile fuel deliveries to forecourts have yet to return to normal, our latest breakdown data points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside."" He says there were ""huge increases"" in such breakdowns between Sunday and Monday, but this fell by 40% from Monday to Tuesday. He adds: ""While the numbers are still higher than weâd normally expect to see, itâs definitely a positive sign. ""Our patrols continue to work hard to keep drivers moving."" One of our reporters, BBC Scotland's Sarah Toom, visited 15 filling stations across Glasgow this morning. Of these, she says  four were closed completely because they had no fuel while several others had diesel but no petrol. One teacher told her he had finally managed to find petrol after visiting five other filling stations - all of which had run out. However, Sarah says she saw no sign of panic-buying or queuing, despite being out and about during morning rush-hour. And there seems to be a mixed picture across much of the rest of the country, with reports of some petrol stations being completely dry while others close-by are operating as normal. Find out more about the situation in Scotland here. Graham Swain, from Sheffield, tells the BBC his mum has been diagnosed with cancer - but he was unable to visit her in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire over the weekend because none of the filling stations he tried on Saturday morning had fuel left. ""This was at 5:30 in the morning,"" he tells the BBC. ""I tried nine stations and one did have petrol but no diesel, which I need. I tried again about six hours later and alas still no luck."" He adds: ""I have still not been able to fill my car at all. I'm almost dry and need to do school trips. I have no idea what to do."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to say fuel deliveries are ""well above normal"" and supplies are ""stabilising"". ""We can all do our bit by filling up only when actually required,""he says,external. Shapps quotes the Petrol Retailers Association figures that we reported earlier - only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. This has fallen from two-thirds of its members saying they were out on Sunday. BBC Radio Shropshire Shropshire Blood Bikes say they've kept their service going partly thanks to the good will of other drivers. Volunteers at the charity courier urgent blood products to NHS hospitals across three counties. Chris Hyde, from the charity, said some experiences on the forecourts have been heart-warming. ""We have had a number of instances where we've approached the queue, and motorists have actually flanked us through to the front of the queue, so we've been able to fill up the fuel and keep the bikes on the road,"" Chris says. Reality Check According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. Read more in our explainer. Lee Sellings, a community care worker in Shaftesbury, Dorset, says if he is not able to find diesel today he will not be able to visit his clients tomorrow. His role includes taking vulnerable people for day outings. ""I think things will get worse before they get better,"" he says. ""When I was recently trying to get fuel, a woman in the queue spent around Â£120 on petrol, saying she need it for the school run. ""In the end, it all comes down to greed."" Reality Check Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is to a large extent served by the same refineries as the rest of the UK. For example, Texaco ships fuel from its refinery in Pembroke to a storage facility at Belfast Harbour. But Northern Ireland has no more access to EU workers such as HGV drivers than other parts of the UK. Read more:How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Jackie Allen says she needs diesel for the school run and spent two hours searching for it without success. She likens the situation to her experience growing up in Zimbabwe in the 1980s when she says she remembers queuing for fuel. She says there is no diesel anywhere in Henley, where she is now, and she has also tried nearby Wallingford and Moulsford as well as every petrol station on the A4 between Reading and Maidenhead. ""A tanker filled up the pumps at the Gulf (garage) on the A4 Bath road
but they still had staff turning people away,"" she says. ""Even the Blood motorbike couldnât get fuel. ""At this rate, they will have to close schools because we
canât fill up our cars."" She says she only fills up once a month and didn't panic buy until she needed diesel and ""now there is nowhere in a 15 mile radius to fill up"". Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980 and was ruled by prime minister Robert Mugabe, who later became executive president before leaving power in 2017. But early gains in the economy were later overshadowed by later economic hardship, inflation and shortages of basic goods later in his rule. Robert Mugabe Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government has a reserve fleet of 80 tankers kept at depots in Cambridgeshire and West Yorkshire for use by industry in emergencies. The number used will change day by day. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acknowledges it won't make a huge difference but ""every little helps"" and are interpreting this as a positive development as it means firms have rejigged driver shifts, cancelled leave etc and so have sufficient drivers to be able to use additional vehicles. The Petrol Retailers Association - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says there are ""early signs"" pressure at the pumps is starting to ease. It says only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. On Tuesday, 37% of the forecourts owned by its members were out of petrol, compared with two-thirds on Sunday. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also says there are signs that the petrol crisis is ""stabilising"". The Ministry of Defence is preparing about 150 qualified military drivers to deliver fuel - and has another 150 personnel ready to support them. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says it will also draw on some of the reserve fleet of 80 tankers which the government keeps for emergencies. Read more in our explainer. We've heard from Nikolas McDonald, from Egham Surrey, who says he paid more than he expected for fuel and was
shocked to see the price per litre had gone up. He says he paid a ""disgusting recently inflated price of Â£1.55.9 per litre"" for super unleaded petrol on Friday. âNormally I would expect to
pay around Â£1.42 or Â£1.43 per litre,"" he says. âI donât mind paying a bit
more but I feel like we are being ripped off and taken advantage of."" Earlier, we reported that the RAC is predicting petrol price rises linked to the cost of oil, with average prices expected to reach 143p per litre for petrol and 145p for diesel in the next few weeks. Brexit is ""largely responsible"" for the ""supply chain fragility"" and the fuel supply problems the UK is experiencing, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. When ask about the fuel crisis during a visit to Dundee, Sturgeon says: ""The end of freedom of movement and the restrictions on immigration are really making it difficult to recruit haulage divers, to recruit people in our agriculture sector and even to recruit people in our health and social care services. ""So it is an extraordinary state of affairs that the UK government is responsible for, but we need to make sure that all of the steps have been taken to get through this period."" She says Covid alone would present ""a real risk of this being the most difficult winter any of us have ever known"", but these additional problems ""makes this extraordinarily difficult"". ""It underlines the foolishness and the recklessness of the UK government pressing ahead with Brexit, in the face of this pandemic."" You can read more on the petrol supply situation in Scotland here. The fuel crisis is easing, says the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents two-thirds of UK filling stations. ""There are encouraging signs that the crisis at the pumps is easing, with forecourts reporting that they are taking further deliveries of fuel,"" executive director Gordon Balmer says. ""Only 27% of PRA members have reported being out of fuel today, and with regular restocks taking place, we are expecting to see the easing continue over the next 24 hours."" But he says the organisation is ""extremely disappointed"" to hear forecourt staff have experienced ""a high level of both verbal and physical abuse"". ""We would urge the public to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" he says. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) isyet to process 56,144 applications,externalfor ""vocational driving licences"" - which includes HGV licences - according to Department for Transport figures. That total, correct as of 22 September, isup from 54,191 on 15 September.,external It was given in response to a written question from Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for Copeland and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the DfT, says the total included applications for provisional licences and for renewals and included ""those applying for entitlement to drive both HGVs and buses"". She says the DVLA is ""prioritising applications for provisional vocational licences so these drivers can take their training quickly"" - noting that they take 10 days to process  - while most people applying to renew a licence could continue driving while their applications were being processed. ""The DVLA continues to explore opportunities to reduce turnaround times for paper applications,"" she says. ""Extra staff have been recruited and the DVLA is seeking extra office space to house more staff to help reduce backlogs and provide future resilience and business continuity."" Clarification 30 September:
The Department for Transport has provided further information which makes clear
that only about 4,000 of the applications in the queue are for provisional HGV
licences and the majority of others are for renewals, and in most cases those
drivers can continue to drive while their application is being processed. BBC Radio CWR Panic buying of fuel has started to ease after several days of supply issues, according to the manager of one independent petrol station in Coventry. Paul Cheema runs a forecourt in Tile Hill and says demand has started to decline and he expects his site not to run out of fuel in the coming days. However, he says staff have kept a limit of Â£15 per driver and refuse to fill petrol cans. ""We have had a couple of kick offs already this morning because we are refusing jerry cans and then you get the foul-mouthed behaviour which is not acceptable,"" he says. A community nurse says she was left heartbroken when an elderly couple who have never spent a day apart weren't able to see each other because the husband couldn't get fuel to visit his wife in hospital. Jane Longhurst, who is 64 and works in Kent, says he called yesterday to say he couldn't come. ""He spoke with his wife on the phone and both were in tears,"" she says. ""This broke my heart."" Jane says she is concerned by what she calls the ""selfish"" attitude of those  panic-buying fuel. ""It has so much of an adverse effect and causes unnecessary anxiety for those that need fuel,"" she says. Her own journey to work takes 45 minutes each way - and she has been trying to find fuel on her days off to ensure she can get to work at the end of the week. ""I travelled locally to five different petrol stations, four had no fuel and at one the queue was exceptionally long,"" she says. ""I have about half a tank - I will be able to get to and from work on Friday but Iâd be mindful that on Saturday, I would get to work but I wouldnât get home."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Coronavirus evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. With the Scottish government already having delayed enforcement of its Covid vaccine passport scheme for nightclubs and large events,the hospitality industry has claimed the public is not ready. UK Hospitality told the BBC that there should have been a public information campaign so that customers would know they had to bring proof of having had two doses of a vaccine. ""It has very much been left to businesses to manage this,"" said Leon Thompson from the trade body. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the scheme - which begins on Monday, with enforcement following from 18 October - had been widely publicised in the media. A rush hour spent with Transport for London's enforcement officers showed howinconsistent policies over mask-wearing are leading to confusion. The BBC saw commuters being politely but firmly told to put on masks, with those not carrying them dispatched to Boots. But one man is angry and confused, caught out by different rules set by national rail services and Transport for London: he doesn't have to wear a mask on the train, so why does he have to on the Tube? TfL says it has refused 223 people entry and asked 53 people to leave since the government ended the legal requirements on masks on 19 July. The London Mayor says the law should be brought back. With the deadline to get vaccinated against Covid having passed on Monday, United Airlines said the vast majority of its 67,000Â staff have complied. But593 who have not applied for a medical or religious exemption face being fired, the company said. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision,"" its bosses said in a memo to employees. But it said the reason for imposing the requirement in August was to ""keep our people safe"". Russia hasthreatened retaliation after two of its German-language YouTube channels were deletedfor breaching Covid misinformation guidelines. The country's media watchdog Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of censorship and demanded the channels be restored. It said it could block the Google-owned video-streaming site within its borders. Russia has previously used powers to block or restrict access to websites to slow down the speed of Twitter. YouTube has also tightened rules on vaccine misinformation, saying it would delete any videos with false claims about vaccines approved by health authorities. First it was toilet rolls, hand sanitiser and pasta, but now Covid-19 has causeda new and unexpected shortage in Northern Ireland: clowns. David Duffy, co-owner of Duffy's Circus, is appealing for locals to put on the traditional red nose and to learn the skills of a clown. With circuses closed for more than 500 days, many performers left Northern Ireland for other places which reopened their big tops more quickly. So what qualities does Mr Duffy say are needed to have them rolling in the aisles? Vulnerability, adaptability and the capacity to think on your feet - even while wearing enormous shoes.

Lava engulfs house that survived La Palma eruption,"The residence had been dubbed a ""miracle house"" for escaping the lava A house that miraculously survived an erupting volcano on La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands for days has now been consumed by lava. The retired Danish couple who owned the house, Inge Bergedorf and Ranier Cocq, told Spanish media on Tuesday it had been swallowed by the flow. ""Everything is destroyed,"" Mr Cocq told the El Mundo newspaper. The property became known as the ""miracle house"" after escaping lava flowing from the Cumbre Vieja volcano. The lava has flattened hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of more than 6,000 people since it started pouring from the volcano on 19 September. On Tuesday nightthe lava reached the Atlantic Ocean, on the west coast of the island, raising fears of explosions and the release of toxic gases. This video can not be played Clouds of steam can be seen as scorching lava enters the Atlantic Ocean Mr Cocq and his wife were not on the island when their house succumbed to the volcano. They live on the Jutland peninsula in Denmark and have not visited La Palma since the Covid-19 pandemic began. ""We have lost everything on our beloved island,""Mr Cocq told El Mundo,external. ""It is very sad. Inge and I are devastated."" 'Miracle house' escapes Canary Islands lava 'You can hear the volcano rumbling in the background' La Palma volcano lava engulfs homes and swimming pools The modest house was built on a 3,000 sq m (32,200 sq ft) plot of land the couple bought decades ago. Had the volcano not erupted, the retired couple said they would have been packing their bags for a getaway in La Palma this autumn. ""We used to go in October and November to collect the grapes that we have in our vineyards. But now there is nothing left,"" Mr Cocq said. One of his daughters, Yenny Cocq, told the BBC the lot her father loved will probably become a wasteland now. ""My mother still looks at old images she finds online and says there is still hope. My father insists [we] rebuild in exactly that location. Although I tell them there won't be a way to get there."" The Cumbre Vieja volcano has been erupting since 19 September A striking image of their home on a small sliver of land, untouched by lava, was seen as a symbol of hope when it spread across the internet last week. The image was taken with a drone by photographer Alfonso Escalero. In an Instagram post, he wrote: ""We will look for another sign that does not make us lose hope in these difficult days."" Many families on the island have lost their homes. On Wednesday the EU's Copernicus service estimated that the lava had destroyed 656 homes on its way to the ocean. The Spanish authorities have declared La Palma a disaster zone, pledging financial support for all those affected by the volcanic activity.

Northern Ireland is to a large extent served by the same refineries as the rest of the UK. For example, Texaco ships fuel from its refinery in Pembroke to a storage facility at Belfast Harbour. But Northern Ireland has no more access to EU workers such as HGV drivers than other parts of the UK. Read more:How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Jackie Allen says she needs diesel for the school run and spent two hours searching for it without success. She likens the situation to her experience growing up in Zimbabwe in the 1980s when she says she remembers queuing for fuel. She says there is no diesel anywhere in Henley, where she is now, and she has also tried nearby Wallingford and Moulsford as well as every petrol station on the A4 between Reading and Maidenhead. ""A tanker filled up the pumps at the Gulf (garage) on the A4 Bath road
but they still had staff turning people away,"" she says. ""Even the Blood motorbike couldnât get fuel. ""At this rate, they will have to close schools because we
canât fill up our cars."" She says she only fills up once a month and didn't panic buy until she needed diesel and ""now there is nowhere in a 15 mile radius to fill up"". Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980 and was ruled by prime minister Robert Mugabe, who later became executive president before leaving power in 2017. But early gains in the economy were later overshadowed by later economic hardship, inflation and shortages of basic goods later in his rule. Robert Mugabe Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government has a reserve fleet of 80 tankers kept at depots in Cambridgeshire and West Yorkshire for use by industry in emergencies. The number used will change day by day. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acknowledges it won't make a huge difference but ""every little helps"" and are interpreting this as a positive development as it means firms have rejigged driver shifts, cancelled leave etc and so have sufficient drivers to be able to use additional vehicles. The Petrol Retailers Association - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says there are ""early signs"" pressure at the pumps is starting to ease. It says only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. On Tuesday, 37% of the forecourts owned by its members were out of petrol, compared with two-thirds on Sunday. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also says there are signs that the petrol crisis is ""stabilising"". The Ministry of Defence is preparing about 150 qualified military drivers to deliver fuel - and has another 150 personnel ready to support them. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says it will also draw on some of the reserve fleet of 80 tankers which the government keeps for emergencies. Read more in our explainer. We've heard from Nikolas McDonald, from Egham Surrey, who says he paid more than he expected for fuel and was
shocked to see the price per litre had gone up. He says he paid a ""disgusting recently inflated price of Â£1.55.9 per litre"" for super unleaded petrol on Friday. âNormally I would expect to
pay around Â£1.42 or Â£1.43 per litre,"" he says. âI donât mind paying a bit
more but I feel like we are being ripped off and taken advantage of."" Earlier, we reported that the RAC is predicting petrol price rises linked to the cost of oil, with average prices expected to reach 143p per litre for petrol and 145p for diesel in the next few weeks. Brexit is ""largely responsible"" for the ""supply chain fragility"" and the fuel supply problems the UK is experiencing, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. When ask about the fuel crisis during a visit to Dundee, Sturgeon says: ""The end of freedom of movement and the restrictions on immigration are really making it difficult to recruit haulage divers, to recruit people in our agriculture sector and even to recruit people in our health and social care services. ""So it is an extraordinary state of affairs that the UK government is responsible for, but we need to make sure that all of the steps have been taken to get through this period."" She says Covid alone would present ""a real risk of this being the most difficult winter any of us have ever known"", but these additional problems ""makes this extraordinarily difficult"". ""It underlines the foolishness and the recklessness of the UK government pressing ahead with Brexit, in the face of this pandemic."" You can read more on the petrol supply situation in Scotland here. The fuel crisis is easing, says the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents two-thirds of UK filling stations. ""There are encouraging signs that the crisis at the pumps is easing, with forecourts reporting that they are taking further deliveries of fuel,"" executive director Gordon Balmer says. ""Only 27% of PRA members have reported being out of fuel today, and with regular restocks taking place, we are expecting to see the easing continue over the next 24 hours."" But he says the organisation is ""extremely disappointed"" to hear forecourt staff have experienced ""a high level of both verbal and physical abuse"". ""We would urge the public to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" he says. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) isyet to process 56,144 applications,externalfor ""vocational driving licences"" - which includes HGV licences - according to Department for Transport figures. That total, correct as of 22 September, isup from 54,191 on 15 September.,external It was given in response to a written question from Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for Copeland and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the DfT, says the total included applications for provisional licences and for renewals and included ""those applying for entitlement to drive both HGVs and buses"". She says the DVLA is ""prioritising applications for provisional vocational licences so these drivers can take their training quickly"" - noting that they take 10 days to process  - while most people applying to renew a licence could continue driving while their applications were being processed. ""The DVLA continues to explore opportunities to reduce turnaround times for paper applications,"" she says. ""Extra staff have been recruited and the DVLA is seeking extra office space to house more staff to help reduce backlogs and provide future resilience and business continuity."" Clarification 30 September:
The Department for Transport has provided further information which makes clear
that only about 4,000 of the applications in the queue are for provisional HGV
licences and the majority of others are for renewals, and in most cases those
drivers can continue to drive while their application is being processed. BBC Radio CWR Panic buying of fuel has started to ease after several days of supply issues, according to the manager of one independent petrol station in Coventry. Paul Cheema runs a forecourt in Tile Hill and says demand has started to decline and he expects his site not to run out of fuel in the coming days. However, he says staff have kept a limit of Â£15 per driver and refuse to fill petrol cans. ""We have had a couple of kick offs already this morning because we are refusing jerry cans and then you get the foul-mouthed behaviour which is not acceptable,"" he says. A community nurse says she was left heartbroken when an elderly couple who have never spent a day apart weren't able to see each other because the husband couldn't get fuel to visit his wife in hospital. Jane Longhurst, who is 64 and works in Kent, says he called yesterday to say he couldn't come. ""He spoke with his wife on the phone and both were in tears,"" she says. ""This broke my heart."" Jane says she is concerned by what she calls the ""selfish"" attitude of those  panic-buying fuel. ""It has so much of an adverse effect and causes unnecessary anxiety for those that need fuel,"" she says. Her own journey to work takes 45 minutes each way - and she has been trying to find fuel on her days off to ensure she can get to work at the end of the week. ""I travelled locally to five different petrol stations, four had no fuel and at one the queue was exceptionally long,"" she says. ""I have about half a tank - I will be able to get to and from work on Friday but Iâd be mindful that on Saturday, I would get to work but I wouldnât get home."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Three more energy firms go bust amid gas price riseEnstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy are the latest to go under, Ofgem announces.","Three more energy suppliers have gone bust amid the surge in wholesale gas prices, the regulator Ofgem has said. Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy said they would stop trading on Wednesday. The trio are the latest companies to go under as soaring gas prices have made price promises by suppliers to customers undeliverable. Together, the suppliers represent less than 1% of the UK market with a total of about 233,000 customers, Ofgem said. Enstroga supplies gas and electricity to about 6,000 domestic customers, while Igloo has about 179,000. Symbio Energy has roughly 48,000 in the UK and a small number overseas. The three energy supplies follow six others which have collapsed in recent weeks. A total of nearly 1.73m customers have been affected in September. Ofgem said customers of Enstroga, Igloo and Symbio would continue to receive energy supplies and any credit to their accounts would be protected. Affected customers will be switched to a new tariff by Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier, the regulator said. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. No chance lights will go out, says government Energy regulator says gas crisis not its fault Former US vice-president buys stake in energy firm Ofgem added that consumers will also be protected by the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas, once switched to a new tariff. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said: ""Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers. ""I want to reassure customers of Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy that they do not need to worry. ""Ofgem will choose a new supplier for you and while we are doing this our advice is to wait until we appoint a new supplier and do not switch in the meantime. You can rely on your energy supply as normal."" On Monday, Ofgem announced Shell Energy had been appointed as the new supplier for 255,000 gas and electricity customers of Green, which collapsed last week. Green ceased trading on the same day as another supplier, Avro, whose 580,000 customers have been moved to Octopus Energy. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, previously told the BBC the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up,"" he said. Mr Brearley has rejected claims from the industry the current crisis represents a failure to adequately regulate the market. The government has said it is looking at issuing loans to bigger energy firms to help them take on stranded customers. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and added he does ""not expect supply emergencies"". Consumers' attention may have been drawn to the queues for petrol this week, but this news is evidence the gas crisis is far from over. It is a crisis that many more suppliers are not expected to survive. The pressure on them is increasing as wholesale gas prices are continuing to go up. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of customers of these three collapsed companies will now wait to be moved automatically onto new, dedicated - but undoubtedly more expensive - tariffs. Millions more face price rises on Friday, when Ofgem's higher price cap for variable tariffs kicks in. As more and more suppliers fold, the cost of dealing with their customers will mean further price rises for everyone in the future are inevitable.

Brewery hit for third time over beer packaging,"Packaging on six Tiny Rebel beers have fallen foul of industry rules A Welsh brewery has been taken to task for a third time by industry regulators for the packaging of some of its beer. Tiny Rebel Brewing was found to have breached rules including appealing to underage drinkers, sexual references and causing offence. The Newport brewery also fell foul of the Portman Group's rules on marketing drinks as clearly alcoholic. Tiny Rebel has withdrawn four beers from sale and said it was working closely with the regulator. The Portman Group said it received complaints from the Metropolitan Police, Alcohol Focus Scotland and a member of the public, leading it to review eight beers. They were: Bump 'n' Grind, Cherry Bomb, Clwb Tropicana cans and four-can packaging, Double 99, No Capes, Original Nuttah and Cali Pale. It upheld complaints,externalfor six of the beers. Goddess image on beer label angers activists Ancient Egypts brewery secret uncovered Brains beer 'may be brewed outside Wales' In the case of Original Nuttah, the panel ruled the name - along with imagery on the the can - was ""likely to be taken as a derogatory reference to mental illness and was likely to cause serious offence"". Bump 'n' Grind had a ""direct association with sexual activity"", while Cherry Bomb was said to have displayed elements associated with soft drinks, rather than alcoholic ones. No Capes and the four-pack for Clwb Tropicana were ruled to breach codes of practice on not appealing to under-18s. Double 99 also breached the same rule and the panel also ruled it ""encouraged immoderate consumption"" of alcohol. The panel dismissed two complaints, against Clwb Tropicana IPA single-can packaging and Cali Pale Ale. The brewery has its headquarters in Newport, and will celebrate its 10th birthday next year Panel chairwoman Nicola Williams said: ""Tiny Rebel's product range has had problems across a range of areas, but in particular with designs that have a particular appeal to under-18s, although this has not been its intention. ""It is essential that alcoholic products are aimed squarely at adults and clearly communicate their alcoholic nature. ""Equally importantly is the need to avoid widespread offence, particularly around mental health."" The brewer said it had voluntarily stopped making Bump 'n' Grind, Cherry Bomb, No Capes and Original Nuttah, while working to resolve packaging issues with the other two beers. Founded in 2012 by Brad Cummings and Gazz Williams, the company went from making homebrew in a Newport garage to establishing a headquarters in the city, along with bars in Cardiff and Newport. Its first beer Cwtch was named champion beer of Britain in 2015, but also had two complaints against it upheld by the regulator in 2017 and 2019. It was ordered to redesign its cans on both occassions, including being told to remove its trademark teddy bear logo. Responding to the latest ruling, an official for the brewery said: ""At Tiny Rebel we take all consumer complaints very seriously, as well as our wider social responsibility. ""We'll continue to work closely with the Portman Group and are committed to following their guidance.""

Starmer sets out 'serious plan' for government,"This video can not be played Starmer's party conference message to PM: ""Get a grip or get out of the way"" Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a ""serious plan for government"", in a speech to his party conference. He said the country faced a ""big moment"" that ""demands leadership"" - and as prime minister he would provide it. Sir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values. He got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers. Sir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"", to cheers from other delegates. Keir Starmer's Labour conference speech fact-checked Five things we learned from Labour conference Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour members back Â£15 minimum wage amid row After a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic. ""These are big issues, but our politics is so small,"" he told delegates. ""So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge."" The 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid. Addressing a packed auditorium, he said he would ""not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today"" and called Labour a party of ""patriots"". He spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. Sir Keir described his parents as ""the two rocks of my life"", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a ""deep respect for the dignity of work"". He contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a ""trickster"", a ""trivial man"" and a ""showman with nothing left to show"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is heckled as he delivers his speech With Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn. While he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: ""We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government. ""It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust."" By contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times. ""You want levelling up?,"" he asked. ""That's levelling up."" At the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: ""I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me."" Sir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. In an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. Persistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. There were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. The speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again. It was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street. Moving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum ""Band-C"" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others. The changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households Â£400 a year in bills on average, he promised. Other pledges in the speech included: Providing mental treatment within a month for all people in England who require it Creating 8,500 more specialist mental health staff, providing an extra million people a year with help Training ""thousands"" of extra teachers in England - his aides did not provide a more specific figure Reforming the inspection body Ofsted to focus more on improving struggling schools ""I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,"" Sir Keir said. ""So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election."" Sir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised. On Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour. The next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership. And delegatesvoted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry,despite Sir Keir ruling this out. The leader also angered the left when he pushed throughchanges to the way Labour elects its leaders. Reacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had ""identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions"". ""We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,"" it added. The trade union Unite said there ""wasn't much"" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights. But Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated ""vision"" and shown the party ""could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government"", adding: ""This is a serious plan for change"". Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan. ""Labour spent five days talking to themselves about themselves instead of to the country.""

Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest,"Four members of Ms Everard's family were in court to hear the pleas Sarah Everard was handcuffed by her murderer as he pretended to arrest her for breaching Covid guidelines. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining Ms Everard, 33, putting her in his hire car and driving away. His sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey was told that her ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The 48-year-old had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Ms Everard was handcuffed at 21:34 GMT and four minutes later she was being driven to Dover, where Couzens transferred her to his own car. Couzens then drove to a remote rural area he knew well, where he raped Ms Everard. The sexual predator had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prosecutor Tom Little QC said Couzens must have taken Ms Everard's mobile phone from her and removed the sim card, which he tried to destroy. Ms Everard was described by a former long-term boyfriend as ""extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise"" and ""not a gullible person"", the court heard. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? He could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know ""unless by force or manipulation"", Mr Little said. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car, but they ""assumed Ms Everard must have done something wrong"", the court was told. Couzens owned a patch of land in Hoads Wood, where he burned Ms Everard's body One of the witnesses described a woman on the pavement who appeared to have her left arm behind her back and ""was in the process of giving her other arm behind her back"" as a man in dark clothing handcuffed her. Mr Little said they believed they were witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman. The exact time Ms Everard was killed could not be determined, although she was dead - strangled with Couzens' police belt - by about 02:30 on 4 March, when he stopped for snacks at a service station. He then visited Hoads Wood near Ashford, Kent, leaving just before sunrise. Later that morning, he threw Ms Everard's mobile phone into a channel at Sandwich, where it was found by a police diver. Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey wearing a dark suit Wayne Couzens shuffled into court his head bowed. Wearing a dark blue suit he confirmed his name. Sarah's parents, and other family members, are in court listening to horrendous details about their daughter's kidnap, rape and murder. In the public gallery many of her friends have also come to court to support them. Three members of her family will read out statements this afternoon about how her murder has affected them. The prosecutor said her murder was reported on social media as #shewasonlywalkinghome but the more appropriate five words to describe what Couzens did were ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation and fire"". A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. Mr Little said: ""The defendant's plot of land is very close to, and in the same woods, where he was to burn Sarah Everard's body after he had murdered her. ""He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task to a pond deeper into the woods, but which was only about 130 metres from his plot."" The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer wiped his phone just minutes before he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, on 9 March. Couzens, who pleaded guilty in July to Ms Everard's murder, will be sentenced at the end of the two-day hearing. Lord Justice Fulford will consider whether to hand down a whole-life term. A tent was set up as police searched woodland near Great Chart, Kent The case prompted national outrage and sparked protests about violence against women, particularly as walking was one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country shared stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled and assaulted; and a number of vigils were held in honour of Ms Everard and to raise concerns about the safety of women. A vigil held on Clapham Commonled to the Met Police being accused of heavy-handedness for its tactics. Ahead of the Couzens sentencing hearing, the Met Police issued a statement that said: ""We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for. ""Our thoughts are with Sarah's family and her many friends. It is not possible for us to imagine what they are going through."" Couzens wassacked by the forcein July.

Couzens 'treated my daughter like nothing',"Sarah Everard's mother Susan said she had kept her daughter's dressing gown because of its familiar smell The mother of Sarah Everard has told a court she is ""tormented"" at the thought of what her daughter endured. The 33-year-old marketing executive was abducted by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as he falsely arrested her for breaching Covid guidelines. Couzens drove for several hours before raping and strangling her, and setting fire to her body. Ms Everard's mother Susan told the Old Bailey she had kept her daughter's dressing gown as it smelled like her. The sentencing hearing, which has been adjourned until Thursday, earlier heard how, on 3 March this year, Couzens used his police warrant cardto trick Ms Everard into being handcuffed and getting in his hire car. She had been walking from a friend's house in Clapham to her own home in Brixton at about 21:00 GMT. CCTV was shown to the courtwhich captured the moments leading up to Ms Everard being put in Couzens' car. Two witnesses saw him handcuff her but believed he was acting legitimately as a police officer. Reading a victim impact statement in court, Mrs Everard said: ""She spent the last hours on this Earth with the very worst of humanity. ""Sarah died in horrendous circumstances. I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger. ""Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. Jeremy Everard asked for this photograph of his daughter to be shown at the Old Bailey as he read his victim impact statement ""Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled. ""I yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her: she was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautiful dancer. She was a wonderful daughter."" In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Everard's father Jeremy asked for a photograph of his daughter to be shown to the courtroom as he read his impact statement. He first, though, told Couzens to look at him, saying: ""No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us."" Prof Everard told the killer ""there can be no redemption"" for what he had done. ""All my family want is Sarah back with us. We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life. ""The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day."" This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Couzens' two-day sentencing hearing has been told that Ms Everard's ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". He had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. Mrs Everard said: ""In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: 'Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run.'"" Prof Jeremy Everard addressed the courtroom after telling Couzens to look at him The family of Sarah Everard were dignified as they described losing a daughter, a sister and even future generations of children. Ms Everard's sister Katie, mother Susan and father Jeremy all read out victim impact statements. Ms Everard's father and sister both directly addressed Couzens - who had his head bowed - demanding he look at them as they spoke. Jeremy Everard told him: ""I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from usâ¦ she was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. ""You burnt our daughter's body - you further tortured us - so that we could not see her again. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sisters, family and friends."" Katie Everard asked Couzens: ""What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? ""When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night?"" A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. The Metropolitan Police hasreleased footage from an interview with Couzensin his home on 9 March where he claimed not to know Ms Everard after being shown her picture. Ms Everard's sister Katie described packing up her younger sister's ""whole life"" when collecting her possessions from the Brixton flat she never returned to: ""Washing was left hanging and packages were waiting to be opened when she got home. ""But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. ""My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. ""I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing. ""All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaid, meeting her babies and being an aunty, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. ""You took her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. ""Her future no longer exists."" Couzens, who could be given a whole-life term, has admitted kidnap, murder and rape. He will be sentenced on Thursday. New footage released in Sarah Everard case.

Children as young as 11 pressured for nudes,"This video can not be played Schoolchildren as young as 11 are sending and receiving nude photos, pupils say Allegations of sexual assault among classmates are being investigated by police after more than 90 schools in Wales were named in an online campaign. The Everyone's Invited website was set up to help pupils anonymously report abuse and harassment by classmates. Some told BBC Wales it was common for girls as young as 11 to be pressured into sending nudes, or receive unwanted explicit images from boys. The Welsh government said the safety of children was a priority. North Wales Police said it was investigating two cases linked to testimony on the website, while Dyfed Powys and South Wales Police forces did not provide figures. Gwent Police said it had not opened any cases. Teens told BBC Wales it was not uncommon to be pressured for nudes or receive unsolicited explicit pictures School inspectors for the education watchdog Estyn are due to begin entering classrooms to investigate ""peer-on-peer sexual harassment"". A similar review in England last term found sexual harassment had become""normalised"" among school children. 'Rape culture' warning as 8,000 report school abuse 'I still feel unsafe, something needs to change' Website exposes 'rape culture' at schools Neil Foden is head teacher at Ysgol Friars in Bangor, Gwynedd, which is one of the Welsh schools listed on the Everyone's Invited website. He said head teachers were ""deluding themselves"" if they did not think sexual harassment was a problem. Head teacher Neil Foden says the allegations would ""horrify"" people, but they are familiar to most teachers ""There is, I think, a culture among some pupils here, as there will be in most other schools, where the borderline between what's just a joke, and what is sexually inappropriate and causes distress, is not well enough understood,"" he said. Mr Foden said serious misconduct was rare, but his school's policy, alongside working with police, was to exclude those responsible. ""I have on one occasion permanently excluded a pupil,"" he said. ""Any school should have been looking at their procedures well before this website came into existence. Something it has made us do, is to look again at our procedures."" He said some of the stories posted on the Everyone's Invited website, which may have ""horrified"" many people, would feel familiar to most teachers. PC Dylan Pritchard, who works as a schools community officer for North Wales Police, said social media and the proliferation of indecent images had become one of the biggest issues. ""It is getting worse I believe,"" he said. ""However, that may be down to knowing more about it and the fact that we are empowering young people to speak up. ""Inappropriate photos are often shared. In some cases, in some schools within Wales, we've had incidents where those images [of girls] have been shared widely across the school - and possibly across other parts of the internet."" Figures obtained by the NSPCC show there were more than 300 offences involving sexual communications with children - which can include asking children to send explicit images - in Wales between April 2020 and March 2021. Myfanwy Kirkwood from North Wales Police said the testimonies of the girls in Wales is ""awful"" North Wales Police said it was working with schools and young people to help potential victims and ""break down barriers"". ""In the future, we would all like it that there doesn't have to be an anonymous website for people to come forward,"" said Det Ch Insp Myfanwy Kirkwood. She said it had been ""awful"" to see the volume of testimonies posted by girls in Wales, many of whom had never spoken to officers. Welsh review to be held into harassment in schools Jump in reports of under-18s sexually abusing peers Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - Ofsted ""We absolutely understand that this is such a difficult and complex area,"" she said. ""Perhaps it's family dynamics that people don't want to report, or they've had a bad experience with the police before, or perhaps they've had a bad experience within an educational setting. ""Looking forwards, there's lots of work to do to break down those barriers and to get to a point where we don't have to have an anonymised reporting system."" Ms Kirkwood said writing an account on Everyone's Invited could be the first step, with officers ready to help and listen when girls were ready. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Any form of sexual harassment is completely unacceptable and should not be tolerated. ""It remains a priority across the Welsh government that every child and young person is supported, and that they feel able to report any concerns they may have. ""This summer, the minister for education and Welsh language asked Estyn to review the culture and processes at secondary schools, to protect and support young people. The report is due to be published in December."" Education Minister Jeremy Miles said he had written to every school in Wales to ""look for assurance that they have systems in place to support pupils in this situation"". He added that the Welsh government planned to act immediately on any recommendations from Estyn.

From prison: 'I sold drugs as a dirty cop'A cop who became a robber speaks from prison,"For the past four years, Jessica Lussenhop has been reporting on the rise and fall of a corrupt squad of Baltimore police officers. Just as she was completing her podcast series on the story, she got a very unexpected call from prison. I'm standing in my pandemic ""radio studio"" - aka the closet in my apartment - surrounded by hangers holding button-up shirts and dresses. I'm staring at my cell phone in the dark. It's propped up on top of a suitcase sitting on top of a plastic tub, and I'm holding my recorder and microphone at the ready. When the phone rings, I put the call on speaker and hear a robotic, pre-recorded female voice: ""You have a prepaid call. You will not be charged for this call. This call is from…"" A human voice breaks in: ""Wayne Jenkins."" ""...an inmate in a federal prison,"" the robot finishes. Former Baltimore Police Department Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, currently inmate number 62928-037 at a federal prison in Kentucky, is on the line. Until this point, I'd only heard Jenkins on secretly taped FBI recordings, wiretapped phone calls, body camera footage and at the hearing in June 2018 when a federal judge sentenced him to 25 years in prison. It was surreal hearing his voice, talking to me. I've been reporting on Jenkins, and the elite Gun Trace Task Force squad he once led, for nearly four years. He and six members of that unit now sit in federal prison for crimes including conspiracy, racketeering and robbery, all committed under the guise of legitimate police work. They stole drugs and cash, sold seized narcotics and guns back on the street, planted evidence on people, even committed home invasions. In 2018, Jessica wrote a piece which detailed the explosive trial at a Baltimore federal courthouse that revealed the unit's crimes She then turned that story into a new seven-part podcast series called Bad Cops which you can listen to in its entirety below Over the years, I wrote to all of these former officers in prison several times, asking them to help me understand their breathtaking crimes. My hope - maybe a naive one - was that hearing one of these men speak candidly about how he crossed over to the dark side would help the public better understand the casual, day-to-day corruption that can happen in policing. I hoped it could spur a more honest discussion about what it's going to take to reform or even redefine what it means to be a cop in the US. Of all seven men, the last person I thought would ever agree to an interview was Jenkins, the fallen ""golden boy"" of the Baltimore Police Department. As the leader of the unit, he received the longest prison sentence and the federal authorities who prosecuted the squad viewed him as its most culpable member. In the years since his arrest, he'd never given a public interview. And yet, here we are, me in my closet ""studio"" and him at the front of a line of 20 to 30 other inmates, all waiting for their turn on the prison phone. I have no idea what he wants to say, or why after four years, he's breaking his silence. ""Everything I tell you, I will take a polygraph,"" Jenkins says near the beginning of that first phone call. ""I'm in prison for 25 years, there's no reason to lie."" On 1 March, 2017, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins and six of his subordinate officers from the Gun Trace Task Force walked into the Baltimore Police Department's Internal Affairs building, believing they were there to clear up a minor complaint about a damaged vehicle. Prior to this, they'd been lauded as some of the best gun cops in the city - seizing dozens of illegal firearms every month, and demonstrating a ""a work ethic that is beyond reproach"", in the words of one supervisor. Jenkins was a rising star in the department, because of his ability to regularly bring in huge seizures of drugs and guns. But when the officers exited the elevators on the building's second floor, they were met by an FBI SWAT team. All seven members were soon in handcuffs. It turned out that federal agents had the unit under surveillance for months. Using wiretaps and hidden recording devices, they had accumulated a wealth of evidence showing the officers were robbing citizens, filing for hundreds of hours of overtime they never worked, stealing drugs and even selling illegal firearms back on the streets. Five of the former officers, including Jenkins, pleaded guilty. But two pronounced their innocence and went to trial, which I covered for the BBC. It was there that the full extent of the officers' misconduct became public. In January 2018, a long list of victims took the stand - many of whom had ties to the drug trade - and told harrowing stories of how they were robbed by the officers during car stops and searches of their homes. Some tried to complain, but were ignored. Shawn Whiting, a man whose house was robbed of $16,000 and a kilo-and-a-half of heroin, testified that he knew that as a drug dealer, his word counted for much less than the officers'. ""I ain't have a trial because the simple fact is I knew [the court] would believe them over top of me,"" he told the jury. Several of the former officers also took the stand - now wearing prison jumpsuits instead of uniforms - and detailed the tactics encouraged by their leader, Jenkins. They testified he told them to carry BB guns to plant if they ever injured or killed an unarmed person, that he often took large quantities of drugs off of suspects without submitting them to the police evidence room. Two officers said he spoke openly about doing home invasions on high-level drug dealers that he called ""monsters"", because of the amount of drugs and cash he hoped they'd have stashed in their houses. One of the most surprising witnesses was a man named Donald Stepp, a bail bondsman, who revealed that he'd been selling drugs Jenkins brought him from work. He said together, they'd sold about $1m worth of narcotics. ""It was a front for a criminal enterprise,"" Stepp said of the Gun Trace Task Force. ""It was obvious to me, when I'm taking millions of dollars worth of drugs from the Baltimore Police Department and selling them, that… this is not a normal police department."" Stepp testified that the arrangement was so lucrative, he stuck with it for years before getting arrested himself in December 2017. ""I'm here because of greed,"" he said. ""It's that simple."" Jenkins did not testify at the trial, but in a way, he was the star of the entire proceeding. After three weeks of astonishing testimony, the jury found the two remaining officers guilty. All seven now sit in federal prisons scattered across the country. The longest sentence was handed down to Jenkins: 25 years. He's due to be released in 2038. After he was sent to federal lock-up, I wrote Jenkins a letter once a year - along with many other journalists, book authors, producers and documentary filmmakers - requesting an interview. I never heard back, and he didn't seem to be responding to anyone else, either. I assumed he never would. This past summer, as I was wrapping up work on ""Bad Cops"", a strange email appeared in my inbox. The message read: ""Greetings. I am Agent and Representative as to Mr Jenkins. Contact me."" A strange back and forth with a man who used to be Jenkins' cell mate ultimately ended up with me in my closet waiting for that call. In the gloom I see the number of the bureau of prisons light up my cell phone screen. ""Hi, ma'am,"" Jenkins says when I pick up. ""This is Wayne."" In federal prison, inmates are only allowed to talk on the phone for 15 minutes before the line is automatically cut. I have so many questions to ask, and I'm not sure if this will be my one and only opportunity to speak to him. ""Especially because we're short on time, is there anything that you kind of want to just say right off the bat?"" I ask. ""Right off the bat, we wasn't living lavishly. I lived modest, we wasn't enriching ourselves,"" he answers. ""I never had [theft complaints] because I never took money off individuals. I did give drugs to Donny for the last couple of years I was police, but I didn't take people's money because then they would know you were dirty. So I kind of had a mental, like maybe a messed up moral code."" Right away I learn that Jenkins is an incredibly fast talker. I have to try to untangle his answers as he moves from subject to subject, sometimes so fast I can't keep up. The first 15 minutes are over in a flash. The line goes dead, and I feel like I've barely gotten anywhere. But then, about an hour later, the phone rings again. Jenkins tells me he traded some sausages with other inmates in the line, bartering his way to the front. Over the course of four phone calls (courtesy of some traded bags of crisps), Jenkins paints a picture of the Baltimore Police Department as a place where indoctrination into corruption starts almost immediately. He tells me that the first time he ever stole money, he was just a rookie. It took place as Jenkins and other officers were searching an apartment. In the bedroom, Jenkins says he and a veteran supervisor found a suitcase filled with tens of thousands of dollars in cash. Jenkins says that the veteran goaded him into taking money. ""He's like, 'I'm not telling you to do anything, I'm just saying it sure would be nice if we had $10,000 apiece to go up to Atlantic City,'"" Jenkins recalls. ""And I remember taking the $10,000."" A lot of what he told me was much more systematic. He claims that he was told early on to lie on police reports and warrant applications in order to make their arrests sound like they were done with proper probable cause, meaning a legal reason to stop someone. In reality, he says, they were making arrests by any means necessary. ""This is a saying we state: 'Don't let probable cause stand in the way of a good arrest,'"" Jenkins says. ""If you've got to lie about what you've seen or what you heard or what you witnessed, as long as he's dirty, he's got the drugs and he's got the guns and he did the crime - just get him."" He told me that frequently, when he or his fellow officers didn't feel like submitting the drugs they seized or doing arrest paperwork, they'd simply confiscate people's drug stashes and let them go. Later on, he claims, they'd throw the drugs out the window or down a sewer grate. ""Pills of heroin, bags of marijuana,"" he says. ""Seen it done, honest to god, 500 times."" Jenkins names two specific locations where he says the drugs get tossed: a train bridge near the Eastern District police station, and a wooded highway off-ramp on the way to the Northern District police station. Weeks later, I search these locations myself to see if I can find anything. On the off-ramp, I find four empty dime bags scattered along a section of sidewalk with no foot traffic. But nothing more. Jenkins also tells me that any time an officer's misconduct gets picked up by Internal Affairs or by an outside law enforcement agency, it was routine for the involved officers to meet up, to tailor their stories to avoid punishment. ""Immediately, we get together and you go over your story. 'You say this, you say that, right?' You're taught that - the second someone gets in trouble we meet up, and we talk face to face,"" he says. As Jenkins is telling me this, he is naming names. He names the veteran he says coached him into stealing for the first time. He also names two former supervisors who he says he complained to about his former subordinate officers, Momodu Gondo and Jemell Rayam, saying they had bad reputations for stealing money. He says he was told that because these officers were so successful at seizing guns, there was nothing to be done. The BBC is not naming these three former supervisors, since none of them has been charged with a crime in connection with this case. But I did call them, and the Baltimore Police Department, to see if anyone would respond to this laundry list of allegations. One former supervisor never responded. The second declined to comment. The spouse of the third left a message telling me I could take what Jenkins told me and ""stuff it"". I never heard back from the Baltimore Police Department. The conversation with Jenkins gets more complicated when we turn specifically to the crimes of the Gun Trace Task Force. Jenkins signed a plea agreement in 2017 that detailed seven robberies that he participated in along with other members of the unit, as well as his drug dealing partnership with Donald Stepp, the former bail bondsman and cocaine dealer who testified at trial. Jenkins admitted that he stole drugs from work and delivered them to Stepp, who would turn around and sell them. The pair also stole valuables, like high-end wrist watches, in break-ins. But Jenkins wanted to argue the details in his plea agreement, saying many of them weren't true. A plea agreement is a document that lists specific criminal acts that the defendant is agreeing to plead guilty to. Jenkins had to affirm under oath in front of a federal judge that what the document said was true. It was difficult for me to understand and parse all of Jenkins' denials, now. For example, I asked him about the robbery of a man who lived in a large mansion in the suburbs of Baltimore - a robbery he pled guilty to in his plea agreement. ""There was cameras everywhere, so I would never have took a dollar,"" he tells me. ""Later on that evening, Gondo did give me money, that means hours later, I'm talking hours later, he gave me money."" ""So you did take money, ultimately?"" I ask, slightly confused. ""I did, yes. Yes, I did,"" he says. He also acknowledged stealing the man's $4,000 (£2,956) watch, which he gave to Stepp to sell. In another man's house, the GTTF broke into a safe and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars. In our conversation, Jenkins says that that's not true - members of the squad did steal money that day, but from somewhere else in the house. It feels a little bit like splitting hairs. When I point out he already pleaded guilty to all these incidents, Jenkins tells me he only signed the agreement because he feared that if he went forward to trial, he could've wound up behind bars for life. He says he couldn't risk it as a father with a young family. ""Life in prison with three small children. Now I deserve 10 to 15 years... I sold drugs as a dirty cop,"" he says. ""I got 25 years. I got gangster charges, racketeering charges, things they usually give the mob, who were burying bodies in cement."" I also point out to him that it's a fairly common practice for prosecutors to level charges that are so serious that the defendant feels they have no choice but to plead guilty. In fact, it's highly likely - if not certain - that many of the people Jenkins' put in prison himself had those tactics used on them by prosecutors. ""Obviously I'm in here now, so I see both sides. If I could take everything back in my life, I would have been a prosecutor,"" he says. ""I'd rather be a prosecutor so I don't overkill people. You never know until you get on this side, including me, what you do to families."" One of the most shocking incidents from the plea agreement is an event that Jenkins now unequivocally denies. In the spring of 2015, the city of Baltimore was rocked by civil unrest after the in-custody death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray. At one point, dozens of pharmacies were looted and millions of dollars worth of medication went missing. In Jenkins' plea, it says that ""in April 2015 following the riots after the death of Freddie Gray, Jenkins brought DS prescription medicines that he had stolen from someone looting a pharmacy so that DS could sell the medications"". ""DS"" stands for Donald Stepp. ""I never took a thing. I was a hero,"" Jenkins says of his activity during the unrest. ""I never took nothing from a looter, so help me god. Donny made every piece of that up."" Donald Stepp was released from federal prison back in January of this year. He served 20 months of a five year sentence in connection with the Gun Trace Task Force case, before being granted a compassionate release. Stepp was on home confinement for six months with an ankle monitor until this summer. Today, he's a free man, living without restrictions with his spouse and young daughter in the eastern part of Baltimore County. He's doing, as he likes to say, ""rather swell"". But when I tell him that I've interviewed Wayne Jenkins, his one-time drug partner, Stepp is displeased, to put it mildly. There is no love lost between these two former friends. ""He's never been a true friend,"" Stepp says. ""I have no respect for him."" Stepp and Jenkins' history runs deep. They'd known one another's families as children. As adults, they ran into each other again at an underground card game frequented by Baltimore Police officers. It was during these games that Stepp heard Jenkins boasting about the large drug stashes he often came across during his work as a plainclothes police officer. At the time, Stepp was running his own bail bond company, Double D Bail Bonds. But he says he was also struggling with a gambling addiction and dealing large amounts of cocaine. That made it very tempting when, sometime around 2011, Jenkins approached Stepp and suggested they go into business together. Jenkins would stop bringing those big drug seizures to the evidence room, and instead give them to Stepp to sell. ""I felt comfortable with it because all the police officers that I met, which were many during the card games, in my opinion, they owned the city,"" Stepp would later tell the jury at the GTTF trial. ""I thought it was a winner."" Stepp says Jenkins started bringing over shipments of drugs on an almost daily basis, putting them in a locked shed behind Stepp's house. The drop-offs included marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, all of which Stepp did his best to sell. Jenkins started calling Stepp to the scenes of arrests, encouraging Stepp to try to get inside drug dealer's hideouts to steal whatever cash or narcotics he could find. They tracked other dealers and broke into their houses when no one was home. This partnership lasted for five years. In December 2017, eight months after Jenkins was arrested, the FBI and Baltimore County officers broke down Stepp's door and arrested him in his kitchen. It didn't take long before Stepp began to suspect that Jenkins ratted him out. But Stepp had an ace up his sleeve - for months, he'd been documenting their crimes on his cell phone. He took pictures of himself and Jenkins together inside the police department, where Stepp would sometimes pick up drugs. When Jenkins called him to a house the GTTF was investigating, Stepp took pictures of the officers going in and out. Later, Jenkins came out carrying two kilos of cocaine he tossed in Stepp's vehicle. Stepp turned everything over to the US prosecutors. In part due to his cooperation in the case, he received a much shorter sentence than the officers of the GTTF. ""He drew first blood,"" Stepp says of Jenkins. ""Now we're going to burn it down. And that's what I did."" Not long after Stepp flipped on his former friend, Jenkins pled guilty. In my conversation with Jenkins, he spent a lot of time disputing Stepp's account of their partnership. He claims that it was Stepp's idea to start selling drugs together, not the other way around. He says Stepp pressured him into it. He also says that he only made roughly $75,000 off of the narcotic sales, as opposed to the figure put on it by Stepp. He calls Stepp ""the biggest exaggerator I've ever met in my life"". When I tell this to Stepp, he's angry. He states flatly that Jenkins is lying to me. He points to the plea agreement, in which Jenkins agreed that his cut of their drug sales came to roughly $250,000. He reminds me that the US Attorney's office found him more credible than Jenkins. ""He's a pathological liar,"" Stepp says. ""I fear nothing he knows or anything. Because believe me, I'll stand my ground in a second."" Stepp's moving on with his life - in a sense. In March, HBO announced a new miniseries by David Simon, the creator of the classic Baltimore true crime series, 'The Wire'. Simon's new project will tell a fictionalised version of the Gun Trace Task Force saga, and began filming on the streets of Baltimore over the summer. Wayne Jenkins will be played by Jon Bernthal, the same actor who portrayed ""The Punisher"". HBO asked Stepp to be a consultant on the project, which he enthusiastically agreed to do. His fee will be donated to the victims of the Gun Trace Task Force. Meanwhile, his Twitter account is full of pictures of him on set, hamming it up with Bernthal and some of the other actors. He's opening a consulting service called Stepp Right Consultants, to give guidance and insight to men and women who are about to enter the federal penal system. He's also at work on a memoir, which he says will reveal the contents of videos and photos he took of Jenkins that were never released publicly. He's even got a clothing line coming out around his defunct bail bond business, Double D Bail Bonds. While he may not be ready to let go of his animus towards Jenkins, Stepp's strange journey seems - at least for now - to be heading towards a happy ending. ""It's a surreal story. But it's the big man upstairs,"" he says. ""I'm grateful, very grateful."" I asked Wayne Jenkins several times why he wanted to do the interview with me. He gave me a few reasons. One was that he felt he'd been railroaded into his plea agreement by the US prosecutors (the Maryland US Attorney's Office declined to comment). Another was to talk about how futile life inside the penal system is. ""I swear, I wish I would have known before I ever put anyone in here… I wish I would have known the other side,"" he says at one point. ""It's nothing I've ever imagined. It's no wonder people come out meaner than when they come in."" And of course, Jenkins is also hoping for a sentenced reduction of some kind. But I think he also spoke to me because he doesn't like the image of himself that's been in the media - as a sociopath, as someone almost inhumanly evil. Back before our interview, Jenkins' representative wanted me to speak to some of his old high school friends. They wanted to tell me that Jenkins was a dedicated father, a good football coach. A loyal friend. They told me they were disturbed that he was being portrayed as a ""monster"". It wasn't the first time I've heard that word to describe Jenkins. While no one should forget for an instant that Jenkins and his officers caused untold harm to Baltimore citizens, I don't find it helpful to try to write him off as a ""monster"". The idea that the Gun Trace Task Force went rogue simply because their sergeant was uniquely evil ignores all the systemic ways in which he was encouraged to operate the way he did, and the larger policing culture that supported him (it should also be noted that several of the squad's members started stealing money long before they joined the GTTF). To single him out as a flawed individual in an otherwise perfectly functioning system is a way to avoid change in the police department, to shirk the responsibility of actually preventing this from happening again. It's going to take an almost unimaginable kind of effort to dig out the roots of corruption in the department, and it's much easier to just lock up the cops who get caught, and carry on with business as usual. Yet another of Jenkins' friends said something I wasn't expecting. He acknowledged that he could tell something was off with Jenkins around the time of the GTTF crime spree. ""We're not stupid. We knew he wasn't the straight-and-narrow cop that all cops are supposed to be,"" he said. ""He always had large sums of money in his pocket. Used to tell me he won it playing poker."" I ask this friend why he didn't say anything to anyone. He says something that I've never heard anyone admit out loud. ""We said, 'You know, he's robbin' the pieces of shit of Baltimore that are the reason that me and my kids can't walk down the street and feel safe,"" he says. This kind of mindset assumes that the victims of the Gun Trace Task Force - many of them black and poor - deserved what happened to them. It's a depressing fact that this is a viewpoint likely shared by many in Baltimore, and is a part of the reason why the GTTF got away with what they did for so long. The GTTF did not hold a monopoly on harm, of course. Baltimore can be a complicated and dangerous place, and the men and women the officers targeted and abused may have caused harm and abuse themselves. Some of the most upsetting conversations I had were with people who felt victimised twice -- by both the officers and by the criminals. The important difference, however, is that the drug dealers never swore an oath to serve and protect. They weren't being paid by the taxpayers to keep the city safe, and weren't operating with all the power and protections that police have. I couldn't help thinking about the many victims of the squad that I'd met over the three years I've been working on this story. My thoughts return to Kenneth Bumgardner, a hard-working father who was chased by the squad when they suspected him of having marijuana. He woke up on a frigid city street with his jaw shattered, and couldn't eat solid food for months. ""I'm finally trying to get my life back on track,"" he told me. ""It's still hard though, because I get a lot of pain in my mouth at night…. I'm losing a lot of teeth, you know, they used to be nice and pretty."" I think about Shawn Whiting, a former heroin dealer who went to prison for years after the officers robbed him. He couldn't get anyone to believe him at the time, and to this day, he fears law enforcement. ""You have nightmares about police officers harassing you, beating you up, just locking you up, it's just a nightmare that I have and it basically hasn't gone away yet,"" he said. ""I just go through this on a daily basis, scared of police, wondering when they gonna stop you, trying to plant drugs on you or something like that. Or harm you or even kill you."" Victims like Bumgardner and Whiting had the courage to speak out. There's no telling how many other people were affected, but were too afraid to come forward. Someone once told me that it will take a generation for the direct impact of the Gun Trace Task Force to start to fade, and it will be impossible to measure how the victims' trauma will play out in the lives of their children, families and friends. The fallout of the squad's crimes is still rippling through the city and undoubtedly made Baltimore a less safe place for everyone who lives there. I continued working on this story for as long as I did out of some hope that the more the public learned about the corruption in the police department, the better chance there might be of some kind of true, systemic reform. But Whiting is not so optimistic. Four years after the Gun Trace Task Force officers were arrested, he says he sees no difference on the streets of Baltimore. ""How police act towards people ain't changed,"" he told me recently. ""I see some police officers harassing people, doing the same little tactics that the Gun Trace Task Force was doing."" I asked him if he thinks that another scandal is inevitable. ""Absolutely. It's going to happen again,"" he said. ""It ain't over. This just begun."" .

"Snowdon walkers dressed for shopping, says rescuer","Rescuers help a man seriously injured after falling on Tryfan on Sunday Mountain rescuers are urging people not to go ill-prepared when walking in Snowdonia amid a rise in callouts. Calls to Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue are up about 20% this year to 110. Volunteer Chris Lloyd said the route up Snowdon can ""bite back"" due to rough terrain, with neighbouring Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team ""getting calls all the time"" to help people.

""Accidents do happen - they happen to the best of people,"" he said. ""But we really do get calls from people who really should be able to sort themselves out if they are properly prepared.""

"No Time To Die is magnificent, critics say","Daniel Craig's fifth and final James Bond film, No Time To Die, has received rave reviews from critics. The movie premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday, following several delays prompted by the Covid pandemic. In his five-star review of the film,Kevin Maher of The Times said:,external""It's better than good. It's magnificent. ""Craig is a towering charismatic presence from opening frame to closing shot, and he bows out in terrific, soulful, style."" But while most critics were positive, some suggested the film did not quite justify its 163-minute running time. This reviews round-up is spoiler free. In his own five-star review,The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described the film,externalas an ""epic barnstormer"" which delivers ""pathos, action, drama, camp comedy, heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action"". ""It is of course a festival of absurdity and complication, a head-spinning world of giant plot mechanisms,"" he said, but concluded the film as a whole is ""very enjoyable and gleefully spectacular"". Lashana Lynch, a newcomer to the Bond films, was praised for her performance in No Time To Die Stephanie Zacharek of Time was broadly positive,externalabout the film, but suggested Craig's swansong didn't warrant its length. ""At two hours and 43 minutes, it's too long and too overstuffed with plot - more isn't always better,"" she said. ""And it features one of the dullest villains in the series' history, played by Rami Malek in mottled skin and dumb silky PJs. ""But forget all that. No Time To Die, its flaws notwithstanding, is perfectly tailored to the actor who is, to me, the best Bond of all."" No Time To Die marks the culmination of an over-arching storyline that began with Craig's first Bond film Casino Royale, released in 2006. In another five-star review,Robbie Collin of The Telegraph said:,external""[Director] Cary Joji Fukunaga's extravagantly satisfying, bulgingly proportioned last chapter to the Craig era, throws almost everything there is left to throw at 007 the series can come up with. ""We've been expecting you, Mr Bond, for quite some time,"" he added, ""and what a joy and relief it is to have you back."" Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek plays the film's villain The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey was less enthusiastic,,externalawarding the film three stars and describing the premise as ""generic spy nonsense"". ""Cary Joji Fukunaga has made a smashing piece of action cinema with No Time To Die - it's just a shame it had to be a Bond film,"" she said. ""What's most disappointing is how strangely anti-climatic the whole thing feels."" She added: ""Despite Phoebe Waller-Bridge's much-publicised contributions to the film's script, No Time to Die hardly feels like the radical feminist rewrite we were promised."" There was a similarly lukewarm responsefrom Screen Daily's Jonathan Romney,,externalwho said: ""It's certainly a film that breaks many of the canonical rules of the series, though not entirely to dazzling effect. ""There's plenty to gawk at, and to argue over, in this episode,"" he added, ""yet No Time To Die is oddly lacking in pleasure or real wit."" Empire's John Nugent agreed,externalthat the film was too long, writing that the middle third is ""bogged down by plotting and exposition doesn't justify that heaving runtime"". However, he noted: ""This film does things that no Bond film has ever done, and despite relying heavily on tropes that feel not only familiar but comforting, it is the unfamiliar things it does that make this such an exciting entry."" This video can not be played Members of the Royal Family joined stars of the new Bond film at its world premiere in London The film's length, however, wasn't an issuefor Digital Spy's Ian Sandwell.,external""It's densely plotted yet snappily paced, meaning that the movie rarely stops for breath before the next big action sequence or another revelation,"" he said. ""Further viewings will likely decide No Time To Die's fate in the ranking of Bond movies, especially as there are definitely moments likely to divide the fandom,"" he continued. ""As an experience though, it delivers all the spectacle you'd expect from a 007 movie, throws a few surprises in along the way and proves to be an entertaining, affecting and bold finale for Daniel Craig."" Daniel Craig's last Bond film finally premieres What we learned from No Time To Die trailer The making of Billie Eilish's Bond theme Many critics took the opportunity to reflect on and praise Craig's portrayal of Bond, particularly the emotional elements he brings to the role. ""Craig, his hair chopped into a bristle cut, has mastered the art of making Bond a seemingly invincible force who is also a human being with hidden vulnerabilities,""said Variety's Owen Gleiberman.,external He was similarly positive about the film's villain as Lyutsifer Safin, writing: ""Rami Malek, with mottled skin, an all-seeing leer, and the caressing voice of a depraved monk, makes him a hypnotic creep."" Daniel Craig with director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the No Time To Die set in 2019 Several reviews also praised one of the new additions to the film's cast. ""The real standout is Lashana Lynch... and she holds her own marvellously well,""wrote Next Best Picture's Josh Parham.,external ""The banter she has with Craig is effectively humorous and provides some of the most delightful moments in the film."" The latest film, which is released in the UK on Thursday, is Craig's fifth - following Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre. ""No Time To Die is a genre-bending Bond,""said Claire Gregory of Sky News.,external""Fans will be pleased that all the classic lines are delivered, sometimes with such humour that you can't help but suspect they were improved by Phoebe Waller Bridge's pass at the script. ""The film is chock full of tech, explosions, guns and car chases,"" she continued. ""In fact some of the scenes feel slightly gratuitous, with Daniel Craig getting one last opportunity to do pretty much everything you could ever expect from Bond."" It was revealed on Wednesday that Craig will follow Bond by playing Macbeth on Broadway from April, with Ruth Negga starring as Lady Macbeth. His final 007 film sees several actors from the Craig-era reprise their roles, including Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q, and LÃ©a Seydoux as love interest Dr. Madeleine Swann. Lashana Lynch, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux attended the film's world premiere on Tuesday ""Even if the two-and-three-quarter hour running time is occasionally a slog, it ultimately delivers,""wrote The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney.,external He said the film was ""the most tender portrait of James Bond we've ever seen,"" although he criticised the films ""plotting deficiencies and occasional pacing lags"". ""It may not rank up there with Skyfall, but it's a moving valedictory salute to the actor who has left arguably the most indelible mark on the character since Connery,"" he concluded. The Press Association's film critic Damon Smith said No Time To Die broke with the film series' previous tendency for a Bond actor's last film to be weaker than his earlier ones. ""Sean Connery returned to MI6 for Diamonds Are Forever and promptly exited, beginning the swansong rot... Roger Moore's 1985 farewell in A View To A Kill flatlined with inert sexual chemistry between [Moore] and Grace Jones,"" he noted. ""Pierce Brosnan barely thawed out Die Another Day, which began well with Halle Berry's orange bikinied entrance a la Ursula Andress then quickly lost the plot with a melting ice palace, an invisible car, another deadly satellite and Madonna's leaden cameo as a vampy fencing instructor. ""No Time To Die, which concludes Daniel Craig's muscular tour of duty as novelist Ian Fleming's dapper spy, ends the losing streak in spectacular and moving fashion."" Ana de Armas, who also starred alongside Craig in Knives Out, was praised for her performance The film ""does deliver some impressive chases and action sequences,""said CNN's Brian Lowry.,externalBut, he added: ""No Time to Die feels as if it's working too hard to provide Craig a send-off worthy of all the hype associated with it - an excess that might be summed up as simply, finally, by taking too much time to reach the finish."" Alex Flood of NME praised the film,externalin his four-star review, but added: ""There are issues. Rami Malek's disfigured Safin is another clichÃ©d, empty bad guy - and while Ana de Armas thrills during one eye-popping party scene, her character is quickly discarded so that other, blander men can take the spotlight. ""For the most part though, and with so much at stake thanks to Covid decimating cinema, No Time To Die producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking some bold risks. The gobsmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history. ""When the credits finally roll on Daniel Craig's last hurrah, [the] difficulties fade into the background. If we didn't know better, we'd say it even looked like he enjoyed himself."" M (Ralph Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) all return in the film No Time To Die is released in UK cinemas on Thursday 30 September.

Army will be delivering fuel in days - minister,"This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said.

"Starmer sets out 'serious plan' for governmentThe Labour leader says he can provide the leadership the UK needs, in a speech to his party conference.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Starmer's party conference message to PM: ""Get a grip or get out of the way"" Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a ""serious plan for government"", in a speech to his party conference. He said the country faced a ""big moment"" that ""demands leadership"" - and as prime minister he would provide it. Sir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values. He got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers. Sir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"", to cheers from other delegates. Keir Starmer's Labour conference speech fact-checked Five things we learned from Labour conference Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour members back Â£15 minimum wage amid row After a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic. ""These are big issues, but our politics is so small,"" he told delegates. ""So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge."" The 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid. Addressing a packed auditorium, he said he would ""not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today"" and called Labour a party of ""patriots"". He spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. Sir Keir described his parents as ""the two rocks of my life"", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a ""deep respect for the dignity of work"". He contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a ""trickster"", a ""trivial man"" and a ""showman with nothing left to show"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is heckled as he delivers his speech With Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn. While he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: ""We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government. ""It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust."" By contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times. ""You want levelling up?,"" he asked. ""That's levelling up."" At the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: ""I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me."" Sir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. In an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. Persistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. There were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. The speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again. It was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street. Moving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum ""Band-C"" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others. The changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households Â£400 a year in bills on average, he promised. Other pledges in the speech included: Providing mental treatment within a month for all people in England who require it Creating 8,500 more specialist mental health staff, providing an extra million people a year with help Training ""thousands"" of extra teachers in England - his aides did not provide a more specific figure Reforming the inspection body Ofsted to focus more on improving struggling schools ""I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,"" Sir Keir said. ""So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election."" Sir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised. On Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour. The next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership. And delegatesvoted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry,despite Sir Keir ruling this out. The leader also angered the left when he pushed throughchanges to the way Labour elects its leaders. Reacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had ""identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions"". ""We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,"" it added. The trade union Unite said there ""wasn't much"" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights. But Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated ""vision"" and shown the party ""could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government"", adding: ""This is a serious plan for change"". Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan.

"Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrestWayne Couzens used his police ID to kidnap Ms Everard as she walked home, the Old Bailey hears.London","Four members of Ms Everard's family were in court to hear the pleas Sarah Everard was handcuffed by her murderer as he pretended to arrest her for breaching Covid guidelines. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining Ms Everard, 33, putting her in his hire car and driving away. His sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey was told that her ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The 48-year-old had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Ms Everard was handcuffed at 21:34 GMT and four minutes later she was being driven to Dover, where Couzens transferred her to his own car. Couzens then drove to a remote rural area he knew well, where he raped Ms Everard. The sexual predator had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prosecutor Tom Little QC said Couzens must have taken Ms Everard's mobile phone from her and removed the sim card, which he tried to destroy. Ms Everard was described by a former long-term boyfriend as ""extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise"" and ""not a gullible person"", the court heard. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? He could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know ""unless by force or manipulation"", Mr Little said. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car, but they ""assumed Ms Everard must have done something wrong"", the court was told. Couzens owned a patch of land in Hoads Wood, where he burned Ms Everard's body One of the witnesses described a woman on the pavement who appeared to have her left arm behind her back and ""was in the process of giving her other arm behind her back"" as a man in dark clothing handcuffed her. Mr Little said they believed they were witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman. The exact time Ms Everard was killed could not be determined, although she was dead - strangled with Couzens' police belt - by about 02:30 on 4 March, when he stopped for snacks at a service station. He then visited Hoads Wood near Ashford, Kent, leaving just before sunrise. Later that morning, he threw Ms Everard's mobile phone into a channel at Sandwich, where it was found by a police diver. Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey wearing a dark suit Wayne Couzens shuffled into court his head bowed. Wearing a dark blue suit he confirmed his name. Sarah's parents, and other family members, are in court listening to horrendous details about their daughter's kidnap, rape and murder. In the public gallery many of her friends have also come to court to support them. Three members of her family will read out statements this afternoon about how her murder has affected them. The prosecutor said her murder was reported on social media as #shewasonlywalkinghome but the more appropriate five words to describe what Couzens did were ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation and fire"". A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. Mr Little said: ""The defendant's plot of land is very close to, and in the same woods, where he was to burn Sarah Everard's body after he had murdered her. ""He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task to a pond deeper into the woods, but which was only about 130 metres from his plot."" The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer wiped his phone just minutes before he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, on 9 March. Couzens, who pleaded guilty in July to Ms Everard's murder, will be sentenced at the end of the two-day hearing. Lord Justice Fulford will consider whether to hand down a whole-life term. A tent was set up as police searched woodland near Great Chart, Kent The case prompted national outrage and sparked protests about violence against women, particularly as walking was one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country shared stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled and assaulted; and a number of vigils were held in honour of Ms Everard and to raise concerns about the safety of women. A vigil held on Clapham Commonled to the Met Police being accused of heavy-handedness for its tactics. Ahead of the Couzens sentencing hearing, the Met Police issued a statement that said: ""We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for. ""Our thoughts are with Sarah's family and her many friends. It is not possible for us to imagine what they are going through."" Couzens wassacked by the forcein July.

"No Time To Die is magnificent, critics sayCritics welcome the latest James Bond film, although some suggested it doesn't warrant its run time.","Daniel Craig's fifth and final James Bond film, No Time To Die, has received rave reviews from critics. The movie premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday, following several delays prompted by the Covid pandemic. In his five-star review of the film,Kevin Maher of The Times said:,external""It's better than good. It's magnificent. ""Craig is a towering charismatic presence from opening frame to closing shot, and he bows out in terrific, soulful, style."" But while most critics were positive, some suggested the film did not quite justify its 163-minute running time. This reviews round-up is spoiler free. In his own five-star review,The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described the film,externalas an ""epic barnstormer"" which delivers ""pathos, action, drama, camp comedy, heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action"". ""It is of course a festival of absurdity and complication, a head-spinning world of giant plot mechanisms,"" he said, but concluded the film as a whole is ""very enjoyable and gleefully spectacular"". Lashana Lynch, a newcomer to the Bond films, was praised for her performance in No Time To Die Stephanie Zacharek of Time was broadly positive,externalabout the film, but suggested Craig's swansong didn't warrant its length. ""At two hours and 43 minutes, it's too long and too overstuffed with plot - more isn't always better,"" she said. ""And it features one of the dullest villains in the series' history, played by Rami Malek in mottled skin and dumb silky PJs. ""But forget all that. No Time To Die, its flaws notwithstanding, is perfectly tailored to the actor who is, to me, the best Bond of all."" No Time To Die marks the culmination of an over-arching storyline that began with Craig's first Bond film Casino Royale, released in 2006. In another five-star review,Robbie Collin of The Telegraph said:,external""[Director] Cary Joji Fukunaga's extravagantly satisfying, bulgingly proportioned last chapter to the Craig era, throws almost everything there is left to throw at 007 the series can come up with. ""We've been expecting you, Mr Bond, for quite some time,"" he added, ""and what a joy and relief it is to have you back."" Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek plays the film's villain The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey was less enthusiastic,,externalawarding the film three stars and describing the premise as ""generic spy nonsense"". ""Cary Joji Fukunaga has made a smashing piece of action cinema with No Time To Die - it's just a shame it had to be a Bond film,"" she said. ""What's most disappointing is how strangely anti-climatic the whole thing feels."" She added: ""Despite Phoebe Waller-Bridge's much-publicised contributions to the film's script, No Time to Die hardly feels like the radical feminist rewrite we were promised."" There was a similarly lukewarm responsefrom Screen Daily's Jonathan Romney,,externalwho said: ""It's certainly a film that breaks many of the canonical rules of the series, though not entirely to dazzling effect. ""There's plenty to gawk at, and to argue over, in this episode,"" he added, ""yet No Time To Die is oddly lacking in pleasure or real wit."" Empire's John Nugent agreed,externalthat the film was too long, writing that the middle third is ""bogged down by plotting and exposition doesn't justify that heaving runtime"". However, he noted: ""This film does things that no Bond film has ever done, and despite relying heavily on tropes that feel not only familiar but comforting, it is the unfamiliar things it does that make this such an exciting entry."" This video can not be played Members of the Royal Family joined stars of the new Bond film at its world premiere in London The film's length, however, wasn't an issuefor Digital Spy's Ian Sandwell.,external""It's densely plotted yet snappily paced, meaning that the movie rarely stops for breath before the next big action sequence or another revelation,"" he said. ""Further viewings will likely decide No Time To Die's fate in the ranking of Bond movies, especially as there are definitely moments likely to divide the fandom,"" he continued. ""As an experience though, it delivers all the spectacle you'd expect from a 007 movie, throws a few surprises in along the way and proves to be an entertaining, affecting and bold finale for Daniel Craig."" Daniel Craig's last Bond film finally premieres What we learned from No Time To Die trailer The making of Billie Eilish's Bond theme Many critics took the opportunity to reflect on and praise Craig's portrayal of Bond, particularly the emotional elements he brings to the role. ""Craig, his hair chopped into a bristle cut, has mastered the art of making Bond a seemingly invincible force who is also a human being with hidden vulnerabilities,""said Variety's Owen Gleiberman.,external He was similarly positive about the film's villain as Lyutsifer Safin, writing: ""Rami Malek, with mottled skin, an all-seeing leer, and the caressing voice of a depraved monk, makes him a hypnotic creep."" Daniel Craig with director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the No Time To Die set in 2019 Several reviews also praised one of the new additions to the film's cast. ""The real standout is Lashana Lynch... and she holds her own marvellously well,""wrote Next Best Picture's Josh Parham.,external ""The banter she has with Craig is effectively humorous and provides some of the most delightful moments in the film."" The latest film, which is released in the UK on Thursday, is Craig's fifth - following Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre. ""No Time To Die is a genre-bending Bond,""said Claire Gregory of Sky News.,external""Fans will be pleased that all the classic lines are delivered, sometimes with such humour that you can't help but suspect they were improved by Phoebe Waller Bridge's pass at the script. ""The film is chock full of tech, explosions, guns and car chases,"" she continued. ""In fact some of the scenes feel slightly gratuitous, with Daniel Craig getting one last opportunity to do pretty much everything you could ever expect from Bond."" It was revealed on Wednesday that Craig will follow Bond by playing Macbeth on Broadway from April, with Ruth Negga starring as Lady Macbeth. His final 007 film sees several actors from the Craig-era reprise their roles, including Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q, and LÃ©a Seydoux as love interest Dr. Madeleine Swann. Lashana Lynch, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux attended the film's world premiere on Tuesday ""Even if the two-and-three-quarter hour running time is occasionally a slog, it ultimately delivers,""wrote The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney.,external He said the film was ""the most tender portrait of James Bond we've ever seen,"" although he criticised the films ""plotting deficiencies and occasional pacing lags"". ""It may not rank up there with Skyfall, but it's a moving valedictory salute to the actor who has left arguably the most indelible mark on the character since Connery,"" he concluded. The Press Association's film critic Damon Smith said No Time To Die broke with the film series' previous tendency for a Bond actor's last film to be weaker than his earlier ones. ""Sean Connery returned to MI6 for Diamonds Are Forever and promptly exited, beginning the swansong rot... Roger Moore's 1985 farewell in A View To A Kill flatlined with inert sexual chemistry between [Moore] and Grace Jones,"" he noted. ""Pierce Brosnan barely thawed out Die Another Day, which began well with Halle Berry's orange bikinied entrance a la Ursula Andress then quickly lost the plot with a melting ice palace, an invisible car, another deadly satellite and Madonna's leaden cameo as a vampy fencing instructor. ""No Time To Die, which concludes Daniel Craig's muscular tour of duty as novelist Ian Fleming's dapper spy, ends the losing streak in spectacular and moving fashion."" Ana de Armas, who also starred alongside Craig in Knives Out, was praised for her performance The film ""does deliver some impressive chases and action sequences,""said CNN's Brian Lowry.,externalBut, he added: ""No Time to Die feels as if it's working too hard to provide Craig a send-off worthy of all the hype associated with it - an excess that might be summed up as simply, finally, by taking too much time to reach the finish."" Alex Flood of NME praised the film,externalin his four-star review, but added: ""There are issues. Rami Malek's disfigured Safin is another clichÃ©d, empty bad guy - and while Ana de Armas thrills during one eye-popping party scene, her character is quickly discarded so that other, blander men can take the spotlight. ""For the most part though, and with so much at stake thanks to Covid decimating cinema, No Time To Die producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking some bold risks. The gobsmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history. ""When the credits finally roll on Daniel Craig's last hurrah, [the] difficulties fade into the background. If we didn't know better, we'd say it even looked like he enjoyed himself."" M (Ralph Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) all return in the film No Time To Die is released in UK cinemas on Thursday 30 September.

The Everyone's Invited website was set up to help pupils anonymously report abuse and harassment by classmates. Some told BBC Wales it was common for girls as young as 11 to be pressured into sending nudes, or receive unwanted explicit images from boys. The Welsh government said the safety of children was a priority. North Wales Police said it was investigating two cases linked to testimony on the website, while Dyfed Powys and South Wales Police forces did not provide figures.

He said head teachers were ""deluding themselves"" if they did not think sexual harassment was a problem. Head teacher Neil Foden says the allegations would ""horrify"" people, but they are familiar to most teachers ""There is, I think, a culture among some pupils here, as there will be in most other schools, where the borderline between what's just a joke, and what is sexually inappropriate and causes distress, is not well enough understood,"" he said. Mr Foden said serious misconduct was rare, but his school's policy, alongside working with police, was to exclude those responsible. ""I have on one occasion permanently excluded a pupil,"" he said. ""Any school should have been looking at their procedures well before this website came into existence. Something it has made us do, is to look again at our procedures."" He said some of the stories posted on the Everyone's Invited website, which may have ""horrified"" many people, would feel familiar to most teachers. PC Dylan Pritchard, who works as a schools community officer for North Wales Police, said social media and the proliferation of indecent images had become one of the biggest issues. ""It is getting worse I believe,"" he said. ""However, that may be down to knowing more about it and the fact that we are empowering young people to speak up. ""Inappropriate photos are often shared.

Ms Kirkwood said writing an account on Everyone's Invited could be the first step, with officers ready to help and listen when girls were ready. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Any form of sexual harassment is completely unacceptable and should not be tolerated. ""It remains a priority across the Welsh government that every child and young person is supported, and that they feel able to report any concerns they may have. ""This summer, the minister for education and Welsh language asked Estyn to review the culture and processes at secondary schools, to protect and support young people. The report is due to be published in December."" Education Minister Jeremy Miles said he had written to every school in Wales to ""look for assurance that they have systems in place to support pupils in this situation"".

""Looking forwards, there's lots of work to do to break down those barriers and to get to a point where we don't have to have an anonymised reporting system."" Ms Kirkwood said writing an account on Everyone's Invited could be the first step, with officers ready to help and listen when girls were ready. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Any form of sexual harassment is completely unacceptable and should not be tolerated. ""It remains a priority across the Welsh government that every child and young person is supported, and that they feel able to report any concerns they may have. ""This summer, the minister for education and Welsh language asked Estyn to review the culture and processes at secondary schools, to protect and support young people. The report is due to be published in December."" Education Minister Jeremy Miles said he had written to every school in Wales to ""look for assurance that they have systems in place to support pupils in this situation"". He added that the Welsh government planned to act immediately on any recommendations from Estyn.

"United Airlines to fire staff who refuse vaccineThe vast majority of its 67,000 US employees comply with the airline's Covid-19 vaccine policy.Business","Nearly 600 United Airlines employees face being fired after failing to comply with the firm's Covid-19 vaccination policy. The vast majority of its 67,000 US staff have supplied proof of vaccination, which was required by Monday. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision,"" its bosses said in a memo to employees. The Chicago-based airline set out its Covid requirements for staff in August. Its US employees had to upload proof of vaccination, or the first of two jabs, by the deadline on Monday. The 593 workers who have refused a coronavirus vaccine and have not applied for an exemption on religious or medical grounds now face losing their jobs. United bets on travel boom with big plane order US lifts Covid travel ban on UK and EU citizens ""Our rationale for requiring the vaccine for all United's US-based employees was simple - to keep our people safe - and the truth is this: everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated, and vaccine requirements work,"" its chief executive Scott Kirby and president Brett Hart said on Tuesday. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision but keeping our team safe has always been our first priority,"" they said. Some of those employees could be kept on if they have been jabbed and have simply failed to submit proof of vaccination - or if they are vaccinated before formal meetings on the matter, the company said. United said it would follow the rules outlined in union agreements on the dismissals. The process could take weeks or months. A further 2,000 employees have requested an exemption to the policy. It previously said it would put those who are exempt on temporary, unpaid leave from 2 October. But those plans were put on hold after a lawsuit was filed by six employees challenging the policy. The US recently rolled back travel restrictions for vaccinated passengers from the UK and European Union Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, told the BBC's Today programme that the ""strict"" policy was not likely to be introduced by UK airlines. Like many companies in the aviation sector, United was severely hit by pandemic-related travel restrictions. At the height of the crisis, it announced that it would need to furlough up to 36,000 staff. It denied, however, that its vaccine policy would affect recruitment going forward, although vaccination will be a condition of hire for new staff. On Tuesday it said that it had received more than 20,000 applications for about 2,000 flight attendant jobs. Elsewhere in the US, few airlines have introduced vaccine mandates for its staff.

Starmer sets out 'serious plan' for governmentVideo'Get out of the way and let us clear up this mess',"This video can not be played Starmer's party conference message to PM: ""Get a grip or get out of the way"" Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a ""serious plan for government"", in a speech to his party conference. He said the country faced a ""big moment"" that ""demands leadership"" - and as prime minister he would provide it. Sir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values. He got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers. Sir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"", to cheers from other delegates. Keir Starmer's Labour conference speech fact-checked Five things we learned from Labour conference Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour members back Â£15 minimum wage amid row After a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic. ""These are big issues, but our politics is so small,"" he told delegates. ""So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge."" The 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid. Addressing a packed auditorium, he said he would ""not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today"" and called Labour a party of ""patriots"". He spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. Sir Keir described his parents as ""the two rocks of my life"", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a ""deep respect for the dignity of work"". He contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a ""trickster"", a ""trivial man"" and a ""showman with nothing left to show"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is heckled as he delivers his speech With Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn. While he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: ""We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government. ""It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust."" By contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times. ""You want levelling up?,"" he asked. ""That's levelling up."" At the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: ""I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me."" Sir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. In an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. Persistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. There were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. The speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again. It was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street. Moving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum ""Band-C"" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others. The changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households Â£400 a year in bills on average, he promised. Other pledges in the speech included: Providing mental treatment within a month for all people in England who require it Creating 8,500 more specialist mental health staff, providing an extra million people a year with help Training ""thousands"" of extra teachers in England - his aides did not provide a more specific figure Reforming the inspection body Ofsted to focus more on improving struggling schools ""I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,"" Sir Keir said. ""So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election."" Sir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised. On Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour. The next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership. And delegatesvoted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry,despite Sir Keir ruling this out. The leader also angered the left when he pushed throughchanges to the way Labour elects its leaders. Reacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had ""identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions"". ""We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,"" it added. The trade union Unite said there ""wasn't much"" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights. But Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated ""vision"" and shown the party ""could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government"", adding: ""This is a serious plan for change"". Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan.

"Daughter, sister, friend and colleague","The murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national outcry, spurring women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe on the streets. Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: ""She was the same age as me"", ""I used to live near her"", ""I've walked the same route"". Ms Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. The private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. Sarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but ""brilliant"" at everything else. There were just 38 minutes between the time this ""clever, articulate and caring"" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. The final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open. The car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose. Sarah Everard was dead. Her body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. A complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her. He knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants. Outwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them. But the 48-year-old officer's faÃ§ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time. The very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as ""carpet protector"" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work. After he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance. That they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones. Ms Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. She, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer. One of Ms Everard's friends said: ""What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. ""We could trust her to fight the good fight."" Ms Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker. Described by her family as ""bright and beautiful"", ""kind and thoughtful"", ""caring and dependable"", she ""always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all"". Rose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation. Met PC pleads guilty to Sarah Everard murder Couzens was accused of indecent exposure in 2015 Ms Woollard said: ""Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her. ""It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start."" ""She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,"" said another friend. ""I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her."" A former colleague said: ""Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. ""There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many."" The uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: ""I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. ""Finding the right words is so hard. ""I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow. ""Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. ""She should be here."" A simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: ""Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day"". When she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey. This was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control. It was cool-headed and clinical. Investigators are looking into the hypothesis he used his police ID card as a means to stop Ms Everard, under the guise of questioning her about Covid restrictions. At any point he could have driven away. He chose not to.

LiveLiveStarmer delivers speech to Labour conference1 minute ago,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gives his first speech to a full conference He says Labour under his leadership will not have an election manifesto ""that is not a serious plan for government"" There are heckles from the audience, to which he responds with ""shouting slogans, or changing lives?"" Sir Keir says rape and serious sexual assault cases will be fast-tracked under a Labour government And he pledges mental health spending would not be allowed to fall He focuses on education, calling for digital skills in schools and reinstating compulsory work experience He criticises Boris Johnson as ""a trivial man, a showman with nothing left to show"" The speech also focuses on science and research, with target investment of 3% of GDP He adds: ""Without a strong economy we cannot pay for the good society"" He finishes outlining his priorities: work, care, equality and security Edited by Johanna Howitt In his closing speech at the Labour conference in Brighton, Sir Starmer said he can provide the leadership the UK needs. We're going to end our coverage from Brighton. Our writers on board with you today were Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon. We'll be back next week when the conference caravan heads to Manchester for the Conservatives annual gathering. Thanks for following along with us. Boris Johnson returns to Manchester next week - the Conservatives last full conference was held there in 2019. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Reviews of the speech from the conference floor were largely but not universally positive. One union leader, for example, praised him for ""regaining issues from the Tories that should always have been ours"". Meanwhile a prominent figure on the left who had backed him for leader said the
speech was ""somehow long yet incomplete"". They said that while it was aimed 'narrowly' at swing
voters, there were omissions which could have been party-pleasing without
alienating a wider electorate such as a call for more rapid global vaccination. But the speech was designed to demonstrate that Labour was
returning to a focus om mainstream issues - such as health and education - which were the
priorities of thesceptical voters Keir Starmer met in the summer. But while
some of his priorities are similar to the last Labour government, some of the
policies are not. There is some radicalism beneath the reassuring rhetoric particularly on employment rights which are some distance
away from Tony Blair's flexible labour market. So what did the speech set out to achieve? Here are five aims:  Now, of course, whether in political jargon these have
'landed' will down to voters and not the conference delegates to decide. Away from the policy and announcements there were several  key moments in Keir Starmer's speech. So what else did he say?  Sir Keir Starmer said that a Labour government would: After his speech, journalists got to question Starmer's team about his performance. Asked about that handful of hecklers interrupting the speech, they said it was ""clear some people this week
havenât accepted the change Keir wanted to bring to party and that was borne out in
hall "". But they said it was only a small number of people and ""it didn't knock him off his stride... or distract him"". They added: ""Starmer delivered the speech in an optimistic, confident tone."" Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden has accused Labour of spending ""five days talking to themselves about themselves instead of to the country"". ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan,"" he said. ""From resignations in the middle of their own conference, to their union backers deserting them, to disrupting their leader's speech, Labour are too preoccupied fighting amongst themselves to put forward a plan for our country."" The conference hall welcomes the Labour leader to the stage Keir Starmer begun his speech by welcoming back ex-MP Louise Ellman - she quit the party over anti-Semitism He also paid tribute to campaigners Doreen Lawrence (L) and Penny and John Clough The shadow cabinet showed their support... ... but the Labour leader's speech was interrupted throughout with heckles from the conference floor... ...and some tried to show Keir Starmer the red card. But party leaders can usually rely on support from their partners. Victoria Starmer joined her husband on stage at the end of his speech. Reality Check On fuel
shortages, Keir Starmer told his party conference: âA tank of fuel already
costs Â£10 more than it did at the start of the year.â Thatâs
about right. In the first week of the year,external, the average UK price for a litre of petrol was about
115p, while diesel was about 120p a litre, according to government figures. The
latest figure is 135p for petrol and 138p for diesel. So you
would need a fuel tank of about 50 litres, which is a pretty normal midsize
car, to be paying Â£10 more for a tankful. Another union takes a very different approach, calling out Sir Keir and his speech. The national political lead of Unite, Rob MacGregor, says there ""wasn't much"" for its members worried about fuel shortages, the end of furlough and fire and rehire tactics. He adds: ""We needed to hear a Labour leader who is as angry as we are about the harm being done to our workers, as as determined as Unite to stand up against abusive employers. ""We're clearly not there yet."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The speech was peppered with attempts to meld
Keir Starmer's back story to his ambitions for the future, rather than simply using his CV to introduce himself to
voters. When talking about violence against women he shows that
he can be emotional as well as determined, using a heart-wrenching case to commit to tougher sentences. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Ben McGowan was pleased with Starmer's vision The buzz around the conference as people start to pack up there bags is mostly positive. Ben McGowan said the speech was ""good"" and he saw it as progress on Starmer's predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. ""It was the first time we were able to see him and get a clear vision of what he was about,"" he said. ""He was confident and he just came up with things that sounded like we could win. It may not have been policy heavy, but it was a vision that I think will get through to the public."" We will have to wait and see about that at the ballot box... Christina McAnea praises Starmer and his speech The general secretary of Unison, Christina
McAnea, says Starmer's Labour was ""offering just what the country needs after 11 years of Tory mismanagement"". Responding to the speech, the union leader adds: ""Communities
across the UK are struggling on so many levels. ""Keir's speech shows that Labour
in power could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government. ""This is a serious plan for change."" Reality Check Keir
Starmer told his party conference: âOver 11 years of Tory government, we have
lost more than 8,000 police officers.â Themost recent figures,externalwe have for full-time equivalent police officers in England
and Wales is from 31 March this year, when there were 135,301. Thatâs
8,433 fewer than the figure for 31 March 2010, which was just over a month
before the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to
power. At the low-point in
2018, the figure was almost 20,000 officers below the 2010 level. The
government promised in 2019 to recruit 20,000 more police officers by 2023,
which would return numbers close to their 2010 levels. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Saranya Thambirajah disliked the ""rhetoric"" around the police in Starmer's speech But not everyone was thrilled with the policies outlined by Sir Keir Starmer - especially his call for more police on the streets. I spoke to one woman in tears about that element, in light oftoday's news around the murder of Sarah Everardand her killer, who was a police officer. She said: ""I don't feel safe, and right now I am scared of the police. I don't want to hear about having more of them, especially today."" Another woman I spoke to, Saranya Thambirajah, felt a similar way. ""There was a lot of rhetoric on crime and I don't think it is appropriate after the year we have had, with Black Lives Matter, attacks on women, and what we have found out about Sarah Everard's murder,"" she added. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Andi and Isabelle say they loved the speech Two other delegates thrilled with the speech were Andi Hopgood and Isabelle Gutierrez, who are both members of the Musicians' Union. Andi, who is a music teacher, said: ""I loved it! I have never heard someone talk so passionately about getting music and instruments to every child in school. ""Education should be creative. It is not just about science and technology!"" Isabelle added: ""I loved it too. It was great to hear us sounding like a government in waiting again."" From the conference floor... Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin was impressed Former Labour MP turned West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin was thrilled with Starmer's performance, calling it ""powerful"". She told me: ""He laid out his vision and really differentiated between a Conservative government and what he would look like in power. ""I feel really safe in his hands with his experience, and I loved us talking about being in government - it has been a while!"" Sir Keir Starmer has told Labour's conference his principles are work, care, equality and security, which are the ""tools of my trade"". The party leader closed his conference speech to a standing ovation â following earlier heckling â saying these values ""take you right to the heart of the British public"". This video can not be played Starmer closes his 2021 Labour Party conference speech Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent âEducation is so important I am tempted to say it three times,â Sir
Keir Starmer told the Labour party conference. That knowing nod to Labourâs mantra under Tony Blair was a sign of
an education policy shifting back towards the centre ground. Sir Keir warned of 200,000 primary pupils growing up in areas where
there were no schools rated good or outstanding. Those ratings are given by Ofsted - and at the last general
election Labour was promising to scrap the inspection service. That has now changed to a plan to âreformâ Ofsted. There was also
no sign of other previous policies such as scrapping Sats tests or clipping the
wings of academies and free schools. There will be a âNational Excellence Programmeâ - and the language
again has echoes of Labourâs years in office, when the bedrock of its policy
was on raising standards. Warning that the pandemic had seen the attainment gap widening
between rich and poor pupils, the Labour leader promised âthe most ambitious
school improvement plan in a generationâ. He promised Labour would focus on preparing young people for work,
including digital skills. It was an appeal to parents that Labour was now forward-looking in
education rather than inward-looking, keen on hi-tech skills and summoning up
the spirit of the âwhite heat of technologyâ. âI want every parent in the country to be able to send their child
to a great state school,â he told the conference. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the heckles were ""awful"" but the ""vast majority"" of the audience wanted to hear Starmer's message. She says people could see in the speech saw what drives Starmer and what he would be like as a prime minister. ""Here is a guy who you would trust your kids and your house with,"" she says. She acknowledges Labour ""got absolutely hammered at the last election"" but says Starmer's speech demonstrated: ""We are a party not of protest but of government."" BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Keir Starmer's speech has received mixed reviews from two Labour figures outside the conference hall. Laura Pidcock, a left-wing former MP who lost her seat at the 2019 election, tells Politics Live on BBC2 it was ""long"" and ""quite uninspiring"". ""I didn't really hear any commitments in his speech, and that's disappointing,"" she adds. She says some of the heckles were inappropriate but that party members feel ""deeply aggrieved"" by the way they have been treated. ""He needs to speak to working class voters"", she adds. There's a different view from Angela Eagle, who says the address ""showed that we're focused on winning the election"" and ""dealt with the concerns the British people have"". She says the heckling inside the hall was ""petulant and small, and very disappointing"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard before murderWayne Couzens falsely arrested the marketing executive as she walked home, the Old Bailey hears.","Four members of Ms Everard's family were in court to hear the pleas Sarah Everard was handcuffed by her murderer as he pretended to arrest her for breaching Covid guidelines. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining Ms Everard, 33, putting her in his hire car and driving away. His sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey was told that her ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The 48-year-old had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Ms Everard was handcuffed at 21:34 GMT and four minutes later she was being driven to Dover, where Couzens transferred her to his own car. Couzens then drove to a remote rural area he knew well, where he raped Ms Everard. The sexual predator had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prosecutor Tom Little QC said Couzens must have taken Ms Everard's mobile phone from her and removed the sim card, which he tried to destroy. Ms Everard was described by a former long-term boyfriend as ""extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise"" and ""not a gullible person"", the court heard. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? He could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know ""unless by force or manipulation"", Mr Little said. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car, but they ""assumed Ms Everard must have done something wrong"", the court was told. Couzens owned a patch of land in Hoads Wood, where he burned Ms Everard's body One of the witnesses described a woman on the pavement who appeared to have her left arm behind her back and ""was in the process of giving her other arm behind her back"" as a man in dark clothing handcuffed her. Mr Little said they believed they were witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman. The exact time Ms Everard was killed could not be determined, although she was dead - strangled with Couzens' police belt - by about 02:30 on 4 March, when he stopped for snacks at a service station. He then visited Hoads Wood near Ashford, Kent, leaving just before sunrise. Later that morning, he threw Ms Everard's mobile phone into a channel at Sandwich, where it was found by a police diver. Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey wearing a dark suit Wayne Couzens shuffled into court his head bowed. Wearing a dark blue suit he confirmed his name. Sarah's parents, and other family members, are in court listening to horrendous details about their daughter's kidnap, rape and murder. In the public gallery many of her friends have also come to court to support them. Three members of her family will read out statements this afternoon about how her murder has affected them. The prosecutor said her murder was reported on social media as #shewasonlywalkinghome but the more appropriate five words to describe what Couzens did were ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation and fire"". A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. Mr Little said: ""The defendant's plot of land is very close to, and in the same woods, where he was to burn Sarah Everard's body after he had murdered her. ""He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task to a pond deeper into the woods, but which was only about 130 metres from his plot."" The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer wiped his phone just minutes before he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, on 9 March. Couzens, who pleaded guilty in July to Ms Everard's murder, will be sentenced at the end of the two-day hearing. Lord Justice Fulford will consider whether to hand down a whole-life term. A tent was set up as police searched woodland near Great Chart, Kent The case prompted national outrage and sparked protests about violence against women, particularly as walking was one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country shared stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled and assaulted; and a number of vigils were held in honour of Ms Everard and to raise concerns about the safety of women. A vigil held on Clapham Commonled to the Met Police being accused of heavy-handedness for its tactics. Ahead of the Couzens sentencing hearing, the Met Police issued a statement that said: ""We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for. ""Our thoughts are with Sarah's family and her many friends. It is not possible for us to imagine what they are going through."" Couzens wassacked by the forcein July.

Next warns of staff shortages and price rises,"Next has warned of price rises and staff shortages before Christmas unless immigration rules are eased. The High Street chain said some areas of its business were ""beginning to come under pressure"", including warehouse and logistics staffing. It blamed higher shipping costs, particularly for larger furniture items, for pushing up its prices. The Home Office said it was working with industry to ""understand how we can best ease particular pinch points"". Next urged the government to ""take a more decisive approach to the looming skills crisis"" and said that the lorry driver crisis was ""foreseen, and widely predicted"". The company's warning over potential staffing issues during the festive period was made in its half-year results, which showed profit before tax was up by 5.9% compared to 2019 levels. The company said rising shipping costs had driven up prices by about 2%, with its larger home products ""bearing the brunt of the increase"". It added that in the first half of next year it expected prices to increase by an average 2.5%, with homeware prices up 6%. Next chief executive Lord Wolfson said the firm was not currently having difficulties in recruiting staff for its stores, but warned warehouse and logistics staffing was ""beginning to come under pressure"". ""We anticipate that, without some relaxation of immigration rules, we are likely to experience some degradation in our service in the run up to Christmas,"" he said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? How many people are out of work? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? A government spokeswoman said: ""We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. ""The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment."" Many UK sectors, from fuel firms to supermarkets, have supply chain problems at the moment due to a chronic shortage of lorry drivers. The shortage in drivers in the UK is estimated to be about 100,000, according to industry bodies, with a long-term problem being made worse by the pandemic, tax changes, Brexit, and an ageing workforce. The recent supply chain problems led to the UK governmentannouncing it will grant temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers. Lord Wolfson was a strong advocate of Brexit in the run-up to the referendum, but he has been critical of the government's approach towards post-Brexit immigration. He has said the imposition of a minimum salary of Â£30,000 was a mistake. In a statement, Next added: ""The HGV crisis was foreseen, and widely predicted for many months. For the sake of the wider UK economy, we hope that the government will take a more decisive approach to the looming skill crisis in warehouses, restaurants, hotels, care homes, and many seasonal industries. ""A demand led approach to ensuring the country has the skills it needs is now vital."" The company's performance for the half year to July was largely fuelled by a surge in online revenue, with sales increasing by 52% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Lord Wolfson said the retail bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic was ""far stronger than we anticipated"". ""Sales in retail stores have done better than planned, while online sales have fallen back less than we expected. It appears that the wider economy has not suffered the long term damage many feared, for the moment at least. And, in particular, employment has held up well,"" he added. The retailer raised its full year profit outlook for the fourth time in six months. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Next's ""ever-growing"" online business had led it to brush off the ""worst of the woes brought on by lockdown"". ""Next is the golden girl of the high street,"" she said. ""The High Street star hasn't escaped unscathed by the labour, supply and cost issues sweeping across the country. ""While things are stable for now, a lack of foreign workers means some Christmas deliveries might take longer to arrive during the peak trading season."" Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Army will be delivering fuel in days - ministerThe business secretary denies there is a crisis in supplies and says the situation is ""stabilising"".UK","This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said.

Toxic gas fears as La Palma lava reaches ocean,"This video can not be played Clouds of steam can be seen as scorching lava enters the Atlantic Ocean Lava from an erupting volcano on Spain's La Palma island has reached the Atlantic Ocean, raising fears of toxic gases being released and explosions. Clouds of white steam were seen rising as a red-hot current made contact with the water in the Playa Nueva area. This could trigger a chemical reaction which can irritate the skin and eyes and affect breathing. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed since the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands erupted on 19 September. About 6,000 people have been evacuated, as the lava was engulfing houses, schools and some banana plantations. On Wednesday the EU's Copernicus service estimated that the lava had had covered 267 hectares (2.7 sq km) and destroyed 656 homes on its way to the ocean. A visual guide to the La Palma volcano eruption Family's anguish as lava destroys 'miracle house' 'You can hear the volcano rumbling in the background' The lava reached the ocean late on Tuesday,the Canary Islands Volcanic Institute (Involcan) tweeted.,externalFootage broadcast on local TV showed a river of lava pouring off a cliff into the water, triggering plumes of vapour and gas. There are also fears that parts of the shoreline could now collapse, triggering explosions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three coastal villages were earlier locked down in anticipation of the lava making contact with the water. Residents on the western coast had been told to stay indoors and seal all doors and windows with tape and wet towels. The advice remains in force, but authorities have played down the threat posed by toxic gases. ""The eruption has not affected air quality, which is perfectly breathable,"" the La Palma Council said on Twitter. A huge cloud of white steam has been rising from the area where lava has been flowing into the ocean The Spanish government has declared La Palma - the most north-westerly island of the archipelago off the north African coast - a disaster zone, pledging financial support for all those affected by the volcanic activity. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said he would go to the island to co-ordinate aid for the residents of La Palma. The president of the Canary Islands, Ãngel VÃ­ctor Torres, said streams of lava up to 600m (1,968 ft) wide had devastated the landscape in some areas. The people of La Palma ""have been cowering in fear with a tremendous sense of desolation"" since the eruption began, the president told Spanish radio. Last week, he had estimated the damage incurred by the eruption would exceed â¬400m (Â£346m; $466m). When lava comes into contact with ocean water, it produces a gas plume known as laze - lava and haze. Laze forms through a series of chemical reactions as hot lava boils the colder sea water. ""It creates a steam of hydrochloric acid, water vapour and bits of ash,"" science journalist and volcanologist Dr Robin George Andrews told the BBC when the volcano first erupted. ""Obviously, it's not good to breathe in."" Laze plumes can cause eye, lung and skin irritation but should not be a problem if residents keep their distance, he said. A Copernicus satellite image shows the eruption on the west slope of the Cumbre Vieja Volcanic explosions were also possible, he added, because lava entering sea water creates ""a pressure-cooker situation"" that ""might fling out volcanic debris"". There was an incident in Hawaii where a chunk of molten rock, known as a lava bomb, crashed into a tourist boat off Hawaii's coast in 2018, injuring 23 people. Authorities have set up an exclusion zone around the lava, including in the sea, to keep people away from any potential danger.

Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops,"This GE tomato with extra vitamin C could get to market much faster The UK government is to relax the regulation of gene-edited crops to enable commercial growing in England. The plants are to be tested and assessed in the same way as conventional new varieties. The changes are possible because the UK no longer has to follow European Union regulations, which are the strictest in the world. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments will get to decide whether to adopt or opt out of the changes. Environment Secretary George Eustice said that he would be working closely with farming and environmental groups to help grow plants that are stronger and more resilient to climate change. ""Gene editing has the ability to harness the genetic resources that nature has provided. It is a tool that could help us tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face."" Costing the Earth: The power to edit nature Imperial units just part of Brexit revamp - No 10 The promise of gene editing in medicine Gene-edited (GE) crops have much simpler genetic alternations than so-called genetically modified (GM) ones. GM crops often involve the addition of extra genes, sometimes from a completely different species; and in some instances the insertion of DNA from animals. Gene-edited crops, by contrast, often just have genes snipped out of them, producing new varieties within months that could also have been produced by traditional cross-breeding but over a period of several years. Scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change. A wheat that has been gene edited to recreate a mutation found only once in nature which increases grain size European Union regulations require that gene-edited crops are treated the same as genetically-modified crops. These rules call for a number of field trials over a period of several years, as well as extensive food safety tests. The final hurdle is for member states to vote to approve a new variety. This approach is regarded by biotech companies as too onerous and expensive, so no genetically altered crops are developed in the European Union. The Westminster government's plan begins with separating the laws governing GE and GM crops. As a first step, legislation will be passed later this year to do away with the need for scientists to apply for a licence to carry out open-air trials of a gene-edited crop that could have been produced through traditional cross-breeding. Currently, the approvals process can take up to two months and cost several thousand pounds. The more significant change will take place next year when legislation will be brought forward to enable simple gene-edited crops to be regulated in the same way as any new variety for commercial development. The government is reviewing what measures it would need to bring in to maintain consumer choice, such as labelling and traceability. In the longer term, ministers will review England's approach to regulation covering all genetically modified organisms. This includes changes that might allow the commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. Such animals can be made to be more productive, resistant to some diseases and even better able to withstand hot weather. This video can not be played Gene-edited pigs immune to lung disease were produced in Scotland The news has been welcomed by many scientists working in the field. Prof Helen Sang works at The Roslin Institute in Edinburgh where researchers have developed gene-edited pigs that are resistant to a type of lung disease. ""Wednesday's announcement is a first step towards reducing unnecessary and unscientific regulatory barriers to the use of advanced breeding techniques, which are precise and targeted, allowing us to make specific genetic changes,"" she said. ""Adopting a more proportionate and enabling approach to regulation will open up increased opportunities for international research collaboration, inward investment and technology-based exports, bringing a major boost for UK science."" US scientists produced this heat-resistant, high-producing dairy calf with GE A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We have no plans to revise the existing GMO Deliberate Release Regulations in Wales and will maintain our precautionary approach towards genetic modification. Unlike the UK Government, we will continue to view products produced by gene editing as Genetically Modified as set out by the European Court of Justice in 2018."" Dr Helen Wallace, of the campaign Group Genewatch, described the changes as a ""weakening of standards meant to protect human health and the environment"". ""People won't be fooled. GM crops are GM crops. Whether they are made with new or old techniques, they can lead to unintended consequences. ""GM crops that withstand climate change have been promised for more than 40 years, but have never been delivered. 90% of GM crops that are grown today are engineered to withstand blanket spraying with weedkillers that are harmful to butterflies and frogs. New gene-edited crops won't be any different and will cause the same environmental problems."" Liz O'Neill, director of GM Freeze, said the government ""wants to swap the safety net of proper public protections for a high-tech free-for-all"". ""This announcement is described as a response to Defra's consultation on the regulation of genetic technologies. However, no detail has been made available on what George Eustice actually learnt from the exercise. ""The consultation submissions that GM Freeze has seen raised a wide range of concerns about Defra's proposals for dismantling GM safeguards, but this announcement suggests the minister isn't listening.""

"Army will be delivering fuel in days - ministerThe business secretary denies there is a crisis in supplies and says the situation is ""stabilising"".UKSnowdon walkers dressed for shopping, says rescuerMountain rescuers urge walkers not to go ill-prepared while in Snowdonia amid a rise in callouts.Wales","This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said.

Calls to Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue are up about 20% this year to 110. Volunteer Chris Lloyd said the route up Snowdon can ""bite back"" due to rough terrain, with neighbouring Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team ""getting calls all the time"" to help people. He said some walkers were ""dressed as if they're going across the supermarket car park"". ""So many are totally ill-equipped and haven't really thought about where they are going,"" he told theBBC Radio Wales breakfast programme. Queues on Snowdon 'worst I can remember' Overloaded visitor experience 'could harm Wales' He said his team had been called out about 20 times in September alone, with 35 callouts for volunteers at Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team covering Snowdon. Several rescues have been carried out on Tryfan mountain, with one man seriously injured, including a broken thigh bone, after falling on slippery rocks on Sunday. Walkers on Snowdon in August A helicopter airlifted rescuers to beneath the cloud line, but they had to reach the casualty on foot and then use a stretcher to lower him down to flat terrain before carrying him off the mountain due to ""atrocious conditions"". Mr Jones said he was ""very lucky"" to be located quickly as he had not been wearing waterproof clothing despite the weather forecast. ""Accidents do happen - they happen to the best of people,"" he said. ""But we really do get calls from people who really should be able to sort themselves out if they are properly prepared."" He said three rescuers had to escort a man to safety after his torch light had gone flat in the darkness.

The posts were written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald. Our live page will be coming to a close soon. But before we go, here's a round-up of the latest on the fuel supply crisis.  Read more in our story here We've been hearing that many in the industry and government believe the fuel supply issues will ease now that a lot of people have filled up their cars. That's because it's difficult, and dangerous, to store fuel. Steve Duffield, from the Humberside Rescue Service, says if you're storing canisters at home, you're taking a risk. ""Petrol is inherently a dangerous substance, itâs a highly flammable liquid, it gives off vapours that can be very very easily ignited and any leak of that petrol can lead to obviously, from our perspective, a serious fire and potentially an explosion,"" he says. The RAC says the fuel supply issue is ""improving"" - but the situation for drivers has not yet returned to normal. Spokesman Simon Williams says: âWhile fuel deliveries to forecourts have yet to return to normal, our latest breakdown data points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside."" He says there were ""huge increases"" in such breakdowns between Sunday and Monday, but this fell by 40% from Monday to Tuesday. He adds: ""While the numbers are still higher than weâd normally expect to see, itâs definitely a positive sign. ""Our patrols continue to work hard to keep drivers moving."" One of our reporters, BBC Scotland's Sarah Toom, visited 15 filling stations across Glasgow this morning. Of these, she says  four were closed completely because they had no fuel while several others had diesel but no petrol. One teacher told her he had finally managed to find petrol after visiting five other filling stations - all of which had run out. However, Sarah says she saw no sign of panic-buying or queuing, despite being out and about during morning rush-hour. And there seems to be a mixed picture across much of the rest of the country, with reports of some petrol stations being completely dry while others close-by are operating as normal. Find out more about the situation in Scotland here. Graham Swain, from Sheffield, tells the BBC his mum has been diagnosed with cancer - but he was unable to visit her in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire over the weekend because none of the filling stations he tried on Saturday morning had fuel left. ""This was at 5:30 in the morning,"" he tells the BBC. ""I tried nine stations and one did have petrol but no diesel, which I need. I tried again about six hours later and alas still no luck."" He adds: ""I have still not been able to fill my car at all. I'm almost dry and need to do school trips. I have no idea what to do."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to say fuel deliveries are ""well above normal"" and supplies are ""stabilising"". ""We can all do our bit by filling up only when actually required,""he says,external. Shapps quotes the Petrol Retailers Association figures that we reported earlier - only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. This has fallen from two-thirds of its members saying they were out on Sunday. BBC Radio Shropshire Shropshire Blood Bikes say they've kept their service going partly thanks to the good will of other drivers. Volunteers at the charity courier urgent blood products to NHS hospitals across three counties. Chris Hyde, from the charity, said some experiences on the forecourts have been heart-warming. ""We have had a number of instances where we've approached the queue, and motorists have actually flanked us through to the front of the queue, so we've been able to fill up the fuel and keep the bikes on the road,"" Chris says. Reality Check According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. Read more in our explainer. Lee Sellings, a community care worker in Shaftesbury, Dorset, says if he is not able to find diesel today he will not be able to visit his clients tomorrow. His role includes taking vulnerable people for day outings. ""I think things will get worse before they get better,"" he says. ""When I was recently trying to get fuel, a woman in the queue spent around Â£120 on petrol, saying she need it for the school run. ""In the end, it all comes down to greed."" Reality Check Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is to a large extent served by the same refineries as the rest of the UK. For example, Texaco ships fuel from its refinery in Pembroke to a storage facility at Belfast Harbour. But Northern Ireland has no more access to EU workers such as HGV drivers than other parts of the UK. Read more:How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Jackie Allen says she needs diesel for the school run and spent two hours searching for it without success. She likens the situation to her experience growing up in Zimbabwe in the 1980s when she says she remembers queuing for fuel. She says there is no diesel anywhere in Henley, where she is now, and she has also tried nearby Wallingford and Moulsford as well as every petrol station on the A4 between Reading and Maidenhead. ""A tanker filled up the pumps at the Gulf (garage) on the A4 Bath road
but they still had staff turning people away,"" she says. ""Even the Blood motorbike couldnât get fuel. ""At this rate, they will have to close schools because we
canât fill up our cars."" She says she only fills up once a month and didn't panic buy until she needed diesel and ""now there is nowhere in a 15 mile radius to fill up"". Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980 and was ruled by prime minister Robert Mugabe, who later became executive president before leaving power in 2017. But early gains in the economy were later overshadowed by later economic hardship, inflation and shortages of basic goods later in his rule. Robert Mugabe Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government has a reserve fleet of 80 tankers kept at depots in Cambridgeshire and West Yorkshire for use by industry in emergencies. The number used will change day by day. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acknowledges it won't make a huge difference but ""every little helps"" and are interpreting this as a positive development as it means firms have rejigged driver shifts, cancelled leave etc and so have sufficient drivers to be able to use additional vehicles. The Petrol Retailers Association - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says there are ""early signs"" pressure at the pumps is starting to ease. It says only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. On Tuesday, 37% of the forecourts owned by its members were out of petrol, compared with two-thirds on Sunday. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also says there are signs that the petrol crisis is ""stabilising"". The Ministry of Defence is preparing about 150 qualified military drivers to deliver fuel - and has another 150 personnel ready to support them. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says it will also draw on some of the reserve fleet of 80 tankers which the government keeps for emergencies. Read more in our explainer. We've heard from Nikolas McDonald, from Egham Surrey, who says he paid more than he expected for fuel and was
shocked to see the price per litre had gone up. He says he paid a ""disgusting recently inflated price of Â£1.55.9 per litre"" for super unleaded petrol on Friday. âNormally I would expect to
pay around Â£1.42 or Â£1.43 per litre,"" he says. âI donât mind paying a bit
more but I feel like we are being ripped off and taken advantage of."" Earlier, we reported that the RAC is predicting petrol price rises linked to the cost of oil, with average prices expected to reach 143p per litre for petrol and 145p for diesel in the next few weeks. Brexit is ""largely responsible"" for the ""supply chain fragility"" and the fuel supply problems the UK is experiencing, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. When ask about the fuel crisis during a visit to Dundee, Sturgeon says: ""The end of freedom of movement and the restrictions on immigration are really making it difficult to recruit haulage divers, to recruit people in our agriculture sector and even to recruit people in our health and social care services. ""So it is an extraordinary state of affairs that the UK government is responsible for, but we need to make sure that all of the steps have been taken to get through this period."" She says Covid alone would present ""a real risk of this being the most difficult winter any of us have ever known"", but these additional problems ""makes this extraordinarily difficult"". ""It underlines the foolishness and the recklessness of the UK government pressing ahead with Brexit, in the face of this pandemic."" You can read more on the petrol supply situation in Scotland here. The fuel crisis is easing, says the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents two-thirds of UK filling stations. ""There are encouraging signs that the crisis at the pumps is easing, with forecourts reporting that they are taking further deliveries of fuel,"" executive director Gordon Balmer says. ""Only 27% of PRA members have reported being out of fuel today, and with regular restocks taking place, we are expecting to see the easing continue over the next 24 hours."" But he says the organisation is ""extremely disappointed"" to hear forecourt staff have experienced ""a high level of both verbal and physical abuse"". ""We would urge the public to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" he says. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) isyet to process 56,144 applications,externalfor ""vocational driving licences"" - which includes HGV licences - according to Department for Transport figures. That total, correct as of 22 September, isup from 54,191 on 15 September.,external It was given in response to a written question from Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for Copeland and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the DfT, says the total included applications for provisional licences and for renewals and included ""those applying for entitlement to drive both HGVs and buses"". She says the DVLA is ""prioritising applications for provisional vocational licences so these drivers can take their training quickly"" - noting that they take 10 days to process  - while most people applying to renew a licence could continue driving while their applications were being processed. ""The DVLA continues to explore opportunities to reduce turnaround times for paper applications,"" she says. ""Extra staff have been recruited and the DVLA is seeking extra office space to house more staff to help reduce backlogs and provide future resilience and business continuity."" Clarification 30 September:
The Department for Transport has provided further information which makes clear
that only about 4,000 of the applications in the queue are for provisional HGV
licences and the majority of others are for renewals, and in most cases those
drivers can continue to drive while their application is being processed. BBC Radio CWR Panic buying of fuel has started to ease after several days of supply issues, according to the manager of one independent petrol station in Coventry. Paul Cheema runs a forecourt in Tile Hill and says demand has started to decline and he expects his site not to run out of fuel in the coming days. However, he says staff have kept a limit of Â£15 per driver and refuse to fill petrol cans. ""We have had a couple of kick offs already this morning because we are refusing jerry cans and then you get the foul-mouthed behaviour which is not acceptable,"" he says. A community nurse says she was left heartbroken when an elderly couple who have never spent a day apart weren't able to see each other because the husband couldn't get fuel to visit his wife in hospital. Jane Longhurst, who is 64 and works in Kent, says he called yesterday to say he couldn't come. ""He spoke with his wife on the phone and both were in tears,"" she says. ""This broke my heart."" Jane says she is concerned by what she calls the ""selfish"" attitude of those  panic-buying fuel. ""It has so much of an adverse effect and causes unnecessary anxiety for those that need fuel,"" she says. Her own journey to work takes 45 minutes each way - and she has been trying to find fuel on her days off to ensure she can get to work at the end of the week. ""I travelled locally to five different petrol stations, four had no fuel and at one the queue was exceptionally long,"" she says. ""I have about half a tank - I will be able to get to and from work on Friday but Iâd be mindful that on Saturday, I would get to work but I wouldnât get home."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Starmer to deliver pivotal speech to Labour conference,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gives his first speech to a full conference He says Labour under his leadership will not have an election manifesto ""that is not a serious plan for government"" There are heckles from the audience, to which he responds with ""shouting slogans, or changing lives?"" Sir Keir says rape and serious sexual assault cases will be fast-tracked under a Labour government And he pledges mental health spending would not be allowed to fall He focuses on education, calling for digital skills in schools and reinstating compulsory work experience He criticises Boris Johnson as ""a trivial man, a showman with nothing left to show"" The speech also focuses on science and research, with target investment of 3% of GDP He adds: ""Without a strong economy we cannot pay for the good society"" He finishes outlining his priorities: work, care, equality and security Edited by Johanna Howitt In his closing speech at the Labour conference in Brighton, Sir Starmer said he can provide the leadership the UK needs. We're going to end our coverage from Brighton. Our writers on board with you today were Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon. We'll be back next week when the conference caravan heads to Manchester for the Conservatives annual gathering. Thanks for following along with us. Boris Johnson returns to Manchester next week - the Conservatives last full conference was held there in 2019. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Reviews of the speech from the conference floor were largely but not universally positive. One union leader, for example, praised him for ""regaining issues from the Tories that should always have been ours"". Meanwhile a prominent figure on the left who had backed him for leader said the
speech was ""somehow long yet incomplete"". They said that while it was aimed 'narrowly' at swing
voters, there were omissions which could have been party-pleasing without
alienating a wider electorate such as a call for more rapid global vaccination. But the speech was designed to demonstrate that Labour was
returning to a focus om mainstream issues - such as health and education - which were the
priorities of thesceptical voters Keir Starmer met in the summer. But while
some of his priorities are similar to the last Labour government, some of the
policies are not. There is some radicalism beneath the reassuring rhetoric particularly on employment rights which are some distance
away from Tony Blair's flexible labour market. So what did the speech set out to achieve? Here are five aims:  Now, of course, whether in political jargon these have
'landed' will down to voters and not the conference delegates to decide. Away from the policy and announcements there were several  key moments in Keir Starmer's speech. So what else did he say?  Sir Keir Starmer said that a Labour government would: After his speech, journalists got to question Starmer's team about his performance. Asked about that handful of hecklers interrupting the speech, they said it was ""clear some people this week
havenât accepted the change Keir wanted to bring to party and that was borne out in
hall "". But they said it was only a small number of people and ""it didn't knock him off his stride... or distract him"". They added: ""Starmer delivered the speech in an optimistic, confident tone."" Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden has accused Labour of spending ""five days talking to themselves about themselves instead of to the country"". ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan,"" he said. ""From resignations in the middle of their own conference, to their union backers deserting them, to disrupting their leader's speech, Labour are too preoccupied fighting amongst themselves to put forward a plan for our country."" The conference hall welcomes the Labour leader to the stage Keir Starmer begun his speech by welcoming back ex-MP Louise Ellman - she quit the party over anti-Semitism He also paid tribute to campaigners Doreen Lawrence (L) and Penny and John Clough The shadow cabinet showed their support... ... but the Labour leader's speech was interrupted throughout with heckles from the conference floor... ...and some tried to show Keir Starmer the red card. But party leaders can usually rely on support from their partners. Victoria Starmer joined her husband on stage at the end of his speech. Reality Check On fuel
shortages, Keir Starmer told his party conference: âA tank of fuel already
costs Â£10 more than it did at the start of the year.â Thatâs
about right. In the first week of the year,external, the average UK price for a litre of petrol was about
115p, while diesel was about 120p a litre, according to government figures. The
latest figure is 135p for petrol and 138p for diesel. So you
would need a fuel tank of about 50 litres, which is a pretty normal midsize
car, to be paying Â£10 more for a tankful. Another union takes a very different approach, calling out Sir Keir and his speech. The national political lead of Unite, Rob MacGregor, says there ""wasn't much"" for its members worried about fuel shortages, the end of furlough and fire and rehire tactics. He adds: ""We needed to hear a Labour leader who is as angry as we are about the harm being done to our workers, as as determined as Unite to stand up against abusive employers. ""We're clearly not there yet."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The speech was peppered with attempts to meld
Keir Starmer's back story to his ambitions for the future, rather than simply using his CV to introduce himself to
voters. When talking about violence against women he shows that
he can be emotional as well as determined, using a heart-wrenching case to commit to tougher sentences. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Ben McGowan was pleased with Starmer's vision The buzz around the conference as people start to pack up there bags is mostly positive. Ben McGowan said the speech was ""good"" and he saw it as progress on Starmer's predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. ""It was the first time we were able to see him and get a clear vision of what he was about,"" he said. ""He was confident and he just came up with things that sounded like we could win. It may not have been policy heavy, but it was a vision that I think will get through to the public."" We will have to wait and see about that at the ballot box... Christina McAnea praises Starmer and his speech The general secretary of Unison, Christina
McAnea, says Starmer's Labour was ""offering just what the country needs after 11 years of Tory mismanagement"". Responding to the speech, the union leader adds: ""Communities
across the UK are struggling on so many levels. ""Keir's speech shows that Labour
in power could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government. ""This is a serious plan for change."" Reality Check Keir
Starmer told his party conference: âOver 11 years of Tory government, we have
lost more than 8,000 police officers.â Themost recent figures,externalwe have for full-time equivalent police officers in England
and Wales is from 31 March this year, when there were 135,301. Thatâs
8,433 fewer than the figure for 31 March 2010, which was just over a month
before the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to
power. At the low-point in
2018, the figure was almost 20,000 officers below the 2010 level. The
government promised in 2019 to recruit 20,000 more police officers by 2023,
which would return numbers close to their 2010 levels. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Saranya Thambirajah disliked the ""rhetoric"" around the police in Starmer's speech But not everyone was thrilled with the policies outlined by Sir Keir Starmer - especially his call for more police on the streets. I spoke to one woman in tears about that element, in light oftoday's news around the murder of Sarah Everardand her killer, who was a police officer. She said: ""I don't feel safe, and right now I am scared of the police. I don't want to hear about having more of them, especially today."" Another woman I spoke to, Saranya Thambirajah, felt a similar way. ""There was a lot of rhetoric on crime and I don't think it is appropriate after the year we have had, with Black Lives Matter, attacks on women, and what we have found out about Sarah Everard's murder,"" she added. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Andi and Isabelle say they loved the speech Two other delegates thrilled with the speech were Andi Hopgood and Isabelle Gutierrez, who are both members of the Musicians' Union. Andi, who is a music teacher, said: ""I loved it! I have never heard someone talk so passionately about getting music and instruments to every child in school. ""Education should be creative. It is not just about science and technology!"" Isabelle added: ""I loved it too. It was great to hear us sounding like a government in waiting again."" From the conference floor... Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin was impressed Former Labour MP turned West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin was thrilled with Starmer's performance, calling it ""powerful"". She told me: ""He laid out his vision and really differentiated between a Conservative government and what he would look like in power. ""I feel really safe in his hands with his experience, and I loved us talking about being in government - it has been a while!"" Sir Keir Starmer has told Labour's conference his principles are work, care, equality and security, which are the ""tools of my trade"". The party leader closed his conference speech to a standing ovation â following earlier heckling â saying these values ""take you right to the heart of the British public"". This video can not be played Starmer closes his 2021 Labour Party conference speech Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent âEducation is so important I am tempted to say it three times,â Sir
Keir Starmer told the Labour party conference. That knowing nod to Labourâs mantra under Tony Blair was a sign of
an education policy shifting back towards the centre ground. Sir Keir warned of 200,000 primary pupils growing up in areas where
there were no schools rated good or outstanding. Those ratings are given by Ofsted - and at the last general
election Labour was promising to scrap the inspection service. That has now changed to a plan to âreformâ Ofsted. There was also
no sign of other previous policies such as scrapping Sats tests or clipping the
wings of academies and free schools. There will be a âNational Excellence Programmeâ - and the language
again has echoes of Labourâs years in office, when the bedrock of its policy
was on raising standards. Warning that the pandemic had seen the attainment gap widening
between rich and poor pupils, the Labour leader promised âthe most ambitious
school improvement plan in a generationâ. He promised Labour would focus on preparing young people for work,
including digital skills. It was an appeal to parents that Labour was now forward-looking in
education rather than inward-looking, keen on hi-tech skills and summoning up
the spirit of the âwhite heat of technologyâ. âI want every parent in the country to be able to send their child
to a great state school,â he told the conference. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the heckles were ""awful"" but the ""vast majority"" of the audience wanted to hear Starmer's message. She says people could see in the speech saw what drives Starmer and what he would be like as a prime minister. ""Here is a guy who you would trust your kids and your house with,"" she says. She acknowledges Labour ""got absolutely hammered at the last election"" but says Starmer's speech demonstrated: ""We are a party not of protest but of government.""

shortages, Keir Starmer told his party conference: âA tank of fuel already
costs Â£10 more than it did at the start of the year.â Thatâs
about right. In the first week of the year,external, the average UK price for a litre of petrol was about
115p, while diesel was about 120p a litre, according to government figures. The
latest figure is 135p for petrol and 138p for diesel. So you
would need a fuel tank of about 50 litres, which is a pretty normal midsize
car, to be paying Â£10 more for a tankful. Another union takes a very different approach, calling out Sir Keir and his speech. The national political lead of Unite, Rob MacGregor, says there ""wasn't much"" for its members worried about fuel shortages, the end of furlough and fire and rehire tactics. He adds: ""We needed to hear a Labour leader who is as angry as we are about the harm being done to our workers, as as determined as Unite to stand up against abusive employers. ""We're clearly not there yet."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The speech was peppered with attempts to meld
Keir Starmer's back story to his ambitions for the future, rather than simply using his CV to introduce himself to
voters. When talking about violence against women he shows that
he can be emotional as well as determined, using a heart-wrenching case to commit to tougher sentences. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Ben McGowan was pleased with Starmer's vision The buzz around the conference as people start to pack up there bags is mostly positive. Ben McGowan said the speech was ""good"" and he saw it as progress on Starmer's predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. ""It was the first time we were able to see him and get a clear vision of what he was about,"" he said. ""He was confident and he just came up with things that sounded like we could win. It may not have been policy heavy, but it was a vision that I think will get through to the public."" We will have to wait and see about that at the ballot box... Christina McAnea praises Starmer and his speech The general secretary of Unison, Christina
McAnea, says Starmer's Labour was ""offering just what the country needs after 11 years of Tory mismanagement"". Responding to the speech, the union leader adds: ""Communities

in power could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government. ""This is a serious plan for change."" Reality Check Keir
Starmer told his party conference: âOver 11 years of Tory government, we have
lost more than 8,000 police officers.â Themost recent figures,externalwe have for full-time equivalent police officers in England
and Wales is from 31 March this year, when there were 135,301. Thatâs
8,433 fewer than the figure for 31 March 2010, which was just over a month
before the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to
power. At the low-point in
2018, the figure was almost 20,000 officers below the 2010 level. The
government promised in 2019 to recruit 20,000 more police officers by 2023,
which would return numbers close to their 2010 levels. Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News Saranya Thambirajah disliked the ""rhetoric"" around the police in Starmer's speech But not everyone was thrilled with the policies outlined by Sir Keir Starmer - especially his call for more police on the streets.

She said: ""I don't feel safe, and right now I am scared of the police. I don't want to hear about having more of them, especially today."" Another woman I spoke to, Saranya Thambirajah, felt a similar way. ""There was a lot of rhetoric on crime and I don't think it is appropriate after the year we have had, with Black Lives Matter, attacks on women, and what we have found out about Sarah Everard's murder,"" she added.

"I'll get Labour back in business, promises StarmerThe Labour leader will pledge more money for schools and mental health in his big conference speech.","This video can not be played Starmer's party conference message to PM: ""Get a grip or get out of the way"" Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a ""serious plan for government"", in a speech to his party conference. He said the country faced a ""big moment"" that ""demands leadership"" - and as prime minister he would provide it. Sir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values. He got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers. Sir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"", to cheers from other delegates. Keir Starmer's Labour conference speech fact-checked Five things we learned from Labour conference Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour members back Â£15 minimum wage amid row After a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic. ""These are big issues, but our politics is so small,"" he told delegates. ""So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge."" The 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid. Addressing a packed auditorium, he said he would ""not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today"" and called Labour a party of ""patriots"". He spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. Sir Keir described his parents as ""the two rocks of my life"", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a ""deep respect for the dignity of work"". He contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a ""trickster"", a ""trivial man"" and a ""showman with nothing left to show"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is heckled as he delivers his speech With Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn. While he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: ""We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government. ""It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust."" By contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times. ""You want levelling up?,"" he asked. ""That's levelling up."" At the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: ""I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me."" Sir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. In an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. Persistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. There were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. The speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again. It was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street. Moving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum ""Band-C"" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others. The changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households Â£400 a year in bills on average, he promised. Other pledges in the speech included: Providing mental treatment within a month for all people in England who require it Creating 8,500 more specialist mental health staff, providing an extra million people a year with help Training ""thousands"" of extra teachers in England - his aides did not provide a more specific figure Reforming the inspection body Ofsted to focus more on improving struggling schools ""I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,"" Sir Keir said. ""So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election."" Sir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised. On Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour. The next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership. And delegatesvoted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry,despite Sir Keir ruling this out. The leader also angered the left when he pushed throughchanges to the way Labour elects its leaders. Reacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had ""identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions"". ""We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,"" it added. The trade union Unite said there ""wasn't much"" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights. But Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated ""vision"" and shown the party ""could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government"", adding: ""This is a serious plan for change"". Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan.

Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard before murder,"Four members of Ms Everard's family were in court to hear the pleas Sarah Everard was handcuffed by her murderer as he pretended to arrest her for breaching Covid guidelines. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining Ms Everard, 33, putting her in his hire car and driving away. His sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey was told that her ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The 48-year-old had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Ms Everard was handcuffed at 21:34 GMT and four minutes later she was being driven to Dover, where Couzens transferred her to his own car. Couzens then drove to a remote rural area he knew well, where he raped Ms Everard. The sexual predator had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prosecutor Tom Little QC said Couzens must have taken Ms Everard's mobile phone from her and removed the sim card, which he tried to destroy. Ms Everard was described by a former long-term boyfriend as ""extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise"" and ""not a gullible person"", the court heard. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? He could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know ""unless by force or manipulation"", Mr Little said. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car, but they ""assumed Ms Everard must have done something wrong"", the court was told. Couzens owned a patch of land in Hoads Wood, where he burned Ms Everard's body One of the witnesses described a woman on the pavement who appeared to have her left arm behind her back and ""was in the process of giving her other arm behind her back"" as a man in dark clothing handcuffed her. Mr Little said they believed they were witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman. The exact time Ms Everard was killed could not be determined, although she was dead - strangled with Couzens' police belt - by about 02:30 on 4 March, when he stopped for snacks at a service station. He then visited Hoads Wood near Ashford, Kent, leaving just before sunrise. Later that morning, he threw Ms Everard's mobile phone into a channel at Sandwich, where it was found by a police diver. Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey wearing a dark suit Wayne Couzens shuffled into court his head bowed. Wearing a dark blue suit he confirmed his name. Sarah's parents, and other family members, are in court listening to horrendous details about their daughter's kidnap, rape and murder. In the public gallery many of her friends have also come to court to support them. Three members of her family will read out statements this afternoon about how her murder has affected them. The prosecutor said her murder was reported on social media as #shewasonlywalkinghome but the more appropriate five words to describe what Couzens did were ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation and fire"". A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. Mr Little said: ""The defendant's plot of land is very close to, and in the same woods, where he was to burn Sarah Everard's body after he had murdered her. ""He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task to a pond deeper into the woods, but which was only about 130 metres from his plot."" The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer wiped his phone just minutes before he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, on 9 March. Couzens, who pleaded guilty in July to Ms Everard's murder, will be sentenced at the end of the two-day hearing. Lord Justice Fulford will consider whether to hand down a whole-life term.

Ahead of the Couzens sentencing hearing, the Met Police issued a statement that said: ""We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for.

Is the fuel crisis improving?,"Only 127 petrol tanker drivers from the EU have applied for temporary visas to help tackle the petrol crisis, according to the prime minister. The government is offering 300 short-term visas for overseas drivers. Meanwhile, military personnel have started driving fuel tankers to help resupply petrol stations. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says the worst-affected areas have seen a ""marginal"" improvement but still face a ""challenging"" time. It said about a fifth of forecourts in London and south-east England were out of fuel on Monday. But elsewhere in Britain, that figure was 8% and there had been a ""marked"" improvement, the association said. Last week the government said it would offertemporary visas for 5,000 overseas HGV drivers- including 300 immediate visas for tanker drivers. But Boris Johnson told BBC Breakfast that so faronly 127 European Union fuel drivers have appliedfor the scheme. He said the low number of applicants reflected a ""global"" issue causing ""a particular problem in the UK"". He blamed long-standing underinvestment in pay and driver facilities. Separately, about 200 Army and RAF personnel - including 100 drivers -will help deliver fuelto forecourts in the hardest-hit areas, including London and south-east England. They have been given training in safety procedures, equipment and forecourt driving manoeuvres. Other measures include: A suspension of competition law between oil firms, which the government said would make it easier for companies to share information and prioritise areas most in need The process for getting an HGV driver licence will be sped up,external, and nearly one million letters have been sent to existing HGV drivers to encourage them back into the industry, plus there are plans to train 4,000 others The doctors' body the BMA, the teachers' union NASUWT and some politicians including London Mayor Sadiq Khan wantedkey workers to be given priority accessto petrol stations to avoid disruption to essential services. However, the government hasn't announced plans to prioritise key workers as it didwith nursery and school places during the pandemic,external. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis The government has powers to limit how much fuel drivers can buy, and the hours when they can buy it, but hasn't used them so far. Some petrol stations have introduced a Â£30 cap on the amount of petrol people can buy. Petrol station worker: 'We're not trained for this' Driver 'pulls knife' during fuel dispute On 23 September,BP warned it would have to ""temporarily"" close a handful of its petrol stations, because of a lack of drivers. Long queues started to build up outside stations across Great Britain in the following days, amid fears that fuel might run out. Oil companies have stressed there is plenty of petrol available. However, the key issue is there aren't enough drivers to deliver it to forecourts. There's an estimated shortage of more than 100,000 HGV drivers, which has already caused problems for a range of retailers - from supermarkets to fast food chains. Fuel tanker driversneed additional safety qualifications,externalon top of their HGV licence to be able to transport chemicals such as petrol. There are a number of reasons - and many countries across Europe have been affected - but the UK has been especially badly hit. After Brexit, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or moved elsewhere, because working in the UK involved additional border bureaucracy which had an impact on their income. The pandemic saw even more drivers return to their home countries, with few coming back. Meanwhile, some older drivers have retired, and there's a huge backlog in HGV driver tests due to Covid. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Petrol pricesare at an eight-year high,external. According to the latest weekly statistics, the average petrol price at UK forecourts on Monday was 136.1p a litre, up from 135.19p a week earlier. The price of a litre of diesel rose 137.95p to 139.2p over the same period. Simon Williams of the RAC said the increase was largely down to the rising price of oil rather than the recent supply problems.

"Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard before murderWayne Couzens is in court for a sentencing hearing, where he could be given a whole-life prison term.London","Four members of Ms Everard's family were in court to hear the pleas Sarah Everard was handcuffed by her murderer as he pretended to arrest her for breaching Covid guidelines. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining Ms Everard, 33, putting her in his hire car and driving away. His sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey was told that her ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The 48-year-old had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Ms Everard was handcuffed at 21:34 GMT and four minutes later she was being driven to Dover, where Couzens transferred her to his own car. Couzens then drove to a remote rural area he knew well, where he raped Ms Everard. The sexual predator had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prosecutor Tom Little QC said Couzens must have taken Ms Everard's mobile phone from her and removed the sim card, which he tried to destroy. Ms Everard was described by a former long-term boyfriend as ""extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise"" and ""not a gullible person"", the court heard. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? He could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know ""unless by force or manipulation"", Mr Little said. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car, but they ""assumed Ms Everard must have done something wrong"", the court was told. Couzens owned a patch of land in Hoads Wood, where he burned Ms Everard's body One of the witnesses described a woman on the pavement who appeared to have her left arm behind her back and ""was in the process of giving her other arm behind her back"" as a man in dark clothing handcuffed her. Mr Little said they believed they were witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman. The exact time Ms Everard was killed could not be determined, although she was dead - strangled with Couzens' police belt - by about 02:30 on 4 March, when he stopped for snacks at a service station. He then visited Hoads Wood near Ashford, Kent, leaving just before sunrise. Later that morning, he threw Ms Everard's mobile phone into a channel at Sandwich, where it was found by a police diver.

"Army will be delivering fuel in days - ministerThe business secretary denies there is a crisis in supplies and says the situation is ""stabilising"".","This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said.

Concern over neurologist's contacts with patientThe consultant Dr Michael Watt is at the centre of Northern Ireland's biggest ever patient recall.,"Dr Michael Watt is at the centre of Northern Ireland's biggest patient recall Interactions with a patient by former Belfast Trust neurologist Dr Michael Watt have raised serious concerns, according to a medical ethics expert. London-based barrister Daniel Sokol has reviewed evidence obtained by BBC Spotlight, including text messages between Dr Watt and the woman that were sent between 2017 and 2020. Concerns over Dr Watt's clinical practice at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital promptedthe biggest ever patient recall in Northern Irelandin 2018. His work and its oversight is the subject of three ongoing high-level inquiries. WATCH: Patient Recall, The Search for Answers Spotlight has asked Dr Watt for his account of his interactions but his solicitor told us Dr Watt's mental health had worsened over the past two years and he could not respond. The woman, Jane, whose identity Spotlight has chosen not to reveal, first met Dr Watt in 2002. He diagnosed her with epilepsy. Jane had suffered a miscarriage in the 1990s and later discovered tissue from her baby had been kept at the Royal Victoria Hospital without her knowledge. She said she was traumatised and did not want to go back to the hospital. She told Spotlight she then met Dr Watt in coffee shops and, for a time, the meetings were also medical consultations. Barrister Daniel Sokol said: ""A coffee shop is somewhere where you go and meet friends. It's not somewhere where you go and see a doctor. ""It's difficult in such a location to maintain privacy, it's difficult to maintain confidentiality. I think it does suggest a lapse of judgement on the part of the doctor here."" Jane told Spotlight that after a meeting with him in 2016, Dr Watt kissed her on the lips. She said although she felt the kiss was inappropriate, she laughed it off because she did not like confrontation and still needed Dr Watt as her neurologist. Recall neurologist will not appear at inquiry Fifth of neurologist's patients misdiagnosed Dr Michael Watt inquiry is given public status Mr Sokol said all medical codes of conduct forbid a doctor pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with a patient. ""Kissing on the lips clearly is an overstepping of the boundary - in fact it's not an overstepping, the boundary is a tiny line in the distance."" Dr Watt worked at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital as a neurologist Later in 2016, a GP raised a red flag over Dr Watt's care. Then in June 2017, the neurologist was withdrawn from seeing patients. Spotlight has obtained texts Dr Watt exchanged with Jane between October 2017 and January 2020. Mr Sokol told Spotlight he believes that even though Dr Watt was withdrawn from patient care during the period covered by the texts, he should have been behaving as though 'Jane' was still his patient. ""It appears this patient wants to re-establish the relationship, the therapeutic relationship, as soon as it's permitted and so therefore this doctor should treat this individual as a patient."" The messages show Dr Watt inviting Jane to his house when he is alone, adding ""entirely safe"" and ""and no funny business x"" via text message. According to Jane, the ""no funny business"" meant ""basically he won't attempt to kiss me again as he had done previously"", which she did not trust would be the case, declining his invitation. Dr Watt exchanged a number of texts with Jane (reconstruction of actual text) Having reviewed the text exchange, Mr Sokol said that Jane could be considered vulnerable and dependent on Dr Watt and it was ""particularly troubling"" that Dr Watt had insisted she come to his house, saying at one point ""oh go on"". But it's messages Dr Watt exchanged with Jane in the summer of 2019 that are most extraordinary. At that time, patients and their families were anxiously awaiting a delayed report on the recall of patients, unaware it had been postponed because Dr Watt had been assessed as at risk of suicide. He texted Jane around the time of that assessment, firstly indicating that he was off sick for financial reasons. ""Still hanging together. Now off on sick to try and prevent the buggers stopping paying me,"" he wrote. Reconstruction of actual text Dr Watt then mentioned to Jane that he had upcoming appointments with occupational health and psychiatry. Then, a couple of weeks later, he sent the most extraordinary message of all after Jane texted to ask him how those appointments had gone. ""They've concluded a significant risk of me topping myself and have postponed the publication of the recall results,"" he wrote, followed by two 'crying with laughter' emojis. We asked Dr Watt for his account of all of the text exchanges but his solicitor said the deterioration in his mental health over the past two years left him unable to respond. So while Spotlight has seen the text messages, we only have 'Jane's' account of the circumstances and not Dr Watt's. And it's important to remember that a single text message does not provide a clear and detailed insight into Dr Watt's mental state either then or now. Spotlight showed some messages from summer 2019 to Therese Ward, a former patient of Dr Watt, who, like others, has been anxiously awaiting the publication of the recall results. ""It's just incredible. That he would put in a message, in a Whatsapp message to a former patient, that there was 'a significant risk of me topping myself and have postponed the publication of the recall results' and he laughs. ""He is laughing at us patients. I find that outrageous, absolutely outrageous that he finds this funny."" In a statement, Dr Watt's former employer, the Belfast Trust, said it was co-operating with all inquiries related to Dr Watt's care and would ensure the matters raised by Spotlight would be brought to the attention of all relevant bodies.

Concerns over Dr Watt's clinical practice at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital promptedthe biggest ever patient recall in Northern Irelandin 2018. His work and its oversight is the subject of three ongoing high-level inquiries. WATCH: Patient Recall, The Search for Answers Spotlight has asked Dr Watt for his account of his interactions but his solicitor told us Dr Watt's mental health had worsened over the past two years and he could not respond. The woman, Jane, whose identity Spotlight has chosen not to reveal, first met Dr Watt in 2002. He diagnosed her with epilepsy. Jane had suffered a miscarriage in the 1990s and later discovered tissue from her baby had been kept at the Royal Victoria Hospital without her knowledge. She said she was traumatised and did not want to go back to the hospital. She told Spotlight she then met Dr Watt in coffee shops and, for a time, the meetings were also medical consultations. Barrister Daniel Sokol said: ""A coffee shop is somewhere where you go and meet friends. It's not somewhere where you go and see a doctor. ""It's difficult in such a location to maintain privacy, it's difficult to maintain confidentiality. I think it does suggest a lapse of judgement on the part of the doctor here."" Jane told Spotlight that after a meeting with him in 2016, Dr Watt kissed her on the lips. She said although she felt the kiss was inappropriate, she laughed it off because she did not like confrontation and still needed Dr Watt as her neurologist. Recall neurologist will not appear at inquiry Fifth of neurologist's patients misdiagnosed Dr Michael Watt inquiry is given public status Mr Sokol said all medical codes of conduct forbid a doctor pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with a patient. ""Kissing on the lips clearly is an overstepping of the boundary - in fact it's not an overstepping, the boundary is a tiny line in the distance."" Dr Watt worked at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital as a neurologist Later in 2016, a GP raised a red flag over Dr Watt's care. Then in June 2017, the neurologist was withdrawn from seeing patients. Spotlight has obtained texts Dr Watt exchanged with Jane between October 2017 and January 2020. Mr Sokol told Spotlight he believes that even though Dr Watt was withdrawn from patient care during the period covered by the texts, he should have been behaving as though 'Jane' was still his patient. ""It appears this patient wants to re-establish the relationship, the therapeutic relationship, as soon as it's permitted and so therefore this doctor should treat this individual as a patient."" The messages show Dr Watt inviting Jane to his house when he is alone, adding ""entirely safe"" and ""and no funny business x"" via text message. According to Jane, the ""no funny business"" meant ""basically he won't attempt to kiss me again as he had done previously"", which she did not trust would be the case, declining his invitation. Dr Watt exchanged a number of texts with Jane (reconstruction of actual text) Having reviewed the text exchange, Mr Sokol said that Jane could be considered vulnerable and dependent on Dr Watt and it was ""particularly troubling"" that Dr Watt had insisted she come to his house, saying at one point ""oh go on"". But it's messages Dr Watt exchanged with Jane in the summer of 2019 that are most extraordinary. At that time, patients and their families were anxiously awaiting a delayed report on the recall of patients, unaware it had been postponed because Dr Watt had been assessed as at risk of suicide. He texted Jane around the time of that assessment, firstly indicating that he was off sick for financial reasons. ""Still hanging together. Now off on sick to try and prevent the buggers stopping paying me,"" he wrote. Reconstruction of actual text Dr Watt then mentioned to Jane that he had upcoming appointments with occupational health and psychiatry. Then, a couple of weeks later, he sent the most extraordinary message of all after Jane texted to ask him how those appointments had gone. ""They've concluded a significant risk of me topping myself and have postponed the publication of the recall results,"" he wrote, followed by two 'crying with laughter' emojis. We asked Dr Watt for his account of all of the text exchanges but his solicitor said the deterioration in his mental health over the past two years left him unable to respond. So while Spotlight has seen the text messages, we only have 'Jane's' account of the circumstances and not Dr Watt's. And it's important to remember that a single text message does not provide a clear and detailed insight into Dr Watt's mental state either then or now. Spotlight showed some messages from summer 2019 to Therese Ward, a former patient of Dr Watt, who, like others, has been anxiously awaiting the publication of the recall results. ""It's just incredible. That he would put in a message, in a Whatsapp message to a former patient, that there was 'a significant risk of me topping myself and have postponed the publication of the recall results' and he laughs. ""He is laughing at us patients. I find that outrageous, absolutely outrageous that he finds this funny."" In a statement, Dr Watt's former employer, the Belfast Trust, said it was co-operating with all inquiries related to Dr Watt's care and would ensure the matters raised by Spotlight would be brought to the attention of all relevant bodies.

Couzens in court for Everard murder sentencing,"Four members of Ms Everard's family were in court to hear the pleas Sarah Everard was handcuffed by her murderer as he pretended to arrest her for breaching Covid guidelines. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Couzens showed his warrant card before restraining Ms Everard, 33, putting her in his hire car and driving away. His sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey was told that her ordeal could be summarised as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire"". The 48-year-old had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Ms Everard was handcuffed at 21:34 GMT and four minutes later she was being driven to Dover, where Couzens transferred her to his own car. Couzens then drove to a remote rural area he knew well, where he raped Ms Everard. The sexual predator had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prosecutor Tom Little QC said Couzens must have taken Ms Everard's mobile phone from her and removed the sim card, which he tried to destroy. Ms Everard was described by a former long-term boyfriend as ""extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise"" and ""not a gullible person"", the court heard. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? He could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know ""unless by force or manipulation"", Mr Little said. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car, but they ""assumed Ms Everard must have done something wrong"", the court was told. Couzens owned a patch of land in Hoads Wood, where he burned Ms Everard's body One of the witnesses described a woman on the pavement who appeared to have her left arm behind her back and ""was in the process of giving her other arm behind her back"" as a man in dark clothing handcuffed her. Mr Little said they believed they were witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman. The exact time Ms Everard was killed could not be determined, although she was dead - strangled with Couzens' police belt - by about 02:30 on 4 March, when he stopped for snacks at a service station. He then visited Hoads Wood near Ashford, Kent, leaving just before sunrise. Later that morning, he threw Ms Everard's mobile phone into a channel at Sandwich, where it was found by a police diver. Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey wearing a dark suit Wayne Couzens shuffled into court his head bowed. Wearing a dark blue suit he confirmed his name. Sarah's parents, and other family members, are in court listening to horrendous details about their daughter's kidnap, rape and murder. In the public gallery many of her friends have also come to court to support them. Three members of her family will read out statements this afternoon about how her murder has affected them. The prosecutor said her murder was reported on social media as #shewasonlywalkinghome but the more appropriate five words to describe what Couzens did were ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation and fire"". A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Her body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags. The court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods. Mr Little said: ""The defendant's plot of land is very close to, and in the same woods, where he was to burn Sarah Everard's body after he had murdered her. ""He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task to a pond deeper into the woods, but which was only about 130 metres from his plot."" The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer wiped his phone just minutes before he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, on 9 March. Couzens, who pleaded guilty in July to Ms Everard's murder, will be sentenced at the end of the two-day hearing. Lord Justice Fulford will consider whether to hand down a whole-life term. A tent was set up as police searched woodland near Great Chart, Kent The case prompted national outrage and sparked protests about violence against women, particularly as walking was one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country shared stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled and assaulted; and a number of vigils were held in honour of Ms Everard and to raise concerns about the safety of women. A vigil held on Clapham Commonled to the Met Police being accused of heavy-handedness for its tactics. Ahead of the Couzens sentencing hearing, the Met Police issued a statement that said: ""We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for. ""Our thoughts are with Sarah's family and her many friends. It is not possible for us to imagine what they are going through."" Couzens wassacked by the forcein July.

Firmus gas prices to rise by a thirdIt will mean the average household bill in the greater Belfast area will rise by Â£182 a year.Northern Ireland,"More than 50,000 customers will be affected, with the average household bill set to increase by Â£182 a year Gas supplier firmus energy has announced that tariffs in the Greater Belfast Network will increase by 32.98%. The change will take effect from 22 October. More than 50,000 customers will be affected by the increase, with the average household bill set to increase by Â£182 a year. Firmus energy said the move was due to global gas commodity prices increasing by 200% since the beginning of April. Wednesday'sannouncement comes after a tariff increasein April. The Greater Belfast Network area covers Belfast, Lisburn, Bangor, Holywood, Donaghadee, Larne, Groomsport, Millisle, Newtownards, Carryduff, Comber, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus, and east Down. Firmus Managing director Michael Scott apologised for the price rise, which he said was down to the huge increases in the cost of purchasing natural gas on the global markets. ""It is simply unavoidable, as these costs are totally beyond our control,"" he said. ""With the world starting to reopen again, following the Covid-19 restrictions, this is leading to increased demand for natural gas and that has been driving the prices up. ""We will continue to monitor and review our tariffs to ensure customers are getting the best prices possible. Mr Scott acknowledged the increase would hit customers ""at a particularly difficult time for many"", and said Firmus was committed to working with consumer bodies to support its customers, especially over the winter months. Raymond Gormley, head of energy policy at the Consumer Council, said that while the price rise was expected ""it makes it no less challenging for household budgets to absorb"". ""Gas consumers in the Belfast area have the opportunity to switch supplier and the Consumer Council would encourage customers to check they have the best deal before 21 October when the opt-out period ends,"" said Mr Gormley in a statement. ""We would encourage all consumers to think about ways they can reduce their energy costs. Switching payment option, changing billing method or switching supplier can save some money."" Mr Gormley added that customers struggling with their energy bills should contact their supplier directly for help. The announcement came as EirGrid, which operates the electricity grids in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland has warned of a ""challenging"" winter,saying low availability of power plants continued to be a concern. Energy prices have continued to rise significantly with many households set to pay more for electricity and heating this winter. Firmus energy hasalready announced a 35% price increasefor customers in its Ten Towns Network.

Family want memorial at police station retained,"A memorial to Joanne forms part of Warrenpoint police station's external wall The family of a woman killed by an IRA bomb beside Warrenpoint police station want assurances a memorial to her will stay in place after the station is sold. Joanne Reilly, a civilian, died in the blast in the County Down town in April 1989. The 20-year-old had been working in an adjacent hardware store on Charlotte Street when the bomb went off. A memorial to Joanne has since formed part of the station's external wall. The Reilly family's solicitor says the family want assurances it will remain in place no matter what the former station becomes once it is sold. ""The Reilly family want Joanne's memorial to remain in situ, in perpetuity and in their ownership,"" said Rosemary Connolly. This video can not be played Solicitor Rosemary Connolly said the Reilly family would like a commitment soon as possible ""A commitment has already been made to that effect some years ago that the memorial will be transferred into the ownership of the Reilly family. ""They want it to remain where it is and they would like that commitment to be delivered on as soon as possible."" The issue of what becomes of memorials at former police stations took centre stage after the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) announced in August that it intended to close Crossmaglen station in south Armagh. Supt Norman Haslett, the Newry, Mourne and Down district commander, said there were also three memorials dedicated to fallen police officers located within the former police station. ""As with any station closure, disposal or redevelopment, there is a requirement to consider how best to manage the transition of these memorials,"" he said. ""Any proposals for the relocation and re-dedication of the memorials currently in Warrenpoint police station will be handled properly, with sensitivity and in full consultation with the respective families of those who are commemorated."" Barbara McGinn, from the Community Centre for Warrenpoint campaign group, was surprised when initial plans to sell the station fell through The former Warrenpoint station has been closed for more than five years. Initially the PSNI had been in negotiations with Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, which wanted to build a community centre on the site. However, in 2018 the PSNI pulled out citing what it said was ""uncertainty surrounding Brexit"". This came as a shock to Barbara McGinn of the Community Centre for Warrenpoint campaign group. ""We were gutted as a group because we had done a lot of work with the council and the people in the town,"" she said. ""The public consultation was very popular and the PSNI site did come out on top. ""But then things happened. Brexit, customs. So we had to move on."" Three border police stations are back up for sale It was thought given its proximity to Warrenpoint port the site could become some form of post Brexit check facility. However, a site within the envelope of the port was later identified for this purpose. With the station now going back on the market there have been suggestions the council may revisit it as an option for its, as yet, unbuilt community centre. ""Absolutely not,"" said councillor Mickey Ruane of Sinn FÃ©in. ""The council very quickly, after we knew this site wasn't going to happen, moved on and we are now in Clonallen Park in the town. ""We are now at the stage where we are moving to appoint consultants for the design team and to go forward for planning, so we have no plans to look at this site even though it is back on the market again. ""We were surprised it's back on the market because we wrote to them not so long ago and they told us there were no plans for it."" The market will now determine what the former police station building becomes. But like in many other towns the past will be ever present when looking to the future.

Next warns of Christmas warehouse staff shortages,"Next has warned of price rises and staff shortages before Christmas unless immigration rules are eased. The High Street chain said some areas of its business were ""beginning to come under pressure"", including warehouse and logistics staffing. It blamed higher shipping costs, particularly for larger furniture items, for pushing up its prices. The Home Office said it was working with industry to ""understand how we can best ease particular pinch points"". Next urged the government to ""take a more decisive approach to the looming skills crisis"" and said that the lorry driver crisis was ""foreseen, and widely predicted"". The company's warning over potential staffing issues during the festive period was made in its half-year results, which showed profit before tax was up by 5.9% compared to 2019 levels. The company said rising shipping costs had driven up prices by about 2%, with its larger home products ""bearing the brunt of the increase"". It added that in the first half of next year it expected prices to increase by an average 2.5%, with homeware prices up 6%. Next chief executive Lord Wolfson said the firm was not currently having difficulties in recruiting staff for its stores, but warned warehouse and logistics staffing was ""beginning to come under pressure"". ""We anticipate that, without some relaxation of immigration rules, we are likely to experience some degradation in our service in the run up to Christmas,"" he said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? How many people are out of work? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? A government spokeswoman said: ""We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. ""The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment."" Many UK sectors, from fuel firms to supermarkets, have supply chain problems at the moment due to a chronic shortage of lorry drivers. The shortage in drivers in the UK is estimated to be about 100,000, according to industry bodies, with a long-term problem being made worse by the pandemic, tax changes, Brexit, and an ageing workforce. The recent supply chain problems led to the UK governmentannouncing it will grant temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers. Lord Wolfson was a strong advocate of Brexit in the run-up to the referendum, but he has been critical of the government's approach towards post-Brexit immigration. He has said the imposition of a minimum salary of Â£30,000 was a mistake. In a statement, Next added: ""The HGV crisis was foreseen, and widely predicted for many months. For the sake of the wider UK economy, we hope that the government will take a more decisive approach to the looming skill crisis in warehouses, restaurants, hotels, care homes, and many seasonal industries. ""A demand led approach to ensuring the country has the skills it needs is now vital."" The company's performance for the half year to July was largely fuelled by a surge in online revenue, with sales increasing by 52% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Lord Wolfson said the retail bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic was ""far stronger than we anticipated"". ""Sales in retail stores have done better than planned, while online sales have fallen back less than we expected. It appears that the wider economy has not suffered the long term damage many feared, for the moment at least. And, in particular, employment has held up well,"" he added.

The posts were written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and Claire Heald. Our live page will be coming to a close soon. But before we go, here's a round-up of the latest on the fuel supply crisis.  Read more in our story here We've been hearing that many in the industry and government believe the fuel supply issues will ease now that a lot of people have filled up their cars. That's because it's difficult, and dangerous, to store fuel. Steve Duffield, from the Humberside Rescue Service, says if you're storing canisters at home, you're taking a risk. ""Petrol is inherently a dangerous substance, itâs a highly flammable liquid, it gives off vapours that can be very very easily ignited and any leak of that petrol can lead to obviously, from our perspective, a serious fire and potentially an explosion,"" he says. The RAC says the fuel supply issue is ""improving"" - but the situation for drivers has not yet returned to normal. Spokesman Simon Williams says: âWhile fuel deliveries to forecourts have yet to return to normal, our latest breakdown data points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside."" He says there were ""huge increases"" in such breakdowns between Sunday and Monday, but this fell by 40% from Monday to Tuesday. He adds: ""While the numbers are still higher than weâd normally expect to see, itâs definitely a positive sign. ""Our patrols continue to work hard to keep drivers moving."" One of our reporters, BBC Scotland's Sarah Toom, visited 15 filling stations across Glasgow this morning. Of these, she says  four were closed completely because they had no fuel while several others had diesel but no petrol. One teacher told her he had finally managed to find petrol after visiting five other filling stations - all of which had run out. However, Sarah says she saw no sign of panic-buying or queuing, despite being out and about during morning rush-hour. And there seems to be a mixed picture across much of the rest of the country, with reports of some petrol stations being completely dry while others close-by are operating as normal. Find out more about the situation in Scotland here. Graham Swain, from Sheffield, tells the BBC his mum has been diagnosed with cancer - but he was unable to visit her in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire over the weekend because none of the filling stations he tried on Saturday morning had fuel left. ""This was at 5:30 in the morning,"" he tells the BBC. ""I tried nine stations and one did have petrol but no diesel, which I need. I tried again about six hours later and alas still no luck."" He adds: ""I have still not been able to fill my car at all. I'm almost dry and need to do school trips. I have no idea what to do."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to say fuel deliveries are ""well above normal"" and supplies are ""stabilising"". ""We can all do our bit by filling up only when actually required,""he says,external. Shapps quotes the Petrol Retailers Association figures that we reported earlier - only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. This has fallen from two-thirds of its members saying they were out on Sunday. BBC Radio Shropshire Shropshire Blood Bikes say they've kept their service going partly thanks to the good will of other drivers. Volunteers at the charity courier urgent blood products to NHS hospitals across three counties. Chris Hyde, from the charity, said some experiences on the forecourts have been heart-warming. ""We have had a number of instances where we've approached the queue, and motorists have actually flanked us through to the front of the queue, so we've been able to fill up the fuel and keep the bikes on the road,"" Chris says. Reality Check According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. Read more in our explainer. Lee Sellings, a community care worker in Shaftesbury, Dorset, says if he is not able to find diesel today he will not be able to visit his clients tomorrow. His role includes taking vulnerable people for day outings. ""I think things will get worse before they get better,"" he says. ""When I was recently trying to get fuel, a woman in the queue spent around Â£120 on petrol, saying she need it for the school run. ""In the end, it all comes down to greed."" Reality Check Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is to a large extent served by the same refineries as the rest of the UK. For example, Texaco ships fuel from its refinery in Pembroke to a storage facility at Belfast Harbour. But Northern Ireland has no more access to EU workers such as HGV drivers than other parts of the UK. Read more:How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Jackie Allen says she needs diesel for the school run and spent two hours searching for it without success. She likens the situation to her experience growing up in Zimbabwe in the 1980s when she says she remembers queuing for fuel. She says there is no diesel anywhere in Henley, where she is now, and she has also tried nearby Wallingford and Moulsford as well as every petrol station on the A4 between Reading and Maidenhead. ""A tanker filled up the pumps at the Gulf (garage) on the A4 Bath road
but they still had staff turning people away,"" she says. ""Even the Blood motorbike couldnât get fuel. ""At this rate, they will have to close schools because we
canât fill up our cars."" She says she only fills up once a month and didn't panic buy until she needed diesel and ""now there is nowhere in a 15 mile radius to fill up"". Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980 and was ruled by prime minister Robert Mugabe, who later became executive president before leaving power in 2017. But early gains in the economy were later overshadowed by later economic hardship, inflation and shortages of basic goods later in his rule. Robert Mugabe Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government has a reserve fleet of 80 tankers kept at depots in Cambridgeshire and West Yorkshire for use by industry in emergencies. The number used will change day by day. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acknowledges it won't make a huge difference but ""every little helps"" and are interpreting this as a positive development as it means firms have rejigged driver shifts, cancelled leave etc and so have sufficient drivers to be able to use additional vehicles. The Petrol Retailers Association - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says there are ""early signs"" pressure at the pumps is starting to ease. It says only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. On Tuesday, 37% of the forecourts owned by its members were out of petrol, compared with two-thirds on Sunday. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also says there are signs that the petrol crisis is ""stabilising"". The Ministry of Defence is preparing about 150 qualified military drivers to deliver fuel - and has another 150 personnel ready to support them. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says it will also draw on some of the reserve fleet of 80 tankers which the government keeps for emergencies. Read more in our explainer. We've heard from Nikolas McDonald, from Egham Surrey, who says he paid more than he expected for fuel and was
shocked to see the price per litre had gone up. He says he paid a ""disgusting recently inflated price of Â£1.55.9 per litre"" for super unleaded petrol on Friday. âNormally I would expect to
pay around Â£1.42 or Â£1.43 per litre,"" he says. âI donât mind paying a bit
more but I feel like we are being ripped off and taken advantage of."" Earlier, we reported that the RAC is predicting petrol price rises linked to the cost of oil, with average prices expected to reach 143p per litre for petrol and 145p for diesel in the next few weeks. Brexit is ""largely responsible"" for the ""supply chain fragility"" and the fuel supply problems the UK is experiencing, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. When ask about the fuel crisis during a visit to Dundee, Sturgeon says: ""The end of freedom of movement and the restrictions on immigration are really making it difficult to recruit haulage divers, to recruit people in our agriculture sector and even to recruit people in our health and social care services. ""So it is an extraordinary state of affairs that the UK government is responsible for, but we need to make sure that all of the steps have been taken to get through this period."" She says Covid alone would present ""a real risk of this being the most difficult winter any of us have ever known"", but these additional problems ""makes this extraordinarily difficult"". ""It underlines the foolishness and the recklessness of the UK government pressing ahead with Brexit, in the face of this pandemic."" You can read more on the petrol supply situation in Scotland here. The fuel crisis is easing, says the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents two-thirds of UK filling stations. ""There are encouraging signs that the crisis at the pumps is easing, with forecourts reporting that they are taking further deliveries of fuel,"" executive director Gordon Balmer says. ""Only 27% of PRA members have reported being out of fuel today, and with regular restocks taking place, we are expecting to see the easing continue over the next 24 hours."" But he says the organisation is ""extremely disappointed"" to hear forecourt staff have experienced ""a high level of both verbal and physical abuse"". ""We would urge the public to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" he says. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) isyet to process 56,144 applications,externalfor ""vocational driving licences"" - which includes HGV licences - according to Department for Transport figures. That total, correct as of 22 September, isup from 54,191 on 15 September.,external It was given in response to a written question from Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for Copeland and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the DfT, says the total included applications for provisional licences and for renewals and included ""those applying for entitlement to drive both HGVs and buses"". She says the DVLA is ""prioritising applications for provisional vocational licences so these drivers can take their training quickly"" - noting that they take 10 days to process  - while most people applying to renew a licence could continue driving while their applications were being processed. ""The DVLA continues to explore opportunities to reduce turnaround times for paper applications,"" she says. ""Extra staff have been recruited and the DVLA is seeking extra office space to house more staff to help reduce backlogs and provide future resilience and business continuity."" Clarification 30 September:
The Department for Transport has provided further information which makes clear
that only about 4,000 of the applications in the queue are for provisional HGV
licences and the majority of others are for renewals, and in most cases those
drivers can continue to drive while their application is being processed. BBC Radio CWR Panic buying of fuel has started to ease after several days of supply issues, according to the manager of one independent petrol station in Coventry. Paul Cheema runs a forecourt in Tile Hill and says demand has started to decline and he expects his site not to run out of fuel in the coming days. However, he says staff have kept a limit of Â£15 per driver and refuse to fill petrol cans. ""We have had a couple of kick offs already this morning because we are refusing jerry cans and then you get the foul-mouthed behaviour which is not acceptable,"" he says. A community nurse says she was left heartbroken when an elderly couple who have never spent a day apart weren't able to see each other because the husband couldn't get fuel to visit his wife in hospital. Jane Longhurst, who is 64 and works in Kent, says he called yesterday to say he couldn't come. ""He spoke with his wife on the phone and both were in tears,"" she says. ""This broke my heart."" Jane says she is concerned by what she calls the ""selfish"" attitude of those  panic-buying fuel. ""It has so much of an adverse effect and causes unnecessary anxiety for those that need fuel,"" she says. Her own journey to work takes 45 minutes each way - and she has been trying to find fuel on her days off to ensure she can get to work at the end of the week. ""I travelled locally to five different petrol stations, four had no fuel and at one the queue was exceptionally long,"" she says. ""I have about half a tank - I will be able to get to and from work on Friday but Iâd be mindful that on Saturday, I would get to work but I wouldnât get home."" Â© 2025 BBC.

UK risks French anger over fishing permits,"Fresh tensions have surfaced between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights. In the latest round of applications, the UK granted just 12 licences from 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters. French sea minister Annick Girardin reportedly said: ""French fishing must not be taken hostage by the British for political ends."" Meanwhile,Jersey refused licences to 75 French fishing boats. The UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights. Overall, the UK has granted 117 EU licences for its inshore territorial waters and almost 1,700 EU vessels have been licensed to fish in the larger UK exclusive economic one, which stretches 200 nautical miles from shore. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the deal mean for fishing? Jersey refuses licences to 75 French fishing boats Ms Girardin, quoted in French newspaper Le Monde, said: ""It is a new refusal of the British to apply the conditions of the Brexit accord despite all the work undertaken together. ""I have only one watchword; to obtain definitive licences for our fishermen as the accord foresees."" Fishing was one of the most contentious issues in the post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU, and it continues to be a source of tension. Both sides have substantial bargaining chips: many European boats have traditionally relied on fishing in British waters, while many British companies rely on selling their catch in European markets. There is a particular focus on the number of French boats that will be able to fish in British waters in the English Channel, and around the Channel Islands. The French Prime Minister Jean Castex recently sent a letter to the President of the European Commission Ursula Von Der Leyen warning that the problem was far from over - so, a local dispute could quickly become a broader European issue. After protests by French vessels in the waters around Jersey in May, the deadline for foreign boats to submit evidence that they have fished near Jersey in the past (which helps determine future access) was extended until the end of this month. But it's safe to say that France won't be impressed by the rejection of 75 boats. Sporadic squabbling about how the new UK-EU trade agreement should be implemented looks set to rumble on for years, placing a nagging strain on what should be a close relationship. A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the UK's approach ""has been reasonable and fully in line with our commitments in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)"". The spokesman said that to get a licence for fishing in the UK territorial sea, which is between six and 12 nautical miles from the coast, EU vessels must provide evidence of a track record of working there. It comes as Jersey said it had granted 64 licences out of 170 applications from French boats. A further 31 boats have been given temporary licences to give them more time to show they have a track record of fishing in Jersey's waters, in line with the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The remaining 75 boats are being given 30 days' notice, after which they will no longer be allowed access to the island's waters. Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions over fishing rights in May, when two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area after French fishermenstaged a protest outside the port of St Helier. The fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. The row led Ms Girardin tothreaten to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France.

Next warns on Christmas warehouse staff shortages,"Next has warned of price rises and staff shortages before Christmas unless immigration rules are eased. The High Street chain said some areas of its business were ""beginning to come under pressure"", including warehouse and logistics staffing. It blamed higher shipping costs, particularly for larger furniture items, for pushing up its prices. The Home Office said it was working with industry to ""understand how we can best ease particular pinch points"". Next urged the government to ""take a more decisive approach to the looming skills crisis"" and said that the lorry driver crisis was ""foreseen, and widely predicted"". The company's warning over potential staffing issues during the festive period was made in its half-year results, which showed profit before tax was up by 5.9% compared to 2019 levels. The company said rising shipping costs had driven up prices by about 2%, with its larger home products ""bearing the brunt of the increase"". It added that in the first half of next year it expected prices to increase by an average 2.5%, with homeware prices up 6%. Next chief executive Lord Wolfson said the firm was not currently having difficulties in recruiting staff for its stores, but warned warehouse and logistics staffing was ""beginning to come under pressure"". ""We anticipate that, without some relaxation of immigration rules, we are likely to experience some degradation in our service in the run up to Christmas,"" he said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? How many people are out of work? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? A government spokeswoman said: ""We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. ""The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment."" Many UK sectors, from fuel firms to supermarkets, have supply chain problems at the moment due to a chronic shortage of lorry drivers. The shortage in drivers in the UK is estimated to be about 100,000, according to industry bodies, with a long-term problem being made worse by the pandemic, tax changes, Brexit, and an ageing workforce. The recent supply chain problems led to the UK governmentannouncing it will grant temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers. Lord Wolfson was a strong advocate of Brexit in the run-up to the referendum, but he has been critical of the government's approach towards post-Brexit immigration. He has said the imposition of a minimum salary of Â£30,000 was a mistake. In a statement, Next added: ""The HGV crisis was foreseen, and widely predicted for many months. For the sake of the wider UK economy, we hope that the government will take a more decisive approach to the looming skill crisis in warehouses, restaurants, hotels, care homes, and many seasonal industries. ""A demand led approach to ensuring the country has the skills it needs is now vital."" The company's performance for the half year to July was largely fuelled by a surge in online revenue, with sales increasing by 52% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Lord Wolfson said the retail bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic was ""far stronger than we anticipated"". ""Sales in retail stores have done better than planned, while online sales have fallen back less than we expected. It appears that the wider economy has not suffered the long term damage many feared, for the moment at least. And, in particular, employment has held up well,"" he added. The retailer raised its full year profit outlook for the fourth time in six months. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Next's ""ever-growing"" online business had led it to brush off the ""worst of the woes brought on by lockdown"". ""Next is the golden girl of the high street,"" she said. ""The High Street star hasn't escaped unscathed by the labour, supply and cost issues sweeping across the country.

Jackie Allen says she needs diesel for the school run and spent two hours searching for it without success. She likens the situation to her experience growing up in Zimbabwe in the 1980s when she says she remembers queuing for fuel. She says there is no diesel anywhere in Henley, where she is now, and she has also tried nearby Wallingford and Moulsford as well as every petrol station on the A4 between Reading and Maidenhead. ""A tanker filled up the pumps at the Gulf (garage) on the A4 Bath road
but they still had staff turning people away,"" she says. ""Even the Blood motorbike couldnât get fuel. ""At this rate, they will have to close schools because we
canât fill up our cars."" She says she only fills up once a month and didn't panic buy until she needed diesel and ""now there is nowhere in a 15 mile radius to fill up"". Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980 and was ruled by prime minister Robert Mugabe, who later became executive president before leaving power in 2017. But early gains in the economy were later overshadowed by later economic hardship, inflation and shortages of basic goods later in his rule. Robert Mugabe Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government has a reserve fleet of 80 tankers kept at depots in Cambridgeshire and West Yorkshire for use by industry in emergencies. The number used will change day by day. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acknowledges it won't make a huge difference but ""every little helps"" and are interpreting this as a positive development as it means firms have rejigged driver shifts, cancelled leave etc and so have sufficient drivers to be able to use additional vehicles. The Petrol Retailers Association - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says there are ""early signs"" pressure at the pumps is starting to ease. It says only 27% of its members have reported being out of fuel today. On Tuesday, 37% of the forecourts owned by its members were out of petrol, compared with two-thirds on Sunday. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also says there are signs that the petrol crisis is ""stabilising"". The Ministry of Defence is preparing about 150 qualified military drivers to deliver fuel - and has another 150 personnel ready to support them. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says it will also draw on some of the reserve fleet of 80 tankers which the government keeps for emergencies. Read more in our explainer. We've heard from Nikolas McDonald, from Egham Surrey, who says he paid more than he expected for fuel and was
shocked to see the price per litre had gone up. He says he paid a ""disgusting recently inflated price of Â£1.55.9 per litre"" for super unleaded petrol on Friday. âNormally I would expect to
pay around Â£1.42 or Â£1.43 per litre,"" he says. âI donât mind paying a bit
more but I feel like we are being ripped off and taken advantage of."" Earlier, we reported that the RAC is predicting petrol price rises linked to the cost of oil, with average prices expected to reach 143p per litre for petrol and 145p for diesel in the next few weeks. Brexit is ""largely responsible"" for the ""supply chain fragility"" and the fuel supply problems the UK is experiencing, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. When ask about the fuel crisis during a visit to Dundee, Sturgeon says: ""The end of freedom of movement and the restrictions on immigration are really making it difficult to recruit haulage divers, to recruit people in our agriculture sector and even to recruit people in our health and social care services. ""So it is an extraordinary state of affairs that the UK government is responsible for, but we need to make sure that all of the steps have been taken to get through this period."" She says Covid alone would present ""a real risk of this being the most difficult winter any of us have ever known"", but these additional problems ""makes this extraordinarily difficult"". ""It underlines the foolishness and the recklessness of the UK government pressing ahead with Brexit, in the face of this pandemic."" You can read more on the petrol supply situation in Scotland here. The fuel crisis is easing, says the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents two-thirds of UK filling stations. ""There are encouraging signs that the crisis at the pumps is easing, with forecourts reporting that they are taking further deliveries of fuel,"" executive director Gordon Balmer says. ""Only 27% of PRA members have reported being out of fuel today, and with regular restocks taking place, we are expecting to see the easing continue over the next 24 hours."" But he says the organisation is ""extremely disappointed"" to hear forecourt staff have experienced ""a high level of both verbal and physical abuse"". ""We would urge the public to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" he says. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) isyet to process 56,144 applications,externalfor ""vocational driving licences"" - which includes HGV licences - according to Department for Transport figures. That total, correct as of 22 September, isup from 54,191 on 15 September.,external It was given in response to a written question from Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. Trudy Harrison, Conservative MP for Copeland and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the DfT, says the total included applications for provisional licences and for renewals and included ""those applying for entitlement to drive both HGVs and buses"". She says the DVLA is ""prioritising applications for provisional vocational licences so these drivers can take their training quickly"" - noting that they take 10 days to process  - while most people applying to renew a licence could continue driving while their applications were being processed. ""The DVLA continues to explore opportunities to reduce turnaround times for paper applications,"" she says. ""Extra staff have been recruited and the DVLA is seeking extra office space to house more staff to help reduce backlogs and provide future resilience and business continuity."" Clarification 30 September:
The Department for Transport has provided further information which makes clear
that only about 4,000 of the applications in the queue are for provisional HGV
licences and the majority of others are for renewals, and in most cases those
drivers can continue to drive while their application is being processed. BBC Radio CWR Panic buying of fuel has started to ease after several days of supply issues, according to the manager of one independent petrol station in Coventry. Paul Cheema runs a forecourt in Tile Hill and says demand has started to decline and he expects his site not to run out of fuel in the coming days. However, he says staff have kept a limit of Â£15 per driver and refuse to fill petrol cans. ""We have had a couple of kick offs already this morning because we are refusing jerry cans and then you get the foul-mouthed behaviour which is not acceptable,"" he says. A community nurse says she was left heartbroken when an elderly couple who have never spent a day apart weren't able to see each other because the husband couldn't get fuel to visit his wife in hospital. Jane Longhurst, who is 64 and works in Kent, says he called yesterday to say he couldn't come. ""He spoke with his wife on the phone and both were in tears,"" she says. ""This broke my heart."" Jane says she is concerned by what she calls the ""selfish"" attitude of those  panic-buying fuel. ""It has so much of an adverse effect and causes unnecessary anxiety for those that need fuel,"" she says. Her own journey to work takes 45 minutes each way - and she has been trying to find fuel on her days off to ensure she can get to work at the end of the week. ""I travelled locally to five different petrol stations, four had no fuel and at one the queue was exceptionally long,"" she says. ""I have about half a tank - I will be able to get to and from work on Friday but Iâd be mindful that on Saturday, I would get to work but I wouldnât get home."" Â© 2025 BBC.

No Time To Die attracts several five-star reviews,"Daniel Craig's fifth and final James Bond film, No Time To Die, has received rave reviews from critics. The movie premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday, following several delays prompted by the Covid pandemic. In his five-star review of the film,Kevin Maher of The Times said:,external""It's better than good. It's magnificent. ""Craig is a towering charismatic presence from opening frame to closing shot, and he bows out in terrific, soulful, style."" But while most critics were positive, some suggested the film did not quite justify its 163-minute running time. This reviews round-up is spoiler free. In his own five-star review,The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described the film,externalas an ""epic barnstormer"" which delivers ""pathos, action, drama, camp comedy, heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action"". ""It is of course a festival of absurdity and complication, a head-spinning world of giant plot mechanisms,"" he said, but concluded the film as a whole is ""very enjoyable and gleefully spectacular"". Lashana Lynch, a newcomer to the Bond films, was praised for her performance in No Time To Die Stephanie Zacharek of Time was broadly positive,externalabout the film, but suggested Craig's swansong didn't warrant its length. ""At two hours and 43 minutes, it's too long and too overstuffed with plot - more isn't always better,"" she said. ""And it features one of the dullest villains in the series' history, played by Rami Malek in mottled skin and dumb silky PJs. ""But forget all that. No Time To Die, its flaws notwithstanding, is perfectly tailored to the actor who is, to me, the best Bond of all."" No Time To Die marks the culmination of an over-arching storyline that began with Craig's first Bond film Casino Royale, released in 2006. In another five-star review,Robbie Collin of The Telegraph said:,external""[Director] Cary Joji Fukunaga's extravagantly satisfying, bulgingly proportioned last chapter to the Craig era, throws almost everything there is left to throw at 007 the series can come up with. ""We've been expecting you, Mr Bond, for quite some time,"" he added, ""and what a joy and relief it is to have you back."" Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek plays the film's villain The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey was less enthusiastic,,externalawarding the film three stars and describing the premise as ""generic spy nonsense"". ""Cary Joji Fukunaga has made a smashing piece of action cinema with No Time To Die - it's just a shame it had to be a Bond film,"" she said. ""What's most disappointing is how strangely anti-climatic the whole thing feels."" She added: ""Despite Phoebe Waller-Bridge's much-publicised contributions to the film's script, No Time to Die hardly feels like the radical feminist rewrite we were promised."" There was a similarly lukewarm responsefrom Screen Daily's Jonathan Romney,,externalwho said: ""It's certainly a film that breaks many of the canonical rules of the series, though not entirely to dazzling effect. ""There's plenty to gawk at, and to argue over, in this episode,"" he added, ""yet No Time To Die is oddly lacking in pleasure or real wit."" Empire's John Nugent agreed,externalthat the film was too long, writing that the middle third is ""bogged down by plotting and exposition doesn't justify that heaving runtime"". However, he noted: ""This film does things that no Bond film has ever done, and despite relying heavily on tropes that feel not only familiar but comforting, it is the unfamiliar things it does that make this such an exciting entry."" This video can not be played Members of the Royal Family joined stars of the new Bond film at its world premiere in London The film's length, however, wasn't an issuefor Digital Spy's Ian Sandwell.,external""It's densely plotted yet snappily paced, meaning that the movie rarely stops for breath before the next big action sequence or another revelation,"" he said. ""Further viewings will likely decide No Time To Die's fate in the ranking of Bond movies, especially as there are definitely moments likely to divide the fandom,"" he continued. ""As an experience though, it delivers all the spectacle you'd expect from a 007 movie, throws a few surprises in along the way and proves to be an entertaining, affecting and bold finale for Daniel Craig."" Daniel Craig's last Bond film finally premieres What we learned from No Time To Die trailer The making of Billie Eilish's Bond theme Many critics took the opportunity to reflect on and praise Craig's portrayal of Bond, particularly the emotional elements he brings to the role. ""Craig, his hair chopped into a bristle cut, has mastered the art of making Bond a seemingly invincible force who is also a human being with hidden vulnerabilities,""said Variety's Owen Gleiberman.,external He was similarly positive about the film's villain as Lyutsifer Safin, writing: ""Rami Malek, with mottled skin, an all-seeing leer, and the caressing voice of a depraved monk, makes him a hypnotic creep."" Daniel Craig with director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the No Time To Die set in 2019 Several reviews also praised one of the new additions to the film's cast. ""The real standout is Lashana Lynch... and she holds her own marvellously well,""wrote Next Best Picture's Josh Parham.,external ""The banter she has with Craig is effectively humorous and provides some of the most delightful moments in the film."" The latest film, which is released in the UK on Thursday, is Craig's fifth - following Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre. ""No Time To Die is a genre-bending Bond,""said Claire Gregory of Sky News.,external""Fans will be pleased that all the classic lines are delivered, sometimes with such humour that you can't help but suspect they were improved by Phoebe Waller Bridge's pass at the script. ""The film is chock full of tech, explosions, guns and car chases,"" she continued. ""In fact some of the scenes feel slightly gratuitous, with Daniel Craig getting one last opportunity to do pretty much everything you could ever expect from Bond."" It was revealed on Wednesday that Craig will follow Bond by playing Macbeth on Broadway from April, with Ruth Negga starring as Lady Macbeth. His final 007 film sees several actors from the Craig-era reprise their roles, including Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q, and LÃ©a Seydoux as love interest Dr. Madeleine Swann. Lashana Lynch, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux attended the film's world premiere on Tuesday ""Even if the two-and-three-quarter hour running time is occasionally a slog, it ultimately delivers,""wrote The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney.,external He said the film was ""the most tender portrait of James Bond we've ever seen,"" although he criticised the films ""plotting deficiencies and occasional pacing lags"". ""It may not rank up there with Skyfall, but it's a moving valedictory salute to the actor who has left arguably the most indelible mark on the character since Connery,"" he concluded. The Press Association's film critic Damon Smith said No Time To Die broke with the film series' previous tendency for a Bond actor's last film to be weaker than his earlier ones. ""Sean Connery returned to MI6 for Diamonds Are Forever and promptly exited, beginning the swansong rot... Roger Moore's 1985 farewell in A View To A Kill flatlined with inert sexual chemistry between [Moore] and Grace Jones,"" he noted. ""Pierce Brosnan barely thawed out Die Another Day, which began well with Halle Berry's orange bikinied entrance a la Ursula Andress then quickly lost the plot with a melting ice palace, an invisible car, another deadly satellite and Madonna's leaden cameo as a vampy fencing instructor. ""No Time To Die, which concludes Daniel Craig's muscular tour of duty as novelist Ian Fleming's dapper spy, ends the losing streak in spectacular and moving fashion."" Ana de Armas, who also starred alongside Craig in Knives Out, was praised for her performance The film ""does deliver some impressive chases and action sequences,""said CNN's Brian Lowry.,externalBut, he added: ""No Time to Die feels as if it's working too hard to provide Craig a send-off worthy of all the hype associated with it - an excess that might be summed up as simply, finally, by taking too much time to reach the finish."" Alex Flood of NME praised the film,externalin his four-star review, but added: ""There are issues. Rami Malek's disfigured Safin is another clichÃ©d, empty bad guy - and while Ana de Armas thrills during one eye-popping party scene, her character is quickly discarded so that other, blander men can take the spotlight. ""For the most part though, and with so much at stake thanks to Covid decimating cinema, No Time To Die producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson should be applauded for taking some bold risks. The gobsmacking ending, in fact, may be the biggest in Bond history. ""When the credits finally roll on Daniel Craig's last hurrah, [the] difficulties fade into the background. If we didn't know better, we'd say it even looked like he enjoyed himself."" M (Ralph Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) all return in the film No Time To Die is released in UK cinemas on Thursday 30 September.

UK risks French anger over fishing permitsThe UK grants just 12 licences from 47 applications for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial sea.,"Fresh tensions have surfaced between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights. In the latest round of applications, the UK granted just 12 licences from 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters. French sea minister Annick Girardin reportedly said: ""French fishing must not be taken hostage by the British for political ends."" Meanwhile,Jersey refused licences to 75 French fishing boats. The UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights. Overall, the UK has granted 117 EU licences for its inshore territorial waters and almost 1,700 EU vessels have been licensed to fish in the larger UK exclusive economic one, which stretches 200 nautical miles from shore. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the deal mean for fishing? Jersey refuses licences to 75 French fishing boats Ms Girardin, quoted in French newspaper Le Monde, said: ""It is a new refusal of the British to apply the conditions of the Brexit accord despite all the work undertaken together. ""I have only one watchword; to obtain definitive licences for our fishermen as the accord foresees."" Fishing was one of the most contentious issues in the post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU, and it continues to be a source of tension. Both sides have substantial bargaining chips: many European boats have traditionally relied on fishing in British waters, while many British companies rely on selling their catch in European markets. There is a particular focus on the number of French boats that will be able to fish in British waters in the English Channel, and around the Channel Islands. The French Prime Minister Jean Castex recently sent a letter to the President of the European Commission Ursula Von Der Leyen warning that the problem was far from over - so, a local dispute could quickly become a broader European issue. After protests by French vessels in the waters around Jersey in May, the deadline for foreign boats to submit evidence that they have fished near Jersey in the past (which helps determine future access) was extended until the end of this month. But it's safe to say that France won't be impressed by the rejection of 75 boats. Sporadic squabbling about how the new UK-EU trade agreement should be implemented looks set to rumble on for years, placing a nagging strain on what should be a close relationship. A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the UK's approach ""has been reasonable and fully in line with our commitments in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)"". The spokesman said that to get a licence for fishing in the UK territorial sea, which is between six and 12 nautical miles from the coast, EU vessels must provide evidence of a track record of working there. It comes as Jersey said it had granted 64 licences out of 170 applications from French boats. A further 31 boats have been given temporary licences to give them more time to show they have a track record of fishing in Jersey's waters, in line with the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The remaining 75 boats are being given 30 days' notice, after which they will no longer be allowed access to the island's waters. Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions over fishing rights in May, when two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area after French fishermenstaged a protest outside the port of St Helier. The fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. The row led Ms Girardin tothreaten to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France.

Toxic gas fears as La Palma lava reaches oceanClouds of white steam are seen billowing at the Playa Nueva area of Spain's La Palma island.Europe,"This video can not be played Clouds of steam can be seen as scorching lava enters the Atlantic Ocean Lava from an erupting volcano on Spain's La Palma island has reached the Atlantic Ocean, raising fears of toxic gases being released and explosions. Clouds of white steam were seen rising as a red-hot current made contact with the water in the Playa Nueva area. This could trigger a chemical reaction which can irritate the skin and eyes and affect breathing. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed since the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands erupted on 19 September. About 6,000 people have been evacuated, as the lava was engulfing houses, schools and some banana plantations.

Three coastal villages were earlier locked down in anticipation of the lava making contact with the water. Residents on the western coast had been told to stay indoors and seal all doors and windows with tape and wet towels.

""The eruption has not affected air quality, which is perfectly breathable,"" the La Palma Council said on Twitter. A huge cloud of white steam has been rising from the area where lava has been flowing into the ocean The Spanish government has declared La Palma - the most north-westerly island of the archipelago off the north African coast - a disaster zone, pledging financial support for all those affected by the volcanic activity. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said he would go to the island to co-ordinate aid for the residents of La Palma. The president of the Canary Islands, Ãngel VÃ­ctor Torres, said streams of lava up to 600m (1,968 ft) wide had devastated the landscape in some areas. The people of La Palma ""have been cowering in fear with a tremendous sense of desolation"" since the eruption began, the president told Spanish radio. Last week, he had estimated the damage incurred by the eruption would exceed â¬400m (Â£346m; $466m). When lava comes into contact with ocean water, it produces a gas plume known as laze - lava and haze. Laze forms through a series of chemical reactions as hot lava boils the colder sea water. ""It creates a steam of hydrochloric acid, water vapour and bits of ash,"" science journalist and volcanologist Dr Robin George Andrews told the BBC when the volcano first erupted. ""Obviously, it's not good to breathe in."" Laze plumes can cause eye, lung and skin irritation but should not be a problem if residents keep their distance, he said. A Copernicus satellite image shows the eruption on the west slope of the Cumbre Vieja Volcanic explosions were also possible, he added, because lava entering sea water creates ""a pressure-cooker situation"" that ""might fling out volcanic debris"".

UK risks French anger over fishing permitsThe UK grants just 12 licences from 47 applications for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial sea.UKScots singer 'was offered gig help in return for sex'Award-winning singer Iona Fyfe says she was propositioned by a man from a well-known band when she was 20.Scotland,"Fresh tensions have surfaced between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights. In the latest round of applications, the UK granted just 12 licences from 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters. French sea minister Annick Girardin reportedly said: ""French fishing must not be taken hostage by the British for political ends."" Meanwhile,Jersey refused licences to 75 French fishing boats. The UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights. Overall, the UK has granted 117 EU licences for its inshore territorial waters and almost 1,700 EU vessels have been licensed to fish in the larger UK exclusive economic one, which stretches 200 nautical miles from shore. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the deal mean for fishing? Jersey refuses licences to 75 French fishing boats Ms Girardin, quoted in French newspaper Le Monde, said: ""It is a new refusal of the British to apply the conditions of the Brexit accord despite all the work undertaken together. ""I have only one watchword; to obtain definitive licences for our fishermen as the accord foresees."" Fishing was one of the most contentious issues in the post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU, and it continues to be a source of tension. Both sides have substantial bargaining chips: many European boats have traditionally relied on fishing in British waters, while many British companies rely on selling their catch in European markets. There is a particular focus on the number of French boats that will be able to fish in British waters in the English Channel, and around the Channel Islands. The French Prime Minister Jean Castex recently sent a letter to the President of the European Commission Ursula Von Der Leyen warning that the problem was far from over - so, a local dispute could quickly become a broader European issue. After protests by French vessels in the waters around Jersey in May, the deadline for foreign boats to submit evidence that they have fished near Jersey in the past (which helps determine future access) was extended until the end of this month. But it's safe to say that France won't be impressed by the rejection of 75 boats. Sporadic squabbling about how the new UK-EU trade agreement should be implemented looks set to rumble on for years, placing a nagging strain on what should be a close relationship. A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the UK's approach ""has been reasonable and fully in line with our commitments in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)"". The spokesman said that to get a licence for fishing in the UK territorial sea, which is between six and 12 nautical miles from the coast, EU vessels must provide evidence of a track record of working there. It comes as Jersey said it had granted 64 licences out of 170 applications from French boats. A further 31 boats have been given temporary licences to give them more time to show they have a track record of fishing in Jersey's waters, in line with the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The remaining 75 boats are being given 30 days' notice, after which they will no longer be allowed access to the island's waters. Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions over fishing rights in May, when two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area after French fishermenstaged a protest outside the port of St Helier. The fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. The row led Ms Girardin tothreaten to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France.

"Fuel crisis starting to ease, Johnson says","This video can not be played Fuel supplies are starting to âimproveâ with petrol and diesel back on the forecourt âin the normal wayâ says the PM. The fuel situation in the UK is starting to improve, PM Boris Johnson has said - as he urged motorists to fill up their cars in the ""normal way"". He said the situation at fuel stations was ""stabilising"" and people should be ""confident"" to go about their business, after days of queues and pump closures. Labour said the government had let the country ""crash from crisis to crisis"". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has approved a request for 150 military tanker drivers to help deliver fuel. Training the drivers to use civilian fuel company tankers is expected to take place over the next three days, so the first deliveries could take place by the end of the week. With some drivers continuing to face difficulties in refuelling, there have been calls for key workers, such as health and social care staff, to receive priority at the pumps. As the prime minister made his first public comments on the fuel supply problems, he was asked if he supported prioritising workers such as NHS staff, responding that ""with things stabilising - the best thing is - we stabilise in the normal way"". Is the fuel crisis improving? Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss Mr Johnson said he sympathised with people who had been unable to get fuel over recent days, calling it ""frustrating and infuriating"". ""What we're hearing from the industry is the situation at forecourts is stabilising,"" he said. ""I would just urge everyone to go about their business in the normal way and fill up when you need it."" A government source confirmed reports that 16% of all petrol stations were now fully supplied with fuel, compared to 10% at the weekend during some of the worst of the fuel rush. The source said that 40% of petrol stations being fully supplied was a more normal figure before the rush on fuel. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""early signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said around 37% of its sites had run out of fuel - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. PRA executive director Gordon Balmer said: ""With regular restocks taking place, this percentage [of petrol stations with fuel] is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours. ""Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers."" The government has said people needlessly buying fuel has led to queues at many forecourts, with fuel running out in some places. Earlier on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there were ""tentative signs"" the situation was starting to stabilise but added that ""won't be reflected in the queues as yet"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer would ""give priority to key workers"" to get fuel The UK is estimated to be short of more than 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The prime minister said panic buying of petrol followed a ""slightly misleading"" account of the shortages of lorry drivers which caused an ""understandable surge in public demand"". He said: ""The actual number of lorry drivers that we're short in that particular sector isn't very big. But generally there is a shortage in that profession around the world."" Mr Johnson said the government was taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas. ""What we want to do is to make sure we have the preparations necessary to get through to Christmas and beyond, not just in the supply of our petrol stations but all parts of our supply chain,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had talked to hauliers earlier in the day and was told that the government was in denial over the problems. ""These were their words, they said, 'it's a government that is denying there's a problem, then blaming somebody else, and then coming up with a half-baked plan'."" He said the government should ""give priority to key workers"" to get petrol, and ""issue enough visas"" to deal with the shortage of lorry drivers. ""The government has reduced the country to chaos as we crash from crisis to crisis. And the government is not gripping this,"" he said. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers Doctors, nurses, and unions for teachers, prison and care staff are among those who have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel. Some patients relying on vital services delivered in their homes have complained of missed appointments because of the fuel crisis. Sarah Jane Barnes, from Berkshire, told the BBC that her elderly mother had missed two out of three dialysis appointments because health workers were unable to get enough fuel to reach her. Rosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services in West Sussex, said one of her carers was half an hour late to her first call because of traffic caused by queues at petrol stations. She said that meant her carer's first patient was unable to get out of bed until she arrived, while it also had a knock-on effect on her other patients. Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of UK Homecare Association, warned that some people who depend on carers for tasks like taking pain medication could die if they are left without help. Unison urged ministers to ""designate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers"" while the NASUWT union called for teachers to be prioritised to safeguard children's education. Roger Grosvenor, of the East of England Co-op petrol stations, told the BBC the group would create a daily priority hour for emergency workers if fuel supply problems had not eased by Thursday. Meanwhile, footage emerged on social media of confrontations taking place on petrol forecourts,including a man threatening a motorist with what appears to be a knife in south-east London. This video can not be played This video has no sound Up to 150 military tanker drivers will prepare to deliver to forecourts which have run dry because of panic buying. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government's move to place the Army on stand-by was a ""sensible, precautionary step"". The government has also authorised an extension to special driver licences that allow drivers to transport goods such as fuel. ADR licences due to expire between 27 September and 31 December will have their validity extended until 31 January 2022, without refresher training or exams.

Army gets ready to assist as PM reassures drivers,"This video can not be played Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the ""situation is stabilising"" The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries. It comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps ""has begun to improve"" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. He said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. Ministers have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in ""the next couple of days"", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. Some 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Be confident going about your business, Johnson says No more visa schemes for businesses, say government sources Fuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: ""We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal."" The industry statement also said there had ""always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals"" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""encouraging signs"" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries. The PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday. Brian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were ""less queues [and] panic buying"" there was still ""unusually heavy demand"". He said ""one or two"" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday. It would take more than ""a day or a few days"" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still ""plenty to go round"". This petrol station in West London ran out of some types of fuel on Wednesday On Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be ""confident"" to go about their business. He said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were ""stabilising"". Sir Keir Starmer used hisfirst in-person conference speechas Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues. Referring to the government's flagship ""levelling up"" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: ""Level up, you can't even fill up."" He accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering ""half-baked"" solutions with ""no plan in place"". Mr Starmer urged the PM to ""either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess"". One hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. Nurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was ""an element of sheer panic"" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. It wants filling stations togive its staff priority accessand is also asking the public for donations. Ms Harper said: ""We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. ""We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel."" There have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service userscould be left without their usual helpif the crisis does not ease. Emma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her""situation is life-threatening"". Care assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. James Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would ""generate more panic"". ""Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a ""dip in demand"". Fuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week. Reports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand. Sainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still ""experiencing high demand for fuel"" and that ""all our sites continue to receive fuel"". Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns ""points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside"". He added: ""After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before."" This is still higher than normal but is a ""positive sign"", he said. Motorists queuing for fuel at a petrol station in Ashford, Kent But Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was ""not getting better"", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel. He called for an essential users list to be brought in to ""take the sting out of this crisis"". Meanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues. The figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months.
