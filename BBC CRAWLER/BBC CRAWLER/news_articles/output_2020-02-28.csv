There are nine yellowweather warnings,externalfor rain, wind and snow in force across the UK for Saturday, as the country prepares for the fresh storm. Barriers along the river in Ironbridge were pushed back 2m (6ft 6ins) as up to 500 tonnes of water per second flowed through the town. Tim Norton, from the agency, said: ""We're not out of the woods yet."" Earlier on Friday, he said engineers had carried out inspections ""right the way along the barrier"" and were ""replacing the parts that need to be replaced and getting it all ready"". New flood barriers arrived in Ironbridge earlier Engineers had been ""really impressed with how the barriers have held up"", Mr Norton added. ""Even though they moved, even though there was some damage, they still did their job. ""The worst hasn't happened... and we're confident they will offer really good protection in the coming days."" Deep marks have appeared on the road near flood defences in Ironbridge Residents were forced to evacuate their homes when waterseeped under the defences on Wednesday. Up to 80mm of rain is expected to fall in parts of Wales when the latest storm hits and the Met Office said the forecast was ""not good news"" for the already flood-hit communities. 'Show us you care prime minister' In Pictures: Flood-hit areas in the Midlands Latest updates on flooding in the West Midlands ""With the ground being so sodden, there's no capacity at all for that to be absorbed,"" Chris Bainger, from the Environment Agency (EA) said. ""We'll probably find all that water making its way into the head of the Severn and working its way through."" Dozens of flood warnings are in place along the length of the river, with Shrewsbury and Worcester still recovering from the aftermath of Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis earlier this month. River levels in Ironbridge have so far dropped by about 1.5m, from a peak of about 6.8m on Wednesday to 5.2m. Ch Supt Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police, said a fresh deluge was expected to hit the town from Sunday night. By Sarah Bishop, BBC Midlands Floodwater has started to recede in Shrewsbury Everyone seems to be very resilient and getting back to normal as much as they can. The pub, the Hop & Friar, lost about Â£15,000 of stock, all that was in the cellar practically, but it is open for business and has been for a few days. They just put their barrels behind the bar instead of in the cellar. The Darwin Townhouse B&B still has water in one of the downstairs rooms but the owners are resigned to the fact that is how it is going to be. The owners had insurance for four years, tried to reinsure just before Storm Dennis struck but could not get any. In the streets, where people were once canoeing, I can now see children on scooters and skateboards and people pushing pushchairs. Most people are not even wearing their wellies, they are just going about their day-to-day business. The shops are open, children have been to school - it just seems a normal day in Shrewsbury. The defence work follows a visit by Environment SecretaryGeorge Eustice who went to Ironbridge and Shrewsbury on Thursday, after Boris Johnson was criticised for not visiting the flooded areas. Steven Clarke, who runs greengrocers The Allotment in Coleham, Shrewsbury, said the minister only listened to their woes when he was approached. Mr Clarke fears it could have just been a ""PR exercise"", adding: ""He's assured us that he will go back and there will be more information provided to us. ""I will be looking for answers."" George Eustice was shown a screen showing images of flood defences during a visit to Ironbridge Shrewsbury is getting back to normal after flooding but more bad weather is expected Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued 185 people from the floodwaters and helped to evacuate a further 204 since 15 February. It has also rescued 19 dogs, 10 cats, 55 sheep, a pony, a parrot and a snake, the service added.

Roof box people smuggler jailed,"The three people were found in the locked airless roof box by Border Force officers A man who smuggled three Vietnamese people into the UK in a car roof box has been jailed for three years. Robert Rooney, 34, was stopped by Border Force after driving his Ford Fiesta into the UK control zone at Coquelle, France, on 5 October. He told officials the roof box contained camping equipment but two men and a girl, 15, were found inside, Maidstone Crown Court heard. The roof box was locked and had no ventilation, Border Force said. Robert Rooney was stopped at the UK border checkpoint in France Judge Catherine Brown said had there been a delay in the crossing, or an accident on the road, it ""could very well have had tragic consequences"". Sentencing him, she added: ""It was a high-risk venture."" A 15-year-old girl was found with two unrelated men, Border Force said Dave Fairclough, Deputy Director of Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigations, told the BBC: ""Robert Rooney went abroad on the pretence of going for a fishing trip and to meet his brother. ""In fact his motive was much more sinister. This was a determined effort to go and meet with people smugglers based in Calais. He had an arrangement with them to collect the three clandestine migrants."" He said the girl was not related to the two men which would suggest she was a victim of human trafficking. Rooney claimed the roof box contained camping equipment Dan Scully, Border Force Regional Director, said: ""Smuggling people into the UK in this way is incredibly dangerous and puts the lives of the individuals at huge risk. ""Crammed into a confined space inside the roof box must have been terrifying."" Rooney, of North Mall, in Edmonton, London, had pleaded guilty to a charge of facilitating the commission of a breach of UK immigration law at a hearing on 8 January.

Motherwell manager cleared of assault charges,"This video can not be played Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson cleared of assaulting his partner Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson has been acquitted of assaulting his partner in Edinburgh last year. Mr Robinson, 45, was on trial at at Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of assaulting Robyn Lauchlan on Waverley Bridge on 13 December. The football manager had denied the charges against him. Ms Lauchlan earlier told the trial he had been trying to calm her down while she was upset and she had asked prosecutors not to bring charges. Sheriff John Cook said it was quite proper that the Crown had brought the matter to court but he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged offences had taken place. It had been alleged that Mr Robinson grabbed Ms Lauchlan, pushed and pulled her and pinned her against a fence on Waverley Bridge, next to the Edinburgh Christmas markets. The 45-year-old was also accused of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by shouting, swearing and acting aggressively. Mr Robinson has been the manager of Motherwell since 2017 But Mr Robinson told the trial he had never been abusive to his partner and said he found the idea ""disgusting"". Giving evidence at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, the former Northern Ireland international said: ""My sole intention was just to calm her down and get her home safely."" The trial hadpreviously heard from Ms Lauchlanthat she was distressed because her partner did not intervene when a man who had been speaking to him in a city centre bar told her aggressively to ""shut up"". She said ""I thought: 'Why is (Stephen) not saying anything to this man who has just ridiculed me in front of everyone and Stephen has allowed him to do it?""' But the 28-year-old said she was ""drunk and behaved like an idiot"" and claimed Mr Robinson was ""paying the price"" for this. In her evidence, Ms Lauchlan also criticised domestic abuse laws and told the trial that prosecuting her partner was ""unfair and wrong"". The couple insisted the incident on Waverley Bridge had been misinterpreted Mr Robinson told the court he had no previous convictions and had never assaulted Ms Lauchlan. He said that when Ms Lauchlan later saw him at Waverley railway station she walked over and ""gave me a big kiss and cuddle"". He told the trial: ""She looked as if she had calmed down. My priority was to make sure she was getting home safely."" Mr Robinson said he was ""used to things"" like the earlier incident in the bar, but became exasperated by her reaction. He added that he wanted to calm her down and had raised his voice and swore. The court heard Ms Lauchlan wrote several letters to the procurator fiscal asking for the charges to be dropped, including one criticising domestic abuse law. ""It terrifies me how easy it is to ruin someone's life with this new law in place,"" she wrote. In a statement after the case concluded, Ms Lauchlan said: ""In no shape or form have I ever been a victim of domestic abuse. At no stage did Stephen push, shove or frighten me. He did not do the things he was accused of. She added: ""The stress this has caused both of us, and our families, is impossible to emphasise enough. It has taken an immeasurable toll on our lives all because the system has failed us both.""

Copenhagen scorer charged following Celtic win,"Michael Santos scored the opening goal for Copenhagen Copenhagen goal scorer Michael Santos has been charged in connection with an alleged assault on a police officer during their win over Celtic. He was allegedly involved in an altercation as his side celebrated their second goal on Thursday night. Santos and a member of the Copenhagen staff have been charged in connection with the incident. Police Scotland confirmed two men - aged 26 and 42 - had been reported to the procurator fiscal. Copenhagen said one of their goal scorers, Pep Biel, was grabbed by ""an official"" as he celebrated. The club claimed a steward ""tried to prevent a clash"" before he was led away. A statement on its website said: ""One of our stewards tried to prevent a clash and was led away and talked with Scottish police. ""Michael Santos also talked with the police, who subsequently have charged them both."" Copenhagen added: ""They travelled home with the team, and we are now waiting to see if the Scottish police will pursue the case. We will co-operate if they want more information from the club."" A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Eight arrests were made at the Europa League fixture between Celtic and Copenhagen last night. ""Six home and two away supporters were detained over minor disorder offences. ""In connection with an assault, we can confirm two males aged 42 and 26 were charged and a report will be made to the procurator fiscal."" A Crown Office spokesman said: ""The procurator fiscal has received a report concerning a 26-year-old male in relation to an alleged incident in Glasgow on February 27 2020.

First case of coronavirus in Wales confirmed,"This video can not be played More cases of coronavirus can be expected in Wales, says the country's chief medical officer The first case of coronavirus in Wales has been confirmed. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the adult patient had returned from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said the diagnosis had a link to the city's Bishop Gore School, but there are no cases within any schools. On Friday, a man on the Diamond Princess cruise ship becamethe first Briton to die of coronavirus. Nineteen people have tested positive in the UK since the virus outbreak began in China. There was one case inNorthern Irelandon Thursday and two new cases inEngland on Friday. Dr Atherton said the development was ""not unexpected"" and the patient was being treated at one of the four specialist units in England. He said it was ""inevitable"" there would be more cases. Dr Atherton said: ""Our job is to prepare for a significant number of cases, for an epidemic in the UK, or a pandemic if it becomes a global issue."" He said the Welsh patient had been tested on Thursday, adding: ""They developed symptoms and contacted the NHS and were assessed by colleagues from Public Health Wales."" He said: ""All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. ""I'd like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents."" He said to protect the patient's confidentiality no further details regarding the individual would be released.

Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and festivals in the UK in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time"". He said if the outbreak intensifies, it may be necessary to close schools and stop mass gatherings of people for ""quite a long period of time, probably more than two months"". The World Health Organization also warned thatthe outbreak had reached a ""decisive point""and had ""pandemic potential"". Based on data from 44,000 patients with this coronavirus, the WHO says: 81% develop mild symptoms 14% develop severe symptoms 5% become critically ill The proportion dying from the disease,which has been named Covid-19, appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable. Thousands are still being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it is also unclear how many mild cases remain unreported - so the death rate could also be lower. To put this into context, about one billion people catch influenza every year, with between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. The severity of flu changes every year. The authorities here are stepping up a gear. They are moving from just testing people who have been to the hotspots. They are now beginning to test some patients, either in intensive care units or some GP surgeries, who have unexplained symptoms which might indicate coronavirus. Things are shifting up a gear but the general message is that people should not panic. Even though more cases are expected, officials insist the NHS is well prepared. To protect against infection, the NHS has advised people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or a sanitiser gel. It is best to catch coughs and sneezes with tissues, which should be thrown away immediately afterwards. Be sure to wash your hands after disposing of tissues. Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and avoid close contact with people who are unwell. The World Health Organization,externaladvises keeping at least a metre between you and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.

How is the UK planning for a coronavirus outbreak?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

""Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. ""So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire."" Greta warned politicians ""we will not be silenced, because we are the change"" Sisters Alannah and Lottie Hoey from Henleaze joined the march Greta walked at the front of the crowds behind a green banner reading Skolstrejk for Klimatet, which translates from Swedish as School Strike for Climate. Protesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners throughout the march. As it happened: Greta Thunberg in Bristol for climate strike What does Greta Thunberg want? Annie, a 21-year-old Bristol University student, was of the many people who turned out to hear the headline speaker and took a day off from her studies to participate. ""This is probably one of the most important things that we should be focussing on right now. Showing support and that you want change will make people higher up realise that as well. ""One day off school is a good enough sacrifice for what this is standing for. It's just one day, it's not going to do any harm."" Protesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners Jerry and four-month-old Leon march through the rain Jerry and her baby, Leon, were also among those who joined the throng of people. ""What an absolutely wonderful experience. Everyone was really respectful and there were loads of lovely teens passionate about climate."" Sisters Alannah and Lottie Hoey, 10 and eight, travelled from Henleaze with family to be part of the day. ""I wanted to go and see Greta because she's very inspirational and does so much good for the planet,"" said Lana. Lottie added: ""We want a nice planet when we grow up so it's important to do things like Greta."" Many youngsters took the day off school to take part Greta had originally intended to visit London, but the area planned for the protest in the capital was considered too small so organisers recommended Bristol instead. Police said 15,000 are in attendance, although organisers believe the figure is closer to 30,000. BYS4C saidit had drafted in more than 80 stewardsand has a sectioned-off a ""safe zone"" for young children as well as an accessibility area. Greta Thunberg meets Malala at university Pressure on big investors to act on climate change Road schemes may face Heathrow-style court action Mya-Rose Craig, the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol, spoke to the crowd before Greta's arrival on stage. She said: ""Greta, welcome to our amazing city and thank you for being with us today. We have to engage with all of our communities in order to properly fight climate change. ""An unequal world can never be a sustainable one."" Greta his influenced youngsters to get involved in fighting the climate crisis Two years ago, Ms Thunbergstarted missing lessonson Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building, in what turned out to be the beginning of a huge environmental movement. She has since become a leading voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. By Steve Mellen, BBC News Protesters began gathering just after first light and by the time Greta walked onstage, it was hard to see the floor of College Green. People were clinging to any vantage point they could find; the balcony at the front of the Marriott Royal and on tiptoes in front of the cathedral. The roar when Greta stepped in front of the microphone echoed across the green and her speech was regularly punctuated with roars of approval, especially when she mentioned the decision not to grant Bristol Airport planning permission to expand. There were plenty of parents and adults who had come to hear Greta speak but the vast majority of the crowd were young and not at school- a reflection, perhaps, of the teenager's own decision to stop attending school to continue her campaign. Clutching homemade signs and chanting, the crowd then took over the heart of the shopping quarter. A crowdfunding campaign will raise money to restore College Green More than 20 road closures were in operation across the city while the march took place but all routes were reopened at 15:30 GMT. Meanwhile, Jon Usher from the charity Sustrans has set up a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to replant grass on College Green, which was left a muddy quagmire after the rally.

Coronavirus risk upgraded to highest level,"The WHO has raised the risk but data shows there is not yet a global pandemic The World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the coronavirus outbreak to ""very high"" - its top level of risk assessment. But the UN body said there was still a chance of containing the virus if its chain of transmission were broken. WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also stressed that fear and misinformation were the biggest challenges to overcome. More than 50 countries have now reported cases of coronavirus. And sources within Iran's healthcare systemtold BBC Persian that, as of Thursday evening, at least 210 people had diedfrom the virus. This is more than six times higher than the official government figure. At a press conference in Geneva, Dr Tedros said that most cases could still be traced, and there was no evidence of the virus ""spreading freely in communities"". Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Coronavirus: How worried should we be? His colleague, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's Emergency Health Programme, said that the risk level was intended to serve as a ""reality check"" for governments, since healthcare systems were still unprepared. ""You have a duty to your citizens, you have a duty to the world to be ready,"" said Dr Ryan. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said fear was still the biggest challenge Globally, more than 80,000 people have been infected. About 2,800 have died - the vast majority in China's Hubei province. China confirmed another 327 cases - the lowest daily increase for a month - along with 44 deaths Switzerland suspended all events with more than 1,000 participants until 15 March, including the Geneva International Motor Show Iceland, Nigeria, Mexico, New Zealand, Belarus and the Netherlands all reported their first cases The first British death from Covid-19 was announced- a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan Fear about the virus has continued to hit global markets.Shares have shed almost 13% of their value this week on London's FTSE, wiping Â£210bn ($267bn) from the value of companies on the index Dr Ryan also stressed that current data information does not suggest the virus has become a global pandemic. ""If we say there's a pandemic of coronavirus, we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed,"" he said. ""The data does not support that as yet and China has clearly shown that that's not necessarily the natural outcome of this event if we take action."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Five countries, five responses Dr Tedros reiterated that the spread had the potential to become a pandemic, but cautioned against unnecessary panic. ""Our greatest enemy right now is not the virus itself, it's fear, rumours and stigma,"" he said. The WHO has said proper containment, with the help of an ""all government, all society approach"" will help slow down rates of infection, break chains of infection and take pressure off healthcare systems around the world.

British man dies from coronavirus in Japan,"At least 621 people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan A British man has become the first UK citizen to die from coronavirus after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. He is the sixth passenger to die from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Japan's health ministry said. Another person has tested positive for the virus in England, which they caught in the UK. The total number of coronavirus cases in the UK now stands at 20. Confirming the latest UK case, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: ""It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad."" The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy's and St Thomas' in London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is due to chair an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Monday, said preparing for an outbreak in the UK was now the government's ""top priority"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson makes statement on coronavirus Speaking from Downing Street on Friday evening, Mr Johnson offered his condolences to the family of the British man who died from Covid-19. When asked if the government should have acted sooner for Britons on the cruise ship, he said it had been following the ""best medical advice"" about not repatriating people unless it is certain there will not be a spread to the UK. Mr Johnson has also faced criticism from Labour for waiting until Monday to hold the government Cobra meeting. But he said he had been working behind the scenes, meeting with the health secretary and chief medical officers to discuss the NHS's preparations. Hundreds of people on board the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship became infected while it was held in quarantine off the port of Yokohama earlier this month. A group of 30 British nationals and two Irish citizens were flown back to the UK from the cruise liner last Saturday. They were taken on coaches to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where they are spending two weeks in isolation. Sally and David Abel are being treated at a Japanese hospital after both testing positive for coronavirus However, some UK passengers were critical of the Foreign Office's ""slow"" response, and said the wait for repatriation had been ""frustrating"". Among them were David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who were not on the evacuation flight after testing positive for the coronavirus. They were part of a group of at least four Britons taken to hospital in Japan for treatment. A family member confirmed the couple are ""doing well and fighting fit"", adding: ""They are getting stronger every day.""

Two new patients in England contracted the virus while in Iran,the Department of Health and Social Care said.,external Public Health Wales said it was working to identify close contacts of the Welsh patient, who is believed to be from the Swansea area and was infected in northern Italy before returning to the UK. Northern Ireland also confirmed its first case on Thursday. Authorities said they havecontacted passengers who sat near the woman on a flight from northern Italy to Dublin. Can coronavirus harm breastfed babies, and other questions EasyJet and British Airways warn over virus impact How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? Following the UK national's death in Japan, a Foreign Office spokesperson said:Â ""We are supporting the family ofÂ aÂ BritishÂ man who has died in Japan and are in contact with local authorities. ""Our sympathies and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.""Â A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, which operates the Diamond Princess ship, also offered the company's ""sincere condolences"". The first death of a Brit from the coronavirus is, sadly, not a surprise. This outbreak has killed around 2,800 people, most of them in China. As the number of people infected with the virus increases, so too will the number of deaths. That is why attention continues to be on China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. Each of those countries still has full-blown outbreaks of the coronavirus and their efforts to contain it will be crucial. Other countries are already feeling the ripple effects of these outbreaks. The latest cases in the UK are connected to either Iran or Italy. For now there is no coronavirus outbreak in the UK, but further imported cases are almost inevitable for as long as other countries have large numbers of infections. The cruise liner, which had 3,711 passengers on board, was put under quarantine in Yokohama in early February after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. At least 621 people on the ship later tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, the World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to ""very high"" because of the continued emergence of cases and new countries being affected. But Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme, reiterated that the outbreak is not a pandemic. He told a press conference: ""If we say there is a pandemic of coronavirus we are essentially accepting every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus and the data does not support that as yet.""

About 2,800 have died - the majority in China's Hubei province TheUK's FTSE 100 share index has been hit by the biggest one-week fall since the 2008 financial crisis amid coronavirus fears. Newcastle and West Ham football clubs havebanned handshakes at their training grounds in an attempt to stop the virus' spread.

Coronavirus fears wipe Â£200bn off UK firms' value,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus. Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping Â£210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion.""

"Roof box people smuggler jailedTwo men and a 15-year-old girl were found in a locked, airless, car roof box, a court hears.England","The three people were found in the locked airless roof box by Border Force officers A man who smuggled three Vietnamese people into the UK in a car roof box has been jailed for three years. Robert Rooney, 34, was stopped by Border Force after driving his Ford Fiesta into the UK control zone at Coquelle, France, on 5 October. He told officials the roof box contained camping equipment but two men and a girl, 15, were found inside, Maidstone Crown Court heard. The roof box was locked and had no ventilation, Border Force said. Robert Rooney was stopped at the UK border checkpoint in France Judge Catherine Brown said had there been a delay in the crossing, or an accident on the road, it ""could very well have had tragic consequences"". Sentencing him, she added: ""It was a high-risk venture."" A 15-year-old girl was found with two unrelated men, Border Force said Dave Fairclough, Deputy Director of Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigations, told the BBC: ""Robert Rooney went abroad on the pretence of going for a fishing trip and to meet his brother. ""In fact his motive was much more sinister. This was a determined effort to go and meet with people smugglers based in Calais. He had an arrangement with them to collect the three clandestine migrants."" He said the girl was not related to the two men which would suggest she was a victim of human trafficking. Rooney claimed the roof box contained camping equipment Dan Scully, Border Force Regional Director, said: ""Smuggling people into the UK in this way is incredibly dangerous and puts the lives of the individuals at huge risk. ""Crammed into a confined space inside the roof box must have been terrifying."" Rooney, of North Mall, in Edmonton, London, had pleaded guilty to a charge of facilitating the commission of a breach of UK immigration law at a hearing on 8 January.

"No 'artificial deadlines' in EU talks, UK warned","Amelie de Montchalin: Trust between the two sides is vital The EU will not be pressurised by ""artificial deadlines"" in its post-Brexit trade talks with the UK, France's Europe minister has warned. Amelie de Montchalin said the EU would not sign just ""any"" deal by the end of the year, saying ""substance was much more important than deadlines"". The UK has said it could walk away from the talks in June unless there was the ""broad outline"" of an agreement. The process, to be conducted in English, will begin on Monday. Details of what will be discussed and when,externalhave been published, with topics to be covered in the first round of negotiations including trade in goods and services, transport, energy, fisheries and ""fair and open competition"" in future dealings. Further rounds of negotiations will take place every two to three weeks, alternating between London and Brussels. UK-EU trade talks: A simple guide UK prepared to ditch EU trade talks in June We'll find out about EU talks, TUC boss warns PM Brexit: What is a level playing field? The session in June, in which both sides will ""take stock"" of progress made at that point, is likely to prove crucial. The UK has ruled out extending the process beyond the end of the year, when the post-Brexit transition period will end. The UK and EU have agreed a schedule for negotiations based on 11 simultaneous streams, including one on the controversial subject of ""a level playing field for fair and open competition"". Eighteen days of talks have been scheduled until mid-May but the UK has not agreed to negotiations on defence or foreign policy, which the EU side wanted. The document says the working groups do not necessarily reflect the structure of the final agreement and the arrangements could change. The two sides can also speak to each other outside the formal rounds. The negotiations in Brussels will take place in a conference centre, not at the headquarters of the European Commission, although the ""plenary sessions"" and meetings between the chief negotiators will be held there. Friday's document, which sets out the terms of reference for the talks, says June's ""high-level"" meeting between chief negotiators David Frost and Michel Barnier will aim to ""agree actions to move forward in negotiations on the future relationship"". Speaking at the Chatham House think tank in London, Ms de Montchalin said the EU would ""not accept time pressure"" and was ""not ready to sign any kind of a deal on December 31 at 11pm"". ""We cannot let our level of ambition be affected by what I would call artificial deadlines,"" she said. David Frost (l) and Michel Barnier (r) will lead the negotiating teams ""If the UK decides to shorten the negotiating period, it will be the UK's responsibility. ""It will not be our choice on the European side, and that choice will have consequences in terms of the breadth and depth of the relationship we can build... for us substance is much, much more important than deadlines."" The UK officially left the EU at the end of January, but is continuing to abide by many EU rules while talks on a permanent trading relationship take place. The UK and the EU have both set out their priorities for the talks, with flash points including the UK's wish to diverge from EU employment and environmental standards in future, its ruling out of any role for the European Court of Justice and the level of EU access to UK fishing waters. This video can not be played Michael Gove: UK is not seeking EU rules alignment The UK has insisted a ""comprehensive"" free trade agreement, modelled on existing EU agreements with the likes of Canada and Japan, is possible within 10 months and it will decide by this summer whether this is achievable. If the UK decides such a deal is not in prospect, the government has said it will move to World Trade Organization rules from the start of 2021, under an arrangement similar to the one that the EU has with Australia. The EU's46-page negotiating document,external, published on Monday, said any trade agreement ""should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"". Ms de Montchalin said trust between the two sides was vital to a successful outcome and the EU needed to know that the existing withdrawal agreement and its guarantees on citizens rights and the Northern Irish border would be stuck to.

Barriers along the river in Ironbridge were pushed back 2m (6ft 6ins) as up to 500 tonnes of water per second flowed through the town. Tim Norton, from the agency, said: ""We're not out of the woods yet."" Earlier on Friday, he said engineers had carried out inspections ""right the way along the barrier"" and were ""replacing the parts that need to be replaced and getting it all ready"". New flood barriers arrived in Ironbridge earlier Engineers had been ""really impressed with how the barriers have held up"", Mr Norton added. ""Even though they moved, even though there was some damage, they still did their job. ""The worst hasn't happened... and we're confident they will offer really good protection in the coming days."" Deep marks have appeared on the road near flood defences in Ironbridge Residents were forced to evacuate their homes when waterseeped under the defences on Wednesday. Up to 80mm of rain is expected to fall in parts of Wales when the latest storm hits and the Met Office said the forecast was ""not good news"" for the already flood-hit communities. 'Show us you care prime minister' In Pictures: Flood-hit areas in the Midlands Latest updates on flooding in the West Midlands ""With the ground being so sodden, there's no capacity at all for that to be absorbed,"" Chris Bainger, from the Environment Agency (EA) said. ""We'll probably find all that water making its way into the head of the Severn and working its way through."" Dozens of flood warnings are in place along the length of the river, with Shrewsbury and Worcester still recovering from the aftermath of Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis earlier this month. River levels in Ironbridge have so far dropped by about 1.5m, from a peak of about 6.8m on Wednesday to 5.2m. Ch Supt Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police, said a fresh deluge was expected to hit the town from Sunday night. By Sarah Bishop, BBC Midlands Floodwater has started to recede in Shrewsbury Everyone seems to be very resilient and getting back to normal as much as they can. The pub, the Hop & Friar, lost about Â£15,000 of stock, all that was in the cellar practically, but it is open for business and has been for a few days. They just put their barrels behind the bar instead of in the cellar. The Darwin Townhouse B&B still has water in one of the downstairs rooms but the owners are resigned to the fact that is how it is going to be. The owners had insurance for four years, tried to reinsure just before Storm Dennis struck but could not get any. In the streets, where people were once canoeing, I can now see children on scooters and skateboards and people pushing pushchairs. Most people are not even wearing their wellies, they are just going about their day-to-day business. The shops are open, children have been to school - it just seems a normal day in Shrewsbury. The defence work follows a visit by Environment SecretaryGeorge Eustice who went to Ironbridge and Shrewsbury on Thursday, after Boris Johnson was criticised for not visiting the flooded areas. Steven Clarke, who runs greengrocers The Allotment in Coleham, Shrewsbury, said the minister only listened to their woes when he was approached. Mr Clarke fears it could have just been a ""PR exercise"", adding: ""He's assured us that he will go back and there will be more information provided to us. ""I will be looking for answers."" George Eustice was shown a screen showing images of flood defences during a visit to Ironbridge Shrewsbury is getting back to normal after flooding but more bad weather is expected Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued 185 people from the floodwaters and helped to evacuate a further 204 since 15 February. It has also rescued 19 dogs, 10 cats, 55 sheep, a pony, a parrot and a snake, the service added.

WHO issues 'highest alert' over coronavirus,"The World Health Organization upgrades the global risk from the coronavirus to ""very high"" Sources in Iran tell the BBC at least 210 have died of coronavirus there, far more than the official figure Stock markets across the globe are suffering their worst week since 2008 The first British death from Covid-19 is announced in Japan Nigeria and Mexico confirm their first cases China confirms another 327 cases - the lowest daily increase for a month - and 44 deaths, mainly in Hubei David Walker and Kathryn Snowdon We are ending today's live coverage of the growing

To recap: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the coronavirus is the government's ""top priority"" and defended the decision not to repatriate people from quarantined cruise ship the Diamond Princess sooner. He said the government had been following the ""best medical advice"" as he tried to reassure people that the NHS was making ""every possible preparation"". His comments come aftera British man who was on board the cruise ship died from the disease. Mr Johnson said: ""We were following the best medical advice. We very much regret the loss of life of the individual concerned but we think that the best thing to do is not to move people around too much in the current situation. ""Not to repatriate unless you can be absolutely sure there is not going to be a spread or contagion to this country - that's the principle we are adopting."" The PM is due to chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday in response to a growing number of cases in Europe. Although UK shares havelost almost 13% of their value, this is not the worst week for the FTSE 100. This chart shows how the latest FTSE 100 plunge compares to other drops since 2000.  ""Please enter with masks and gloves for the safety of everyone"", says the sign on a shop door in San Fiorano, one of the 11 northern Italian towns under lockdown to stop transmission of coronavirus. The shop also asks that only four people enter at one time. Italy has 650 confirmed cases and 17 deaths, mostly in the regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Richard Ratcliffe, whose British-Iranian wife Nazanin isbeing held in an Iranian jail, says he fears she might be at risk of contracting the coronavirus as she wakes up shivering, has a severe sore throat and ""a cold"". Mr Ratcliffe says conditions in the Evin prison in Tehran have been ""worsening"" over the past few months. He told the i newspaper that a lack of medicine, disinfectant, bleach and antiseptic in prison shops had forced prisoners to depend on washing liquid to stay clean. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it remains ""extremely concerned"" about Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's welfare. As Iran reports rising numbers of coronavirus cases, its parliament has supsended its sessions ""until further notice"". A parliamentary official quoted in Iran's Fars news agency said the decision was based on advice from the health ministry about ""the outbreak and the risks it has"". The Iranian parliament, known as the Majlis, is also expected not to ratify the state budget for the Iranian new year starting 20 March and will instead pass a temporary emergency budget, the official said. At least 210 Covid-19 patients have died in Iran, sources within the country's health care system have told BBC Persian. This figure, as of Thursday evening, is way above the official figure of 34. The official figure for infected people is at 388 but many have challenged official figures. 
Most victims are from the capital, Tehran, and the city of Qom where the Iranian outbreak started. Iran's government has defended its response to the spread of the virus and denied it is withholding information about the number of people affected. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: Romania's Orthodox Church has advised worshippers not to kiss the icons in church to avoid transmitting 

the coronavirus. People can, however, kiss icons in their own homes, the church advises in a statement. In addition, 

worshippers ""may exceptionally ask the priest"" to use their own spoon for Holy Communion rather than 

share one.

Anyone too ill to attend Mass is advised to drink holy water at home, the statement adds. People are packing up after The Geneva Motor Show was cancelled. The decision to pull one of the biggest events in the auto industry calendar came after an order from the Swiss federal government, banning gatherings of more than 1000 people, in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus. The entertainment industry has been significantly affected by the outbreak, with major acts pulling shows. BTS said the cancellations were ""unavoidable"" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The first death of a
Brit from the coronavirus is, sadly, not a surprise. This
outbreak has killed around 2,800 people, most of them in China. As
the number of people infected with the virus increases, so too will the number
of deaths. That
is why attention continues to be on China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. Each
of those countries still has full-blown outbreaks of the coronavirus and their
efforts to contain it will be crucial. Other
countries are already feeling the ripple effects of these outbreaks. The latest
cases in the UK are connected to either Iran or Italy. For
now there is no coronavirus outbreak in the UK, but further imported cases are
almost inevitable for as long as other countries have large numbers of
infections Tokyo's Disneyland and DisneySea are to close from Saturday until 15 March amid the coronavirus 

outbreak, operators said. The decision to close the parks, which attract millions of visitors a year, follows government advice to 

curtail large gatherings, Oriental Land Co Ltd said. Osaka-based Universal Studios theme park also said it would close until 15 March.
Japan has had five deaths and more than 200 confirmed cases of the virus, as well as another 700 cases and five more deaths from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama. An Italian-Nigerian footballer has reportedly become the first professional player to be infected with the coronavirus. King Paul Akpan Udoh, 22, who plays for Pianese in Serie C, was diagnosed on Thursday and has been quarantined,media outlets have reported.,external He was once on the books of Italian giants Juventus before dropping to the country's third tier. Footballers worried about the impact of coronavirushave been contacting unions""out of fear"" they could be forced to play in ""high-risk environments"", according to global body Fifpro. It said in a statement Fifro said there was a danger of football ""acting as a vehicle to spread"" the disease. ""Our talks with various football stakeholders also address the rescheduling of international dates, including but not limited to qualifying matches for this yearâs Tokyo Olympics and 2022 FIFA World Cup,"" Fifpro said. AFC Champions League matches due to take place next week have already been rescheduled as a result of the growing outbreak. Dr Mike Ryan, the WHOâs director of health emergencies, has explained that the global risk level of ""very high"" is the highest alert the organisation can declare. He said earlier that it would be ""unhelpful"" to declare a pandemic when the world was still trying to contain the virus. ""If we say there's a pandemic of coronavirus we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus. The data does not support that as yet,"" he said. We've just spoken to an official at Iceland's health directorate who confirmed that the country has recorded its first coronavirus case. The official was not able to offer further details, but local media reports say the patient is a man in his 50s who had been in Italy. The man is said to be showing ""typical symptoms"" of the virus, and is being kept in isolation. Efforts are underway to find out who else might have been exposed to the virus. The World Health Organization is disappointed that it cannot provide more protective equipment to medical workers because of a global shortage, executive director Dr Michael Ryan told a news conference in Geneva. In London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped by another 4.3%, or by 290 points. With one hour of trading left this week, it puts the blue-chip index on track for its lowest close since July 2016. So what happens next? Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: ""The weekend may provide time for heads to cool, and allow
investors to assess whether or not they want to re-enter the market at these
new lows â after all, from a certain perspective the market is now far more
approachable than when it was racing to all-time highs just last week. ""Of course, that is only if the next few days arenât
filled with round after round of alarming headlines. From a market perspective, an explosion of cases in the US would
likely be the most catastrophic turn the illness could take. Though thatâs not
to downplay the impact of the steadily increasing number of nations around the
world now seeing their first cases of the coronavirus, each new country pushing
us closer to a pandemic."" Dr Tedros said we don't need to wait for a vaccine though, as there are already ways to avoid catching and spreading the virus. Health experts across the world are asking people to wash their hands and catch coughs and sneezes. According to the UK's NHS, the best way to prevent spread requires lots of soap and plenty of disposable tissues. It's worth reminding ourselves of the symptoms of the coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes, Covid-19. Symptoms appear to begin with a raised temperature, followed by a dry cough - and then after a week. shortness of breath. And finally, ""self-isolation"" is a phrase we're hearing a lot. The BBC's Joseph Lee has explained what it meansand how to do it successfully. The WHO's Executive Director Dr Michael J
Ryan says no individual country is to blame for the outbreak. ""It's really important that our rhetoric and narrative is
balanced"" said Dr Ryan, adding that China was not responsible for
coronavirus, just as the Democratic Republic of Congo was not responsible for
Ebola. He said stigma âhad become part of the global narrative, which
is unhelpfulâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Coronavirus fears wipe Â£200bn off UK firms' valueLondon's FTSE 100 share index suffers one of its biggest falls since 2008 as the virus spreads.Business,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus. Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping Â£210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion.""

The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it remains ""extremely concerned"" about Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's welfare. As Iran reports rising numbers of coronavirus cases, its parliament has supsended its sessions ""until further notice"". A parliamentary official quoted in Iran's Fars news agency said the decision was based on advice from the health ministry about ""the outbreak and the risks it has"". The Iranian parliament, known as the Majlis, is also expected not to ratify the state budget for the Iranian new year starting 20 March and will instead pass a temporary emergency budget, the official said. At least 210 Covid-19 patients have died in Iran, sources within the country's health care system have told BBC Persian. This figure, as of Thursday evening, is way above the official figure of 34. The official figure for infected people is at 388 but many have challenged official figures. 
Most victims are from the capital, Tehran, and the city of Qom where the Iranian outbreak started. Iran's government has defended its response to the spread of the virus and denied it is withholding information about the number of people affected. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: Romania's Orthodox Church has advised worshippers not to kiss the icons in church to avoid transmitting 

the coronavirus. People can, however, kiss icons in their own homes, the church advises in a statement. In addition, 

worshippers ""may exceptionally ask the priest"" to use their own spoon for Holy Communion rather than 

share one.

Anyone too ill to attend Mass is advised to drink holy water at home, the statement adds. People are packing up after The Geneva Motor Show was cancelled. The decision to pull one of the biggest events in the auto industry calendar came after an order from the Swiss federal government, banning gatherings of more than 1000 people, in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus. The entertainment industry has been significantly affected by the outbreak, with major acts pulling shows. BTS said the cancellations were ""unavoidable"" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The first death of a
Brit from the coronavirus is, sadly, not a surprise. This
outbreak has killed around 2,800 people, most of them in China. As
the number of people infected with the virus increases, so too will the number
of deaths. That
is why attention continues to be on China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. Each
of those countries still has full-blown outbreaks of the coronavirus and their
efforts to contain it will be crucial. Other
countries are already feeling the ripple effects of these outbreaks. The latest
cases in the UK are connected to either Iran or Italy. For
now there is no coronavirus outbreak in the UK, but further imported cases are
almost inevitable for as long as other countries have large numbers of
infections Tokyo's Disneyland and DisneySea are to close from Saturday until 15 March amid the coronavirus 

outbreak, operators said. The decision to close the parks, which attract millions of visitors a year, follows government advice to 

curtail large gatherings, Oriental Land Co Ltd said. Osaka-based Universal Studios theme park also said it would close until 15 March.
Japan has had five deaths and more than 200 confirmed cases of the virus, as well as another 700 cases and five more deaths from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama. An Italian-Nigerian footballer has reportedly become the first professional player to be infected with the coronavirus. King Paul Akpan Udoh, 22, who plays for Pianese in Serie C, was diagnosed on Thursday and has been quarantined,media outlets have reported.,external He was once on the books of Italian giants Juventus before dropping to the country's third tier. Footballers worried about the impact of coronavirushave been contacting unions""out of fear"" they could be forced to play in ""high-risk environments"", according to global body Fifpro. It said in a statement Fifro said there was a danger of football ""acting as a vehicle to spread"" the disease. ""Our talks with various football stakeholders also address the rescheduling of international dates, including but not limited to qualifying matches for this yearâs Tokyo Olympics and 2022 FIFA World Cup,"" Fifpro said. AFC Champions League matches due to take place next week have already been rescheduled as a result of the growing outbreak. Dr Mike Ryan, the WHOâs director of health emergencies, has explained that the global risk level of ""very high"" is the highest alert the organisation can declare. He said earlier that it would be ""unhelpful"" to declare a pandemic when the world was still trying to contain the virus. ""If we say there's a pandemic of coronavirus we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus. The data does not support that as yet,"" he said. We've just spoken to an official at Iceland's health directorate who confirmed that the country has recorded its first coronavirus case. The official was not able to offer further details, but local media reports say the patient is a man in his 50s who had been in Italy. The man is said to be showing ""typical symptoms"" of the virus, and is being kept in isolation. Efforts are underway to find out who else might have been exposed to the virus. The World Health Organization is disappointed that it cannot provide more protective equipment to medical workers because of a global shortage, executive director Dr Michael Ryan told a news conference in Geneva. In London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped by another 4.3%, or by 290 points. With one hour of trading left this week, it puts the blue-chip index on track for its lowest close since July 2016. So what happens next? Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: ""The weekend may provide time for heads to cool, and allow
investors to assess whether or not they want to re-enter the market at these
new lows â after all, from a certain perspective the market is now far more
approachable than when it was racing to all-time highs just last week. ""Of course, that is only if the next few days arenât
filled with round after round of alarming headlines. From a market perspective, an explosion of cases in the US would
likely be the most catastrophic turn the illness could take. Though thatâs not
to downplay the impact of the steadily increasing number of nations around the
world now seeing their first cases of the coronavirus, each new country pushing
us closer to a pandemic."" Dr Tedros said we don't need to wait for a vaccine though, as there are already ways to avoid catching and spreading the virus. Health experts across the world are asking people to wash their hands and catch coughs and sneezes. According to the UK's NHS, the best way to prevent spread requires lots of soap and plenty of disposable tissues. It's worth reminding ourselves of the symptoms of the coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes, Covid-19. Symptoms appear to begin with a raised temperature, followed by a dry cough - and then after a week. shortness of breath. And finally, ""self-isolation"" is a phrase we're hearing a lot. The BBC's Joseph Lee has explained what it meansand how to do it successfully. The WHO's Executive Director Dr Michael J
Ryan says no individual country is to blame for the outbreak. ""It's really important that our rhetoric and narrative is
balanced"" said Dr Ryan, adding that China was not responsible for
coronavirus, just as the Democratic Republic of Congo was not responsible for
Ebola. He said stigma âhad become part of the global narrative, which
is unhelpfulâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Crossbow murder: Killer to serve at least 31 years,"Gerald Corrigan died last May, three weeks after being shot outside his home with a crossbow bolt A man has been jailed for at least 31 years for murdering a retired lecturer with a crossbow. Terence Whall, 39, of Bryngwran, Anglesey, was found guilty of killing Gerald Corrigan, 74, in April 2019. Whall was handed a life sentence at Mold Crown Court. Mr Corrigan's partner Marie Bailey told the court she was ""devastated"" by his death and had been left with the ""image of his lifeblood"" spilling out after the shooting. Whall was lying in wait for Mr Corrigan at his remote home near the South Stack headland on the island, when he ventured out of his home to fix a satellite dish - which had been tampered with. He was shot with a crossbow using a razor sharp broadhead arrow bolt, sustaining two holes in his stomach and damage to other organs. He died in hospital three weeks later after developing sepsis. This video can not be played How the crossbow killer was caught Whall, a sports therapist, maintained throughout the trial that he was having sex with a man in a field on the night Mr Corrigan was shot. Thomas Barry Williams denied this -saying the pair had only ever been friends. But Whall's precise movements on the night of the killing were tracked by data from ""black box"" technology in a Land Rover, which belonged to his partner and which he had borrowed. The prosecution said without this, he would have got away with his lies. The home Gerald Corrigan's partner shared with him is now ""tainted"", she said Marie Bailey said losing Gerald Corrigan had been a ""deep, agonising loss"". In a victim impact statement read from behind screens at Mold Crown Court, she said he ""didn't have a chance"" after being shot by Whall. ""He was everything to me. I miss him so much. He was my love,"" she said. ""I am absolutely devastated to lose him."" The court heard Ms Bailey has multiple sclerosis and was upstairs at their home when Mr Corrigan was hit. ""I was not there. I could not help,"" she said. ""I will never forget Gerry clutching what was a terrible injury. The pain must have been excruciating.Â  I could not do anything. She said the impact of his murder had been a living hell, and said the memories ""of our beautiful home that we shared is now tainted"". ""Now he is gone I feel I have a lesser life, I have an ache and emptiness that will not stop,"" she added. How a crossbow killer was caught How in-car technology helped catch crossbow killer Mr Corrigan's son Neil told the court he was undergoing counselling in a bid to come to terms with what happened to his father. ""How could someone choose to use such a barbaric weapon on an old man? Did they really want to cause him a slow painful death?"" he told the court. ""I hope one day I can remember the good times and stop being traumatised by bad memories."" Mr Corrigan's daughter Fiona added: ""Hearing the news was just awful. ""Planning the funeral was the hardest thing I have ever done. ""The worst thing of all of this is that I will never get to hold my dad again."" This Land Rover, belonging to Whall's partner, was found burned out on the outskirts of Bangor Whall and another man, Gavin Jones, 36, of High Street, Bangor, were also found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and Jones was found guilty of arson of a motor vehicle. Whall was given a concurrent sentence of six years for the arson charges, while Jones was jailed for five years. Darren Jones, 41, and Martin Roberts, 34, had already pleaded guilty to arson. They were handed sentences of two years and 10 months, and two years and four months. Jailing Whall for life, Mrs Justice Jefford said he had been found guilty of ""the vicious murder of Gerald Corrigan"". ""For your own reasons, you clearly had a plan to kill,"" the judge said. ""You have deprived Mr Corrigan's family of any explanation."" ""Your arrogant belief that you could get away with murder was misplaced,"" she told him. He had ""carried on as if nothing had happened"" after the murder and ""thought you had got away with it"". There was a ""very significant degree of planning,"" the judge said. Referring to the broadhead crossbow bolts he used, she said: ""I have no doubt that you well knew that they were designed for hunting animals. In other words, they were designed to kill."" She was satisfied he interfered with Mr Corrigan's satellite dish to ""draw him outside"". Mr Corrigan's death was ""slow and agonising,"" she said. Whall showed no emotion throughout. Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney led the murder investigation Speaking afterwards, with Mr Corrigan's partner by his side, Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney welcomed the sentences. ""Gerald was an innocent victim of a truly barbaric murder,"" he said. ""This was a complex murder investigation supported by numerous experts and professionals and a very dedicated investigation team."" But the officer also indicated that this may not be the end of the investigation. ""I continue to keep an open mind as to why Gerald was targeted, but clearly as outlined by Peter Rouch QC, someone wanted Gerald Corrigan dead,"" said Det Ch Insp Kearney. ""This is clearly, in a wider context, that the victim Gerald was a source of potential grief to local criminality. ""If anyone has any information regarding this, please feel free to contact me in the strictest confidence."" Man guilty of 'medieval-style' crossbow murder How a crossbow killer was caught.

Leasehold property buyers 'misled by developers',"An investigation into the leasehold property market has found ""worrying evidence"" that buyers are being treated unfairly and charged unreasonable fees. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said many homeowners found themselves in ""serious traps"" after being misled by housing developers. It said it would take action against firms, calling for a change in the law and for refunds to be paid. But it has not disclosed any names so far as it continues to investigate. The CMA found some buyers were not told upfront that a property was leasehold and what this meant. By the time people found out the realities of owning a leasehold, including regular ground rent charges, they were often unable to pull out of the sale, or would have found it very difficult. In some cases, ground rents doubled every 10 years. This increase is often built into contracts, meaning people can struggle to sell their homes and find themselves trapped. 'We've been caught in a leasehold trap' Home leasehold system needs reform, says MPs George Lusty from the CMA told BBC Radio 5 live that people could be in line for refunds. ""If we can attack and challenge these unfair ground rent terms, then they're invalid - all the money that was collected on them isn't valid and that has to be paid back,"" he said. ""We're going to do everything we can to get people out of these really serious traps they find themselves in. ""People aren't able to take mortgages on these properties. They can't sell them, that's a terrible outcome and absolutely devastating for the people affected."" This could result in firms signing legal commitments to change how they do business, and being taken to court if they do not comply. The CMA said there should be a ban on the sale of new leasehold houses, while ground rents for new leases should be slashed to zero. Concerns have long been raised by MPs and consumer groups aboutunfair leasehold contracts, with costly fees or onerous terms, prompting the CMA to announce the investigation last year. Campaigners have called for leaseholds to be abolished, while some developers say they still have a place. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""In the past two years, the government has taken more action to stop unfair leasehold practices than ever before - including reducing ground rents to a peppercorn and banning the sale of new leasehold houses. ""But we know more needs to be done to support leaseholders and the CMA report echoes our commitment to bring forward legislation to reduce ground rents to zero for future leases."" John Healey MP, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said: ""Labour and leasehold campaigners forced this investigation last year and it confirms the scale of the problems with leasehold mis-selling. ""Ministers should legislate to stop the sale of new leasehold homes and end the unfair fees and contract terms that existing leasehold homeowners face.""

Motherwell manager acquitted of assault charges,"This video can not be played Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson cleared of assaulting his partner Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson has been acquitted of assaulting his partner in Edinburgh last year. Mr Robinson, 45, was on trial at at Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of assaulting Robyn Lauchlan on Waverley Bridge on 13 December. The football manager had denied the charges against him. Ms Lauchlan earlier told the trial he had been trying to calm her down while she was upset and she had asked prosecutors not to bring charges. Sheriff John Cook said it was quite proper that the Crown had brought the matter to court but he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged offences had taken place. It had been alleged that Mr Robinson grabbed Ms Lauchlan, pushed and pulled her and pinned her against a fence on Waverley Bridge, next to the Edinburgh Christmas markets. The 45-year-old was also accused of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by shouting, swearing and acting aggressively. Mr Robinson has been the manager of Motherwell since 2017 But Mr Robinson told the trial he had never been abusive to his partner and said he found the idea ""disgusting"". Giving evidence at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, the former Northern Ireland international said: ""My sole intention was just to calm her down and get her home safely."" The trial hadpreviously heard from Ms Lauchlanthat she was distressed because her partner did not intervene when a man who had been speaking to him in a city centre bar told her aggressively to ""shut up"". She said ""I thought: 'Why is (Stephen) not saying anything to this man who has just ridiculed me in front of everyone and Stephen has allowed him to do it?""' But the 28-year-old said she was ""drunk and behaved like an idiot"" and claimed Mr Robinson was ""paying the price"" for this. In her evidence, Ms Lauchlan also criticised domestic abuse laws and told the trial that prosecuting her partner was ""unfair and wrong"". The couple insisted the incident on Waverley Bridge had been misinterpreted Mr Robinson told the court he had no previous convictions and had never assaulted Ms Lauchlan. He said that when Ms Lauchlan later saw him at Waverley railway station she walked over and ""gave me a big kiss and cuddle"". He told the trial: ""She looked as if she had calmed down. My priority was to make sure she was getting home safely."" Mr Robinson said he was ""used to things"" like the earlier incident in the bar, but became exasperated by her reaction. He added that he wanted to calm her down and had raised his voice and swore. The court heard Ms Lauchlan wrote several letters to the procurator fiscal asking for the charges to be dropped, including one criticising domestic abuse law. ""It terrifies me how easy it is to ruin someone's life with this new law in place,"" she wrote. In a statement after the case concluded, Ms Lauchlan said: ""In no shape or form have I ever been a victim of domestic abuse. At no stage did Stephen push, shove or frighten me. He did not do the things he was accused of. She added: ""The stress this has caused both of us, and our families, is impossible to emphasise enough. It has taken an immeasurable toll on our lives all because the system has failed us both.""

"Race to repair flood barriers before Jorge hitsMore heavy rain is expected in Ironbridge, Shropshire, as engineers replaced damaged defences.Shropshire","Environment Agency teams have been working on temporary flood barriers in the Wharfage area of Ironbridge Engineers have repaired damaged flood defences ahead of a new storm that threatens to bring more heavy rain. Dave Throup, from the Environment Agency, praised the ""Herculean efforts"" to fix the barriers in Ironbridge, Shropshire before Storm Jorge. A severeflood warning,external- meaning a danger to life - for the River Severn at Ironbridge was downgraded on Friday.

There are nine yellowweather warnings,externalfor rain, wind and snow in force across the UK for Saturday, as the country prepares for the fresh storm. Barriers along the river in Ironbridge were pushed back 2m (6ft 6ins) as up to 500 tonnes of water per second flowed through the town. Tim Norton, from the agency, said: ""We're not out of the woods yet."" Earlier on Friday, he said engineers had carried out inspections ""right the way along the barrier"" and were ""replacing the parts that need to be replaced and getting it all ready"". New flood barriers arrived in Ironbridge earlier Engineers had been ""really impressed with how the barriers have held up"", Mr Norton added. ""Even though they moved, even though there was some damage, they still did their job. ""The worst hasn't happened... and we're confident they will offer really good protection in the coming days."" Deep marks have appeared on the road near flood defences in Ironbridge Residents were forced to evacuate their homes when waterseeped under the defences on Wednesday. Up to 80mm of rain is expected to fall in parts of Wales when the latest storm hits and the Met Office said the forecast was ""not good news"" for the already flood-hit communities. 'Show us you care prime minister' In Pictures: Flood-hit areas in the Midlands Latest updates on flooding in the West Midlands ""With the ground being so sodden, there's no capacity at all for that to be absorbed,"" Chris Bainger, from the Environment Agency (EA) said. ""We'll probably find all that water making its way into the head of the Severn and working its way through."" Dozens of flood warnings are in place along the length of the river, with Shrewsbury and Worcester still recovering from the aftermath of Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis earlier this month. River levels in Ironbridge have so far dropped by about 1.5m, from a peak of about 6.8m on Wednesday to 5.2m. Ch Supt Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police, said a fresh deluge was expected to hit the town from Sunday night. By Sarah Bishop, BBC Midlands Floodwater has started to recede in Shrewsbury Everyone seems to be very resilient and getting back to normal as much as they can. The pub, the Hop & Friar, lost about Â£15,000 of stock, all that was in the cellar practically, but it is open for business and has been for a few days. They just put their barrels behind the bar instead of in the cellar. The Darwin Townhouse B&B still has water in one of the downstairs rooms but the owners are resigned to the fact that is how it is going to be. The owners had insurance for four years, tried to reinsure just before Storm Dennis struck but could not get any. In the streets, where people were once canoeing, I can now see children on scooters and skateboards and people pushing pushchairs. Most people are not even wearing their wellies, they are just going about their day-to-day business. The shops are open, children have been to school - it just seems a normal day in Shrewsbury. The defence work follows a visit by Environment SecretaryGeorge Eustice who went to Ironbridge and Shrewsbury on Thursday, after Boris Johnson was criticised for not visiting the flooded areas. Steven Clarke, who runs greengrocers The Allotment in Coleham, Shrewsbury, said the minister only listened to their woes when he was approached. Mr Clarke fears it could have just been a ""PR exercise"", adding: ""He's assured us that he will go back and there will be more information provided to us. ""I will be looking for answers."" George Eustice was shown a screen showing images of flood defences during a visit to Ironbridge Shrewsbury is getting back to normal after flooding but more bad weather is expected Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued 185 people from the floodwaters and helped to evacuate a further 204 since 15 February. It has also rescued 19 dogs, 10 cats, 55 sheep, a pony, a parrot and a snake, the service added.

Abuse by paddle steamer captain 'left me broken'A victim of paedophile David Neill speaks out after he is jailed for seven years for abusing boys in the 1980s.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Jim Scott waived his right to anonymity and spoke to BBC Scotland from his home in Canada A victim of former Waverley captain David Neill has told how the paedophile left him ""broken"". Jim Scott was just 15 when he was given a job as a galley boy on the world-famous paddle steamer. But he soon discovered the lure of a naval career was a front for Neil to groom and sexually abuse young boys. As Neill was jailed for seven years, Mr Scott revealed he still suffers flashbacks to his ordeal, which led to him being diagnosed with PTSD. He told BBC Scotland: ""I feel shame and embarrassment of being afraid to tell anyone. Not knowing if people would believe me. ""I lived with this dirty secret for over three decades."" Mr Scott is now a father-of-five living quietly in Canada. He waived his right to anonymity after Neill, 75, wasfound guiltyof four charges of indecent assault between 1982 and 1987. He continues to deny the offences. The extent of his ongoing torment was revealed in a victim impact statement submitted to the High Court in Glasgow. It states: ""David Neill totally dismantled my life. ""He has caused decades of pain, decades of feeling unworthy, ashamed, embarrassed. ""No amount of therapy or medication can replace what is lost. I am broken, I doubt I will ever be whole."" Predator David Neill groomed teenage boys with the promise of jobs Passing sentence,judge Tom Hughes QC,externaltold Neill he had committed ""an appalling series of offences"" after offering the boys a job on the Waverley and the prospect of a naval career. He added: ""With hindsight they now acknowledge that you were actually grooming them and using them for your own selfish, evil, sexual gratification."" The judge also praised the dignity of the victims and acknowledged they have been left with ""horrendous lifelong consequences"". Neill, of Galston, East Ayrshire, captained the Waverley from 1975 to 1997. In 1998, he was jailed for three years at Glasgow Sheriff Court after being found guilty of abusing five teenage boys in his cabin. Mr Scott, 53, said he was not aware of Neill's previous conviction when he contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) about his experiences in November 2017. His testimony set in motion a Police Scotland investigation which uncovered two further victims. Mr Scott said he finally reported the abuse after he confided in a friend about his ordeal amid fears he was about to ""implode"" He added: ""It was not to do with confidence, it was more to do with survival."" Mr Scott first met Neill when the Waverley skipper picked him up as he hitchhiked from his farm home outside Uplawmoor, East Renfrewshire, in March 1982. He recalled: ""When we were driving into Beith, he asked me what I wanted to do when I left school and I told him I wanted to go into the merchant navy. ""At that point, he announced he was Captain David Neill of the paddle steamer Waverley."" Neill later gave the teenager a lift home and asked his parents if he could take him to see the Waverley, with a view to getting him a job on the boat. Neill captained the famous Waverley paddle steamer from 1975 to 1997 Mr Scott said the idea of a professional life at sea was ""more than a dream"". He said: ""Back then, one in four were unemployed and kids coming out of school never really had any prospects. ""I got a job on a ship without really trying. It was going to lead to the merchant navy. I had high, high hopes."" That weekend, Neill drove the teenager to Glasgow to see the legendary paddle steamer. But, en-route, the serial paedophile spoke to his prospective victim about the ""bad ladies"" and started touching him. Mr Scott said he believed Neill was telling him something important, ""without even realising what he was doing"". Mr Scott on his first ""proper"" holiday in 22 years after overcoming a fear of looking at the sea The following week, he quit school and went to work on the Waverley. The teenager had a bunk on board and performed a range of tasks, from washing dishes to cleaning the galley. Mr Scott, who now lives in Airdrie, Alberta, said: ""It wasn't very glamorous, but it was a job that I thought would take me somewhere."" Despite what had happened in Neill's car, Mr Scott initially believed he was a ""nice guy"" and described him as a ""father figure"" to the young boys who worked on the ship. But over the next few weeks, he was sexually abused up to a dozen times - including in the captain's cabin. Shortly after turning 16 in April 1982, he jumped ship in Fort William and hitchhiked home. In his victim impact statement, Mr Scott said he regularly experiences flashbacks. He wrote: ""I still see David Neill in his car or in his cabin. I see him sitting on his bunk with his vest and lots of body hair reaching out to touch me. I can feel his hand and hear his voice."" The statement continues: ""All I did was exist, devoid of happiness and any real feelings. ""I often wonder why I decided to stay on this planet. Most days I have moments where I feel like crying."" Jim Scott now lives quietly with his five children in Canada Mr Scott, who moved to Canada in 1997 and has never returned to Scotland, describes himself as a loner and said he finds it difficult to socialise. He has told his children about what happened to him and hopes speaking openly about his experiences will aid his recovery. Mr Scott said: ""I don't think David Neill understands the impact he has had on many lives. ""I think offenders like him take a lot more from the victims than they can ever comprehend.

Breaking|Breaking newsUK top shares in worst week since financial crisisUK's FTSE 100 share index hit by biggest one-week fall since 2008 financial crisis amid coronavirus fearsBusiness,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus. Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping Â£210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion.""

Abuse by paddle steamer captain 'left me broken',"Jim Scott waived his right to anonymity and spoke to BBC Scotland from his home in Canada A victim of former Waverley captain David Neill has told how the paedophile left him ""broken"". Jim Scott was just 15 when he was given a job as a galley boy on the world-famous paddle steamer. But he soon discovered the lure of a naval career was a front for Neil to groom and sexually abuse young boys. As Neill was jailed for seven years, Mr Scott revealed he still suffers flashbacks to his ordeal, which led to him being diagnosed with PTSD. He told BBC Scotland: ""I feel shame and embarrassment of being afraid to tell anyone. Not knowing if people would believe me. ""I lived with this dirty secret for over three decades."" Mr Scott is now a father-of-five living quietly in Canada. He waived his right to anonymity after Neill, 75, wasfound guiltyof four charges of indecent assault between 1982 and 1987. He continues to deny the offences. The extent of his ongoing torment was revealed in a victim impact statement submitted to the High Court in Glasgow. It states: ""David Neill totally dismantled my life. ""He has caused decades of pain, decades of feeling unworthy, ashamed, embarrassed. ""No amount of therapy or medication can replace what is lost. I am broken, I doubt I will ever be whole."" Predator David Neill groomed teenage boys with the promise of jobs Passing sentence,judge Tom Hughes QC,externaltold Neill he had committed ""an appalling series of offences"" after offering the boys a job on the Waverley and the prospect of a naval career. He added: ""With hindsight they now acknowledge that you were actually grooming them and using them for your own selfish, evil, sexual gratification."" The judge also praised the dignity of the victims and acknowledged they have been left with ""horrendous lifelong consequences"". Neill, of Galston, East Ayrshire, captained the Waverley from 1975 to 1997. In 1998, he was jailed for three years at Glasgow Sheriff Court after being found guilty of abusing five teenage boys in his cabin. Mr Scott, 53, said he was not aware of Neill's previous conviction when he contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) about his experiences in November 2017. His testimony set in motion a Police Scotland investigation which uncovered two further victims. Mr Scott said he finally reported the abuse after he confided in a friend about his ordeal amid fears he was about to ""implode"" He added: ""It was not to do with confidence, it was more to do with survival."" Mr Scott first met Neill when the Waverley skipper picked him up as he hitchhiked from his farm home outside Uplawmoor, East Renfrewshire, in March 1982.

I'm a journalist in pain - I can't show weakness,"BBC investigative journalist Sam Poling has spoken publicly about living with endometriosis after years of keeping the condition private For much of her professional life, Sam Poling has spent time in the company of counterfeit cigarette gangs, cocaine traffickers and convicted murderers while undercover. The BBC investigative journalist, 46, has remained calm in high pressure situations and has managed often exhaustive scrutiny over her work. ""Showing any sign of weakness is never going to work,"" she said. This is partly why she never spoke publicly about living with a chronic condition which at times left her on her knees crying with pain. The condition that can take over seven years to diagnose Endometriosis: Thousands share devastating impact of condition Women 'taking their own lives' due to lack of support Endometriosis affects one in 10 women in the UK - Sam has lived with hers since she was a girl, speaking about it only to close friends and family. Now,as first reported in The Scottish Sun,external, she has shared her story publicly following in the footsteps ofBBC colleague Fiona Stalker,external- a fellow sufferer who has raised awareness of the condition. ""Fiona was brave enough to talk - and I've spent my entire time begging people to talk to me in my job,"" Sam said. ""You spend so many years in pain and not being believed that you become numb."" The condition means cells like the ones in the lining of the womb (uterus) are found elsewhere in the body. Each month these cells react in the same way to those inside the womb - building up, then breaking down and bleeding, but with no way to escape. Painful periods are just one of potential symptoms, which can also include pain during sex, heavy, prolonged or irregular periods, pain when passing urine, symptoms of irritable bowel, back and leg pain, fatigue, infertility and depression. Surgery can also cause adhesions - which are bands of scar tissue that can bind two organs together. Because some symptoms are shared by other illnesses, diagnosis is very difficult. On average it takes more than seven years between a woman first seeing a doctor about their symptoms and receiving a firm diagnosis. The cause is unknown and there is no definitive cure. Sam is best known for investigations on BBC's Panorama and Disclosure - most recently her work on the documentaryWho Killed Emma?won the Nations & Regions Current Affairs award at the annual RTS ceremony. Many of her colleagues had no idea of the pain she experiences, not just during a period, but for three out of four weeks every month. The condition first emerged when Sam was 12, but it was not diagnosed until she was 30. She describes the feeling as ""the worst pain you can imagine deep inside your body"" - and has often walked around doubled up in pain. Surgeons who could not find the cause through operations told her she was being ""dramatic"". Sam has won numerous BAFTAs for her work, including the 2009 Panorama programme Crime Pays ""When I was growing up I just thought being on your hands and knees crying on the floor every month was normal,"" she said. ""Whenever I went to the doctor or complained I was told I had a low pain threshold - that I was making it up to get off school or uni. ""This is the story for so many women, you're made out you're lying and that was it for a long time because takes so long to get a diagnosis."" In an effort to manage her condition, Sam has had ""countless"" operations and been put through chemical menopause three times. The procedure is unpleasant and causes almost immediate symptoms including hot flushes and memory loss. Doctors have repeatedly recommended she receive a hysterectomy - which does not guarantee an end to pain. She said: ""Not being able to remember the day, who I'm interviewing or the questions I'm asking and having a constant battle with yourself because you don't want to say 'I'm struggling' -  that's my problem. ""When you spend years being belittled, humiliated, embarrassed, ignored and dismissed by people who should have been helping you at the time, you learn to silence yourself."" In her spare time Sam bikes around the Scottish Highlands In the past Sam has been able to take comfort in the support of her closest colleagues. She welcomes the news that BBC Scotland has now become an endometriosis-friendly employer. The scheme,external- run by the charity Endometriosis UK - enables employers to better support women with the condition by educating staff, breaking stigmas and encouraging practical adjustments in working life. A spokeswoman for Endometriosis UK said: ""With female employment rates higher than ever before and endometriosis costing the UK economy Â£8.2bn a year in loss of work, treatment and healthcare costs, endometriosis is a condition that employers cannot afford to ignore."" The charity recently surveyed about 2,000 people in the UK on awareness - less than half the people asked in Scotland knew what endometriosis was. MPs have launched an inquiry into women's experiences of endometriosis followingrecent BBC researchwhere half of the 13,500 women questioned said they experienced suicidal thoughts - many also said they rely on highly addictive painkillers. Now under the care of a ""life changing"" consultant, Sam hopes her story will help improve conditions for women who face endometriosis in the future. She added: ""Any conversation is a good conversation. I am delighted when I see and hear people talking about it and social media is a great thing for people to share these conversations. ""I think it was 18 months ago a young woman had made a video diary about life with endometriosis. It was just brilliant and I was so proud of her, yet so sad that I didn't have that at the beginning.""

Former Barclays bankers cleared of fraud charges,"Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalari and Richard Boath (left to right) were acquitted on all charges in under six hours Three former top Barclays executives have been cleared of fraud charges linked to how the bank raised billions from Qatar in the financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had alleged the bank had given Qatar secret fees that helped it to survive without a UK government bailout in 2008. Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris, and Richard Boath were found not guilty on all charges by the jury in under six hours. Former Barclays chief executive John Varley was acquitted in June 2019. The acquittal of the three men is a blow to the SFO and draws a line under an ambitious seven-and-a-half-year investigation that led to the first criminal charges in Britain against senior financiers at a major bank over credit crisis-era conduct. An SFO spokesperson said: ""Our prosecution decisions are always based on the evidence that is available, and we are determined to bring perpetrators of serious financial crime to justice. ""Wherever our evidential and public interest tests are met, we will always endeavour to bring this before a court."" Mr Boath, when leaving the Old Bailey on Friday morning, told the BBC: ""I'm very relieved about the verdict, particularly given that I was cleared in 2017 by the Financial Conduct Authority."" He added that the SFO should never have brought the case. Mr Boath said the last six years had been tough. But phone calls recorded during the crisis and played to the jury made clear he was innocent. ""Obviously there are ups and downs but today is a big up obviously. "" ""I frankly couldn't have done more in 2008 to make sure the bank didn't do anything that it regretted and that really comes out on all the tapes and I think that was obvious to the jury."" The acquittal of three former Barclays executives is the only time a jury has ruled on criminal allegations against senior bankers for events in the 2008 crisis. The senior executives in this trial, which began in October - Roger Jenkins, 64, Tom Kalaris, 64 and Richard Boath, 61 - were not the top bosses of Barclays. Instead, they were between one and four ranks down from the board of directors in the bank's hierarchical structure. The allegations centred on a giant fundraising exercise in 2008 which enabled Barclays to escape the nationalisation forced on its competitors, RBS, Lloyds and HBOS. The defendants were accused by prosecutors of conspiring to commit fraud in connection with that fundraising effort. They argued that it was not a fraud - and that if, alternatively, it was judged to be a fraud, they were not the ones who should be held accountable for it. Their actions, their barristers said, were approved and negotiated at the top of the bank and signed off by the banks' top lawyers. In the end, the jury took less than six hours to find in their favour. The decision comes as a setback for the Serious Fraud Office, which took years to launch its prosecution and has now had its case thrown out. The inside story of the Barclays trial The three former senior bankers were accused by the SFO of committing a fraud in the midst of the financial crisis - charges they have spent more than a year on trial denying. In 2008, Barclays, like other banks, was running dangerously low on cash. Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath helped to arrange a Â£12bn investment by sovereign wealth funds, including the Gulf state of Qatar. However, the Qataris demanded more than double the fees paid to other investors. The SFO said the bank decided to disguise their extra fees - Â£322m in total - by hiding them in what it said were pretend agreements for advisory services. The defendants said the agreements were approved at the top of the bank and signed off by its lawyers. Prosecutors had alleged Mr Jenkins, the head of the Middle East investment bank, Mr Kalaris, who ran Barclays' wealth unit, and former financial institutions head Mr Boath conspired with former finance director Chris Lucas to disguise a Â£42m payment to Qatar. The SFO said the bankers used a so-called ""advisory services agreement"" to mask the fact Barclays was paying Qatar more than twice the fees it was paying other investors that June. Mr Jenkins, who was described as the ""gatekeeper"" to the Qatari relationship, was also charged over a Â£280m, five-year agreement struck with Qatar four months later. Mr Lucas was not charged because he was too ill to stand trial. Qatar, a major investor in the UK and still a significant Barclays shareholder, was neither investigated nor accused of wrongdoing.

Eight-year ban for Olympic champion Sun,"Sun Yang was a double Olympic gold medallist at London 2012 and won the men's 200m freestyle title in 2016 China's three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang has been banned for eight years for missing a doping test in September 2018. The 28-year-old was initiallycleared of wrongdoing by Fina,,externalthe swimming federation, in January 2019. Following an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), the decision has been overturned. An eight-year ban was imposed on Sun because this was his second offence. He had served a three-month suspension in 2014 for taking prohibited stimulant Trimetazidine. Sun told China's Xinhua news agency that he plans to appeal against the decision. He said: ""This is unfair. I firmly believe in my innocence."" Fina said it would implement the decision ""notwithstanding any further legal action and as directed"". This video can not be played 'You're a loser, I'm a winner' - ugly scenes as GB's Scott refuses to share podium with Sun Cas said its decision can be challenged before the Swiss Federal Tribunal within 30 days. Sun had told an appeal hearing in November that he missed a test because testers failed to prove their identity when they arrived at his home. He also denied a vial containing his blood samples was smashed with a hammer. Cas said: ""The athlete failed to establish that he had a compelling justification to destroy his sample collection containers and forego the doping control when, in his opinion, the collection protocol was not in compliance with the ISTI (international standard for testing and investigations). ""As the Cas panel noted, it is one thing, having provided a blood sample, to question the accreditation of the testing personnel while keeping the intact samples in the possession of the testing authorities; it is quite another thing, after lengthy exchanges and warnings as to the consequences, to act in such a way that results in destroying the sample containers, thereby eliminating any chance of testing the sample at a later stage."" Wada welcomed the ruling,,externaland added that it was ""satisfied that justice in this case has been rendered"". At the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in July, Sun won gold in the 200m freestyle but Britain's Duncan Scott refused to share the podium with him. Australian Mack Horton took a similar stance after the 400m freestyle, years after accusing him of being a ""drug cheat"". Scott said on Friday: ""I fully respect and support the decision that has been made. ""I believe in clean sport and a level playing field for all athletes and I trust in Cas and Wada to uphold these values."" Sun's results prior to, during and after the championships will stand because he has not tested positive for doping. He has won 11 world titles since 2011, including two golds at last year's event in Gwangju, South Korea. When Fina originally cleared him, it said that testers had breached several rules, including failing to produce authorisation letters and a nursing licence. Sun was subsequently issued with a warning. The Cas appeal was heard in public. The only previous time that had happened was in 1999 when Ireland's triple Olympic swimming champion Michelle Smith de Bruin failed with her appeal against a four-year ban for tampering with an anti-doping sample. Adam Peaty, British Olympic 100m breaststroke champion:""Very good. For anyone that's been banned once, potentially it's a mistake. ""You're looking at it twice - you're a fool. I believe that you're disrespecting the sport, you're disrespecting yourself and you're disrespecting your country."" Mack Horton, Australian swimmer who refused to share a podium with Sun:""My stance has always been for clean sport. It is not, and never will be about individuals or nations. Today's outcome does not change my stance."" Lizzie Simmonds, British two-time Olympian & former European champion:""I once called this man the Harry Houdini of doping control, but it seems that justice has finally been served. ""Imagine there will be a few very relieved freestylers waking up across the world. ""Given the damning length of this sentence, it seems inconceivable that he originally just received a slap on the wrist from Fina. ""A strong message to those who cheat, but I hope an even stronger message to those who seek to protect bureaucratic harmony over sporting integrity."" James Guy, British four-time world swimming champion:""The truth always comes out."" Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is a hugely significant case for sport, and one that will lead to serious questions about the judgement and credibility of Fina, which will now come under pressure to establish an integrity unit, similar to those created for athletics and cycling. Swimming's world governing body caused dismay among many in the sport when it cleared Sun last year. That decision, combined with Sun's mega-stardom in the sporting superpower of China, his infamy after already serving a doping suspension in 2014, and the dramatic symbolism of a case in which a blood vial was smashed with a hammer, meant an especially bitter controversy - the antipathy with some of his rivals marring last year's World Championships. The severity of the eight-year ban (which almost certainly ends Sun's career) will be celebrated by many in swimming and beyond as a sign of the sport getting tougher on doping, and perhaps restore some faith in the anti-doping system. But it will no doubt provoke outrage in China, and may reinforce the sense both there and in places like Russia (which is appealing over its Olympic ban) that Cas is biased against countries in the east. Expect further appeals (to the Swiss Federal Tribunal) and recriminations.

LiveCoronavirus outbreak 'getting bigger' - WHO,"The World Health Organization upgrades the global risk from the coronavirus to ""very high"" Sources in Iran tell the BBC at least 210 have died of coronavirus there, far more than the official figure Stock markets across the globe are suffering their worst week since 2008 The first British death from Covid-19 is announced in Japan Nigeria and Mexico confirm their first cases China confirms another 327 cases - the lowest daily increase for a month - and 44 deaths, mainly in Hubei David Walker and Kathryn Snowdon We are ending today's live coverage of the growing
coronavirus outbreak around the world. To recap: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the coronavirus is the government's ""top priority"" and defended the decision not to repatriate people from quarantined cruise ship the Diamond Princess sooner. He said the government had been following the ""best medical advice"" as he tried to reassure people that the NHS was making ""every possible preparation"". His comments come aftera British man who was on board the cruise ship died from the disease. Mr Johnson said: ""We were following the best medical advice. We very much regret the loss of life of the individual concerned but we think that the best thing to do is not to move people around too much in the current situation. ""Not to repatriate unless you can be absolutely sure there is not going to be a spread or contagion to this country - that's the principle we are adopting."" The PM is due to chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday in response to a growing number of cases in Europe. Although UK shares havelost almost 13% of their value, this is not the worst week for the FTSE 100. This chart shows how the latest FTSE 100 plunge compares to other drops since 2000.  ""Please enter with masks and gloves for the safety of everyone"", says the sign on a shop door in San Fiorano, one of the 11 northern Italian towns under lockdown to stop transmission of coronavirus. The shop also asks that only four people enter at one time. Italy has 650 confirmed cases and 17 deaths, mostly in the regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Richard Ratcliffe, whose British-Iranian wife Nazanin isbeing held in an Iranian jail, says he fears she might be at risk of contracting the coronavirus as she wakes up shivering, has a severe sore throat and ""a cold"". Mr Ratcliffe says conditions in the Evin prison in Tehran have been ""worsening"" over the past few months. He told the i newspaper that a lack of medicine, disinfectant, bleach and antiseptic in prison shops had forced prisoners to depend on washing liquid to stay clean. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it remains ""extremely concerned"" about Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's welfare. As Iran reports rising numbers of coronavirus cases, its parliament has supsended its sessions ""until further notice"". A parliamentary official quoted in Iran's Fars news agency said the decision was based on advice from the health ministry about ""the outbreak and the risks it has"". The Iranian parliament, known as the Majlis, is also expected not to ratify the state budget for the Iranian new year starting 20 March and will instead pass a temporary emergency budget, the official said. At least 210 Covid-19 patients have died in Iran, sources within the country's health care system have told BBC Persian. This figure, as of Thursday evening, is way above the official figure of 34. The official figure for infected people is at 388 but many have challenged official figures. 
Most victims are from the capital, Tehran, and the city of Qom where the Iranian outbreak started. Iran's government has defended its response to the spread of the virus and denied it is withholding information about the number of people affected. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: Romania's Orthodox Church has advised worshippers not to kiss the icons in church to avoid transmitting 

the coronavirus. People can, however, kiss icons in their own homes, the church advises in a statement. In addition, 

worshippers ""may exceptionally ask the priest"" to use their own spoon for Holy Communion rather than 

share one.

Anyone too ill to attend Mass is advised to drink holy water at home, the statement adds. People are packing up after The Geneva Motor Show was cancelled. The decision to pull one of the biggest events in the auto industry calendar came after an order from the Swiss federal government, banning gatherings of more than 1000 people, in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus. The entertainment industry has been significantly affected by the outbreak, with major acts pulling shows. BTS said the cancellations were ""unavoidable"" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The first death of a
Brit from the coronavirus is, sadly, not a surprise. This
outbreak has killed around 2,800 people, most of them in China. As
the number of people infected with the virus increases, so too will the number
of deaths. That
is why attention continues to be on China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. Each
of those countries still has full-blown outbreaks of the coronavirus and their
efforts to contain it will be crucial. Other
countries are already feeling the ripple effects of these outbreaks. The latest
cases in the UK are connected to either Iran or Italy. For
now there is no coronavirus outbreak in the UK, but further imported cases are
almost inevitable for as long as other countries have large numbers of
infections Tokyo's Disneyland and DisneySea are to close from Saturday until 15 March amid the coronavirus 

outbreak, operators said. The decision to close the parks, which attract millions of visitors a year, follows government advice to 

curtail large gatherings, Oriental Land Co Ltd said. Osaka-based Universal Studios theme park also said it would close until 15 March.
Japan has had five deaths and more than 200 confirmed cases of the virus, as well as another 700 cases and five more deaths from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama. An Italian-Nigerian footballer has reportedly become the first professional player to be infected with the coronavirus. King Paul Akpan Udoh, 22, who plays for Pianese in Serie C, was diagnosed on Thursday and has been quarantined,media outlets have reported.,external He was once on the books of Italian giants Juventus before dropping to the country's third tier. Footballers worried about the impact of coronavirushave been contacting unions""out of fear"" they could be forced to play in ""high-risk environments"", according to global body Fifpro. It said in a statement Fifro said there was a danger of football ""acting as a vehicle to spread"" the disease. ""Our talks with various football stakeholders also address the rescheduling of international dates, including but not limited to qualifying matches for this yearâs Tokyo Olympics and 2022 FIFA World Cup,"" Fifpro said. AFC Champions League matches due to take place next week have already been rescheduled as a result of the growing outbreak. Dr Mike Ryan, the WHOâs director of health emergencies, has explained that the global risk level of ""very high"" is the highest alert the organisation can declare. He said earlier that it would be ""unhelpful"" to declare a pandemic when the world was still trying to contain the virus. ""If we say there's a pandemic of coronavirus we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus. The data does not support that as yet,"" he said. We've just spoken to an official at Iceland's health directorate who confirmed that the country has recorded its first coronavirus case. The official was not able to offer further details, but local media reports say the patient is a man in his 50s who had been in Italy. The man is said to be showing ""typical symptoms"" of the virus, and is being kept in isolation. Efforts are underway to find out who else might have been exposed to the virus. The World Health Organization is disappointed that it cannot provide more protective equipment to medical workers because of a global shortage, executive director Dr Michael Ryan told a news conference in Geneva. In London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped by another 4.3%, or by 290 points. With one hour of trading left this week, it puts the blue-chip index on track for its lowest close since July 2016. So what happens next? Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: ""The weekend may provide time for heads to cool, and allow
investors to assess whether or not they want to re-enter the market at these
new lows â after all, from a certain perspective the market is now far more
approachable than when it was racing to all-time highs just last week. ""Of course, that is only if the next few days arenât
filled with round after round of alarming headlines. From a market perspective, an explosion of cases in the US would
likely be the most catastrophic turn the illness could take. Though thatâs not
to downplay the impact of the steadily increasing number of nations around the
world now seeing their first cases of the coronavirus, each new country pushing
us closer to a pandemic."" Dr Tedros said we don't need to wait for a vaccine though, as there are already ways to avoid catching and spreading the virus. Health experts across the world are asking people to wash their hands and catch coughs and sneezes. According to the UK's NHS, the best way to prevent spread requires lots of soap and plenty of disposable tissues. It's worth reminding ourselves of the symptoms of the coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes, Covid-19. Symptoms appear to begin with a raised temperature, followed by a dry cough - and then after a week. shortness of breath. And finally, ""self-isolation"" is a phrase we're hearing a lot. The BBC's Joseph Lee has explained what it meansand how to do it successfully. The WHO's Executive Director Dr Michael J
Ryan says no individual country is to blame for the outbreak. ""It's really important that our rhetoric and narrative is
balanced"" said Dr Ryan, adding that China was not responsible for
coronavirus, just as the Democratic Republic of Congo was not responsible for
Ebola. He said stigma âhad become part of the global narrative, which
is unhelpfulâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Three more coronavirus cases confirmed in UK,"Two new patients in England are being treated at a specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London Three more cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, including the first one in Wales. Two new patients in England contracted the virus while in Iran,the Department of Health and Social Care said,external. Public Health Wales said it was working to identify close contacts of the Welsh patient, who is believed to be from the Swansea area and was infected in Italy before returning to the UK. The new cases bring the total number in the UK to 19. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said""all appropriate measures"" were being taken to care for the patient and reduce the risk of transmission. The patients in England are being treated at a specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

BBC reporter Dan Johnson said nine Canary Islands residents were allowed to leave the hotel on Friday because they arrived after four Italian guests with the virus had left. This video can not be played Lara Pennington and her family have self-isolated in their room after being quarantined in their hotel Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and festivals in the UK in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, which causes Covid-19. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Shares face worst week since global financial crisis England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said on Thursday that transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time"". He said if the outbreak intensifies, it may be necessary to close schools and stop mass gatherings of people for ""probably more than two months"". It is important to realise the UK does not have an ""outbreak"" of the coronavirus. We are dealing with the ripples of large, uncontrolled outbreaks elsewhere in the world. The cases announced on Thursday and Friday were all people who had been infected abroad before travelling to the UK - the virus is not spreading from person to person here. It means the UK's strategy remains one of containment - isolate any infected people and perform rigorous detective work to find and test anyone they come into contact with. Further cases are almost inevitable for as long as outbreaks in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan continue. The World Health Organization warned thatthe outbreak had reached a ""decisive point""and had ""pandemic potential"". Globally, more than 80,000 people have been infected. About 2,800 have died - the majority in China's Hubei province.

What is the UK doing?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

Shares in worst week since 2008,"The Dow Jones recorded its biggest ever points fall on Thursday US markets have suffered their worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008, as fears over the impact of the coronavirus continued to grip investors. The three main US indexes ended the week down 10% or more from last Friday, despite a last-minute rally in prices. Earlier, the main European markets fell sharply, with London's FTSE 100 index down 3.2% for the day. Investors are worried the coronavirus could spark a global recession. The Dow settled 1.4% lower on Friday, recovering from earlier lows, while the S&P sank 0.8% and the Nasdaq was roughly flat. Amid the sell-off, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell put out an unusual statement, saying the US central bank was ""closely monitoring"" developments. ""The fundamentals of the US economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" he said. ""We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."" Why should I care if share prices fall? The news of more coronavirus cases, notably in Italy, has raised concerns of a much larger economic effect than previously expected. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Friday warned the outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's growth prospects. Other countries are also reassessing their economic forecasts, as hundreds of firms warn of disruptions to their supply chains and a decline in consumer demand. US tech giantsAppleandMicrosoftare among the companies that have said their business will be affected, while investment bank Goldman Sachs warned on Thursday that the coronavirus is likely to wipe out any growth in US company profits this year. Shares in airlines have been especially hard-hit as travel bans are imposed and companies limit staff travel. On Friday, airline group IAG - which owns British Airways and Iberia - said its earnings had been affected by ""weaker demand"" as a result of the outbreak. ""A known unknown"" is how one major company boss described the economic fallout of coronavirus to the BBC. But what the markets have woken up to - perhaps belatedly - is that the disruption to the economic activity from coronavirus is wider, deeper and perhaps longer lasting than previously assumed. As major outbreaks spring up outside China, it is clear that it is not just global supply chains but also demand from consumers that's suffering, as efforts to contain the virus keep them away from shops, bars and restaurants. What is unknown is exactly how bad and how lasting the impact could be. But what is known is that this comes at an already tricky time for the global economy with Japan, Italy, China and the UK among those already seeing growth faltering. As economists slash their growth forecasts, policymakers are debating how much they can do to help, given how low interest rates remain. What's entirely clear is that investors face more anxiety ahead. Mayank Mishra, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said: ""Previously the market had taken some comfort in the falling infection rates in China as a result of containment measures put in place earlier. ""But the spread of the coronavirus infection outside China, with clusters emerging in South Korea, Italy and Japan, has increased concerns significantly."" BA owner and EasyJet hit by coronavirus Dettol sales surge amid coronavirus fears Coronavirus outbreak at âdecisive pointâ In Europe, Germany's Dax index fell 4.2%, while France's Cac 40 index sank 3.9%. Earlier on Friday, in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.7%, bringing its fall for the week to more than 9%. China's Shanghai Composite index also fell 3.7% on Friday. Traders fled to less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to new lows. Meanwhile, oil prices also fell on fears the virus would hurt demand, with Brent prices dropping more than 3% to about $50 a barrel on Friday, the lowest level for more than a year. US President Donald Trump, who has claimed credit for a sharp rise in share prices during his tenure, blamed the falls on investor fear of ""the unknown"" - as well as concerns about the Democratic candidates hoping to challenge him in November's presidential election. ""PeopleÂ look at it and they say how long will this last,"" he said. ""It's an election ... I don't think that's helping."" Several key global market indexes - including the FTSE 100 and the Dow Jones - have fallen more than 10% from recent highs. A drop of that magnitude is generally referred to as a correction. However, share prices were hovering at record levels before the sell-off started, noted Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. The Dow and S&P 500 have now retreated roughly to where they were in August, while the Nasdaq has returned to December prices. ""What markets are trying to digest is how long this is going to go on and what the economic damage will be,"" she said. Many analysts now predict the US central bank will cut interest rates in an attempt to counter any impact. James Bullard, who sits on the Fed's board of governors, said Friday that cuts are ""a possibility"" should the virus continue to spread, but he warned that market expectations would not force the bank to act. Ms Laud said that many central banks had little room for manoeuvre, because rates are already so low. ""Realistically it's mostly the Fed and to some extent the Bank of England that still have the chance to cut rates,"" she told the BBC. ""I think there will be a huge focus on governments to step up fiscal stimulus under the assumption there is not a lot more that central banks can do to stimulate the economy.""

""Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. ""So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire."" Greta warned politicians ""we will not be silenced, because we are the change"" Sisters Alannah and Lottie Hoey from Henleaze joined the march Greta walked at the front of the crowds behind a green banner reading Skolstrejk for Klimatet, which translates from Swedish as School Strike for Climate. Protesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners throughout the march. As it happened: Greta Thunberg in Bristol for climate strike What does Greta Thunberg want? Annie, a 21-year-old Bristol University student, was of the many people who turned out to hear the headline speaker and took a day off from her studies to participate. ""This is probably one of the most important things that we should be focussing on right now. Showing support and that you want change will make people higher up realise that as well. ""One day off school is a good enough sacrifice for what this is standing for. It's just one day, it's not going to do any harm."" Protesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners Jerry and four-month-old Leon march through the rain Jerry and her baby, Leon, were also among those who joined the throng of people. ""What an absolutely wonderful experience. Everyone was really respectful and there were loads of lovely teens passionate about climate."" Sisters Alannah and Lottie Hoey, 10 and eight, travelled from Henleaze with family to be part of the day. ""I wanted to go and see Greta because she's very inspirational and does so much good for the planet,"" said Lana. Lottie added: ""We want a nice planet when we grow up so it's important to do things like Greta."" Many youngsters took the day off school to take part Greta had originally intended to visit London, but the area planned for the protest in the capital was considered too small so organisers recommended Bristol instead. Police said 15,000 are in attendance, although organisers believe the figure is closer to 30,000. BYS4C saidit had drafted in more than 80 stewardsand has a sectioned-off a ""safe zone"" for young children as well as an accessibility area. Greta Thunberg meets Malala at university Pressure on big investors to act on climate change Road schemes may face Heathrow-style court action Mya-Rose Craig, the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol, spoke to the crowd before Greta's arrival on stage. She said: ""Greta, welcome to our amazing city and thank you for being with us today. We have to engage with all of our communities in order to properly fight climate change. ""An unequal world can never be a sustainable one."" Greta his influenced youngsters to get involved in fighting the climate crisis Two years ago, Ms Thunbergstarted missing lessonson Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building, in what turned out to be the beginning of a huge environmental movement. She has since become a leading voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. By Steve Mellen, BBC News Protesters began gathering just after first light and by the time Greta walked onstage, it was hard to see the floor of College Green. People were clinging to any vantage point they could find; the balcony at the front of the Marriott Royal and on tiptoes in front of the cathedral. The roar when Greta stepped in front of the microphone echoed across the green and her speech was regularly punctuated with roars of approval, especially when she mentioned the decision not to grant Bristol Airport planning permission to expand. There were plenty of parents and adults who had come to hear Greta speak but the vast majority of the crowd were young and not at school- a reflection, perhaps, of the teenager's own decision to stop attending school to continue her campaign. Clutching homemade signs and chanting, the crowd then took over the heart of the shopping quarter. A crowdfunding campaign will raise money to restore College Green More than 20 road closures were in operation across the city while the march took place but all routes were reopened at 15:30 GMT. Meanwhile, Jon Usher from the charity Sustrans has set up a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to replant grass on College Green, which was left a muddy quagmire after the rally.

Eight-year ban for Olympic champion SunChina's three-time Olympic champion swimmer Sun Yang is banned from competing for eight years for missing a doping test in September 2018.,"Sun Yang was a double Olympic gold medallist at London 2012 and won the men's 200m freestyle title in 2016 China's three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang has been banned for eight years for missing a doping test in September 2018. The 28-year-old was initiallycleared of wrongdoing by Fina,,externalthe swimming federation, in January 2019. Following an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), the decision has been overturned. An eight-year ban was imposed on Sun because this was his second offence. He had served a three-month suspension in 2014 for taking prohibited stimulant Trimetazidine. Sun told China's Xinhua news agency that he plans to appeal against the decision. He said: ""This is unfair. I firmly believe in my innocence."" Fina said it would implement the decision ""notwithstanding any further legal action and as directed"". This video can not be played 'You're a loser, I'm a winner' - ugly scenes as GB's Scott refuses to share podium with Sun Cas said its decision can be challenged before the Swiss Federal Tribunal within 30 days. Sun had told an appeal hearing in November that he missed a test because testers failed to prove their identity when they arrived at his home. He also denied a vial containing his blood samples was smashed with a hammer. Cas said: ""The athlete failed to establish that he had a compelling justification to destroy his sample collection containers and forego the doping control when, in his opinion, the collection protocol was not in compliance with the ISTI (international standard for testing and investigations). ""As the Cas panel noted, it is one thing, having provided a blood sample, to question the accreditation of the testing personnel while keeping the intact samples in the possession of the testing authorities; it is quite another thing, after lengthy exchanges and warnings as to the consequences, to act in such a way that results in destroying the sample containers, thereby eliminating any chance of testing the sample at a later stage."" Wada welcomed the ruling,,externaland added that it was ""satisfied that justice in this case has been rendered"". At the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in July, Sun won gold in the 200m freestyle but Britain's Duncan Scott refused to share the podium with him. Australian Mack Horton took a similar stance after the 400m freestyle, years after accusing him of being a ""drug cheat"". Scott said on Friday: ""I fully respect and support the decision that has been made. ""I believe in clean sport and a level playing field for all athletes and I trust in Cas and Wada to uphold these values."" Sun's results prior to, during and after the championships will stand because he has not tested positive for doping. He has won 11 world titles since 2011, including two golds at last year's event in Gwangju, South Korea. When Fina originally cleared him, it said that testers had breached several rules, including failing to produce authorisation letters and a nursing licence. Sun was subsequently issued with a warning. The Cas appeal was heard in public. The only previous time that had happened was in 1999 when Ireland's triple Olympic swimming champion Michelle Smith de Bruin failed with her appeal against a four-year ban for tampering with an anti-doping sample. Adam Peaty, British Olympic 100m breaststroke champion:""Very good. For anyone that's been banned once, potentially it's a mistake. ""You're looking at it twice - you're a fool. I believe that you're disrespecting the sport, you're disrespecting yourself and you're disrespecting your country."" Mack Horton, Australian swimmer who refused to share a podium with Sun:""My stance has always been for clean sport. It is not, and never will be about individuals or nations. Today's outcome does not change my stance."" Lizzie Simmonds, British two-time Olympian & former European champion:""I once called this man the Harry Houdini of doping control, but it seems that justice has finally been served. ""Imagine there will be a few very relieved freestylers waking up across the world. ""Given the damning length of this sentence, it seems inconceivable that he originally just received a slap on the wrist from Fina. ""A strong message to those who cheat, but I hope an even stronger message to those who seek to protect bureaucratic harmony over sporting integrity."" James Guy, British four-time world swimming champion:""The truth always comes out."" Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is a hugely significant case for sport, and one that will lead to serious questions about the judgement and credibility of Fina, which will now come under pressure to establish an integrity unit, similar to those created for athletics and cycling. Swimming's world governing body caused dismay among many in the sport when it cleared Sun last year. That decision, combined with Sun's mega-stardom in the sporting superpower of China, his infamy after already serving a doping suspension in 2014, and the dramatic symbolism of a case in which a blood vial was smashed with a hammer, meant an especially bitter controversy - the antipathy with some of his rivals marring last year's World Championships. The severity of the eight-year ban (which almost certainly ends Sun's career) will be celebrated by many in swimming and beyond as a sign of the sport getting tougher on doping, and perhaps restore some faith in the anti-doping system. But it will no doubt provoke outrage in China, and may reinforce the sense both there and in places like Russia (which is appealing over its Olympic ban) that Cas is biased against countries in the east. Expect further appeals (to the Swiss Federal Tribunal) and recriminations.

"Former Barclays bankers cleared of fraud chargesRoger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris, and Richard Boath are found not guilty on all charges in under six hours.Business","Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalari and Richard Boath (left to right) were acquitted on all charges in under six hours Three former top Barclays executives have been cleared of fraud charges linked to how the bank raised billions from Qatar in the financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had alleged the bank had given Qatar secret fees that helped it to survive without a UK government bailout in 2008. Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris, and Richard Boath were found not guilty on all charges by the jury in under six hours. Former Barclays chief executive John Varley was acquitted in June 2019. The acquittal of the three men is a blow to the SFO and draws a line under an ambitious seven-and-a-half-year investigation that led to the first criminal charges in Britain against senior financiers at a major bank over credit crisis-era conduct. An SFO spokesperson said: ""Our prosecution decisions are always based on the evidence that is available, and we are determined to bring perpetrators of serious financial crime to justice. ""Wherever our evidential and public interest tests are met, we will always endeavour to bring this before a court."" Mr Boath, when leaving the Old Bailey on Friday morning, told the BBC: ""I'm very relieved about the verdict, particularly given that I was cleared in 2017 by the Financial Conduct Authority."" He added that the SFO should never have brought the case. Mr Boath said the last six years had been tough. But phone calls recorded during the crisis and played to the jury made clear he was innocent. ""Obviously there are ups and downs but today is a big up obviously. "" ""I frankly couldn't have done more in 2008 to make sure the bank didn't do anything that it regretted and that really comes out on all the tapes and I think that was obvious to the jury."" The acquittal of three former Barclays executives is the only time a jury has ruled on criminal allegations against senior bankers for events in the 2008 crisis. The senior executives in this trial, which began in October - Roger Jenkins, 64, Tom Kalaris, 64 and Richard Boath, 61 - were not the top bosses of Barclays. Instead, they were between one and four ranks down from the board of directors in the bank's hierarchical structure. The allegations centred on a giant fundraising exercise in 2008 which enabled Barclays to escape the nationalisation forced on its competitors, RBS, Lloyds and HBOS. The defendants were accused by prosecutors of conspiring to commit fraud in connection with that fundraising effort. They argued that it was not a fraud - and that if, alternatively, it was judged to be a fraud, they were not the ones who should be held accountable for it. Their actions, their barristers said, were approved and negotiated at the top of the bank and signed off by the banks' top lawyers. In the end, the jury took less than six hours to find in their favour. The decision comes as a setback for the Serious Fraud Office, which took years to launch its prosecution and has now had its case thrown out. The inside story of the Barclays trial The three former senior bankers were accused by the SFO of committing a fraud in the midst of the financial crisis - charges they have spent more than a year on trial denying. In 2008, Barclays, like other banks, was running dangerously low on cash. Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath helped to arrange a Â£12bn investment by sovereign wealth funds, including the Gulf state of Qatar. However, the Qataris demanded more than double the fees paid to other investors. The SFO said the bank decided to disguise their extra fees - Â£322m in total - by hiding them in what it said were pretend agreements for advisory services. The defendants said the agreements were approved at the top of the bank and signed off by its lawyers. Prosecutors had alleged Mr Jenkins, the head of the Middle East investment bank, Mr Kalaris, who ran Barclays' wealth unit, and former financial institutions head Mr Boath conspired with former finance director Chris Lucas to disguise a Â£42m payment to Qatar. The SFO said the bankers used a so-called ""advisory services agreement"" to mask the fact Barclays was paying Qatar more than twice the fees it was paying other investors that June. Mr Jenkins, who was described as the ""gatekeeper"" to the Qatari relationship, was also charged over a Â£280m, five-year agreement struck with Qatar four months later. Mr Lucas was not charged because he was too ill to stand trial. Qatar, a major investor in the UK and still a significant Barclays shareholder, was neither investigated nor accused of wrongdoing.

Britons in virus-hit hotel face flight wait,"Some 700 guests remain in quarantine at a hotel in Tenerife after four Italian tourists tested positive for the virus Britons confined to a hotel in Tenerife over coronavirus will not be flown home until next month, unless they have tested negative, airline Jet2 has said. It is understood travellers booked with Jet2 received messages saying it would not fly them to the UK until 10 March. It comes after three more people were diagnosed with the virus in the UK on Thursday, including Northern Ireland'sfirst confirmed case. That patient had travelled from northern Italy via Dublin. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer said ""robust infection control measures"" were in place. On Thursday, health officialsconfirmed two new cases of the virus in England, who contracted the virus while they were in northern Italy and Tenerife. It means 16 people have tested positive in the UK since the virus outbreak began in China in December. Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and festivals in the UK in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, which causes Covid-19. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time"". He said if the outbreak intensifies, it may be necessary to close schools and stop mass gatherings of people for ""quite a long period of time, probably more than two months"". LIVE: Coronavirus spreads around the world EasyJet and British Airways warn over virus impact How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? The World Health Organization also warned thatthe outbreak had reached a ""decisive point""and had ""pandemic potential"". Globally, more than 80,000 people have been infected. About 2,800 have died - the majority in China's Hubei province. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If I was going to choose a country to be in when there is a pandemic I would choose the UK."" He added that the timeline of the virus was ""at a moment of enormous significance"". Italy has seen at least 650 cases of coronavirus and 15 deaths, according to local authorities. Meanwhile, British cyclists Chris Froome and Adam Yatesare being tested for the virusafter two Italian ""staff members"" tested positive during a race in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has since been called off. ""It's a shame that the UAE Tour has been cancelled but public health must come first,""Froome said in a tweet,external. Some 168 Britons are among 700 guests who remain in the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, were diagnosed with coronavirus. On Thursday, the Canary Islands minister of health said a group of 130 low-risk guests - including around 50 British nationals - would be able to leave because they arrived on Monday and did not come into contact with the four Italians who tested positive. However, airline Jet2 has said it will not fly home any passengers who have been staying at the hotel until they have completed two weeks in quarantine, or tested negative for the illness. Lara Pennington, who is quarantined in the hotel with her family, toldBBC Breakfastshe was concerned that other Britons there were not taking isolation seriously enough. This video can not be played Mother-of-two Lara Pennington says she feels ""very unsafe"" at the locked-down hotel Ms Pennington said she had sought a guarantee for her family's safety ""given we have remained in isolation and there will be other passengers on the plane who have not only gone into the hotel grounds but have not been following the protocols"". ""I think it would be unfair to me and my family and [would] put us at risk at that point,"" she said. In a statement, Jet2 said: ""We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for Covid-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus."" Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Shares face worst week since global financial crisis The Foreign Office said it was trying to clarify the situation with the Spanish authorities and was supporting all 168 British tourists at the hotel. Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, previously said a health protection specialist had been sent from the UK to Tenerife to work with the Spanish authorities. The new cases in the UK come as the government prepares a public information campaign focusing on hygiene and how to prevent the spread of infection. The current advice is to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, throw away tissues immediately after use and wash your hands frequently. It is also advised to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands and avoid close contact with people who are unwell.

First case of virus confirmed in Wales,"This video can not be played More cases of coronavirus can be expected in Wales, says the country's chief medical officer The first case of coronavirus in Wales has been confirmed. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the adult patient had returned from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said the diagnosis had a link to the city's Bishop Gore School, but there are no cases within any schools. On Friday, a man on the Diamond Princess cruise ship becamethe first Briton to die of coronavirus. Nineteen people have tested positive in the UK since the virus outbreak began in China. There was one case inNorthern Irelandon Thursday and two new cases inEngland on Friday. Dr Atherton said the development was ""not unexpected"" and the patient was being treated at one of the four specialist units in England. He said it was ""inevitable"" there would be more cases. Dr Atherton said: ""Our job is to prepare for a significant number of cases, for an epidemic in the UK, or a pandemic if it becomes a global issue."" He said the Welsh patient had been tested on Thursday, adding: ""They developed symptoms and contacted the NHS and were assessed by colleagues from Public Health Wales."" He said: ""All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. ""I'd like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents."" He said to protect the patient's confidentiality no further details regarding the individual would be released.

Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and festivals in the UK in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time"". He said if the outbreak intensifies, it may be necessary to close schools and stop mass gatherings of people for ""quite a long period of time, probably more than two months"". The World Health Organization also warned thatthe outbreak had reached a ""decisive point""and had ""pandemic potential"". Based on data from 44,000 patients with this coronavirus, the WHO says: 81% develop mild symptoms 14% develop severe symptoms 5% become critically ill The proportion dying from the disease,which has been named Covid-19, appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable. Thousands are still being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it is also unclear how many mild cases remain unreported - so the death rate could also be lower. To put this into context, about one billion people catch influenza every year, with between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. The severity of flu changes every year. The authorities here are stepping up a gear. They are moving from just testing people who have been to the hotspots. They are now beginning to test some patients, either in intensive care units or some GP surgeries, who have unexplained symptoms which might indicate coronavirus. Things are shifting up a gear but the general message is that people should not panic. Even though more cases are expected, officials insist the NHS is well prepared. To protect against infection, the NHS has advised people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or a sanitiser gel. It is best to catch coughs and sneezes with tissues, which should be thrown away immediately afterwards. Be sure to wash your hands after disposing of tissues. Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and avoid close contact with people who are unwell. The World Health Organization,externaladvises keeping at least a metre between you and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.

Shares face worst week since financial crisis,"The Dow Jones recorded its biggest ever points fall on Thursday US markets have suffered their worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008, as fears over the impact of the coronavirus continued to grip investors. The three main US indexes ended the week down 10% or more from last Friday, despite a last-minute rally in prices. Earlier, the main European markets fell sharply, with London's FTSE 100 index down 3.2% for the day. Investors are worried the coronavirus could spark a global recession. The Dow settled 1.4% lower on Friday, recovering from earlier lows, while the S&P sank 0.8% and the Nasdaq was roughly flat. Amid the sell-off, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell put out an unusual statement, saying the US central bank was ""closely monitoring"" developments. ""The fundamentals of the US economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" he said. ""We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."" Why should I care if share prices fall? The news of more coronavirus cases, notably in Italy, has raised concerns of a much larger economic effect than previously expected. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Friday warned the outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's growth prospects. Other countries are also reassessing their economic forecasts, as hundreds of firms warn of disruptions to their supply chains and a decline in consumer demand. US tech giantsAppleandMicrosoftare among the companies that have said their business will be affected, while investment bank Goldman Sachs warned on Thursday that the coronavirus is likely to wipe out any growth in US company profits this year. Shares in airlines have been especially hard-hit as travel bans are imposed and companies limit staff travel. On Friday, airline group IAG - which owns British Airways and Iberia - said its earnings had been affected by ""weaker demand"" as a result of the outbreak. ""A known unknown"" is how one major company boss described the economic fallout of coronavirus to the BBC. But what the markets have woken up to - perhaps belatedly - is that the disruption to the economic activity from coronavirus is wider, deeper and perhaps longer lasting than previously assumed. As major outbreaks spring up outside China, it is clear that it is not just global supply chains but also demand from consumers that's suffering, as efforts to contain the virus keep them away from shops, bars and restaurants. What is unknown is exactly how bad and how lasting the impact could be. But what is known is that this comes at an already tricky time for the global economy with Japan, Italy, China and the UK among those already seeing growth faltering. As economists slash their growth forecasts, policymakers are debating how much they can do to help, given how low interest rates remain. What's entirely clear is that investors face more anxiety ahead. Mayank Mishra, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said: ""Previously the market had taken some comfort in the falling infection rates in China as a result of containment measures put in place earlier. ""But the spread of the coronavirus infection outside China, with clusters emerging in South Korea, Italy and Japan, has increased concerns significantly."" BA owner and EasyJet hit by coronavirus Dettol sales surge amid coronavirus fears Coronavirus outbreak at âdecisive pointâ In Europe, Germany's Dax index fell 4.2%, while France's Cac 40 index sank 3.9%. Earlier on Friday, in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.7%, bringing its fall for the week to more than 9%. China's Shanghai Composite index also fell 3.7% on Friday. Traders fled to less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to new lows. Meanwhile, oil prices also fell on fears the virus would hurt demand, with Brent prices dropping more than 3% to about $50 a barrel on Friday, the lowest level for more than a year. US President Donald Trump, who has claimed credit for a sharp rise in share prices during his tenure, blamed the falls on investor fear of ""the unknown"" - as well as concerns about the Democratic candidates hoping to challenge him in November's presidential election. ""PeopleÂ look at it and they say how long will this last,"" he said. ""It's an election ... I don't think that's helping."" Several key global market indexes - including the FTSE 100 and the Dow Jones - have fallen more than 10% from recent highs. A drop of that magnitude is generally referred to as a correction. However, share prices were hovering at record levels before the sell-off started, noted Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. The Dow and S&P 500 have now retreated roughly to where they were in August, while the Nasdaq has returned to December prices. ""What markets are trying to digest is how long this is going to go on and what the economic damage will be,"" she said. Many analysts now predict the US central bank will cut interest rates in an attempt to counter any impact. James Bullard, who sits on the Fed's board of governors, said Friday that cuts are ""a possibility"" should the virus continue to spread, but he warned that market expectations would not force the bank to act. Ms Laud said that many central banks had little room for manoeuvre, because rates are already so low. ""Realistically it's mostly the Fed and to some extent the Bank of England that still have the chance to cut rates,"" she told the BBC. ""I think there will be a huge focus on governments to step up fiscal stimulus under the assumption there is not a lot more that central banks can do to stimulate the economy.""

Airlines warn of virus bookings hit,"British Airways owner IAG has warned that bookings in 2020 will be hit by the effects of coronavirus. IAG boss Willie Walsh said that as well as all China flights being suspended, there had been ""a significant fall-off in demand in Italy"". Airline shares have fallen sharply amid investor concerns about the potential economic effects of the virus. EasyJet isalso cancelling some flights because of the virus,externaland is looking into making cost cuts. IAG said flight suspensions to China and cancellations on Italian routes wouldaffect how many passengers it carried this year,external. The airline group - which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling - said it was not possible to say how much profits would be hit in 2020 because of uncertainty about the impact and duration of the current outbreak. Outbreak at 'decisive point' Shares face worst week since global financial crisis IAG chief executive Willie Walsh told the BBC's Today programme that in the first three weeks of February, mainly Asian bookings had been affected. ""Clearly we had announced the suspension of flights to China. We took that decision at the end of January, and we had seen some impact on our other Asian routes, but it had looked like it was stabilising. ""But earlier this week we had the issues in Italy, and that's clearly led to a significant fall-off in demand in Italy and in some of the surrounding countries as well."" Mr Walsh added that business travel had been affected by the cancellation of large conferences, as well as by the introduction of travel restrictions by some big companies. Shares in airlines have been among the hardest hit in the global market sell-off seen this week, and IAG's shares have sunk 17%. ""I don't think it's a surprise that investors are cautious in the current circumstances,"" Mr Walsh said, although he added that IAG had a ""very strong balance sheet"". Of all the businesses affected by the coronavirus, airlines and travel companies are among the hardest hit. It's a combination of factors. In some cases airlines have effectively been obliged to cancel services, because of warnings against all but essential travel issued by governments. Major international carriers have suspended normally busy routes to Chinese cities, for example. On other routes, there are no such recommendations - but passenger numbers have dropped off because people are simply less willing to fly than usual. Some are staying at home for fear of contracting the virus; others are worried about being stranded abroad and forced into quarantine if they happen to come into contact with an infected person. Tales of people being forced to spend weeks confined to cabins aboard cruise ships or barricaded inside hotels hardly make people want to go on holiday, while the cancellation of major industry events such as the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the Geneva Motor Show will have had a big impact on business travel. IAG and EasyJet have joined other companies such as Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and Qantas in warning that this will cause them financial pain. Last week, the International Air Transport Association put the potential cost of the outbreak to the global industry at $29.3bn this year. But that figure was based on the centre of the crisis remaining in China. It is now clear that the impact is being felt much more widely - so the costs could well be a lot higher. Budget carrier EasyJet said that following the increased number of coronavirus cases in Northern Italy, it had seen ""a significant softening of demand and load factors into and out of our Northern Italian bases"". ""As a result, we will be making decisions to cancel some flights, particularly those into and out of Italy."" EasyJet said it would also seek to cut costs. This will include looking into reducing administrative budgets, offering unpaid leave, and freezing recruitment, promotion and pay rises. Finnair also joined the growing list of airlines issuing warnings,saying it expected a significant fall in operating profit this year,externaldue to lower demand for air travel. EasyJet has been forced to cancel some flights Rolls-Royce, one of the world's largest makers of aircraft engines, also warned of the impact of coronavirus on its business. Chief executive Warren East said the virus was a ""macro-risk for everyone"". ""It's not sector specific, or company specific. It's a known unknown,"" he told the BBC. ""This is something that is developing daily, and the impact is going to depend on how long disruption lasts for, how wide, from a regional point of view, the disruption spreads, and of course for us as a business, our ability to mitigate against that.""

Live TV moves to livestreaming in virus-hit China,"The show must go on - reality show stars have found ways to adapt while still being advised to stay at home China has the world's largest livestreaming industry and Wuhan - the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak - was already something of a livestreaming hub. So when the new virus emerged, confining millions of people to their homes, the industry responded quickly, with new programming genres emerging and a shift in the formats of popular TV reality shows. Audiences have been watching livestreams of both celebrities and ordinary people singing, cooking and exercising in their own homes. Programmes that usually feature live audiences have instead come to resemble video conferences - but have still proven an unusual hit. But despite these changing programming trends, vloggers - of which there aremore than 524 million in China,external- still need to be extremely cautious about what they post, especially within Wuhan. In late January, livestreams of two hospitals being built in Wuhan provedunusually popular with online audiences. Recognising the appeal that unconventional livestreams have had among audiences while Chinese have been in self-quarantine, some new shows quickly sprang up on online streaming services. New online programmes like Games at Home have proven popular and helped homebound Chinese see how others are keeping entertained The Guangzhou Daily newspaper noted the rise of a new genre of""cloud reality shows"",external, where artists only needed a mobile phone or a computer and a good network to be part of a show. There has been no limit to the range of sub-genres. Since 8 February, an hour-long cookery programme called Eat Wellhas sprang up on the YouTube-like Youku,external, which takes viewers inside different peoples' homes and shows a different person each day cooking a homemade meal. Similarly, in mid-February, the popular iQiyi website hosted a new ""at home"" reality shows.In Karaoke at Home,external, the format is simple: social media users send requests for singers to perform songs of their choice, from their own home. Games at Home,externalshows different stars compete in certain challenges within their homes, like ""who can do the most press-ups"". These new shows, along with Chinese government restrictions on people's movements as a result of the coronavirus threw a spanner in the works for reality TV producers. Some 780 million people in China - more than half of the population - have experienced some form of lockdown since late January. Talk show panelists on Day Day Up have used video conferencing to watch fellow panelists sing along to tunes from Frozen Coronavirus coverage has also been inescapable. In late January, China's top media regulator called on the revision of TV schedules to ""reduce entertainment programming"" and step up special reports on the coronavirus. As viewing audiences have increasingly turned online, many linear TV programmes have swiftly adapted their formats to continue running, even though their stars have needed to remain off-site. The popular reality show Singer normally shows performers in front of a live audience, with a panel of judges on a stage. However, on 21 February, viewers saw the judges and other contestants calling in from their homes. Popular talk show Day Day Up has similarly come to resemble a video conference, as guests have kept the show running by filming within their homes. The Sixth Tone news website adds that an upcoming show Street Dance of China has had to ask auditioning contestantsto submit videos of themselves dancing in their homes.,external Nowhere has actually been better equipped to respond to this new trend, than Wuhan. Before the outbreak of the coronavirus, the city was gaining a reputation as the place to be for Chinese livestreamers. The annual Douyu Festival in Wuhan is normally a must for livestreamers - but vloggers have found ways to adapt The South China Morning Post newspaper noted in November 2019 that companies were investing millions of dollars developing in the city, which was""eager to boost innovation and cultivate the next big technology unicorns"",external. So much so, that in December 2017,Wuhan built a livestreaming ""village"",externalwith rooms for around 100 livestreaming hosts, complete with ""European style architecture"". Wuhan is home to some of China's largest live-streaming servicesincluding industry leader Douyu,external. And its rapidly developing industry meant that the provincial Hubei government actually set the precedent for livestreaming regulations across the country. In February 2018, it set China's first standards for livestreaming platforms and hosts. It issued guidance on""content, account supervision, platform inspection and how hosts should dress"",external, the official China Daily reported. Wuhan-based livestreamers, therefore, should be better equipped than anywhere else to know what the guidelines are on what people can say and do. But Chinese live streaming applications have a strict and extensive list of guidelines so that mainland-based users do not post content that is deemed subversive towards the state. After Wuhan went into lockdown on 23 January, video diaries proved popular as residents began detailing their daily lives in quarantine. Coronavirus Wuhan diary: Living alone in a city gone quiet Coronavirus Wuhan diary: 'He got a hospital bed three hours before he died' Coronavirus: Why have two reporters in Wuhan disappeared? But those that have challenged the government's lines on the coronavirus have seemingly been deemed unacceptable. Fang Bin and Chen Qiushi had both been posting livestreams and videos from Wuhan which questioned the government's reporting. Their videos claiming to show ""what is really happening"" received thousands of views. In February, Chen told the BBC the censorship was ""very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content"". Shortly after, both he and Fang went quietand haven't been heard from since. Chen Qiushi is one of two Wuhan journalists who have gone missing BBC Monitoring,externalreports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Amid the sell-off, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell put out an unusual statement, saying the US central bank was ""closely monitoring"" developments. ""The fundamentals of the US economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" he said. ""We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."" Why should I care if share prices fall? The news of more coronavirus cases, notably in Italy, has raised concerns of a much larger economic effect than previously expected. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Friday warned the outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's growth prospects. Other countries are also reassessing their economic forecasts, as hundreds of firms warn of disruptions to their supply chains and a decline in consumer demand. US tech giantsAppleandMicrosoftare among the companies that have said their business will be affected, while investment bank Goldman Sachs warned on Thursday that the coronavirus is likely to wipe out any growth in US company profits this year. Shares in airlines have been especially hard-hit as travel bans are imposed and companies limit staff travel. On Friday, airline group IAG - which owns British Airways and Iberia - said its earnings had been affected by ""weaker demand"" as a result of the outbreak. ""A known unknown"" is how one major company boss described the economic fallout of coronavirus to the BBC. But what the markets have woken up to - perhaps belatedly - is that the disruption to the economic activity from coronavirus is wider, deeper and perhaps longer lasting than previously assumed. As major outbreaks spring up outside China, it is clear that it is not just global supply chains but also demand from consumers that's suffering, as efforts to contain the virus keep them away from shops, bars and restaurants. What is unknown is exactly how bad and how lasting the impact could be. But what is known is that this comes at an already tricky time for the global economy with Japan, Italy, China and the UK among those already seeing growth faltering. As economists slash their growth forecasts, policymakers are debating how much they can do to help, given how low interest rates remain. What's entirely clear is that investors face more anxiety ahead. Mayank Mishra, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said: ""Previously the market had taken some comfort in the falling infection rates in China as a result of containment measures put in place earlier. ""But the spread of the coronavirus infection outside China, with clusters emerging in South Korea, Italy and Japan, has increased concerns significantly."" BA owner and EasyJet hit by coronavirus Dettol sales surge amid coronavirus fears Coronavirus outbreak at âdecisive pointâ In Europe, Germany's Dax index fell 4.2%, while France's Cac 40 index sank 3.9%. Earlier on Friday, in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.7%, bringing its fall for the week to more than 9%. China's Shanghai Composite index also fell 3.7% on Friday. Traders fled to less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to new lows. Meanwhile, oil prices also fell on fears the virus would hurt demand, with Brent prices dropping more than 3% to about $50 a barrel on Friday, the lowest level for more than a year. US President Donald Trump, who has claimed credit for a sharp rise in share prices during his tenure, blamed the falls on investor fear of ""the unknown"" - as well as concerns about the Democratic candidates hoping to challenge him in November's presidential election. ""PeopleÂ look at it and they say how long will this last,"" he said. ""It's an election ... I don't think that's helping."" Several key global market indexes - including the FTSE 100 and the Dow Jones - have fallen more than 10% from recent highs. A drop of that magnitude is generally referred to as a correction. However, share prices were hovering at record levels before the sell-off started, noted Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. The Dow and S&P 500 have now retreated roughly to where they were in August, while the Nasdaq has returned to December prices. ""What markets are trying to digest is how long this is going to go on and what the economic damage will be,"" she said. Many analysts now predict the US central bank will cut interest rates in an attempt to counter any impact. James Bullard, who sits on the Fed's board of governors, said Friday that cuts are ""a possibility"" should the virus continue to spread, but he warned that market expectations would not force the bank to act. Ms Laud said that many central banks had little room for manoeuvre, because rates are already so low. ""Realistically it's mostly the Fed and to some extent the Bank of England that still have the chance to cut rates,"" she told the BBC. ""I think there will be a huge focus on governments to step up fiscal stimulus under the assumption there is not a lot more that central banks can do to stimulate the economy.""

Britons in virus-hit hotel face flight waitJet2 tells passengers in Tenerife they cannot fly home for 12 days unless they test negative for coronavirus.,"Some 700 guests remain in quarantine at a hotel in Tenerife after four Italian tourists tested positive for the virus Britons confined to a hotel in Tenerife over coronavirus will not be flown home until next month, unless they have tested negative, airline Jet2 has said. It is understood travellers booked with Jet2 received messages saying it would not fly them to the UK until 10 March. It comes after three more people were diagnosed with the virus in the UK on Thursday, including Northern Ireland'sfirst confirmed case. That patient had travelled from northern Italy via Dublin. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer said ""robust infection control measures"" were in place. On Thursday, health officialsconfirmed two new cases of the virus in England, who contracted the virus while they were in northern Italy and Tenerife. It means 16 people have tested positive in the UK since the virus outbreak began in China in December. Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and festivals in the UK in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, which causes Covid-19. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time"". He said if the outbreak intensifies, it may be necessary to close schools and stop mass gatherings of people for ""quite a long period of time, probably more than two months"". LIVE: Coronavirus spreads around the world EasyJet and British Airways warn over virus impact How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? The World Health Organization also warned thatthe outbreak had reached a ""decisive point""and had ""pandemic potential"". Globally, more than 80,000 people have been infected. About 2,800 have died - the majority in China's Hubei province. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If I was going to choose a country to be in when there is a pandemic I would choose the UK."" He added that the timeline of the virus was ""at a moment of enormous significance"". Italy has seen at least 650 cases of coronavirus and 15 deaths, according to local authorities. Meanwhile, British cyclists Chris Froome and Adam Yatesare being tested for the virusafter two Italian ""staff members"" tested positive during a race in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has since been called off. ""It's a shame that the UAE Tour has been cancelled but public health must come first,""Froome said in a tweet,external. Some 168 Britons are among 700 guests who remain in the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, were diagnosed with coronavirus. On Thursday, the Canary Islands minister of health said a group of 130 low-risk guests - including around 50 British nationals - would be able to leave because they arrived on Monday and did not come into contact with the four Italians who tested positive. However, airline Jet2 has said it will not fly home any passengers who have been staying at the hotel until they have completed two weeks in quarantine, or tested negative for the illness. Lara Pennington, who is quarantined in the hotel with her family, toldBBC Breakfastshe was concerned that other Britons there were not taking isolation seriously enough. This video can not be played Mother-of-two Lara Pennington says she feels ""very unsafe"" at the locked-down hotel Ms Pennington said she had sought a guarantee for her family's safety ""given we have remained in isolation and there will be other passengers on the plane who have not only gone into the hotel grounds but have not been following the protocols"". ""I think it would be unfair to me and my family and [would] put us at risk at that point,"" she said. In a statement, Jet2 said: ""We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for Covid-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus."" Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Shares face worst week since global financial crisis The Foreign Office said it was trying to clarify the situation with the Spanish authorities and was supporting all 168 British tourists at the hotel. Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, previously said a health protection specialist had been sent from the UK to Tenerife to work with the Spanish authorities. The new cases in the UK come as the government prepares a public information campaign focusing on hygiene and how to prevent the spread of infection. The current advice is to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, throw away tissues immediately after use and wash your hands frequently. It is also advised to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands and avoid close contact with people who are unwell. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) iswarning against all but essential travel to 11 quarantined towns in Italy,external, two cities in South Korea and mainland China. The Department of Health saysanyone who has returned from those specified parts of Italy and South Korea, as well as Iran, since 19 February,externalshould call the NHS 111 helpline, stay indoors and avoid contact with others. Anyone who has returned in the past 14 days from Hubei Province in China - where the FCO has warned against all travel - should do the same.

Roads closed as Greta's climate strike due,"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg: ""The world is on fire"" Greta Thunberg has warned ""those in power"" she will ""not be silenced when the world is on fire"". The teenager was welcomed by chants of ""Greta, Greta"" as she addressed some 15,000 people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate (BYS4C) event. She accused politicians and the media of ignoring the climate emergency and ""sweeping their mess under the rug"". ""We are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not,"" the Swedish environmentalist said. Greta was speaking at the climate strike event on College Green, before leading a march through the city. ""Activism works so I'm telling you to act,"" she said. ""We are being betrayed by those in power."" Greta led the march in Bristol after making her speech Greta Thunberg tweeted a photo of the crowds gathered to see her Wet weather failed to deter thousands of people turning out for the 17-year-old, who appeared on stage at about 11:45 GMT. ""Our leaders behave like children so it falls to us to be the adults in the room. They are failing us but we will not back down,"" Greta told the crowds. ""It should not be this way but we have to tell the uncomfortable truth. They sweep their mess under the rug and ask children to clean up for them. ""This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power. ""Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. ""So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire."" Greta warned politicians ""we will not be silenced, because we are the change"" Sisters Alannah and Lottie Hoey from Henleaze joined the march Greta walked at the front of the crowds behind a green banner reading Skolstrejk for Klimatet, which translates from Swedish as School Strike for Climate. Protesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners throughout the march. As it happened: Greta Thunberg in Bristol for climate strike What does Greta Thunberg want? Annie, a 21-year-old Bristol University student, was of the many people who turned out to hear the headline speaker and took a day off from her studies to participate. ""This is probably one of the most important things that we should be focussing on right now. Showing support and that you want change will make people higher up realise that as well. ""One day off school is a good enough sacrifice for what this is standing for. It's just one day, it's not going to do any harm."" Protesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners Jerry and four-month-old Leon march through the rain Jerry and her baby, Leon, were also among those who joined the throng of people. ""What an absolutely wonderful experience. Everyone was really respectful and there were loads of lovely teens passionate about climate."" Sisters Alannah and Lottie Hoey, 10 and eight, travelled from Henleaze with family to be part of the day. ""I wanted to go and see Greta because she's very inspirational and does so much good for the planet,"" said Lana. Lottie added: ""We want a nice planet when we grow up so it's important to do things like Greta."" Many youngsters took the day off school to take part Greta had originally intended to visit London, but the area planned for the protest in the capital was considered too small so organisers recommended Bristol instead. Police said 15,000 are in attendance, although organisers believe the figure is closer to 30,000. BYS4C saidit had drafted in more than 80 stewardsand has a sectioned-off a ""safe zone"" for young children as well as an accessibility area. Greta Thunberg meets Malala at university Pressure on big investors to act on climate change Road schemes may face Heathrow-style court action Mya-Rose Craig, the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol, spoke to the crowd before Greta's arrival on stage. She said: ""Greta, welcome to our amazing city and thank you for being with us today. We have to engage with all of our communities in order to properly fight climate change. ""An unequal world can never be a sustainable one."" Greta his influenced youngsters to get involved in fighting the climate crisis Two years ago, Ms Thunbergstarted missing lessonson Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building, in what turned out to be the beginning of a huge environmental movement. She has since become a leading voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. By Steve Mellen, BBC News Protesters began gathering just after first light and by the time Greta walked onstage, it was hard to see the floor of College Green. People were clinging to any vantage point they could find; the balcony at the front of the Marriott Royal and on tiptoes in front of the cathedral. The roar when Greta stepped in front of the microphone echoed across the green and her speech was regularly punctuated with roars of approval, especially when she mentioned the decision not to grant Bristol Airport planning permission to expand. There were plenty of parents and adults who had come to hear Greta speak but the vast majority of the crowd were young and not at school- a reflection, perhaps, of the teenager's own decision to stop attending school to continue her campaign. Clutching homemade signs and chanting, the crowd then took over the heart of the shopping quarter. A crowdfunding campaign will raise money to restore College Green More than 20 road closures were in operation across the city while the march took place but all routes were reopened at 15:30 GMT. Meanwhile, Jon Usher from the charity Sustrans has set up a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to replant grass on College Green, which was left a muddy quagmire after the rally. Avon and Somerset Police said Greta left Bristol at about 15:00.

Worst markets week since 2008,"The Dow Jones recorded its biggest ever points fall on Thursday US markets have suffered their worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008, as fears over the impact of the coronavirus continued to grip investors.

Outbreak at âdecisive pointâ,"Italy and Iran have become hotbeds of coronavirus infections The coronavirus outbreak has reached a ""decisive point"" and has ""pandemic potential"", World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus says. His comments come as countries around the world battle to prevent the virus spreading further. For a second day, more cases have been reported outside than inside China. Iran and Italy have become major centres of infection, with people travelling from there spreading the virus further afield. Several high-profile Iranian officials have become infected, the latest being Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar. ""It's what's happening in the rest of the world that's now our greatest concern,"" Dr Tedros said. As it happened: Updates as cases spread around world How close are we to a pandemic? What you need to know Globally, more than 80,000 people in nearly 50 countries have been infected. Nearly 2,800 have died, the majority in China's Hubei province. Meanwhilestock markets around the world have fallen sharplyamid fears that increased travel restrictions will prevent business activity. Dr Tedros urged governments to act swiftly and aggressively to contain the virus. ""We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,"" he said. ""This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,"" he added.

It is not clear if the Hajj pilgrimage, which begins in July this year, will be affected Iran has urged citizens to avoid making unnecessary trips within the country and cancelled Friday prayers in Tehran and other cities Australia is extending a ban on foreign visitors from mainland China Italy, where 17 people have died, has quarantined 11 towns Greece is cancelling all carnival activities The closures are set to take effect on Monday and will last until the end of spring vacation - typically in early April. The move will affect about 13 million students. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the first weeks of March would be an ""extremely critical period"" for preventing virus transmission. It follows China's decision not to reopen schools on the mainland after the Spring Festival holiday and instead ask nearly 200 million students to follow classes online from their homes. Hong Kong is also keeping schools closed until April. Japan's school closures will affect 13 million students Many parents in Japan are concerned about what they will do with their children. ""My honest feeling - all schools on break? It's important to protect children, but what happens if they have working parents?"" one parent wrote on social media. Where are we with a coronavirus vaccine? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Officials say child day care centres and after-school facilities can remain open. More than 200 people have so far been infected with the coronavirus in Japan. One woman in her forties in Osaka is said to have tested positive for a second time after earlier recovering.

Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Global stock markets suffer sixth day of losses Ms Ebtekar's symptoms are reportedly not severe and she is not in hospital. Ms Ebtekar - one of Iran's vice-presidents - has contracted the virus The WHO's Michael Ryan said the extent of infection in Iran ""may be broader than we think"". But he said the country had a ""very high clinical capacity"" and the current 10% death rate for cases there probably reflected screening that was not picking up mild coronavirus cases. Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur called on Iranians to avoid ""unnecessary trips inside the country"". Iran's neighbours have closed their borders. The UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Estonia in northern Europe all recorded new cases of the virus in people travelling from Iran. Mark Lowen, BBC Rome correspondent Italy's government is in fightback mode, trying a concerted approach to lessen the coronavirus panic. The foreign minister warned that an ""epidemic of misleading information"" would damage Italy ""more than the virus itself"", which, he added, had infected 0.1% of towns in the country. ""It's time to stop the panic"", said the prime minister, asking the national broadcaster Rai to ""tone down"". This video can not be played Quiet on Venice streets amid coronavirus fears On the front pages of Italian newspapers, the top story is no longer the rising number of cases but appeals for calm. The mayor of Milan, where many hotels and restaurants are half-empty, has called for some museums to reopen.A new video released by the authorities shows vibrant scenes,externalfrom the city with the message: we're not afraid and we're open for business. But this is a story driven by perceptions. And with Donald Trump mentioning possible future travel restrictions to Italy, with Israel barring foreigners arriving on flights from Italy, with Kuwait evacuating its nationals from Milan, the Italian government faces a challenge to change the narrative.

Ministers 'need to get on' with EU aid replacementWales' Brexit minister urges clarity from the UK government on how EU cash will be replaced.Wales politics,"The Welsh Government wants to keep control of what replaces EU funds Wales' Brexit minister Jeremy Miles has urged the UK government to give ""clarity and commitment"" that EU funding will be fully replaced. UK ministers have vowed to substitute the Â£375m that Wales gets annually from the EU, but have not confirmed how. Mr Miles said there was ""no time to lose"". The Welsh Government wants to keep control of the cash but a Tory MP said it could be spent better. The UK government said it was committed to the devolution settlement. Large parts of Wales received extra cash from the EU in the form of economic aid but the funds have been administered by the Welsh Government. The UK government has promised a new Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF) to replace the money, which has continued to be paid under the transition period that ends in December. The Conservative general election manifesto promised the replacement would match the size of EU funds ""at a minimum"". Under EU structural funds Wales would have received more than Â£5bn by 2020. EU fund replacement 'lack of clarity' UK's EU trade stance will cost Welsh jobs, says FM What happens next with our EU funding? David Jones, Conservative MP for Clwyd West and a former Brexit minister,has called for the SPF to be run from Westminster, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last year there should be ""strong Conservative influence"" over how the cash is spent. Mr Miles told BBC Wales: ""I'd urge them to bring forward a clear commitment that there won't be a penny less for Wales, and the devolution boundary will be respected. ""We haven't yet had from them the level of clarity and commitment that we would expect. ""There is really no time to lose for this. We are in a situation where these programmes ought to be in place at the beginning of next year, and so really we need to be getting on with it,"" he said. Mr Miles spoke as the Welsh Government launched a consultation on its own proposals. It has set out four priorities for investment - business productivity and competitiveness, reducing income inequalities, healthier and more sustainable communities, and a zero-carbon economy. Jeremy Miles said the UK government had ""no time to lose"" in replacing EU funds Stephen Crabb, Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire and chair of the Welsh affairs committee, said too often EU funds to Wales were spent ""wrongly"". ""I don't think there was enough focus on strategic infrastructure. I don't think businesses were closely involved enough in the design and spending decisions previously, so we have an opportunity to rectify all of that. ""I don't want to see any less money coming to Wales but I want to see the pot of money being spent better."" In response Mr Miles said he did not accept the use of EU funds had not been effective - ""quite the opposite"", he said. But he added: ""There's always room to learn and do better in the future, and there are flexibilities which we can take advantage of in how we design some of these programmes... which help us with spreading geographically across Wales."" A UK government spokesman said: ""The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will tackle inequalities between communities by raising productivity, especially in those parts of our country whose economies are furthest behind. ""The UK government remains committed to respecting the devolution settlement and working closely with the Welsh Government to ensure that the fund delivers for the people of Wales. ""The secretary of state for Wales has also reaffirmed his commitment to the positive working relationship which exists between both governments in Wales.""

At risk gamblers 'need better protection',"More should be done to limit problem gambling, including toughening up oversight of the Â£11bn industry, the National Audit Office (NAO) has said. The body, which scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, called for better protection for ""at risk"" gamblers. It said the government should look at the way the regulator, the Gambling Commission, is funded. The Commission said it agreed that more needed to be done. The NAO report,externalsaid that licensed gambling - excluding the National Lottery - had increased by 57% over the past decade. Much of this rise, it said, was due to an increase in licensed online gambling, which rose sharply in November 2014 when a change in regulations meant all online gambling needed to be licensed, including firms based overseas. William Hill site penalised over gambling addicts The people most likely to have a gambling problem Gambling links with football have 'gone too far' Gambling on credit cards to be banned ""The Gambling Commission is a small regulator in a huge and fast-evolving industry. While the Commission has made improvements, gambling regulation lags behind the industry,"" said Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO. The Commission estimates 1.8 million people are ""at risk"" gamblers and 395,000 are ""problem"" gamblers, including 55,000 children. Gambling addiction can lead to mental health problems and severe financial difficulties. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: ""We agree with the report's assessment that we face the significant challenge of regulating a dynamic and developing industry"". It was already discussing proposals to reform its funding model with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, it added. The Commission received Â£19m of funding in 2018-19, almost all of which came from the licence fees charged to operators, the NAO's report said. The organisation does not have the power to increase the licence fees it charges, making it difficult to invest in new skills to respond to developments in the industry, the watchdog said. The fees are set through secondary legislation by the government every four years. Clarification 30th June 2020: This article was amended to reflect the NAO's finding that the 57% increase in licensed gambling was mostly due to a significant increase in licensed online gambling following changes to licensing regulations in November 2014.

Dow falls more than 4% amid coronavirus stock rout,"Financial markets suffered a sixth day of losses on Thursday, as traders dumped shares on fears that the spread of coronavirus will hobble the global economy. In the US, the Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,200 points to lose 4.4%. It was the sharpest points-drop in history. The S&P 500 ended 4.4% lower, while the Nasdaq dropped 4.6%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 finished 3.5% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 led Asian losses, falling more than 2%. The string of declines has pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. The tumult comes as the coronavirus, which started in China, spreads rapidly around the world, restricting travel, upending global supply chains and prompting shoppers in some countries to stay home. ""Markets move sharply when fear and uncertainty are prevalent, and there is plenty of both right now,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. Indexes in the US and London were poised for their the biggest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis, as the Dow retreated to levels last seen in August. Investors rushed into less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to record lows. Globally, the share price declines of the last six days have wiped out more than $3.6tn (Â£2.8tn) in value. The declines follow warnings from dozens of companies - from mining firm Rio Tinto to software giant Microsoft - that they will not hit sales targets. On Thursday, Facebook said it would cancel a conference for developers, scheduled for May. Economists, many of whom had originally expected the virus to be a temporary blow, are also sounding warnings. Japan to close all schools to halt spread Coronavirus: Sick pay rules apply, says pub chain How would the UK tackle a coronavirus outbreak? 'We're getting more orders thanks to the virus' At an event on Wednesday, former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested it could tip the US into recession, while Goldman Sachs told clients it did not expect companies to see any profit growth this year. ""Our reduced profit forecasts reflect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity... lower end-demand for US exporters, disruption to the supply chain for many US firms, a slowdown in US economic activity, and elevated business uncertainty,"" the firm wrote. The coronavirus has infected nearly 79,000 people in China and killed more than 2,700. More than 3,200 cases and 51 deaths have been reported in another 44 countries. Investors around the world are now looking to see if central banks respond with efforts to prop up the economy. Chinas's central bank has already taken stimulative measures. Germany's Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that while the impact of the virus so far had been limited, the country was considering how to respond should it worsen.

Britons in virus-hit hotel face flight delay,"Some 700 guests remain in quarantine at a hotel in Tenerife after four Italian tourists tested positive for the virus Britons confined to a hotel in Tenerife over coronavirus will not be flown home until next month, unless they have tested negative, airline Jet2 has said. It is understood travellers booked with Jet2 received messages saying it would not fly them to the UK until 10 March. It comes after three more people were diagnosed with the virus in the UK on Thursday, including Northern Ireland'sfirst confirmed case. That patient had travelled from northern Italy via Dublin. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer said ""robust infection control measures"" were in place. On Thursday, health officialsconfirmed two new cases of the virus in England, who contracted the virus while they were in northern Italy and Tenerife. It means 16 people have tested positive in the UK since the virus outbreak began in China in December. Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and festivals in the UK in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, which causes Covid-19. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time"". He said if the outbreak intensifies, it may be necessary to close schools and stop mass gatherings of people for ""quite a long period of time, probably more than two months"".

Some 168 Britons are among 700 guests who remain in the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, were diagnosed with coronavirus. On Thursday, the Canary Islands minister of health said a group of 130 low-risk guests - including around 50 British nationals - would be able to leave because they arrived on Monday and did not come into contact with the four Italians who tested positive. However, airline Jet2 has said it will not fly home any passengers who have been staying at the hotel until they have completed two weeks in quarantine, or tested negative for the illness. Lara Pennington, who is quarantined in the hotel with her family, toldBBC Breakfastshe was concerned that other Britons there were not taking isolation seriously enough.

""I think it would be unfair to me and my family and [would] put us at risk at that point,"" she said. In a statement, Jet2 said: ""We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for Covid-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus.""

The UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Estonia in northern Europe all recorded new cases of the virus in people travelling from Iran.

But this is a story driven by perceptions. And with Donald Trump mentioning possible future travel restrictions to Italy, with Israel barring foreigners arriving on flights from Italy, with Kuwait evacuating its nationals from Milan, the Italian government faces a challenge to change the narrative.

Gambling industry 'needs tougher regulation',"More should be done to limit problem gambling, including toughening up oversight of the Â£11bn industry, the National Audit Office (NAO) has said. The body, which scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, called for better protection for ""at risk"" gamblers. It said the government should look at the way the regulator, the Gambling Commission, is funded. The Commission said it agreed that more needed to be done. The NAO report,externalsaid that licensed gambling - excluding the National Lottery - had increased by 57% over the past decade. Much of this rise, it said, was due to an increase in licensed online gambling, which rose sharply in November 2014 when a change in regulations meant all online gambling needed to be licensed, including firms based overseas. William Hill site penalised over gambling addicts The people most likely to have a gambling problem Gambling links with football have 'gone too far' Gambling on credit cards to be banned ""The Gambling Commission is a small regulator in a huge and fast-evolving industry. While the Commission has made improvements, gambling regulation lags behind the industry,"" said Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO. The Commission estimates 1.8 million people are ""at risk"" gamblers and 395,000 are ""problem"" gamblers, including 55,000 children. Gambling addiction can lead to mental health problems and severe financial difficulties. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: ""We agree with the report's assessment that we face the significant challenge of regulating a dynamic and developing industry"". It was already discussing proposals to reform its funding model with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, it added. The Commission received Â£19m of funding in 2018-19, almost all of which came from the licence fees charged to operators, the NAO's report said. The organisation does not have the power to increase the licence fees it charges, making it difficult to invest in new skills to respond to developments in the industry, the watchdog said. The fees are set through secondary legislation by the government every four years. Clarification 30th June 2020: This article was amended to reflect the NAO's finding that the 57% increase in licensed gambling was mostly due to a significant increase in licensed online gambling following changes to licensing regulations in November 2014.
