Special Tiara wins Champion Chase,"The win for Special Tiara gave Fehily his 100th winner of the season Cheltenham Festival on the BBC Dates:14-17 MarchVenue:Cheltenham Coverage:Commentary on BBC Radio 5 live & BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app(full coverage details) Special Tiara won the Queen Mother Champion Chase but 2-9 favourite Douvan struggled in a major shock on day two of the Cheltenham Festival. The 10-year-old Special Tiara (11-1) finished a head clear of Fox Norton (7-1) with Sir Valentino (33-1) third. It was jockey Noel Fehily's second big-race victory of the Festival followingTuesday's Champion Hurdle success. Douvan, ridden by Ruby Walsh, jumped poorly and was never in contention, finishing seventh. A post-race examination by a veterinary officer found Douvan to be lame behind. Full Queen Mother Champion Chase result Listen: 5 live podcast reacts to Day Two at Cheltenham Fehily told BBC Radio 5 live: ""[Special Tiara] felt great and never missed a beat. I have been second in this race a few times so to win one is brilliant."" Unbeaten in 13 previous starts for trainer Willie Mullins, Douvan's defeat was described by BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght as ""one of the biggest upsets in Cheltenham Festival history"". Douvan, who was the subject of a Â£500,000 bet at odds of 1-5, which would have produced winnings of Â£100,000, had never looked himself, and afterwards Mullins suggested the seven-year-old may have pulled something during the race. ""We are all a bit gobsmacked I think, he didn't jump as well as we had hoped with his usual fluency,"" Mullins told 5 live. ""Usually you find something wrong when that happens. ""He probably pulled something, a muscle, a ligament, hopefully something that will come right straight away. ""Over the first two fences, I thought he would have to be a super horse to win this, you don't get away with that in the Champion Chase. ""I'm hoping he could be one of the best horses I have ever trained. Today clearly was not his day. That's the way it is. ""We are all disappointed that this happened, now my main job is to find out what is wrong and how long it will take to fix."" Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent The defeat of Douvan has to rate as among the biggest shocks in Cheltenham Festival history. It's not just the odds, but since joining Willie Mullins this horse has been winning with an authoritative flamboyance that meant that practically everyone thought his opponents had the proverbial Everest to climb to beat him. And Douvan's defeat continued a challenging time for the normally rampant Ricci-Mullins-Walsh team and their expensively assembled string. But good for Special Tiara, a real trooper, in the race for the fourth time and just holding on to make the ever-reliable Noel Fehily a double championship-winning jockey this week. And he's on the favourite in Thursday's feature race too. Special Tiara's trainer Trainer Henry de Bromhead said: ""He seemed in great form coming into it, but it was hard to believe we could win with Douvan and everything else - Douvan had looked so good. ""For our lad, he just tries his heart out and no-one deserves it more."" Fehily, 41, added: ""I didn't think we'd beat Douvan, but I thought I had a great chance of being second. I got over the last and was surprised something hadn't come to me, but I knew he wasn't stopping."" After three wins on the opening day, trainer Gordon Elliott claimed another double whenCause of Causes(4-1) won the Cross Country Chase before the fast-finishingFayonagh(7-1) took the closing Champion Bumper Both were ridden by experienced Irish amateur Jamie Codd, who also had a Festival double in 2015, and who was full of praise for Cause of Causes. ""He's run at four Festivals now, been second once and won three times,"" he said. ""He's a great little horse and he's been marvellous for my career. ""He's an idle little horse but quick when you need him to be."" The most dramatic finish of the day saw the 7-2 favouriteMight Bitebeat his Nicky Henderson-trained stablemate Whisper (9-2) by a nose in the RSA Chase. De Boinville was a relieved man after Might Bite hung on to win Might Bite, ridden by Nico de Boinville, was comfortably ahead but made a mess of the last fence and then started to hang badly to his right. Whisper and Davy Russell saw an opportunity and got past the struggling Might Bite on the run-in, but de Boinville managed to correct his path with the aid of a loose horse and after the pair went past the post together, Might Bite was announced the winner. There were also first festival winners for trainers Ben Pauling, afterWilloughby House(14-1) beat Neon Wolf in the opening Neptune Investment Management Novices Hurdle, and for Nick Williams after the 33-1 chanceFlying Tigertook the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle under champion jockey Richard Johnson. And on Ladies Day, Jessica Harrington claimed her ninth Festival winner when Supasundae (16-1) took the Coral Cup. However, there was some sad news from the day's racing after Consul De Thaix suffered a fatal fall during the Novices Hurdle. His jockey Mark Walsh was treated for what was described as a ""concussive head injury"" and has been ruled out for the remainder of the Festival. After his wins in the Champion Hurdle (Buveur D'Air,) and the Queen Mother Champion Chase (Special Tiara), Unowhatimeanharry could give Noel Fehily a third big-race win in the Stayers' Hurdle, the feature race on day three. The nine-year-old is unbeaten in his last eight starts, including in the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle 12 months ago, and is likely to be sent on his way at very short odds - but he likes very testing ground and the drying conditions may not be to his liking Cole Harden won the race two years ago and is back again for the Warren Greatrex team. The Jessica Harrington-trained Jezki is one of six Irish declarations, with Willie Mullins responsible for Clondaw Warrior, Nichols Canyon and Shaneshill. Snow Falcon (Noel Meade) and Dedigout (Gordon Elliott) have also made the journey across the Irish Sea.

Marines 'wanted Afghan insurgent dead',"This video can not be played Sgt Blackman's murder conviction has now been reduced to manslaughter As theconviction of Sgt Alexander Blackmanfor shooting an injured Afghan fighter in 2011 is reduced from murder to manslaughter on the grounds of his mental illness, Royal Marines who fought alongside him have spoken for the first time - offering new insights into the killing. In interviews for BBC Panorama, the men from 42 Commando said they wanted the insurgent dead and their comrade ""took one for the team"" when he faced a court martial. His colleagues said they also suffered from post-traumatic stress and one marine believes such incidents occurred elsewhere during the conflict. There is much public sympathy for Blackman, 42, but few people who have watched the full video of the killing - recorded by another marine's helmet-mounted camera - would describe him as a hero. The footage has not been made public but Blackman can be heard trying to cover up his actions, making sure a helicopter above is out of sight before he delivers the fatal shot. Perhaps more understandable though is the sympathy of the men who fought alongside him and endured the same hardships. Colleagues suggested there were other pressures on Blackman, who was known as Marine A during the original trial process and was only fully identified when he was convicted. Rob Driscoll, who was at a nearby patrol base at the time of the killing, told Panorama: ""Everyone that was speaking on that radio was sending out a signal to Al... everyone wanted that guy to be dead."" He said no-one would have wanted to send out a medical team to help the insurgent because the ground could have been littered with roadside bombs, while a helicopter might have been targeted in the air. They would have done it for one of their own, but risking British lives for a wounded Taliban fighter ""who has been shooting at them for the last four months"" was less appealing, he said. The helmet-mounted camera of another marine filmed Blackman (pictured) shooting the prisoner Sam Deen, who was on the patrol, said: ""I do remember saying, 'yeah I would shoot him'... and I do think I influenced what happened"". ""A few of the other lads said that,"" Mr Deen said. The killing, on 15 September 2011, took place after a patrol base in Helmand province came under fire from two insurgents. One of the attackers was seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field. The footage from the helmet-mounted camera showed Blackman shooting the Afghan prisoner in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol. Blackman, from Taunton, was convicted of murder in November 2013 and jailed for life. He lost an appeal in May of the following year, but his 10-year minimum term was reduced to eight years. Five judges at the Court Martial Appeal Court in London have now ruled the conviction should be manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility, not murder. A further hearing will now decide what sentence Blackman should serve. This video can not be played Extract from helmet camera recording of incident in Helmand, Afghanistan Filmmaker and anthropologist Chris Terrill was embedded with Blackman's unit at the time of the shooting. His film for Panorama tries to look beyond the narrow focus of the helmet camera that led to Blackman's conviction and questions whether, in the slow attrition of war, they began to think as a pack and lose their moral compass. Speaking about Blackman's decision to kill the insurgent, Sam Deen says: ""I do think he took the responsibility for the younger ladsâ¦ he thought it was his responsibility to do it, and then move on."" Rob Driscoll admits to some sleepless nights but adds: ""I'm glad Al did what he did because all my guys went home"". Louis Nethercott, another Royal Marine on the patrol, tells Panorama: ""I think it was just another day in Afghanistan and that's the way it goes out there. ""And none of us got hurt so it was a successful day as far as I'm concerned"". Chris Terrill asks another Royal Marine who was on that tour whether he thought this was the only time such an incident occurred during the Afghan war. His answer - ""No"". Panorama, Marine A: The Inside Story will be on BBC One at 22:50 GMT, and available later oniPlayer.

Reality Check: Who benefits from National Insurance U-turn?,"Reality Check verdict:About 80% of self-employed workers will pay less National Insurance from April 2018, with the rest seeing no change after the government abandoned changes announced in the Budget. Chancellor Philip Hammond announced on Wednesday that he would not be raising Class 4 National Insurance contributions as he had planned to in last week's Budget. Class 2 National Insurance contributions will still be abolished from April next year. They are paid at a flat rate of Â£2.80 a week by anyone making profits of more than Â£5,965 a year. Figures prepared for the BBC by the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) suggest that about 20% of self-employed people earn less than Â£5,965. They do not pay any National Insurance and will still not pay any - that is about one million people. The remaining 80%, approximately 3.6 million people, will now get the cut to NI that they had been expecting since George Osborne announced the abolition of Class 2 contributions in 2016. These figures are not precise because they are based on an ONS survey, which estimates the distribution of earnings for the self-employed. In an interview the morning after last week's Budget, the chancellor said that 60% of self-employed workers would pay less NI as a result of the abolition of Class 2 contributions combined with the increase in Class 4 contributions. He said: ""Of the 15% of people who are self-employed, 60% will see a reduction in their National Insurance charge. Anyone earning less than Â£16,250 a year will see a reduction in the National Insurance contributions they pay."" That was clearly not the case - those earning less than Â£5,965 a year would not have paid any National Insurance either before or after the changes. The ONS survey estimates that 40% would have paid less NI, while 20% would see no change.

Ikea drivers living in trucks for months,"This video can not be played Emilian says he feels ""like a prisoner"" in his cab Lorry drivers moving goods in Western Europe for Ikea and other retailers are living out of their cabs for months at a time, a BBC investigation has found. Some drivers - brought over from poorer countries by lorry firms based in Eastern Europe - say their salary is less than three pounds an hour. They say they cannot afford to live in the countries where they work. One said he felt ""like a prisoner"" in his cab. Ikea said it was ""saddened by the testimonies"" of the drivers. The drivers the BBC spoke to were employed by haulage companies based in Eastern Europe, which are paid to transport Ikea goods. Romanian driver Emilian spends up to four months at a time sleeping, eating and washing in his truck. He moves goods for Ikea around Western Europe, and had been in Denmark most recently. He says the salary he takes home is a monthly average of 477 euros (Â£420). A Danish driver can expect to take home an average of 2,200 euros (Â£1,900) a month in salary. EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be ''guaranteed'' the host nation's ''minimum rates of pay'' and conditions. But companies can exploit loopholes in the law. Emilian's colleague Christian prepares dinner in the back of the truck Emilian is employed by a Slovakian subsidiary of Norwegian trucking company Bring, and is being paid as if his place of work is Slovakia - even though he never works there. He shows us where he sleeps - a sleeping bag in the back of his cab. According to EU law, drivers must take 45 hours weekly rest away from their cabs, but governments have been slow to enforce it. He says he cannot afford to sleep anywhere else - he receives around 45 euros (Â£40) a day in expenses, which is meant to cover all hotel bills and meals. Zoe Conway was reporting for the BBC'sTodayandVictoria Derbyshireprogrammes. During the working week, Emilian cooks and eats at the roadside. He says conditions have left him feeling ""like a prisoner, like a bird in the cage"". ""It's not good for drivers, it's not safe for other people on the road... it is possible to [cause an] accident,"" he says. One driver's belongings, as he waits to board a minibus home for the first time in months Asked if he has a message for Ikea, he says: ""Come and live with me for one week. Eat what I eat. See what is happening in reality with our lives."" After a few months on the road he will board a minibus back to Slovakia. His Slovakian employer, Bring, says Emilian is responsible for taking his rest breaks, and can return home whenever he likes. Emilian is not alone. We have seen the contracts of drivers working for some of Ikea's biggest contractors - each paid low Eastern European wages while working for months at a time in Western Europe. It is clear this way of treating drivers is widespread. It is not just within the Ikea supply chain, but also in those of several other big, household names. Emilian shows us inside his fridge In Dortmund, Germany - outside the biggest Ikea distribution centre in the world - truck drivers are drying their clothes. One is making his mash potato on a fuel tank. There is no toilet, no running water. Drivers from Moldova say they receive an average monthly salary of 150 euros (Â£130) from their employer. Legal action is now being taken against some of Ikea's contractors. In the Netherlands last month, a court ruled that Brinkman - which delivers Ikea flowers to the UK and Scandinavia - was breaking the law. The court found that drivers' pay was ""not consistent"" with Dutch wages law. The judge described conditions for drivers as an ""inhumane state of affairs'', and contrary to EU law. Edwin Atema, of trade union FNV, says he believes Ikea must have known of the conditions in which drivers are living. ""The Ukrainian, Moldovan, Polish guys remove the furniture from Ikea, they touch the furniture,"" he says. ""Ikea is the economic employer of all these workers here. They have so much power. Ikea has the tool in hand to change the business model with an eye blink."" One union, the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), met Ikea several times last year to discuss the issue - but talks ended in November. Ikea said it takes what drivers have told the BBC ""very seriously'' and are ""saddened by the testimonies"". It said it puts ''strict demands'' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance. 'Far more foreign lorries' Increasing numbers of foreign haulage companies are now moving goods in Britain. They are working for hundreds of different companies, including Ikea. At a lorry stop in Immingham, Lincolnshire, one anonymous Polish driver explains: ""We spend a lot of time living in lay-bys where there are no toilets, no showers, no facilities. Drivers at a lorry stop in Immingham, Lincolnshire ""The work is paid a bit better than what I would get in Poland, but this life is not good. I do it for my family.'' British haulage companies are nervous that they will be undercut by companies that could be breaking the law. Jack Semple says foreign haulage companies pose a road safety risk Jack Semple, from the Road Haulage Association, says: ""We are seeing far more foreign lorries that are frankly less compliant with drivers' hours and road-worthiness regulations. ""There is a road safety risk, and the Treasury is losing a fortune in tax revenue. ""They have to get a grip on this because big, well-known UK retailers and other companies are making increasing use of these firms because they don't cost very much.""

Fake news distorting the French election,"There is little over a month before the first round of the French election. ""Fake news"" seeking to distort France's political conversation is increasingly seen as a threat to the democratic process. The BBC is working in collaboration withCrossCheck,external, a journalism project set up byFirst Draft News,externalcomprising news organisations around Europe, to verify and debunk fake stories surrounding the upcoming French elections. Here are five stories news organisations working with CrossCheck have investigated so far. A fake news site registered in the US cloned the website of reputable Belgian newspaper Le Soir to make the false allegations. DATE OF PUBLICATION:24 February 2017 IMPACT:The story URL has generated almost 10,000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook CLAIM:A story shared by Marion Marechal-Le Pen, niece of National Front presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, claimed that the campaign of Emmanuel Macron, a centrist candidate, was financially supported by Saudi Arabia FACTS:The story is a fake,external. The site it appeared on - LeSoir.info - copied the design and layout of the real Le Soir website - LeSoir.be - to spread false information When Marion Marechal-Le Pen tweeted ""30% of Macron's campaign funded by Saudi Arabia? We demand transparency"", she appeared to have a reputable source. Le Soir is a French-language Belgian newspaper founded in 1887. But she had been caught out by some digital trickery. Someone had cloned the newspaper website to make the story look legitimate and published a false story on a similar domain - LeSoir.info. To further cover the author's tracks, clicking on any of the links on the fake news report page took you to the real Le Soir website. It's unclear who created the false story, but the domain of the fake site is registered to a Donald Thomas in Delaware, United States. Ms Le Pen deleted her tweet. Social media users have been sharing this map, falsely claiming that it depicts recent French rioting. DATE OF PUBLICATION:Various IMPACT:The map has been widely shared on social media, garnering thousands of shares and retweets. One Facebook post published on 15 February 2017 has been shared more than 12,500 times CLAIM:Social media user Bernard Barrier shared the infographic, claiming that it mapped ""clashes between the rabble and our police"" FACTS:The map was first published in November 2005,externaland is not an accurate representation of the current social tensions in France After the deaths of French teenagers Zyed Benna and Bouna Traore, in October 2005, France was engulfed in rioting and unrest. A state of national emergency was called as police officers were attacked and over 9,000 cars were set on fire in the suburban ""banlieues"", often poor areas with large immigrant communities. The map, which first appeared in aDaily Telegraph article,externalon 8 November 2005, to highlight the riots and unrest then, has been shared thousands of times on social media in recent weeks. Far-right accounts have falsely claimed it depicts current rioting in France and have used it to endorse the existence of ""no-go zones"". The image text reads: ""Thanks for housing us with your money, it's nice"". DATE OF PUBLICATION:10 March 2017 IMPACT:To date, the story URL has generated close to 10,000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook CLAIM:Website La Gauche m'a Tuer (which translates as ""the left-wing kills me"") published a story claiming that the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) will lend the French state 100 million euros (Â£87.3 million) to purchase hotels for housing asylum seekers FACTS:Two separate news stories have been conflated and altered,external, distorting the truth and exaggerating the assistance available to asylum seekers Le Figaro reports,externalthe Accor hotel group is selling 62 of its F1 brand hotels to the Societe Nationale Immobiliere (SNI) a community housing project. SAMU Social, a humanitarian public service offering emergency housing in several cities across France, will refer people who are in need of homes, including asylum seekers, to the project. Separately, and entirely unrelated, in 2015 a subsidiary of the SNI, Adama, borrowed 100 million euros (Â£87.3 million) from the CEB. Adama helps people in difficulty, including workers in precarious circumstances, people on minimum social benefits, asylum seekers and migrants. A screenshot of a tweet falsely attributed to Marine Le Pen's account, read: ""I am shocked to see that a public channel broadcasts a cartoon whose heroine wears the veil"". DATE OF PUBLICATION:26 February 2017 IMPACT:A tweet from February was shared over 1,700 times CLAIM:An anti-National Front Twitter account claimed that French presidential candidate and National Front leader Marine Le Pen criticised a children's cartoon, Masha and the Bear, because Masha wore a ""veil"" FACTS:Marine Le Pen did not tweet that - a screenshot of the image is doctored,external. Satirical website secretnews.fr published a 2014 article on the same topic As Marine Le Pen visited Nantes for a rally in February, a tweet purportedly revealing her criticism of a children's cartoon was spreading on Twitter. But the image was a fake. The person behind the tweet, who did not want to be named, told Crosscheck it was designed ""to demonstrate how easy it is to misinform on Twitter"" and that it ""was part of the fight against [extreme right groups]"". The translated headline reads: ""The French state will replace two public holidays with two Muslim and Jewish holidays"". DATE OF PUBLICATION:12 March 2017 IMPACT:The story URL has generated approximately 6,000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook CLAIM:Some French websites have run stories claiming that two new Muslim and Jewish public holidays will be introduced FACTS:The government has never announced such a proposal,external, although a think tank, Terra Nova, has advocated the idea The introduction of Muslim and Jewish public holidays in France is not a new idea. MEP Eva Joly proposed something similar when she stood as a French presidential candidate representing The Greens in 2012. And a recent report from the think tank, Terra Nova, reignited the debate when it recommended ""integrating at least two important dates, Yom Kippur and Eid al-Adha, as public holidays"". However, the government has not announced such a measure and the think tank's recommendations do not have to be adopted.

'A lovely man': The woman who dated the Man on the Moor,"On 12 December 2015 a man's body was found lying on the ground on Saddleworth Moor. He had died from poisoning. He became known as theBody on the Moor. And the struggle to identify him became one of the strangest mysteries. No mobile, no identification of any kind. No family or friends came forward. One of the few people with any insight into the puzzle behind the man's death was Maureen Toogood. Maureen had a relationship with a man starting in the late 1960s. They didn't marry and she ended up marrying someone else but they stayed friends. For 40 years they saw each other regularly - she helped him in his garden and around the house. Then in 2006 he simply vanished from Maureen's life - upped sticks and left the country. All of the interviews here are taken from thenew episodeof the World at One's  Body on the Moorpodcast seriesby Jon Manel. Maureen believed he had sold his home and emigrated to California. The first she heard was when she received a call from his neighbour. She was told he was going to the US the following day. ""I was very hurt by this,"" she says. She was unable to contact him because his phone had been disconnected.  Since then, she says, she has thought about him often. Eleven years later she got another phone call. This time from the police. They had finally identified the body on the moor. They were calling because it was David Lytton, her friend. They knew little of his life and Maureen was able to fill in some of the gaps. Before he left in 2006, David had lived an apparently unremarkable life in south-west London, working as a croupier, a taxi controller for a mini-cab company, a baker and a train driver for the London Underground. Maureen says she met David in 1968. She was suffering from flu at the time but had ventured out to Finchley in north London to buy a stereo. It was the Last Night of the Proms and she wanted to enjoy listening to it at home. ""I didn't feel very well. I was on my knees, and I was collapsing. There was a young man who went 'Oh, hang on, hang on I'll come over,'"" she remembers. ""He walked home to my flat and he made me a nice cup of tea. We hit it off. He made me some toast - I hadn't had any breakfast and he stayed with me until my flatmates came home."" The following day, she says, he was back on her doorstep. ""'Hello, do you remember me?' he said. And he kept coming round every day. He didn't leave me at all. We would even meet in the launderette round the corner and do our washing together."" She describes him as a gentleman who liked to take care of her. He treated her to haircuts in fashionable Mayfair, where he was working as a croupier. But, although he was happy to treat his girlfriend, there were few extravagances for himself. His house in Streatham was sparsely decorated. There was no bed, just a piece of foam and a three-piece suite from a second-hand shop. Two items do stand out, though. Korans, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, she says. There was nothing in the kitchen - no fridge, no kettle, no food. ""He said he wasn't entitled to comforts. Where he got that I don't know,"" she says. The police went on to discover that David ate all his meals at the same local vegetarian restaurant at the same time each night. He dressed smartly and was very particular and precise. Maureen says she could have predicted the clothes that he would be wearing the morning he was found: ""M&S socks, white Jockey underwear, white vest, a singlet, cord trousers - navy blue, and round-neck sweater and an old mac that he probably had 30 or 40 years."" His luxury was a pair of shoes made by the Swiss designer Bally. David grew up in the north London suburb of Finchley. He was born David Keith Lautenberg on 21 April, 1948 to Sylvia and Hyman Lautenberg. He was Jewish, his family having originally come to Britain fleeing from Europe. At some time, his immediate family changed their name from Lautenberg. He changed his name to David Lytton in 1986. Timeline -David Lytton's final journey - from Lahore to Saddleworth Moor Thursday 10 December 2015 10:30 - Boards a Pakistan International Airways plane in Lahore and travels to London. He sits in economy seat 25C. 15:30 - Lands at Heathrow - he is met by a friend of 35 years and they have dinner together at the airport. Evening - Checks into the Travelodge in Ealing Broadway and books a room for five days. Friday 11 December 2015 09:04 - He pays Â£4.80 cash for a single ticket at Ealing Broadway and gets on the tube. 09:50 - At Euston station pays Â£81.60 cash for an off-peak return ticket to Manchester. 10:00 - Train departs, on its journey it stops at Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Stockport. 12:07 - Arrives on platform 6 at Manchester Piccadilly. At the station he visits a gambling arcade, Boots, WH Smith and buys an M&S sandwich. 13:00 - Leaves Manchester Piccadilly station on foot towards the city centre. There are a ""missing 59 minutes"" in the timeline - the police do not know how he got from the station to a pub 12 miles away. 14.00 - Walks into The Clarence Pub in the village of Greenfield, close to Saddleworth Moor - he asks the locals for ""directions to the top of the mountain"". 16.00 - As the sun sets across the moor, he passes two RSPB members walking down from the mountain. Saturday 12 December 2015 10:47 - David's body is discovered by a cyclist high up on the moor. The cyclist calls the police. Incident Log 936 reads ""male deceased found in local beauty spot"". Maureen and David met not long after he left Leeds University. He had gone to study psychology and sociology but, according to the police, he suffered from hypothyroidism and found it difficult to sleep at night. Instead, he slept during the day and didn't get the grades he wanted. When he returned to London he fell out with his family and moved out of his home. Maureen describes David as a ""strange"" man with some ""quirky ways"". ""But I did like him,"" she says. ""He was very particular, very precise and a gentleman. He was a lovely, lovely man."" He didn't have any hobbies or particular interests that she knew of. But the police have discovered that David had an interest in different religions, including Buddhism and Islam. His last job was as a driver for the London Underground, one which he was well-suited to, says Maureen. ""He enjoyed that - he liked his own company. He was a loner."" Maureen and David had a pregnancy which ended in miscarriage. She says he changed greatly after that, he became withdrawn and quiet. Unbeknown to Maureen, David put his house up for sale in 2005. It sold on 4 October 2006, and he left for Pakistan on 6 October - not California as Maureen had mysteriously been told. His departure, it seems, was part of a plan - not a sudden disappearance. For Detective Sergeant John Coleman, this was one of the hardest cases of his career. He never dreamed it would remain unsolved for so long. Early in the investigation, he believed a titanium plate that had been fitted during an operation on the man's leg would provide the answer. This type of plate is only used in Pakistan, so police only needed to track down the surgeon. After months of searching, they drew a blank. But as the anniversary of the death of the man on the moor was approaching, there was a breakthrough. Initial inquiries had also focused on Ealing in West London, as it was here that the man was caught on CCTV. Because of the Pakistan connection and the fact that he had been seen walking from the direction of South Ealing, which is a few stops along from Heathrow Airport, DS Coleman had a hunch. He asked for all the passenger lists from Pakistan to be examined from the days before he was first spotted on CCTV in London. The task was to find someone who fitted the profile of a white male between 65 and 75, possibly travelling alone. At first, the person asked to do this failed to find a match. But as the anniversary approached, he revisited the case. ""That's a hell of a piece of work. Thousands and thousands of people. The tenacity of that officer,"" he says. A match was found. The man was British, so police contacted the UK Passport Agency and obtained a copy of his passport photograph. Although the picture was 10 years old, there was a resemblance. ""You can imagine the excitement in Oldham CID,"" says DS Coleman. CCTV images from Lahore airport came through on the anniversary of the death. The police had found their man. A DNA sample from a family member was needed for confirmation. Police checked the electoral roll in London. When this failed to turn up any leads, they turned to genealogy records. Eventually, they found David's mother Sylvia, who suffers from dementia and lives in a care home in London. The trail led to Maureen, who telephones the care home to check up on her former friend's mother every day. From David's visa for Pakistan, the police have been able to fill in some blanks. The found out that he set up home in an area called Hassan Town in Lahore. Neighbours say he kept himself to himself. One said he used to read all the time and visit the local internet cafe. ""He never bothered anybody, though local lads teased him at times,"" one told the BBC. ""He was nice to his neighbours and ate food sent by his next door neighbours. You would see him going for a walk in the morning, dressed in a tracksuit."" Another recalled him returning from the hospital after he had the plate fitted. ""His friend requested me to arrange for his food while he was on bed-rest,"" said Ejaz Ahmad. ""So my family looked after him, our children used to bring him fruit and go to the bakery to buy him cake or pastry. So he was in bed for 15 to 20 days and then he started walking slowly."" Another said that he was a Muslim and that David told him that he had converted in 1996. ""Now, I don't know whether he said this in view of the treatment meted out to Christians here, as they are made to eat in separate pots from us, Muslims, but he definitely told me that he was a Muslim."" The police say there is no evidence to suggest that he had converted to Islam. On Thursday 10 December, David Lytton sat in seat 25C on a Pakistan International Airlines Flight from Lahore arriving at London Heathrow at 15:30. He was met at the airport by a friend, who he had known for some 35 years. They ate a meal before the friend dropped David off at the Travelodge in Ealing. ""His friend indicated that since David had not been in the UK for some time, he wanted to spend some time - weeks or months travelling around and seeing the sights,"" says DS Coleman. Although he booked into the hotel for five nights, David only stayed one. And in keeping with the mysterious nature of this story, police have been unable to locate the 18kg suitcase that he brought with him from Pakistan. And what about the ""why"". Why did David Lytton travel to Manchester, and then out to the renowned beauty spot? ""I've got all the GP's records - I have records from university - there is no connection to Dovestones,"" says Detective Sergeant Coleman. At the inquest in Manchester, Coroner Simon Nelson said Mr Lytton ""died of his own hand"", but he couldn't be sure whether Mr Lytton had intended to take his own life.

Syria's war has changed but not ended,"The view from the presidential palace in Damascus is the brightest it has been since the war in Syria started. Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision at the end of 2015 to increase enormously the support he was giving to President Bashar al-Assad has transformed the war in the regime's favour. The fall of the eastern side of Aleppo in 2016 was a hammer blow to the armed rebels who once had hopes of toppling the regime. President Assad has not won the war. But it is hard to see now how he can lose it, without an equally decisive intervention against him by an outside power. The jihadist group Islamic State was incubated by the war. It started as an offshoot of al-Qaeda in Iraq. When it was driven out it was able to regroup and transform itself in Syria, taking over territory that the central government lost. Pro-democracy protests erupted in Syria in March 2011 The first peaceful demonstrations against the regime in March 2011 seem a world away. Change seemed to be sweeping the region. President Assad had talked endlessly about reform of the system in Syria since he inherited power from his father in 2000. He admitted there was corruption. He did not talk about the well-documented brutality of the security services. By the standards of the leaders of authoritarian Arabs he seemed relatively open to new ideas, but he never translated talk into action. President Bashar al-Assad dismisses all armed opponents as ""terrorists"" The immediate assumption in 2011 was that Bashar al-Assad would go the way of the leaders of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. But the Syrian regime, unlike those in Tunisia and Egypt, was well constructed to resist rebellion, around a core of Alawites from the president's own minority sect. Unlike Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, Syria's president never lost the loyalty of his armed forces, or of his key foreign allies. He also had real support from important sectors of the population, without which he would not have survived. Syria has been caught up in the tide of sectarianism that has ripped across the Middle East since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Most of the rebels were Sunnis: Sunni governments in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar supported different groups. The dominant Alawite minority in Syria is a branch of Shia Islam; the regime's biggest supporters outside Russia are the Shia regime in Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia movement. By 2012, the violence had escalated and the country had descended into civil war The first generation of rebels begged Western powers, and sympathetic Saudis and Qataris, for military support. It arrived, but not on the scale that Russia gave President Assad later in the war. In Libya, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi would probably have regained his grip on power had the UK, France and the US, and allies from Nato and Arab countries, not provided the rebels with an air force. Nothing like that was attempted in Syria. Generals from Nato countries say that early in the war they had credible plans that could have ended the Syrian war. But they did not have political leaders who were prepared to take the considerable risk of intervening - and in the White House, President Barack Obama was determined not to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor George W Bush by getting involved in another big Middle Eastern war. Western powers blamed the government for a deadly chemical weapons attack in 2013 The crucial turning point came in August and September of 2013, after an attack using chemical weapons on rebel-held areas in the suburbs of Damascus. President Obama first threatened force against the regime, then changed his mind. In wars, hard power is decisive. Without it, Western countries could only huff and puff against President Assad. Western countries never decided what they wanted in Syria, beyond saying that Mr Assad had to go. President Putin knew exactly what he wanted - to preserve a friendly regime and show his supporters and the wider world that Russia was back on the world stage. He made it happen. Barack Obama's decision not to forcefully respond to the 2013 attack angered the opposition From the very beginning, President Assad and his people have presented the war as a foreign conspiracy intended to destroy secular, multi-cultural Syria. The choice, he said, was stark - the regime or Islamist, terrorist extremists, and he made no distinction between different kinds of armed opposition. They were all terrorists, all enemies of the Syrian people and therefore were legitimate targets. The Syrian armed forces, President Assad has said throughout, are the protectors of the people. Government forces have regained control of many areas of the country since late 2015 Early in the war, if you crossed the line from regime held areas to ones controlled by rebels, as I was able to do several times, the message was very different. Fighters denied foreign conspirators inspired them. Many said they were local men who had taken up arms against a cruel dictator. Some were migrants from the countryside who had suffered badly during years of drought that had been handled badly by corrupt and inept administrators. But that relative simplicity became muddled as the war developed layers of conflict, as rebel groups changed, sometimes self-destructed, fought each other as well as the regime, and were kept under constant pressure by the Syrian military. The city of Homs, dubbed ""the capital of the revolution"" suffered widespread destruction The people of Syria suffered appalling privations. Half lost their homes, and either left the country as refugees or were displaced, often many times, within Syria. The Syrian armed forces used siege tactics against enclaves controlled by rebels, sealing them off, stopping food deliveries, and shelling and bombing from the air. Civilians died in huge numbers. All the available statistics, denied by the regime, say that the biggest killer of civilians has been the Syrian armed forces. More children died in 2016 than in any other of the previous five years of civil war I have interviewed the president, and had many conversations with Syrian officers about the scale of killing by the military. They deny it has happened, and speak passionately about their desire to protect Syrians from religious extremists. But the tactics they have used against areas controlled by rebels and with large civilian populations guarantee that many will die. Barrel bombs are an indiscriminate weapon, and artillery and air strikes have laid waste to huge areas. I have seen the damage myself in areas recaptured from rebels. In many parts of east Aleppo, which was pounded by the regime and by the Russians, it is hard to find buildings that are undamaged. Entire districts were levelled. Rebel groups have also used indiscriminate force, but they have a fraction of the firepower of the regime and its allies. Rebel fighters and allied jihadists are estimated to control about 15% of Syria Statistics are unreliable in a country that has been in chaos, with many areas impossible to reach. But they give an idea of what has happened. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is a monitoring group based in the UK using sources in Syria, says 321,000 people, including 96,000 civilians, have been killed in the war. Another 145,000 are missing, it says. So many foreign powers, Western as well as Middle Eastern, have intervened in Syria that it became a mini world war. The regime is secure, but it does not control large areas of the country. Civilians continue to suffer. More people are going to die in a war that has changed but not ended.

Why Republican support for Trump is sky-high,"Mr Trump was chosen as the Republican nominee for president after a fierce and often bitter battle with opponents He's fallen out with judges, journalists and intelligence agents, and his approval rateis a measly 41%,externalamong all adults in the US. But there's one group of people with whom President Donald Trump is still hugely popular. After his first weeks in office, his approval rate among Republicans of 86% is second only to that of George W Bush among all of the party's presidents elected in the last 65 years. So what are the things that they like so much? Despite being a Republican, property developer John Delia says he was ""too embarrassed"" to vote for Mr Trump in November's election because of the controversy about his candidacy. But he says he was ""relieved"" to see the New York billionaire win the race - and what has happened since has pleased him even more. Mr Trump's platform of new jobs, American business and economic renewal has sent the US stock market to record highs. It is investors like Mr Delia who are feeling richer as a result. ""I invest in the stock market and I have succeeded in the short term,"" says the 26-year-old, based in Columbus, Ohio. ""Investors are definitely feeling more confident. They think Donald Trump is going to bring more jobs and infrastructure, and help us move forward."" From a business perspective, he says he is not fazed about allegations of improper ties to Russia, legal challenges to Mr Trump's travel ban, or complaints about racist rhetoric from the administration. ""Yes, he's a bigot but at least you are aware,"" says Mr Delia of the US president. ""He speaks honestly. ""No matter what happens, most investors just want to make money. We are not going to pay attention to the drama. We're just trying to stay ahead of the curve."" And it is especially Mr Trump's promise to ""clean up"" America's inner cities that makes Mr Delia, who started his own property portfolio at 20, feel positive about the future. He hopes investment will pour into his own urban development projects. ""I think I'm going to make a lot of money,"" he says. President Trump made revival of the coal industry a key campaign pledge The next interviewee asked to remain anonymous, because he says the polarised political climate in the US has left him feeling ""a bit paranoid"". ""I often feel the country is being torn about and being a white/Christian/conservative makes you a hater and a racist,"" he says. But in a social media conversation spanning several days, the 36-year-old coal miner from Indiana explained how Mr Trump's presidency was having a direct impact on his life. Before the election, the father-of-four says he expected to lose his job in coal within five years, but with Mr Trump in office ""it could be as many as 15"". He puts this down to the president's cancelling of an Obama-era environmental regulation known as the ""stream protection rule"". The bill put restrictions on coal companies wanting to expand and tried to stop them dumping mining waste into streams and waterways. While environmentalists point out that the rise of cheap natural gas has contributed largely to decline in the US coal industry, the Indiana coal miner we spoke to says the policy put a ""stranglehold on coal companies"". ""During 2016 our company was in the process of getting permits to strip some land that would add life to the mine,"" he says. ""The permitting process was put on hold concerning a impact study on the land. Management told the miners that if we didn't get any new permits and most of them were on hold indefinitely, we would be out of work in a few years."" Now Mr Trump has lifted the rule, he feels ""hopeful"" that he will be able to continue the work done by his great-grandfathers for years to come. ""Some people really dislike the coal industry... but it's the best paying job around and I'm blessed to be able to work and support my family."" Marilyn De Reggi was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer just a month before her late husband, Aime, had his first stroke. The 76-year-old says her experience of having to ""fight hard"" for him - while being unwell herself - left her with a low estimation of government-subsidised healthcare. She welcomes Mr Trump's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare as ""extremely important"". And while she also supports Mr Trump's tough immigration policies, she sees his push of an alternative system as one of the best things he's done so far. This video can not be played What's in the Republican healthcare bill? The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, helped 20m previously uninsured Americans get health insurance by making it a legal requirement. However, increases in insurance premiums - which were also a problem before the health law - have irked many Americans.Critics have also decried itas an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals. Mrs De Reggi, a retired musician and teacher who lives just outside Washington DC in Maryland, says the cost of President Obama's signature healthcare plan has left younger members of her family struggling. And although medical costs for her and her late husband were covered by Medicare (a different government-run programme available to elderly patients), this made her ""very aware"" of the problems with federal involvement. ""I encountered the worst of care with my husband and the limitations of government making decisions for you,"" she says. The couple went through ""a lot of savings"" after Aime was denied access to certain sorts of care under Medicare because of his age and condition, she says. Instead they had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure the treatment they wanted. She is now against ""the government making medical choices"". ""I'm interested in a programme gives people a choice and where there aren't committees that decide what happens to you at a certain age,"" she adds. ""I think the thing that [Mr Trump] has done so far that will have the greatest long term impact on the law is the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,"" says David Rogers, a housing lawyer from Texas. ""I think he brings predictability in the law. The law is not going to change dramatically and that is good."" The Supreme Court has the final legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues. Conservatives celebrated theselection of Judge Gorsuchto fill an empty seat on the bench because of his views on issues such as birth control and euthanasia. But it is his approach to gun rights that particularly pleases Mr Rogers. The 52-year-old says he expects the judge to protect the Second Amendment - which guarantees the rights of people to keep and bear arms - because he is known to maintain a strict interpretation of the US Constitution. ""I believe in guns,"" says Mr Rogers. ""Going to the gun range is something I do at the weekend with my children... With Gorsuch, I feel like I don't need to worry that's going to be taken away."" Judge Gorsuch's appointment still needs to be confirmed by the Senate. But if it goes ahead, ""Washington isn't going to actively make my life harder"", says Mr Rogers. ""Gun rights feel safer under Trump.""

Amol Rajan: Do technology giants face a backlash?,"Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg: a shared philosophy It is perhaps the most beguiling irony of our age that a new class of super-rich that has emerged on America's West Coast has its moral, intellectual and even spiritual origins in the anti-materialistic radicalism of 1960s counter-culture. Silicon Valley is what happened when the flower power generation sobered up. Steve Jobs was a Buddhist, though to what extent has been the subject of much debate. And the zealous mission on which Facebook is embarked - to create a more open and connected world, smashing barriers instinctively - owes a substantial debt to the baby boomers and their own particular doctrine, (John) Lennonism. When Mark Zuckerberg speaks, I always hear the lyrics to Imagine. Perhaps it is this moral component to what Silicon Valley's biggest companies do that has, for the most part, protected them from what I had long considered inevitable: a monumental backlash. I call this thetech-lash,external, and thought it would have two main components. First, anti-capitalism: the hostility toward plutocracy shown by groups such as Occupy Wall Street would, eventually, take aim at the astronomical wealth of tech billionaires - especially once it dawned on these protesters, and society at large, that compared to the industrialists of old, these companies don't actually employ many people. As a result, of the vast capital they have amassed, a disconcertingly small amount actually makes it to the labour force. That smells like trickle-down economics - without the trickle down. The second component of the tech-lash would arise from concerns about privacy, fuelled not least by the revelations from Edward Snowden. It is hard to get your head around just how much data companies such as Google and Facebook hold, and how much information they have about us - most of it voluntarily given over. If the civil liberties brigade ever needed a cause around which to rally, this could well be it. Together with disgust at how little taxes these companies pay, you have the elements of an almighty revolt. And yet, it hasn't really come: partly, I imagine, because of that sense of moral purpose; and partly because of the fact that these brilliant and uniquely innovative companies have improved our lives without asking us to pay a penny. Your appetite for being horrible toward Google is neutered when you use Gmail to rally comrades to a cause, and Google Maps to get to a protest. This, then, was the tech-lash that wasn't. Until now. Two stories this week suggest that the mood is changing. On Tuesday, the Home Affairs Select Committee gave aferocious grillingto senior executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter. Google, Facebook and Twitter faced the Home Affairs Select Committee The Daily Mail is usually a good indicator of which way the wind is blowing; its front page headline on Wednesday was ""Shaming of the web giants"". The next story that showed public feeling might be turning was on the front of another British newspaper - the Financial Times. And yet the story wasn't about Britain. The splash headline was: ""Berlin plans â¬50m [Â£44m] fines for hate speech and fake news"". This is a remarkable story: the German government is drafting legislation that will aggressively target internet companies, including social media giants, if they don't do enough to stop the spread of socially corrosive material online, particularly by giving users tools to flag such material. Germany is uniquely susceptible to the spread of fake news. The Daily Mail's hard-hitting headline Angela Merkel's hugely controversial refugees policy, the rise of the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, the constant threat from neo-Nazis, upcoming national elections, and the staid media landscape - staid compared with Britain's raucous tabloids, for instance - all make conditions ripe for exploitation. But Germany isnow leading the fight-back. Germans have a very different approach to the state to that which is fashionable on America's West Coast. The new tech giants are often libertarians who believe that innovation and technology can solve social problems much more effectively than government. They are diametrically opposed to what you might, crudely, call the Teutonic faith in regulation: many Germans - and indeed all those I spoke to while reporting there - believe that a smart, enabling state can, through effective legislation, mitigate social ills. If the much heralded tech-lash is finally upon us, it is the Germans who hold the whip hand. It isn't hatred of plutocracy, or love of privacy, that finally turned the temper of a people against tech giants: it is the threat of election, and legislative power falling into the hands of nasty forces, that has prompted action. Moreover, it took the German faith in the efficacy of regulation to confront those giants with the threat of punitive action. If the German proposal becomes legislation, it will offer a template that could be rolled out elsewhere. Whether this is the beginning of a tech-lash - a concerted effort by societies and government to, ahem, take back control from tech companies - or just an incremental development in a constantly maturing new world of law and power, is unclear. I would hope, whatever the regulatory fallout of the fake news phenomenon, the likes of Facebook and Google continue to earn immense respect for being better at providing exceptional services to customers than most companies in history. Does that include the British? Yes, basically: our political class reveres Silicon Valley and hopes to replicate its success over here. But my conversations in Westminster lead me to believe that, in Theresa May, we have a leader who is not far off the pragmatic, populist patriotism of Mrs Merkel; that, like the German chancellor, our prime minister is a provincial Tory who believes in the good that government can do. Theresa May admires the pragmatism of her German counterpart, Angela Merkel Given her one-nation rhetoric, Mrs May will be conscious that fake news - which Facebook is taking very seriously - does potentially pose a threat to the social solidarity. The prime minister and her most senior lieutenants are very close observers of German affairs, and there are people close to the top of British government  who are wondering what they can learn, and imitate, from this week's German proposal. In recent years, the moral fervour of those sons and daughters of the 1960s who have come to dominate Silicon Valley, and all our lives, has forged an alliance with wealth and power of a kind most of us can't imagine.

Could Leicester defy logic once again?,"Leicester are the first English side to overcome a first-leg defeat against Spanish opposition in the Champions League knockout stages since Chelsea in 2005 Leicester City delivered a new entry into their list of unlikely success stories with a stunning victory over Sevilla at the King Power Stadium that takes them into the Champions League quarter-finals. The club and team that makes a habit of turning logic on its head did it again as high-flying La Liga side's 2-1 advantage from the first leg was overturned amid an atmosphere of passion and emotion that evoked memories of last season's Premier League title win. It was made all the more remarkable by the fact that three weeks ago, after that first game in Spain, Leicester sacked Claudio Ranieri, the man who masterminded that title triumph, amid tales of dressing-room discontent and fears of relegation. How have they undertaken this transformation? And how far can they now go in the Champions League? Leicester beat Sevilla to reach Champions league last eight Foxes 'achieved the impossible again', says Morgan Football Daily podcast: Leicester win had 'epic quality of title-winning season' Craig Shakespeare has won all three of his games in charge of Leicester since succeeding Claudio Ranieri When Leicester sacked Ranieri on 23 February, the Champions League was an afterthought set alongside fears the Foxes were on course to drop into the Championship. They had dredged a creditable 2-1 loss out of a performance that was the final curtain for the popular Italian - but it was wider concerns that led to his dismissal. The club's Thai owners needed someone to rediscover the element that had been lost in the nine months since Leicester lifted the Premier League trophy in one of the greatest sporting stories ever told. They needed someone to keep them up, with any success in the Champions League falling into the category of added bonus. They turned to Craig Shakespeare, who came to the club with Nigel Pearson and stayed on to ride shotgun to Ranieri in that dream season. And, in an instant, the dial has been turned back. Shakespeare has restored this Leicester team to default, title-winning settings - and the transformation has been remarkable. Who's through to the last eight? Atletico Madrid/Bayer Leverkusen Barcelona Bayern Munich Borussia Dortmund Juventus Leicester City Manchester City/Monaco Real Madrid Shakespeare, in charge until the end of the season, has won three out of three. Impressive wins against Liverpool and Hull have soothed relegation fears but this win over Sevilla is the most compelling vindication of his methods. It was the kind of victory on which reputations are made and, in the case of Leicester's players, revived. He effectively restored the title team, with the obvious exception of Wilfred Ndidi for the departed N'Golo Kante, and ordered them to play in the same intense, counter-attacking manner - using the pace of Jamie Vardy and the creativity of Riyad Mahrez - that brought that success. It was a move that now has self-belief sweeping through the club, players and supporters, like a tidal wave. To watch the Foxes hurry Sevilla out of their stride was the equivalent of being transported back to last season. Shakespeare has gone back to improve the future. Leicester have returned to the uncomplicated success of last season, banishing the mediocrity and lacklustre performances of the early months of a season that threatened to be the biggest anti-climax of all. When they lost 2-0 at relegation rivals Swansea on 12 February, a result that helped to seal Ranieri's fate, they were in 17th place with 21 points from 25 Premier League games. This was a club in freefall. Leicester gave up a lot of possession to Sevilla but had more shots (13 to 11) and took the two they needed to win the tie Shakespeare's approach has been simple but very specific. Leicester have returned to what they do best and what opponents dislike most. And in doing so, the King Power Stadium is back to the imposing arena it was last term. Tuesday's win was driven by passion, noise and raw emotion. When the board went up to signal four minutes of stoppage time, a huge roar rippled around the stadium - a roar of inspiration, not fear. Those closing stages were pure theatre as the clock ticked down in an electric atmosphere. All the ingredients that made Leicester such a success story last year were back. There was still plenty of criticism of the club's players on social media on Tuesday from those who believed they downed tools under Ranieri only to pick them up once he was gone, but no-one seemed to care inside a thunderous King Power Stadium. This beating of Sevilla was the most emphatic justification of the events of the past few weeks. Leicester's owners deceided to sack Claudio Ranieri as manager after the first leg in Spain Leicester's Thai owners were painted as heartless, ruthless and almost the enemies of decency and manners when the dignified Ranieri was shown off the premises nine months after bringing them riches they could only have dreamed of. It was significant that when Leicester made their post-Ranieri return with a3-1 win at home to Liverpoolon 27 February, there was a march of thanks to the departed manager and many banners of appreciation, but little acrimony or open criticism of the club's hierarchy. This may have been a signal suggesting that, while their fans may have found the decision to remove the Italian uncomfortable, particularly given his obvious warmth and decency, they had been watching a floundering team and realised emergency action was needed. The club's decision-makers made the move with a heavy heart but without sentiment. Relegation was the fear and it needed to be avoided - and it is unlikely supporters would have thanked them for being sentimental all the way into the Championship. They have not looked for vindication or justification - remaining silent for the most part - but the performance against Sevilla and the securing of a place in the last eight of the Champions League is evidence that, no matter how unpalatable their sacking of Ranieri may have been to some, it was the right move. Leicester have joined the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus in the last eight Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, a former Leicester and England striker, tweeted that the decision was ""inexplicable, unforgiveable and gut-wrenchingly sad"". And there were many who shared his view. Results since, and the celebrations at the final whistle on Tuesday after another moment of Foxes history, give further credence to what many regarded as a cruel move. The Foxes' owners have a track record of taking the right decisions - and they look to have done so again. They kept faith with former manager Nigel Pearson through a period of struggle and he mounted an unlikely survival campaign to stay in the Premier League. And when he was sacked, the appointment of Ranieri - greeted with widespread scepticism - was a masterstroke. Former England defender Danny Mills, watching as a BBC Radio 5 live analyst on Tuesday, offered his support to the club's owners as he said: ""It's just a different Leicester from what we have seen this season. ""All those fans who thought it was a disgrace that Ranieri was sacked have got to eat some humble pie."" It still would have tasted sweet to those who questioned that decision as they made their way out into the streets around the stadium amid scenes of wild celebration. Kasper Schmeichel has saved both of his penalties in the Champions League this season, one in each leg against Sevilla It is surely stretching the credibility of even Leicester's scriptwriters to suggest they can win the Champions League - but who is to say they cannot make even more waves after Sevilla, Europa League winners three seasons in succession and third in La Liga, were beaten? This was a fully deserved win against a side rated as potential dark horses in the competition and comes on the heels of an impressive dismissal of Liverpool. The Foxes will be rank outsiders against Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus - or anyone who is pitted against them in the last eight. However, they will not shy away from any challenge, especially not at home and especially not if this arena is the stage for the second leg. There was a real air of intimidation, noise and theatre in the stadium against Sevilla and Leicester's fans are starting to dream again after the dark months between August and February. Under Shakespeare, they are playing in a manner designed to unsettle any side who takes the measured approach - and they will do it backed by a 90-minute wall of sound. All the odds suggest this latest great adventure should end at the next stage - but since when did the odds or logic come into this club's calculations?

Is this the food that is making us all fat?,"Oil was previously used sparingly in cooking A teaspoon of oil, measured out with precision, is how Professor Tim Benton remembers his mother preparing items for frying. When he was growing up in the 1960s, vegetable oil was still a precious commodity and used sparingly. Fast-forward to today and oil is now so abundant and cheaply available that most of us use it liberally in our cooking - chucking it in anything from salad dressings to deep fat frying. It's not only in our home cooking, oil is also an ingredient in most of the items we buy from the supermarket. In fact, vegetable oil, specifically soy bean oil and palm oil, are two of the eight ingredients, alongside wheat, rice, maize, sugar, barley and potato, that are now estimated to provide a staggering 85% of the world's calories. Increasingly, no matter what country we live in, we all eat similar diets which are heavy in calories and low in nutrients. It's a development that Prof Benton, a strategic research dean at the University of Leeds specialising in food security and sustainability, links directly to global trade. The production of vegetable oils and oil crops have both increased considerably over the past three decades. The rise has been  driven by a combination of trade agreements, which have made it cheaper and easier to export and import oil, and various government policies. Policy incentives in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, aimed at ramping up production for export, have helped to lower the cost of vegetable oil, for example. Obesity levels around the world have more than doubled since 1980 ""Competing in a global market requires a highly efficient production process driving scale and cheapness. Now we have a food system built on incredibly cheap calories,"" says Prof Benton. Of course, this food trade has in many cases helped reduce famine and, as Prof Benton points out, means the ""poorest of poor have access to cheap calories"". But he says this trade - which means more people are eating less healthy imports, rather than what is locally available - may also have helped to make us fatter. Over 50% of the world's population is not of a ""healthy weight"", according to Prof Benton'srecent report on food production,external. And worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980. ""The poorest anywhere still struggle to get sufficient calories and are underweight, but in our rich countries, poverty often does not stop people being able to eat (and drink) calories, but it does stop them having a nutrient-rich diet,"" the report says. Prof Corinna Hawkes, director of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London, says the greatest increase in sources of calories since the globalisation era began, has come from oil crops. ""There was a very sudden and marked increase in the availability of soybean and palm oil and that to me is directly related with policies that made it easier to trade,"" she says. The quinoa question - has globalisation disproportionately benefited those who are already advantaged? Oilseeds are now among the most widely traded crops, and most processed foods contain either palm oil or soybean oil, which can help extend shelf life, she says. ""Because it became much easier and cheaper for the processed food industry to import it there was no disincentive for using it,"" she says. A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. But fats are high in calories so eating a lot can increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese. Saturated and trans fats are also associated with heart disease. Prof Hawkes says that the low cost and availability of oil has meant some countries' cooking habits have changed. In China, for example, food is deep fried in high quantities of oil and in Brazil, people use larger amounts of oil in traditional dishes. But alongside the increased trade of oil crops, she says, it's important to note that trade in fruit and vegetables has also increased, meaning many people's diets have actually improved. This discrepancy is what Prof Hawkes calls the ""quinoa question"". Increasing western demand for the so-called ""superfood"", which has been grown high in the Andes for thousands of years, has been blamed for its skyrocketing price and unavailability for people in the countries it first came from. The question goes to the heart of the controversy surrounding globalisation: that its rise has disproportionately benefited people who are already advantaged. So while people clued-up on nutrition and health may be getting healthier thanks to global trade, those without this knowledge have seen their diet deteriorate. We can now work, shop and socialise from home whilst barely moving However, the findings ofa recent study by the London School of Economics (LSE),external, which looked at 26 countries between 1989 and 2005 when globalisation dramatically expanded, contradict this. The research concluded that ""social globalisation"" - changes in the way we work and live - was what was making us fat, rather than the wider availability of cheaper and more calorific foods driven by global trade. Basically, the fact that we are are now increasingly able to work, shop and socialise whilst barely moving a muscle is to blame, says study author Dr Joan Costa-Font. ""Our food intake is driven towards meeting the needs of a pre-global [socially speaking] world, where people would have to walk to places, and where there would not be as many energy-saving activities as today. Individuals would have closer personal social contacts, and would cook and spend more time on daily chores,"" he says. Dr Costa-Font says the research suggests that once people adapt their diet and lifestyle to these changes - basically move more and eat less - more normal weights will again prevail. He points to the US as an example. While obesity levels are alarmingly high at almost 35%, he notes that this level has stayed pretty much the same over the past decade. ""That's good news. That's already something. ""It may be that the US is beginning to start to learn how to eat and adjust its lifestyle to a global one. The hypothesis is that this rise in obesity is only transitory.""

What U-turn tells us about May's government,"""Screech!"" The tyre marks must be visible on the tarmac, the smell of burning rubber hanging in the air over Downing Street. Almost exactly seven days later to the minute, the prime minister and chancellor have dumped the most controversial part of their Budget, scrapping the planned rises to National Insurance. A U-turn so fast, so blatant, so complete, it's hard to think of recent examples that are so overt. Why? Number 10 and Number 11 were worried about the fact they would have been breaking a manifesto promise to carry the measure through. Theircomplicated excusejust didn't wash. Some Tory backbenchers were so unhappy about it that they had gone into overdrive trying to change the chancellor's mind. And in the end ditching the plan, while politically costly, doesn't cost that much money in the longer term, in the context of the whole government budget. So what does it mean? It undermines the credibility of the chancellor, an admission at the very least, that his political antennae have gone wonky. Second, it questions the extent to which the prime minister is willing to back him. Relations between the next door neighbours are businesslike and between their operations certainly frosty - and this will not have improved things at all. It also tells us that although polling suggests the prime minister is strong in the country, she's simply not that strong in Parliament. A firm nudge from backbenchers, and they shifted. One Tory MP told me he was ""lividâ¦ a little bit of difficulty and they give way?"" Given the complexities of what the government hopes to achieve in the next four years, for ministers to cave so quickly on this is worrying for some of their supporters. However, whereas in traditional times, a reversal like this would have been a disaster for the Prime Minister, instead, by the end of today's Prime Minister's Questions  Theresa May was leaning back and grinning, with the chancellor appearing relaxed alongside. You could see from the faces of Labour backbenchers, Jeremy Corbyn was unable to land any blows. Who would have thought it? A giant, embarrassing reversal from the government, a gift for the opposition, but the Labour leader instead was the one looking uncomfortable by the end of his weekly clash with Theresa May. A bad day at the office for them both.

All you need to know about the new Â£1 coins,"The new Â£1 coin comes into circulation this month, signalling the beginning of the end for the round pound, which will becompletely phased out by 15 October. If you're struggling to make heads or tails of the change, here's what you need to know, including what to do with your old coins and what it means for those supermarket trolley key fobs. Man dresses as a parrot to sell a house Will circular runways take off? Is this the food that's making us fat? Schoolboy David Pearce drew the ""tails"" design for the new Â£1 coin The new Â£1 coin is about the the same size as the old one but has 12 edges and is gold and silver. It features a hologram where the ""Â£"" symbol changes to the number ""1"" when viewed from different angles. The ""tails"" side was drawn by schoolboyDavid Pearce, who in 2015 created a designof the four plants that represent the UK's four nations. He said he ""spent a lot of time researching what coin designs looked like and what sort of designs would represent all parts of the UK"" before drawing a leek, thistle, shamrock and rose coming out of a crown. The new design is meant to be harder for criminals to fake and is billed as the ""most secure coin in the world"". About 45 million Â£1 coins, or 3% of those in circulation, are apparently counterfeit. Royal Mint, which produces the coins in its Llantrisant factory in Wales, says the new Â£1 features a complex ""patented high-security feature"" to prevent copycats. Distinctive features - including grooves on the coin and tiny lettering - are meant to make it easier for shopkeepers and bank tellers to recognise a genuine coin. This video can not be played The BBC's Jon Ironmonger reports: ""This year, all of the UK's pound coins will be phased out"" Shoppers can use both old and new coins from 28 March. They have until 15 October to spend old Â£1 coins or return them to the bank. If your local bank or Post Office refuses to accept them, they can be exchanged at the Bank of England in London. This means savers should raid their piggy banks and search sofas and glove compartments before their spare change loses its legal tender status. Business owners are being urged to make sure staff are trained to recognise the new coins and to change their equipment, with awebsite,externalaimed at firms explaining the changes. Vending machines, slot machines, parking meters and toilet turnstiles willall have to be adaptedto accept the new coins and reject old ones. Several supermarkets have said they are getting ready by making sure self-checkout machines accept old and new coins from 28 March. They will reject round Â£1 coins when they go out of circulation in October. But Bryony Andrews, features editor at Vending International magazine, warned that some vending machines might be slow to adapt. ""It could be difficult if operators haven't got around to updating their equipment in time,"" she said. ""In that case, there would be a period when they can't accept the old coins or the new ones."" If you have a key ring the same size as a Â£1 coin that fits in to supermarket trolleys, you may still be able to use it after October. The bigger supermarkets, including Morrisons and Sainsbury's, say their trolleys will accept both the new and old Â£1 coin, as well as tokens used to resemble them. Asda told customers not to ""worry about our trolleys"" which will accept the new Â£1 coin, the existing version and trolley tokens. Old Â£1 coins could become collectible when they cease to become legal tender, according to experts. ""The end of the round pound means many people will want a complete collection from 1983 to today,"" explains London dealer Richard Lobel, of Coincraft. He says coins in ""brilliant uncirculated condition"" are desirable but more as souvenirs than an investment. ""They're difficult to get because nobody puts them aside, after all they are Â£1 not a penny. But don't expect them to rocket in value."" Mr Lobel also advised people to save their new coins, which could become collectors' items. ""Lots of people save a coin in the first year of issue, but fewer in the second and in the third year fewer still,"" he says. ""Put a pound away every year and build up a little collection.""

Special Tiara wins Queen Mother Chase,"The win for Special Tiara gave Fehily his 100th winner of the season Cheltenham Festival on the BBC Dates:14-17 MarchVenue:Cheltenham Coverage:Commentary on BBC Radio 5 live & BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app(full coverage details) Special Tiara won the Queen Mother Champion Chase but 2-9 favourite Douvan struggled in a major shock on day two of the Cheltenham Festival. The 10-year-old Special Tiara (11-1) finished a head clear of Fox Norton (7-1) with Sir Valentino (33-1) third. It was jockey Noel Fehily's second big-race victory of the Festival followingTuesday's Champion Hurdle success. Douvan, ridden by Ruby Walsh, jumped poorly and was never in contention, finishing seventh. A post-race examination by a veterinary officer found Douvan to be lame behind. Full Queen Mother Champion Chase result Listen: 5 live podcast reacts to Day Two at Cheltenham Fehily told BBC Radio 5 live: ""[Special Tiara] felt great and never missed a beat. I have been second in this race a few times so to win one is brilliant."" Unbeaten in 13 previous starts for trainer Willie Mullins, Douvan's defeat was described by BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght as ""one of the biggest upsets in Cheltenham Festival history"". Douvan, who was the subject of a Â£500,000 bet at odds of 1-5, which would have produced winnings of Â£100,000, had never looked himself, and afterwards Mullins suggested the seven-year-old may have pulled something during the race. ""We are all a bit gobsmacked I think, he didn't jump as well as we had hoped with his usual fluency,"" Mullins told 5 live. ""Usually you find something wrong when that happens. ""He probably pulled something, a muscle, a ligament, hopefully something that will come right straight away. ""Over the first two fences, I thought he would have to be a super horse to win this, you don't get away with that in the Champion Chase. ""I'm hoping he could be one of the best horses I have ever trained. Today clearly was not his day. That's the way it is. ""We are all disappointed that this happened, now my main job is to find out what is wrong and how long it will take to fix."" Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent The defeat of Douvan has to rate as among the biggest shocks in Cheltenham Festival history. It's not just the odds, but since joining Willie Mullins this horse has been winning with an authoritative flamboyance that meant that practically everyone thought his opponents had the proverbial Everest to climb to beat him. And Douvan's defeat continued a challenging time for the normally rampant Ricci-Mullins-Walsh team and their expensively assembled string. But good for Special Tiara, a real trooper, in the race for the fourth time and just holding on to make the ever-reliable Noel Fehily a double championship-winning jockey this week. And he's on the favourite in Thursday's feature race too. Special Tiara's trainer Trainer Henry de Bromhead said: ""He seemed in great form coming into it, but it was hard to believe we could win with Douvan and everything else - Douvan had looked so good. ""For our lad, he just tries his heart out and no-one deserves it more."" Fehily, 41, added: ""I didn't think we'd beat Douvan, but I thought I had a great chance of being second. I got over the last and was surprised something hadn't come to me, but I knew he wasn't stopping."" After three wins on the opening day, trainer Gordon Elliott claimed another double whenCause of Causes(4-1) won the Cross Country Chase before the fast-finishingFayonagh(7-1) took the closing Champion Bumper Both were ridden by experienced Irish amateur Jamie Codd, who also had a Festival double in 2015, and who was full of praise for Cause of Causes. ""He's run at four Festivals now, been second once and won three times,"" he said. ""He's a great little horse and he's been marvellous for my career. ""He's an idle little horse but quick when you need him to be."" The most dramatic finish of the day saw the 7-2 favouriteMight Bitebeat his Nicky Henderson-trained stablemate Whisper (9-2) by a nose in the RSA Chase. De Boinville was a relieved man after Might Bite hung on to win Might Bite, ridden by Nico de Boinville, was comfortably ahead but made a mess of the last fence and then started to hang badly to his right. Whisper and Davy Russell saw an opportunity and got past the struggling Might Bite on the run-in, but de Boinville managed to correct his path with the aid of a loose horse and after the pair went past the post together, Might Bite was announced the winner. There were also first festival winners for trainers Ben Pauling, afterWilloughby House(14-1) beat Neon Wolf in the opening Neptune Investment Management Novices Hurdle, and for Nick Williams after the 33-1 chanceFlying Tigertook the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle under champion jockey Richard Johnson. And on Ladies Day, Jessica Harrington claimed her ninth Festival winner when Supasundae (16-1) took the Coral Cup. However, there was some sad news from the day's racing after Consul De Thaix suffered a fatal fall during the Novices Hurdle. His jockey Mark Walsh was treated for what was described as a ""concussive head injury"" and has been ruled out for the remainder of the Festival. After his wins in the Champion Hurdle (Buveur D'Air,) and the Queen Mother Champion Chase (Special Tiara), Unowhatimeanharry could give Noel Fehily a third big-race win in the Stayers' Hurdle, the feature race on day three. The nine-year-old is unbeaten in his last eight starts, including in the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle 12 months ago, and is likely to be sent on his way at very short odds - but he likes very testing ground and the drying conditions may not be to his liking Cole Harden won the race two years ago and is back again for the Warren Greatrex team. The Jessica Harrington-trained Jezki is one of six Irish declarations, with Willie Mullins responsible for Clondaw Warrior, Nichols Canyon and Shaneshill. Snow Falcon (Noel Meade) and Dedigout (Gordon Elliott) have also made the journey across the Irish Sea.

Should a rapist be given a platform?,"This video can not be played Thordis Elva and Tom Stranger spoke on the BBC's Newsnight An international project featuring a rapist discussing his crime on stage has drawn both condemnation and support. So should a perpetrator be given a platform to share his experience? ""There's a rapist in the building,"" the protesters shouted as they briefly blocked the entrance. ""Get the rapist out."" Their banners and loudspeakers were an unusual sight outside a venue better known for world-class concert performances than controversy. The anger at London's Royal Festival Hall at the Southbank Centre on Tuesday evening was over South of Forgiveness, an event that would see a woman inviting the man who raped her to discuss the impact of his actions. The discussion between Thordis Elva, from Iceland, and Australian Tom Stranger had already beendropped from a women's festivalat the weekend following pressure from campaigners. Watch the full BBC Newsnight interview here,external But it was rescheduled after organisers of the Women of the World (WOW) Festival said the debate was too important to silence. ""Rape is one of these critical issues and we need to shift the discourse around it, which too often focuses on rape survivors rather than rape perpetrators"", Jude Kelly, artistic director of the Southbank Centre, said in a statement. Diane Langford, one of the protesters waving placards on the banks of the River Thames, condemned the decision. ""I'm here because I feel a rapist is profiting from his rape,"" said the 75-year-old, herself a survivor of rape. ""I don't believe there can ever be impunity for a rapist."" Diane Langford, left, was at the protest with her daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter Thordis Elva was 16 when she was raped by her then 18-year-old boyfriend, Tom Stranger, after a Christmas party in her hometown in Iceland. After years of turmoil she decided to get in touch with him. And to her surprise, he replied with a confession and an offer of ""whatever I can do"". By then it was too late for her to press criminal charges. Instead, they wrote a book together about what happened. ATED talk they filmed last October,externalhas been watched by more the 2.7 million people and the pair have since taken part in a handful of stage appearances. Their London fixtureprompted a petition,externalby campaigners who warned it would be a ""trigger"" for sexual assault survivors - bringing back painful and dangerous memories - and could ""encourage the normalisation of sexual violence instead of focusing on accountability and root causes of this violence"". They said it risked ""suggesting that standing on a platform alongside one's rapist is a model approach to addressing sexual violence"". Thordis Elva made contact with Tom Stranger in 2005 The debate comes amid continued concern about the number of victims who report rape to police, both in the UK and around the world. The BBC has previously covered cases - forexample in ColombiaandMyanmar- where women have been attacked and even raped again for speaking out against sexual assault. Elva, who now lives in Sweden with her husband and son, insists she is not sharing a set of recommendations for others. Instead, she wants to shift the focus of responsibility for sexual violence to the perpetrator rather than the victim, and bring about what she calls the ""demonstrification"" of attackers. ""Demonisation of perpetrators in the mainstream media got in the way of my recovery,"" she said. ""The fact that Tom wasn't a monster, but a person who made an awful decision, made it harder for me to see his crime for what it was."" When it was Stranger's turn to speak at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday, his words appeared very carefully chosen and he still seemed to have some difficulty getting them out. ""I'm not up here as some form of punishment... or searching for some kind of questionable redemption,"" he said. ""I'm not trying to benefit my profile or my bank balance. It would be disrespectful for me to do so."" From rape to reconciliation: Thordis and Tom's story Organisers of the event said Stranger would not be paid for his appearance and he has vowed to donate any profits from the book to charity. He is being held up as the first and only confessed rapist to speak out publicly and internationally about his crime - without being identified by a court. So there is no guide on how to deal with these sensitivities. But the attempts to make Stranger's involvement more palatable have failed to pacify some activists and victims. ""Even if he's not getting paid, he will benefit from the cultural capital and the media buzz. He will continue to use his position of the vocal rapist to be protected,"" Liv Wynter, an artist, activist and survivor of rape, told the BBC. In acomment piece,externalpublished before Tuesday's event, Wynter argued that rapists should not be applauded for purely admitting their crime, and worried that such a discussion could encourage other perpetrators to contact their victims. No-one involved in the event encouraged this. But any possibility - however slight - that rapists might be somehow persuaded to contact their victims ""would undoubtedly be concerning"", says Katie Russell, a spokesperson for support group Rape Crisis. ""If there is any rapist reading about this who is considering doing so, we urge them not to; it's not your right or your decision,"" she says. Rape Crisis as well as The Survivors Trust stress that, while they support Thordis Elva's process of recovery, her approach will not be right for everyone. ""We welcome the debate with caution as each experience is unique,"" says Fay Maxted of The Survivors Trust. Campaigners, meanwhile, have questioned how far Tom Stranger will go now to challenge other men who have perpetrated - or could perpetrate - sexual violence. He told the audience in London he would be ""deeply invested in listening to other men"" and encouraged more men to take part the debate about sexual violence and responsibility around the world. ""I recognise I'm a problematic individual. But I think there's a hunger for this discussion and it is high time."" His involvement in the talk was broadly welcomed by those in the audience on Tuesday - perhaps unsurprisingly as they had devoted the time to listen. ""It was still her story"", said Karla Williams, 34. ""He didn't try to hijack anything or make it about himself."" ""If you never hear from men, then how is anything ever going to change?"" added her friend Simran Chawla, 41. A handful of the men in the audience also shared their reactions in follow-up discussions after Elva and Stranger's talk. ""I think what they are doing is extraordinary. I'm really pleased this is happening,"" one man said. ""Tom did something quite brave and courageous"" in speaking up, said another. But the small number currently engaging in the debate soon came in sharp focus.  It emerged that a separate men-only discussion after Elva and Strange's event only attracted two participants. ""It seems men here weren't ready to have the conversation with themselves,"" one of them said.

"Who's up, down and out at China's congress?","Party power is increasingly concentrated in President Xi Jinping China's National People's Congress (NPC) is largely a rubber stamp for policy but it is still closely watched for indications of who is on the rise or on the way out in Beijing. After attaining the title ""core"" last October, you might think President Xi had already reached the top. But no Chinese leader can sit easy on the throne, and having worked hard for a title, making everyone use it is a useful way to exact loyalty. So for the first time this year, NPC work reports and meetings were replete with references to President Xi as the ""leadership core of the Communist Party"". In fact, President Xi got more name checks than any Chinese leader since Chairman Mao. President Xi is up. As the former British colony awaits the much less-than-democratic election of a new leader at the end of the month, it got a very pointed thumbs down from Beijing. NPC Standing Committee Chairman Zhang Dejiang warned that Hong Kong's economy could be overtaken within two years by neighbouring Shenzhen, which as many Shenzhen residents themselves will proudly tell you, was little more than a fishing village only 30 years ago. Beijing's experimental trickle of clever animations, songs and promotional videos hasturned into something stronger. The NPC seems to be a practice round for the Communist Party congress in the autumn and has pioneered a WeChat animation which addresses users by name and almost gives the impression of genuinely answering questions. There's also a series called ""My life, my China"", with passionate young party professionals explaining how they avoided being brainwashed in the West. The NPC is held in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, amid tight security In the premier's work report to the NPC, there was no direct mention of the stiff capital controls in place to prevent a dramatic depreciation of the RMB, China's currency. But there was plenty of muttering on the sidelines of the CPPCC - that assembly of the networking great and good which adds the ""consultative"" to China's ""consultative democracy"". Zheng Yuewen, chairman of the pharmaceutical company Creat Group, was not alone when he complained: ""Foreign exchange management is so strict now that it's almost impossible to move funds out"". And with perfect theatrical timing, the $1bn (Â£824m) deal for Dalian Wanda to buy Hollywood's Dick Clark Productions came crashing down. That's Foreign Minister Wang Yi to you and me. This year's NPC has taken place against aswelling tide of outrage from Chinese patriots: smashing washing machines, chanting hostile slogans and refusing to get off a cruise ship on South Korean soil, all to protest against the deployment of a US anti-missile system in South Korea in the face of Chinese opposition. Normally so quick to stamp out the first sign of protest, Beijing has only encouraged the targeting of South Korean businesses and boycotts of South Korean goods and services. But swinging his figurative flashlight with typical poise, China's foreign minister came as peacemaker to the NPC. In proposing a ""double suspension"" - North Korean nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for South Korean and US military exercises - Wang Yi said opposing sides on the Korean peninsula were like accelerating trains bearing down on each other. ""Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision? The priority is to flash the red light and apply the brakes."" Branches of South Korean store Lotte have been closed in China in a move seen as retaliation over the missile system row Education Minister Chen Baosheng delivered the painful public admission that although President Xi had made ""important comments"" on political education for students at the end of last year, problems on the ground were proving an obstacle. ""When we go and investigate at colleges and universities, attention levels at thought and political theory classes are not high. People are there in body but not in spirit."" He said crude tools and unfashionable packaging must go, but made clear the political product was still a winner. ""Students must be led by the core values of Chinese socialism to ensure their healthy moral growth."" Expect to see more of those animations and interactive tools I mentioned earlier. There are plenty of names one could mention here. But I'll make do with one: Bo Xilai. Bo Xilai (centre) is long gone but the consequences of his ousting are still being felt The most charismatic Chinese politician of his generation was toppled from power at the end of an NPC session exactly five years ago and currently languishes in a jail north of Beijing, serving a life sentence for corruption and abuse of power after the murder of a British businessman and the sensational show trials which followed. Thedisgrace of the Chongqing party secretarymarked the last great highpoint in the Chinese political cycle, and the savage purge of ""corrupt tigers"" which ensued cleared China's stage for the strongman politics we see today. All of which takes us back to the beginning: President Xi is up. And as the president puts a smooth NPC behind him and moves on to prepare for the much more important party congress in the autumn, his remaining enemies must tremble at the prospect of his second term in power. For more on the intrigue that led to Bo Xilai's downfall, listen to the podcast from the BBC's China Editor Carrie Gracie:Murder at the Lucky Holiday Hotel.

Six decisive points that changed Syria's war,"The war has devastated large parts of the country, and countless lives The fighting in Syria is entering its seventh year, with no real end in sight. What began as calls for change on the streets swiftly became a multi-national battleground, which has left more than 300,000 people dead and millions displaced. Here are six decisive phases which have shaped the course of the conflict to date: Deraa was one of the first places to see anti-government protests in early 2011 There were almost 18 months between the outbreak of peaceful protests in February 2011 and the point - in July 2012 - that Syria wasdeclared by the Red Crossto be in a state of civil war. Over this period, the international narrative shifted from one that framed events within the context of the Arab Spring's search for accountability and reform to one of a protracted military conflict. The Syrian opposition that emerged in this period reflected, and continues to reflect, a broad movement and not a cohesive force. The government resorted to increasingly violent crackdowns, prompting the establishment of a growing number of armed opposition groups. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) began to form in the summer of 2011, while the key Islamist and jihadist groups such as Ahrar al-Sham and al-Nusra Front were formed in late 2011 and early 2012, respectively. While the West hesitated over which groups to support, a chaotic influx of funds ensued from regional powers and individual donors in the Gulf and the Syrian diaspora. The US failure to forcefully respond to chemical weapons attacks disappointed the opposition US President Barack Obama had declared in 2012 that the US would punishany use of chemical weaponsby the Syrian government. But when the government was reported to have launched a chemical attack in the Ghouta agricultural belt outside Damascus in August 2013, the US did not intervene and instead accepted an offer from Russia to get Syria to dispose of its chemical weapons. The Obama administration continued to insist that the deal with Moscow was a better outcome. But on the ground it served to embolden President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies, as it appeared to legitimise the use of non-chemical weapons. These events shattered any hopes the opposition and its regional backers had of direct US military intervention. They would also undermine potential US leverage in peace negotiations, as the government and its international backers henceforth operated with little fear of US sanction. Following President Obama's decision not to enforce his red line on chemical weapons, Western support for the ""moderate"" armed groups was eclipsed by the support of Islamist groups by regional powers Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Even prior to this, some FSA groups had begun adopting a more religious image in order to attract Gulf funding, while some fighters had defected to better-equipped Islamist rivals. Jihadist groups skilfully sought to exploit the weakness of other groups to increase their power and influence within the rebel movement, sometimes targeting FSA units. Paradoxically, by 2015 this made moderate groups increasingly reliant upon jihadist groups on the battlefield. The growth of radical groups was further facilitated by the government's battlefield alliances with Hezbollah and other Shia militias, which reinforced the sectarian narrative of Sunni jihadists. The advent of IS changed the dynamics of the war in Syria IS entered the Syrian conflict by setting up al-Nusra Front, before announcing a merger with the group in 2013 that was rejected by al-Qaeda. The Syrian government's focus on military efforts against the moderate opposition groups afforded IS room for manoeuvre. In June 2014, IS announced the formation of its so-called ""caliphate"", encompassing areas of Syria and Iraq. Defeating IS would soon become the priority in Iraq and Syria for Western powers, leading the West to subordinate the peace process in Syria to an ""IS first"" policy imperative. In September 2014, the start of air strikes on IS positions in Syria demonstrated that the West was willing to intervene directly to counter the jihadist group, but not to protect civilians in opposition-held areas from the government's barrel-bombs. This fuelled a deep sense of betrayal within the Syrian opposition and communicated the prioritisation of a military solution to one of the products of the conflict over the search for a peace settlement that would tackle its drivers. The Russian offensive managed to turn the tide in favour of Assad Following a string of rebel victories in early 2015 - most notably in Idlib - President Assad was forced to admit that manpower shortages had made ceding territory necessary. Russia calculated that the Syrian government required direct material support to guarantee its survival. In September 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of Russian forces to Syria. The intervention surprised the international community and immediately tipped the military balance in the government's favour. Moscow declared its intervention to be aimed at listed terror groups such as IS and al-Nusra Front, but it overwhelmingly targeted more moderate groups, including those receiving US support. Russia has subsequently become the main arbiter in international peace talks, effectively sidelining the UN and making the US a junior partner in the process. The Russian intervention has also upped the ante for any form of future Western intervention, as this would bring a real threat of direct combat with Russian forces. Eastern Aleppo was the rebels' last major urban stronghold until it fell to the government The recapture of rebel-held eastern Aleppo by the government and government-aligned forces in December 2016 was the most significant victory for President Assad in the conflict to date. The loss of Aleppo appears to illustrate that the rebels' hopes of overthrowing the Assad regime militarily are at an end. But the government also lacks the capacity to control the whole of the country, meaning that victory will prove a relative term in Syria. Internationally, events in Aleppo cemented Russia's role as the main external actor in the Syrian conflict. They also resulted in Turkey replacing the US as the key interlocutor with Russia in the last days of the Obama presidency. With the US and its Western allies having ceded the initiative, it now appears Western marginalisation in Syria could leave Russia and Iran to negotiate with Turkey an eventual settlement to the war.

Who lost out by stopping cheating?,"It's a conundrum. You might expect a less corrupt exam system to allow ability to shine through regardless of the economic status of the students. But research into an ostensibly successful anti-corruption campaign in Romania has revealed that one of the consequences is precisely the reverse of its aims: that poorer students actually performed worse in the cleaned-up exam. The research was carried out by a team of three economists including Dr Oana Borcan of the University of East Anglia, who herself had witnessed this corruption as a final-year high school student in Romania in 2006. The corruption became apparent as she prepared to sit the all-important Baccalaureate exam which determined whether or not students could progress to elite universities. The cheating, Dr Borcan said, was ""blatant"". Much of it happened ""in plain sight"". ""The morning before the exam, students would go around collecting some money, a little contribution to give to the invigilators... some would pay, some would not, it was voluntary. CCTV cameras were used to detect and discourage cheating in exams ""I remember seeing students who I knew had low marks in general get top scoresâ¦ this left a very strong and long-lasting impression."" So strong, in fact, that it played a part in the direction of Dr Borcan's subsequent career. The Bac cheating reached a peak in 2010, when hundreds of students submitted identical answer-sheets. This time, whistles were blown, and the ensuing media storm led to high-profile prosecutions. As a result, the government introduced tough anti-corruption measures for future exams. CCTV monitoring systems were to be installed in exam halls, and a range of severe punishments were given maximum publicity to deter would-be cheats. These ranged from fines and loss of jobs to prison sentences; students caught cheating would be banned from re-sitting the exam as a minimum sanction. ""There were many prosecutions,"" Dr Borcan said. ""Based on reports by the Anti-Corruption Directorate, between 2010 and 2013, 280 teachers and students were prosecuted, 99 of whom received a prison sentence of between six months and five years."" More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. All the signs were that the anti-corruption campaign was working. By 2012, the average pass rate had almost halved compared with 2009, from over 80% to 43%. The previously soaring average scores had plummeted and stabilised. The overall findings were widely welcomed. However, Dr Borcan and her co-authors Mikael Lindahl and Andreea Mitrut of the University of Gothenburg, wanted to find out exactly how effective the different aspects of the campaign had been. They used rigorous statistical analyses of data from each of Romania's 42 counties. Other potential factors affecting the scores were eliminated by using control groups, and by comparing results in different areas where, for example, CCTV was introduced in different years. Overall, they found that the cameras were responsible for up to 50% of the overall drop in pass rates. But it was the combination of this monitoring with the real threat of punishment, plus heavy media coverage, that made the campaign so effective. Romania had taken radical steps to tackle concerns about corruption in education They also compared the findings with those from a similar anti-corruption drive in Moldova, which had comparable problems of cheating, as well as in Cambodia and India. The bombshell in this research, however, was revealed when they analysed the impact in terms of students' socio-economic background. The pass rates of poorer students - those in receipt of financial assistance payments - fell by 14.3%, compared to 8.1% for better-off students. Their overall marks also decreased disproportionately. As a result, the researchers conclude that ""the anti-corruption campaign resulted in increased inequality between poor and non-poor students"" - and that it ""significantly reduced their chances of entering higher education"". The researchers admit they were surprised by the finding and looked hard to isolate possible reasons. The most likely culprit, it emerged, was that the ""collective"" and ""petty"" forms of corruption, as witnessed by Dr Borcan herself, had a curious effect: they might be paid for chiefly by well-off students bribing invigilators, but everyone benefited. It gave the poorer students ""a free ride"" to higher marks. The research raises questions about how exams are used as the entry point for universities It also meant that when cheating was removed, the academic advantages of wealthier students became even more apparent. Cheating it seemed had provided a kind of levelling effect. ""There's a silver lining to all this,"" she said. ""When corruption was widespread, we couldn't know the true scale of inequalityâ¦ Our findings have revealed just how much greater the equality gap is."" ""Once we know the true gap in attainment, the government can tackle the source of the inequality."" The authors also see wider implications for their findings, for example, about the wisdom of such heavy reliance on a ""high stakes"" exam for university entrance. Although she has not had any direct response from the Romanian government so far, she was hopeful that a new government, and a new education minister, would take notice and act. ""I am hopeful they'll have the right dialogue and we will be able to raise the questions that the authorities need to look at.""

The Free Syrian Army (FSA) began to form in the summer of 2011, while the key Islamist and jihadist groups such as Ahrar al-Sham and al-Nusra Front were formed in late 2011 and early 2012, respectively. While the West hesitated over which groups to support, a chaotic influx of funds ensued from regional powers and individual donors in the Gulf and the Syrian diaspora. The US failure to forcefully respond to chemical weapons attacks disappointed the opposition US President Barack Obama had declared in 2012 that the US would punishany use of chemical weaponsby the Syrian government. But when the government was reported to have launched a chemical attack in the Ghouta agricultural belt outside Damascus in August 2013, the US did not intervene and instead accepted an offer from Russia to get Syria to dispose of its chemical weapons. The Obama administration continued to insist that the deal with Moscow was a better outcome. But on the ground it served to embolden President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies, as it appeared to legitimise the use of non-chemical weapons. These events shattered any hopes the opposition and its regional backers had of direct US military intervention. They would also undermine potential US leverage in peace negotiations, as the government and its international backers henceforth operated with little fear of US sanction. Following President Obama's decision not to enforce his red line on chemical weapons, Western support for the ""moderate"" armed groups was eclipsed by the support of Islamist groups by regional powers Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Even prior to this, some FSA groups had begun adopting a more religious image in order to attract Gulf funding, while some fighters had defected to better-equipped Islamist rivals. Jihadist groups skilfully sought to exploit the weakness of other groups to increase their power and influence within the rebel movement, sometimes targeting FSA units. Paradoxically, by 2015 this made moderate groups increasingly reliant upon jihadist groups on the battlefield. The growth of radical groups was further facilitated by the government's battlefield alliances with Hezbollah and other Shia militias, which reinforced the sectarian narrative of Sunni jihadists. The advent of IS changed the dynamics of the war in Syria IS entered the Syrian conflict by setting up al-Nusra Front, before announcing a merger with the group in 2013 that was rejected by al-Qaeda. The Syrian government's focus on military efforts against the moderate opposition groups afforded IS room for manoeuvre. In June 2014, IS announced the formation of its so-called ""caliphate"", encompassing areas of Syria and Iraq. Defeating IS would soon become the priority in Iraq and Syria for Western powers, leading the West to subordinate the peace process in Syria to an ""IS first"" policy imperative. In September 2014, the start of air strikes on IS positions in Syria demonstrated that the West was willing to intervene directly to counter the jihadist group, but not to protect civilians in opposition-held areas from the government's barrel-bombs. This fuelled a deep sense of betrayal within the Syrian opposition and communicated the prioritisation of a military solution to one of the products of the conflict over the search for a peace settlement that would tackle its drivers. The Russian offensive managed to turn the tide in favour of Assad Following a string of rebel victories in early 2015 - most notably in Idlib - President Assad was forced to admit that manpower shortages had made ceding territory necessary. Russia calculated that the Syrian government required direct material support to guarantee its survival. In September 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of Russian forces to Syria. The intervention surprised the international community and immediately tipped the military balance in the government's favour. Moscow declared its intervention to be aimed at listed terror groups such as IS and al-Nusra Front, but it overwhelmingly targeted more moderate groups, including those receiving US support. Russia has subsequently become the main arbiter in international peace talks, effectively sidelining the UN and making the US a junior partner in the process. The Russian intervention has also upped the ante for any form of future Western intervention, as this would bring a real threat of direct combat with Russian forces. Eastern Aleppo was the rebels' last major urban stronghold until it fell to the government The recapture of rebel-held eastern Aleppo by the government and government-aligned forces in December 2016 was the most significant victory for President Assad in the conflict to date. The loss of Aleppo appears to illustrate that the rebels' hopes of overthrowing the Assad regime militarily are at an end. But the government also lacks the capacity to control the whole of the country, meaning that victory will prove a relative term in Syria. Internationally, events in Aleppo cemented Russia's role as the main external actor in the Syrian conflict. They also resulted in Turkey replacing the US as the key interlocutor with Russia in the last days of the Obama presidency. With the US and its Western allies having ceded the initiative, it now appears Western marginalisation in Syria could leave Russia and Iran to negotiate with Turkey an eventual settlement to the war.

Six points which changed Syria's war,"The war has devastated large parts of the country, and countless lives The fighting in Syria is entering its seventh year, with no real end in sight. What began as calls for change on the streets swiftly became a multi-national battleground, which has left more than 300,000 people dead and millions displaced. Here are six decisive phases which have shaped the course of the conflict to date: Deraa was one of the first places to see anti-government protests in early 2011 There were almost 18 months between the outbreak of peaceful protests in February 2011 and the point - in July 2012 - that Syria wasdeclared by the Red Crossto be in a state of civil war. Over this period, the international narrative shifted from one that framed events within the context of the Arab Spring's search for accountability and reform to one of a protracted military conflict. The Syrian opposition that emerged in this period reflected, and continues to reflect, a broad movement and not a cohesive force. The government resorted to increasingly violent crackdowns, prompting the establishment of a growing number of armed opposition groups.

What made these grannies go nude in public?,"This image of a nude protest by a group of Indian mothers and grandmothers stunned the world 13 years ago. Defying all stereotypes, the 12 women challenged the security forces and paved the way for real change on the ground in the north-eastern state of Manipur. Eleven of the mothers regrouped in the state capital, Imphal, recently to speak to the BBC about their unconventional protest. The 12th protester died five years ago. In a large bare hall, they sit on floor mats, many of them in their sunset years. Many are frail and have failing eye sight, one is accompanied by her daughter as she cannot walk unaided. As they start telling me about that day, it's hard to imagine these women carrying out that act of protest. Pioneering Indians is a series looking back at men and women who have helped shape modern India. Other stories from the series: The making of India's only man in space What made these grannies go nude in public? The rape that led to India's sexual harassment law Manipur has struggled for decades with an insurgency involving several militant groups, and the Indian military has for more than half a century had sweeping shoot-to-kill powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa). The mothers regrouped in Imphal to speak about their unconventional protest Manorama was gang-raped and killed in July 2004 The security forces were often accused of rights abuses, but it was thegang-rape and murder of a 32-year-old woman,externalin July 2004, allegedly by paramilitary soldiers, that set the state on the edge. Manorama was picked up from her home at midnight on 11 July by soldiers from the Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force deployed in Manipur to fight insurgents. A few hours later, her mutilated, bullet-riddled body was found by the roadside. It bore tell-tale signs of torture and rape. The Assam Rifles denied any role in her death, but the state witnessed unprecedented anger and at the centre of that was the ""mothers' protest"". The grannies in front of the Kangla Fort where they had staged their famous protest The women were all housewives, mostly from poor families, and many did small jobs to supplement their family incomes. The oldest was 73, the youngest 45. Between them, they had 46 children and 74 grandchildren. They were also activists (called Meira Paibis, or torch-bearers). They knew each other, but belonged to different organisations. Some of them visited Manorama's family and the morgue where her body was kept. ""It made me very angry. It was not just Manorama who was raped. We all felt raped,"" says Soibam Momon Leima. Lourembam Nganbi (left) arrived in Imphal a day earlier from her home in Vishnupur, 30km away The idea of a nude protest was first discussed on 12 July at a meeting of the All Manipur Women's Social Reformation and Development Samaj, but it was thought ""too sensitive and radical"", says Thokchom Ramani, who was 73 at the time. But at a meeting later in the day of different women's groups, Ms Thokchom mentioned it and believing that ""desperate times call for desperate measures"", it was agreed that a small group of women would attempt to strip in front of the iconic Kangla Fort, the Assam Rifles headquarters. On the morning of 15 July, the day of the protest, Laishram Gyaneshwari left her home at 5:30am. ""I didn't tell my husband or children that I was going to take part in this protest. I had no idea how it would go, I knew I was putting my life in danger and I knew I could die that day. So I touched my husband's feet, sought his blessings and left,"" she told me. Thokchom Ramani, at 73, was the oldest protester Haobam Tombi, 45, was the youngest protester Lourembam Nganbi arrived in the city a day earlier from her home in Vishnupur, 30km away. Because of a government-imposed curfew in many parts of the state, there were no buses so she hired a private taxi to reach Imphal and walked the last few miles to the home of Haobam Ibetombi, another of the protesters. ""There, we removed our inner garments and just covered our bodies in the traditional Manipuri sarongs so that we could strip easily,"" she says. Just after 9am, a van began ferrying them to Kangla Fort - it made three trips, carrying the protesters and volunteers, depositing them not at the fort but near enough to get there quickly. Manipuris accuse the Indian army of misusing the sweeping powers given to them under the special law The women were all housewives and mostly from poor families ""We were crying even before we left. We are women, all we have is our honour. And Manipur is a traditional society, we don't show our bodies. We are uncomfortable even showing our ankles,"" Mrs Laishram said. The authorities had somehow got wind of their protest and a large number of police, some of them women, were beginning to gather outside the fort. At 10am, the rag-tag bunch walked in twos and threes to the fort gate and before anyone could realise what was going on, the mothers stripped. They threw off all their clothes, beat their chests, rolled on the ground and wept. The women carried banners that read ""Indian army, rape us"" and ""Indian army, kill us"". Even though Manorama had been taken away by members of a paramilitary force, most Indians don't know the different branches of the security forces, and so army is used as a loose term to describe them all. Nine women were accused of arson and waging war against the country and were sent to jail Although there were no leaders, Mrs Lourembam shouted the loudest, chanting slogans in English ""because we wanted to shame them in a language they and the rest of the world understood"", she said. ""I was thinking their action must stop, they must be punished. Women should not be raped anywhere in the world. The women tried to storm the fort, but the soldiers locked the gates. ""Two sentries pointed their guns at us. We dared them to shoot us and they lowered their weapons. I think they were ashamed,"" says Mrs Laishram. Soon, a large crowd gathered and Mrs Thockchom says most people, including many police personnel, were crying. The protest continued for just 45 minutes, but those 45 minutes have had a lasting impact on the lives on the 12 women and the story of Manipur. Laishram Gyaneshwari did not tell her family that she was going to take part in the nude protest The mothers became celebrities who were feted at neighbourhood receptions. But they were also harassed by an embarrassed government which began a systematic destruction of their offices and organisations. Nine of the women were accused of arson and waging war against the country and were sent to jail for nearly three months. Their protest, however, did have the intended impact of putting the spotlight on the Manipur problem. ""The mothers' protest came too late for Manorama, but it played a crucial role in forcing the Assam Rifles to vacate the fort four months later, for the first time since they occupied it in 1949,"" says Babloo Loitongbam of Human Rights Alert. Manipur is one of India's most restive states India also promised to look at the demand to repeal Afspa and then prime ministerManmohan Singh promised,externala ""healing touch"" to the Manipuris. Thirteen years later, though, Afspa remains in large parts of the state and reports of rights abuses by security forces still come in, but campaigners feel the situation has improved. Along with the16-year fastby the state's most celebrated activist Irom Sharmila, the mothers' protest has entered the history books. The mothers, however, remain angry. ""We are still naked,"" Mrs Laishram tells me. ""We will believe the government has clothed us only on the day Afspa is removed from the whole state.""

TV spin-offs: The best and worst,"Jim Parsons plays Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory TV's most socially-awkward sitcom character, The Big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper, is getting his own spin-off series. The eccentric Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, has been at the centre of America's most popular comedy show since it started in 2007. Earlier this week, CBSconfirmedthat The Big Bang Theory's new spin-off, Young Sheldon, will be a prequel focusing on the character's early years. But will it work? Some spin-off shows have been hugely successful - but there have also been quite a few flops. Here's a round-up of some of the best and worst: Cheers and Frasier Frasier is one of television's most successful spin-offs. It lasted for 11 seasons and notched up 264 episodes - just behind its predecessor Cheers, which managed 270. The Kelsey Grammer sitcom continued the story of radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane. Digital Spy's TV editor Morgan Jeffery thinks the change in tone contributed to its success. ""Frasier had a different style and sense of humour to Cheers,"" he says. ""A spin-off needs to look and feel different. A lot of bad spin-offs are just watered down versions of the original."" The change certainly worked wonders for Frasier - the sitcom broke an Emmy Awards record, winning 37 over the course of its run (although the record was later beaten by the pesky Game of Thrones). Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul While Breaking Bad centred on characters played by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk) developed something of a cult following. Better Call Saul, which began in 2015, was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the brains behind Breaking Bad. The Times's TV critic Andrew Billen thinks focusing on a less prominent character can often make a spin-off more likely to succeed. ""Most shows are not Marvel Comic universes, they're built around one or two heroes,"" he says. ""But if you take a minor character, there's more chance of succeeding. Then you're into something much nearer to a Hollywood franchise."" Jeffery agrees: ""Angel is a good example of a character who maybe wasn't getting the screen time when he was on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, so he was given a show where there was more space to explore that character."" Happy Days and its seven spin-offs Happy Days certainly knows a thing or two about spin-offs - it had seven. Seven! The most successful were Mork & Mindy, which starred Robin Williams; and Laverne & Shirley, which was fronted by Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams. The latter, which first aired in 1976, focused on two single room-mates (who had been friends of Fonzie's in the main show) who work as bottlecappers in a Milwaukee brewery. It ran side-by-side with Happy Days, and by its third season had become the most popular TV show in the US. The show was cancelled in 1983, but it still managed an impressive eight seasons. Friends and Joey As one of the most successful sitcoms in television history, Friends was ripe for spin-off when it ended in 2004. Only Matt LeBlanc stuck with the character that made him famous, and Joey was launched that September. But it didn't go down well with fans, and viewing figures were low. It was cancelled after two seasons, with the final eight episodes not even making it to air. ""Matt LeBlanc was fantastic in [Friends] but he was playing a caricature,"" Billen says. ""I'm not sure there was enough complexity to Joey as a character, he was more of a clown, and it's difficult to build a show around that premise."" Jeffery adds: ""I don't feel there was a clear creative vision behind Joey, they just wanted to keep the Friends train going for a few more years."" The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its three spin-offs When it comes to spin-offs, Billen describes The Mary Tyler Moore Show as ""the mother of them all"". He explains: ""It was so successful, the best friend Rhoda, played by Valerie Harper, got a spin-off. And the neighbour and landlady Phyllis also span off, but the really significant one was Lou Grant. ""In the original show, Mary Tyler Moore's character worked in a TV station in the newsroom, and the news editor [Grant] then span off into a drama series. It ran many seasons, and was a post-Watergate view of investigative journalism."" Including the original, that totals an impressive four shows in the Tyler Moore universe. Only Fools and Horses and Green Green Grass Ask a British sitcom fan what their favourite shows of all time are, and it's likely Only Fools and Horses will figure highly on their list. It's slightly less likely they'd choose The Green Green Grass, the Fools spin-off that began in 2005 and focused on Boycie and his wife Marlene It managed 32 episodes but was cancelled in 2009 after continuing negative reviews from critics. The world of CSI CSI: Crime Scene Investigation began in September 2002 and was hugely popular with audiences. So popular, in fact, that it sparked CSI: Miami, CSI: NY and the more recent (and less successful) CSI: Cyber. Jeffery says the CSIs ""work on a business level because you're giving people more of what they enjoyed before"". CSI: Skegness surely only a matter of time. The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon? Iain Armitage will play a younger version of Jim Parsons's character Sheldon Cooper Jeffrey thinks it could be just the right time for The Big Bang Theory to get the spin-off treatment. ""I believe it's close to being renewed again but it doesn't feel like it's got too much life left in it,"" he says. ""It's probably got a couple more seasons before the cast try and shoehorn themselves out of the show."" The Guardian,external's Stuart Heritage put it slightly more bluntly, writing that the announcement of Young Sheldon means ""The Big Bang Theory has officially started its death spiral"". Big Bang may well be ripe for a spin-off, but its makers will have to tread carefully. ""There's absolutely no guarantee a spin-off will work better than any brand new comedy or a brand new programme,"" cautions Billen. ""It will give you ratings for the first couple of episodes, and after that it sinks or swims on its own merit.""
