'Wenger uncertainty affected Arsenal',"This video can not be played Playing in 'hostile environment' didn't help Arsenal Arsene Wenger says his ""professionalism or commitment"" cannot be questioned but that uncertainty over his future contributed to Arsenal failing to qualify for the Champions League. It is the first time Arsenal, who finished fifth, have failed to qualify for the competition for 20 years. Wenger, whose contract expires this summer,says his future will be decidedafter the FA Cup final on 27 May. ""I have said no to every club in the world,"" said the Frenchman, 67. Chelsea top of the class - Phil McNulty's Premier League end-of-season report Kane, Alli, Sanchez, Hazard - Garth Crooks' team of the season Wenger has been in charge of the Gunners since 1996, winning three Premier Leagues and six FA Cups, but has faced protests from Arsenal supporters this season calling for him to quit. ""I believe since January we have played in a very difficult environment for different reasons,"" he added. ""Some you know about and that's very difficult for a group of players to cope with that - and some other reasons we will talk about on another day. ""Psychologically the atmosphere was absolutely horrendous. It has been difficult, yes, and certainly my personal situation has contributed to that but you can never question my professionalism or commitment."" Banners bearing mixed messages greeted Arsene Wenger and the Arsenal players at the Emirates Arsenalbeat Everton 3-1 on Sunday,but a 3-0 home win for Liverpool against Middlesbrough saw the Gunners finish a point behind Jurgen Klopp's side in fifth. ""I'm a lot more resigned because it's been coming for a few years and everybody has to focus on the FA Cup,"" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright told BBC Radio 5 live. ""This is done, we are in the Europa League, there is nothing we can do about it."" Flippers, flappers and triple keepers: The Premier League's weirdest final day? REPORT: Arsenal 3-1 Everton Wenger, whose side face Premier League champions Chelsea in the FA Cup final, said it was ""very sad"" Arsenal will not be playing in Europe's top club competition next season. He added: ""We do our job and you are professional and part of the job is being professional when the environment is not positive."" Some Arsenal fans also voiced their frustration at majority owner Stan Kroenke. ""I think you respect everyone in life and I respect Stan Kroenke a lot,"" said Wenger. ""It is not his fault we didn't reach the Champions League, it is the technical department's responsibility for that. ""A club works when everybody does their job and we live in a society where everybody has an opinion and what moves society forward is when we work and not talk too much."" Sir Alex Ferguson (left) and Arsene Wenger have won 16 Premier League titles between them Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a sometimes bitter rivalry with Wenger during his Old Trafford reign, winning 13 Premier League titles with the Red Devils. Scot Ferguson was in charge for 26 years, while Frenchman Wenger is in his 21st year at the north London club. ""At the moment, of course, with the ridiculous situation of the pressure Arsene is under, I just wonder if they realise the job he's done,"" Ferguson told Sky Sports. ""The most amazing thing about him is this: he has come through a forest of criticism for months now, and has never bowed. He has seen it right through, he has shown a determination, a stubbornness. I think when you look at that, it's a quality, and I'm not sure they'll ever get another manager like that. ""It's quite easy to say 'Get rid of him', but who do you get? Who do you get in to keep that club the way they are for the next 20 years? ""I really feel sorry for him because I think he's shown outstanding qualities, and I think he has handled the whole situation. I don't know many that have done that."" Arsenal will be playing in the Europa League next season BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty at Emirates Stadium As Arsene Wenger sifted through the fall-out from Arsenal's failure to reach the Champions League for the first time in 20 years, he made a stark admission. Wenger, reflecting on the atmosphere around Emirates Stadium, said: ""The psychological environment was absolutely horrendous."" He insisted he was not using this as an excuse for Arsenal's failings but it was clear he felt the over-arching atmosphere had not helped his players as they tried to fight their way into the Premier League's top four. Wenger may have a point - but has he himself not made a major contribution to the mood around the club and has to take his share of responsibility as his own Arsenal future became almost a matter for daily debate? Even now, although most now assume he will extend his stay as Arsenal manager, he was simply saying his own personal situation would be ""sorted soon"". The lack of clarity has cast a cloud over Arsenal's season and provided an unwanted sub-plot when matters should have been solely focused on the pitch. The toxic mood was on show again as Arsenal's fate and the realisation that they would be in the Europa League next season became clearer, with chants against American owner Stan Kroenke, who has ignored a Â£1.3bn takeover bid from Alisher Usmanov, who has a 30% stake in the club. Wenger defended Kroenke but it was obvious he feels factors elsewhere have created this ""horrendous"" psychological environment that has swirled unhelpfully around Arsenal. The problem for Wenger is that he takes a big portion of the responsibility - and part of the price he and Arsenal will pay is that they will be out of Europe's elite group next season with their noses pushed against the window as they contemplate life without the Champions League.

Liverpool 3-0 Middlesbrough,"Georginio Wijnaldum's opener was his sixth goal of the season for Liverpool Liverpool secured their Champions League return as their initial nerves turned to jubilation and relegated Middlesbrough crumbled at Anfield. With top-four rivals Arsenal ahead at Everton, Liverpool were impotent in attack and twitchy at the back for most of the first half. But Georginio Wijnaldum eased the tension in injury time, bursting into the box and smashing in a fierce shot at the near post. Philippe Coutinho's low curling free-kick six minutes into the second half was quickly followed by Adam Lallana slotting in to give the Reds a comfortable cushion to ride out to full-time. With Manchester City thrashing Watford, Liverpool finished fourth in the final Premier League table and will have to negotiate Champions League qualifying at the start of next season. Jurgen Klopp took charge at Liverpool in October 2015 Manager Jurgen Klopp had a beaming smile on the final whistle as he congratulated his players, but his team's display - in front of a watching owner John W Henry - underlined the need for further investment as they prepare to step up to Europe's top table for the first time since 2014-15. That campaign ended in the group stages as Brendan Rodgers' side - with talisman Luis Suarez sold to Barcelona - were found wanting. If they play like they did in Sunday's first half, the same fate will be the best this version can hope for. As so often this season, Liverpool's attackers seemed stumped by deep-lying opposition and the soft centre of their defence was nearly exposed when Patrick Bamford got the wrong side of Dejan Lovren and had a strong claim for a penalty denied. But Wijnaldum's powerful opener changed the mood both in the stands and on the pitch. The interplay between Roberto Firmino, Coutinho and Lallana in the second half was close to the scintillating best that they have produced in this campaign. They surely need additions to recreate that form more consistently and on bigger stages next season, but Klopp's side collected an impressive 76 points and finished above Arsenal and Manchester United in his first full season in charge. ""I think it does qualify as a successful season. They set out to reach the Champions League and from a league point of view they've achieved that. They'll be bigger and better next season,"" Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said. This video can not be played Wonderful day for Liverpool - Klopp Sturridge finishes the season with eight goals for Liverpool Daniel Sturridge is the last remaining part of the attacking trio that drove Liverpool close to the Premier League title two seasons ago. But after an injury-blighted couple of campaigns and doubts over whether he can find a place in Klopp's high-tempo gameplan, it had been suggested he might follow Suarez and Raheem Sterling out of the club. Sturridge had five shots, coming close, but not hitting the target with any... ...however he had fewer touches (36) and ran a shorter overall distance (8.93km) than any other outfield starter for Liverpool Starting successive Premier League games for the first time since September, he added an extra dimension to Liverpool's play with clever movement, a constant penalty-box presence and ability to get a shot away. He came closer than any Liverpool player to scoring in the first 45 minutes with a shot just wide, applauded the fans as he headed off with eight to go and exchanged an embrace with Klopp on his way to the bench. ""There is nothing to discuss really,"" he told Sky Sports, when asked after the match if he would still be at Liverpool next season. ""I have two years left on my deal and I am happy here."" While Liverpool prepare for the Champions League, Middlesbrough have the different challenge of life in the Championship next season. Chairman Steve Gibson has been bullish about the possibility of an immediate return, saying earlier in the week that heaimed to ""smash the league"" and return as champions. A starting selection without likely summer departures Alvaro Negredo, Marten de Roon and Adama Traore suggested that caretaker Steve Agnew is already concentrating on the next campaign. Solidly run off the pitch,externalas well as resolute on it, Boro are well set to back up their chairman's promise, particularly if Gibson can convince his centre-back nephew Ben to stick with the club in the second tier. This video can not be played Stability key to Middlesbrough revival - Agnew Liverpool's go-to man for inspiration and invention had 132 touches and five shots, with three on target. No team-mate managed more in any of those statistics. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""We worked hard to get the first goal. We got more confident. We then scored from the free-kick and got even more confident. ""The boys then played some fantastic football. I'm really looking forward to next season. I think we have created a wonderful base. The better you're organised, the more you feel free to do special things in offence. ""I'm really happy about this - what a wonderful day."" Middlesbrough caretaker boss Steve Agnew:""Liverpool have some top-class players and you wait for moments like that Patrick Bamford penalty shout and that did not go our way. ""It has been a difficult season and the bottom line is that we have not scored enough goals or won enough games. We need to use this summer to reflect and work out what we need to do to come back. ""The chairman is the best in my opinion and I'm sure that talks will be progressing over the next few weeks about the future of the club."" Liverpool have finished in the top four of the Premier League for only the second time in the past eight seasons. Philippe Coutinho has had a hand in 20 Premier League goals for Liverpool this season, more than any other player (13 goals, seven assists). Coutinho has scored 15 Premier League goals from outside the area, more than any other player. Middlesbrough are one of three teams to visit Anfield on 10 or more occasions in the Premier League without winning (Sunderland - 16, Middlesbrough - 15 and Bolton - 13). All 17 of Georginio Wijnaldum's Premier League goals have been scored in home games (six at Anfield and 11 at St James' Park). Middlesbrough won just 28 points this season, their worst return in a Premier League season.

County Championship - Essex defeat Hampshire,"Essex beat Hampshire by an innings and 97 runs at Chelmsford Kumar Sangakkara hits second century against Middlesex at Lord's Shiv Chanderpaul makes hundred for Lancashire in the Roses match Jonathan Trott scores 175 for Warwickshire against Somerset Glamorgan survive to final day against Notts in Cardiff Paul Grunill and Ged Scott No doubt about the star performers on the latest day of County Championship action. Essex take the collective excellence award after wrapping up an innings victory over Hampshire at Chelmsford, with Jamie Porter taking seven wickets in the game to help put them top of Division One. Individual honours, though go to Kumar Sangakkara, whose second century at Lord's has kept Surrey in the contest against Middlesex, and to Jack Brooks and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the Roses game at Old Trafford. Brooks' maiden first-class century was one for the cricket romantics, those who like to see bowlers shine with the bat and vice versa, while 42-year-old Chanderpaul's was one for the pragmatists. Jonathan Trott's 175 for Warwickshire wasn't half bad either, while in Division Two, Glamorgan are doing their darnedest to deny Notts a fourth successive Championship win. For the next instalment in these and other stories, please join us tomorrow from 10:30 BST. Division One Essex 360 v Hampshire 115 & 148 (following on) Essex won by an innings and 97 runs Yorkshire 448-8 dec v Lancashire 264-6 Yorkshire lead by 184 runs Surrey 313 & 194-4 v Middlesex 411 Surrey lead by 96 runs Warwickshire 413 v Somerset 94-4 Warwickshire lead by 319 runs Division Two Derbyshire 275 v Worcestershire 323-3 Worcestershire lead by 48 runs Nottinghamshire 448 v Glamorgan 187 & 212-5 (following on) Glamorgan need another 49 to avoid an innings defeat Leicestershire 420 v Kent 193-5 Leicestershire lead by 227 runs Durham 287 v Sussex 43-1 - day one Leicestershire 420 v Kent 193-5 (39 overs) Back to the County Championship and all-rounder Darren Stevens hit an unbeaten 54 for Kent, including a six and nine fours, in the final session of an elongated day at Grace Road following rain earlier in the match. Dieter Klein bowled superbly for Leicestershire, taking 4-48, after they earned a full haul of batting points earlier in the day, thanks mainly to Clint McKay's 66 off 58 balls. Kent trail by 227 and will need to bat with care on the final morning to snuff out any possibility of them being asked to follow-on. Mumbai Indians are IPL champions again after beating Rising Pune Supergiant by one run in a nerve-jangling finish in Hyderabad. Set a target of 130, Pune needed 11 off the final over of the game, bowled by Australia's Mitchell Johnson. Three wickets fell, including the run out of Dan Christian off the final delivery attempting a third run that would have tied the scores. South Africa have beaten Northants by 13 runs at Wantage Road in their latest 50-over tour game ahead of the series against England and Champions Trophy. Hashim Amla top-scored with 59 as they made 275-7, and the highlight of the county side's reply was an innings of 54 off 43 balls by debutant Tom Sole, batting at number nine. He was the last to go, at the start of the 48th over, as Morne Morkel wrapped up South Africa's win. Surrey 313 & 194-4 (72 overs) v Middlesex 411 Another day, another peerless batting display by Surrey's Kumar Sangakkara, who passes 20,000 first-class runs shortly before stumps at Lord's. His unbeaten 116 gives his side a 96-run lead to take into the final day's play, but it is hard to see how they might pull off a victory against a team as strong as the reigning champions, without a rapid acceleration on the final morning. The new ball is only eight overs away, which offers a ray of hope for Middlesex. If they can remove Sangakkara early, as they did on the second day of the match, they would be hopeful of cleaning up the rest and then chasing down a target. Izzy WestburyBBC Sport Somerset
captain Tom Abellâs poor start to the season continued at Taunton. He could only manage
8 with the bat as Somerset struggled to 94-4 in reply to Warwickshireâs
total of 413. Jonathan Trott made the bulk of the Warwickshire
runs, amassing 175 in a knock which included three sixes. In reply, only veteran Marcus Trescothick offered much resistance from the home side,
surpassing 25,000 first class runs in his unbeaten knock of 41. A tense day
awaits Somerset tomorrow if they are to avoid making it three defeats from
three. Lancashire 264-6 (94.0 overs) v Yorkshire Lancashire still need a further 35 to make sure they avoid being asked to follow on in the Roses match against Yorkshire. It was a day dominated by Jack Brooks and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who both scored centuries. Brooks, on his first start of the summer, added the six singles he needed to reach his maiden first-class hundred, finishing unbeaten on 109 when Yorkshire declared on 448-8. Chanderpaul's century, by contrast, was his 75th in first-class cricket - a key knock after Brooks had followed up his ton by then uprooting England Test opener Haseeb Hameedâs off stump for
a third duck in four Championship innings. Derbyshire 275 v Worcestershire 323-3 Brett D'Oliveira gives a return catch to Jeevan Mendis as he attempts a slog sweep and that's the final act of the third day's play at Derby. The opener faced 232 balls and hit 15 fours and his innings, coupled with Daryl Mitchell's 120, has given them every chance of maximum batting points in what was a rain-hit match on the first two days. For Worcestershire to win, however, they will need to get a move on and extend their 48-run lead in the hope that a declaration will enable their bowlers to put some pressure on Derbyshire in the final stages of the game tomorrow. Durham 287 v Sussex 43-1 (11 overs) Durham are unable to achieve a second breakthrough after Graham Onions had Harry Finch caught at third slip for a duck with his first delivery. Chris Nash reaches stumps 22 not out, with partner Luke Wells unbeaten on 16, and Sussex will be satisfied with their work on the opening day after Jofra Archer took 5-76 as Durham's first innings only lasted to the 83rd over. They are 244 ahead, though, and Onions and Chris Rushworth will be fresh for a second burst with the new ball in the morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Somerset 94-4 (27 overs) v Warwickshire Somerset closed on 94-4 at Taunton, still trailing fellow Division One strugglers Warwickshire by 319 runs. The Bears would have to take 16 wickets on the final day to win - and that does seem quite so likely given that they still might have to get Marcus
Trescothick out twice. The former England opener was unbeaten at the close on 41, having gone past 25,000 first class runs as Somerset replied to
Warwickshireâs 413 all out. Nottinghamshire 448 v Glamorgan 187 & 212-5 (96 overs) If Glamorgan lose this game, there will still be positives for the Welsh county after succeeding in taking it into a final day at the Swalec, having been forced to follow on. In-form Colin Ingram batted for over five hours to reach 72 not out at stumps, with his side still needing another 49 to avoid an innings defeat. Luke Fletcher (2-52) has the best figures for Notts, but England's Stuart Broad is still waiting for his first wicket of the Glamorgan second innings, ending the day with 0-37 from 23 accurate overs. Surrey 313 & 171-4 (62.3 overs) v Middlesex 411 Two days ago a portrait of Kumar Sangakkara wasunveiled in the Pavilion,externalat Lord's. In it, the Sri Lankan has a serious expression on his face - but perhaps it ought to be smiling as, with an appropriate sense of occasion, he completes his second hundred of the match for Surrey with three runs off Ollie Rayner. Following his 114 in the first innings, this one has taken him 174 balls and has featured 12 fours. Superb batting by the left-hander - and isn't it surprising  that only one of his 38 Test centuries was made at the home of cricket, 147 against England in 2014. Six more runs will take him to 20,000 in first-class cricket. Legend. Somerset 86-4 (24.5 overs) v Warwickshire Grant Thornton adds a second scalp on his County Championship debut as he removes Somerset keeper Steven Davies. Two wickets in 16 balls for the young Coventry-born pace bowler, in his first game for the Bears since being plucked from the Birmingham League earlier this season. Lancashire 247-6 (89.3 overs) v Yorkshire Ben Coad proves a twist late in the day at Old Trafford as he bowls Shiv Chanderpaul, just after the West Indian had reached his ton. Did it perhaps keep a little low? Ryan McLaren, with whom he shared a 112-run stand, is still there but Lancashire supporters are slightly more concerned now as they chase the follow-on avoidance figure of 299. Surrey 313 & 171-4 (61.5 overs) v Middlesex 411 In the context of the match, that may be an important wicket for Middlesex. But Kumar Sangakkara is the main focus of attention at Lord,s with just one more run needed for his second century of the game. Surrey's lead is 73. Worcestershire 282-2 (67 overs) v Derbyshire Tom Fell gone, bowled by Jeevan Mendis. His innings took almost an hour, just when Worcestershire needed to press on a bit. Captain Joe Leach is next to the wicket, as the visitors, looking for a big first-innings lead,  home in on a third batting point. Somerset 78-3 (20.2 overs) v Warwickshire Grant Thornton's maiden first-class wicket - and not a bad one too, trapping Jimmy Hildreth leg before wicket. Somerset have not made the best start, in response to Warwickshire's 413. But Marcus Trescothick is still there on 40, having gone past 25,000 first-class runs in the process. A prodigious effort from the 41-year-old former England opener. Lancashire 237-5 (85 overs) v Yorkshire Shiv Chanderpaul completes the 75th first-class century of his career - a second Roses Match ton of the day, following Jack Brooks' earlier 109 not out for Yorkshire. This one has taken four and a half hours. It is the 42-year-old West Indian's fourth for Lancashire - and also his fourth against Yorkshire. Very well received by an Old Trafford crowd now visibly bolstered by the football having finished just up the road, following Manchester United's final home league game of the season. The partnership for the sixth wicket with Ryan McLaren (50) has reached 102. Nine overs left after this one. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nottinghamshire 448 v Glamorgan 187 & 194-5 (88 overs) Colin Ingram and David Lloyd survive seven overs against the new ball, but Luke Fletcher ends their partnership in the eight as the latter edges a ball which appears to lift more than he expected to second slip. Glamorgan need another 67 to bring the scores level as Chris Cooke joins Colin Ingram, who is 62 not out, at the crease with eight overs left in the day. Â© 2025 BBC.

The struggles of war babies fathered by black GIs,"About 100,000 black GIs were stationed in the UK during the war. Inevitably there were love affairs, but US laws usually prevented black servicemen from marrying. So what happened to the children they fathered? Fiona Clampin met two such children in Dorset, now in their seventies, who have not given up hope of tracing their fathers. A bottle of champagne has sat on a shelf in Carole Travers's wardrobe for the past 20 years.  Wedged between boxes and covered with clothes, it'll be opened only when Carole finds her father.  ""There's an outside chance he might still be alive,"" she reflects.  ""I've got so many bits of information, but to know the real truth would mean the world to me - to know that I did belong to somebody."" The possibility of Carole tracking down her father becomes more and more remote by the day.  Born towards the end of World War Two, Carole, now 72, was the result of a relationship between her white mother and a married African-American or mixed-race soldier stationed in Poole, in Dorset. Whereas some ""brown babies"" (as the children of black GIs were known in the press) were put up for adoption, Carole's mother, Eleanor Reid, decided to keep her child.  The only problem was, she  was already married, with a daughter, to a Scot with pale skin and red hair. ""I had black hair and dark skin,"" says Carole.  ""Something obviously wasn't right."" Carole Travers with a friend The difference between Carole and her half-siblings only dawned on the young girl at the age of six, when she overheard her parents having an argument.  ""Does she know?  Well, it's about time she did,"" said her stepfather, in Carole's retelling of the story.  She remembers how her mother sat her down at the kitchen table and told Carole the truth about her background. ""I was chuffed I was different,"" she says.  ""I used to tell my friends, 'My dad's an America,' without really knowing what that meant."" In 1950s Dorset there were very few mixed-race or black children, and having one out of wedlock carried a huge stigma.  Although Carole doesn't remember any specific racist remarks, she recalls the stares.  Parents would shush their children when she and her family got on the bus. Carole says her ""blackness"" was considered cute when she was a child, but as she grew up she became more aware of her difference.  ""I remember once being in a club and there was a comedian who started making jokes about black people. I'm stood there and I'm thinking: 'Everyone's looking at me,'"" she says. ""I always felt inferior.  As a teenager, I would stand back, I thought that nobody would ever want to know me because of my colour. ""I was going out with one boy, and his mother found out about me.  She put a stop to it because she remarked that if we had kids, they would be 'coloured'."" GIs at work in Weymouth harbour Seventy-two-year-old John Stockley, another child of an African-American GI stationed further down the Dorset coast in Weymouth, does remember the racial abuse in striking detail. John was called names to such an extent that at the age of seven he decided he would try to turn his skin pale to be like his classmates. ""I worked out that if I drank milk of magnesia [a laxative] and ate chalk I would make myself go white,"" he chuckles.  ""I think I drank over half the bottle! You can imagine the effect.  It wasn't good and it tasted disgusting."" This video can not be played John Stockley spoke to Woman's Hour about trying to fit in In one playground incident a boy insulted him with the N-word and called him ""dirty"", but when John thrashed him he found himself summoned to the school office. ""It was a winter's day in the early 1950s,"" John explains. ""I was playing football and I collided with another guy.  By this time I was quite fiery, I wouldn't take it, and a blow was struck.  I made his nose bleed.  To this day I can see the blood on the snow. ""My mother lived less than 100 yards from the school, and she was summoned to the office with me.  I remember her shaking next to me, holding my hand.  The secretary told her what had happened and he said to my mother: 'You have to remember, Mrs Stockley, these people cannot be educated.'  That puts my hackles up now."" Shocking though the racism seems to us today, it was arguably family life which had a more pernicious effect on these mixed-race children.  ""Your mum made a mistake,"" one of his aunts once told John Stockley. ""The 'mistake' is me,"" he says. John's description of his childhood spent living with his grandparents in a village behind Chesil Beach sounds idyllic.  But that's to ignore the reason why he went there in the first place. Determined to punish his wife for her double transgression, John's stepfather did not allow him to live in the family home except from Monday to Friday during school term. Even then, John was not permitted to enter the house by the front door.  At weekends he was packed off to his maternal grandparents, who provided him with the stable and loving family life he craved - and a refuge from his stepfather. ""Of course, coming back from the war and finding his wife with a black child must have been a great shock,"" John acknowledges. ""And they never had any children together. But there was no love at all for him from me, because of what he did to my mother. She was effectively kept in a position of restraint, and I'd see her go through depression because she wanted to do things she couldn't."" John says his stepfather - a gambler and philanderer - exercised control over his mother despite the fact that she ran a successful guesthouse. He decided who John's mother could or could not be friends with, John says. ""And he didn't like us to be too close.  If some music came on the radio when he wasn't there, I would dance with her because she loved to jitterbug.  But not when he was around.  We were told to stop."" Carole Travers's stepfather began divorce proceedings when he found out what his wife had done in his absence.  However, when it appeared that he wouldn't get custody of their daughter (Carole's half-sister), he returned to the family home and Carole took his surname. He appeared to accept Carole on the surface, but towards the end of his life he telephoned her and dropped a bombshell.  He wouldn't be leaving her anything in his will, he told her, ""because you're nothing to do with me"". ""The money didn't matter,"" says Carole.  ""But what he said really hurt me.  I told him, 'You're my dad, you've always been my dad, and you're the only dad I've ever known'."" Married and with children of her own by this time, Carole started trying to trace her biological father, based on the scraps of information her mother had given her in the weeks before she died.  ""It just didn't occur to me to ask questions when I was younger,"" she says, the tone of regret in her voice clear. ""My stepfather would always bring me up in any argument with my mother, referring to me as 'your bastard', and I learned not to rock the boat.  I just got on with my life."" Find out more Deborah Prior, front row, in the light dress, lived in Holnicote House in Somerset along with other mixed-race children - the photograph was used to attract potential adoptive parents Not all GI babies were able to stay with their mothers. Dr Deborah Prior was born in 1945, to a widow in Somerset and a black American serviceman. Her mother was persuaded to give her up, and for five years Deborah lived in Holnicote House, a special home for mixed-race children. Deborah spoke to Woman's Hour along with Prof Lucy Bland, who is researching this under-reported chapter of social history. Listen to Dr Deborah Prior's interviewon Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4 Listen to Carole Travers and John Stockley in full Like Carole, John Stockley wanted to protect his mother by keeping quiet. ""I could see it was going to upset her if I asked too many questions, and upset her was the last thing I was going to do,"" he says. He would take his chance occasionally, although his mother would always evade his enquiries. But John remembers with characteristic clarity the last time he brought up the subject of his real father. ""I remember her saying to me in the course of a minor argument between us: 'You don't know what I've been through because of you.' ""And I said to her: 'You don't know what I've been through because of you!' She went pale, and realised what she'd said and how she'd put her foot in it.  But we never went any further than that.  She just looked at me in a sad sort of way, and I said, 'Have I ever done anything to make you ashamed of me?' And she said no. And that was the last we ever spoke about it."" It was turning 70 that prompted John to start looking for information about his father, whereas Carole has spent almost half her life searching for a man she knows only as ""Burt"". Neither of them has many facts to go on - Carole believes her stepfather destroyed the only photos and letters that could have helped her identify Burt. But while their searches may come to nothing, they both take solace from the fact that their mothers loved them against all the odds, and that they were born of loving relationships, not one-night stands. ""My mother told me my father was the only man she ever really loved,"" says Carole.  ""And I've had Mum's friends say to me since her death: 'Don't ever feel ashamed of your background, because you were born out of love and your mum wanted you.'  She knew he was going back to America and she wanted something of him, something to hold on to."" Listen to Fiona Clampin's report on Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.

Why Swedish workplaces aren't as equal as you think,"Amanda Lundeteg wants to expose Sweden's lack of equality Sweden may have a global reputation as one of world's most gender equal societies but when it comes to female representation in business, campaigners question whether the Nordic nation is right to keep basking in the spotlight, as progress slows down back home. Amanda Lundeteg, already a chief executive aged just 32, is in one way a poster girl for gender equality in the Swedish workplace. She holds a degree in Business Economics, started her career in banking and has already served on three different boards. Yet the sole reason Allbright, the non-profit company she manages, exists is to expose the limitations in career opportunities for women in Sweden. Despite giving fathers the right to take paid time off since the 1970s and one of the world's most generous parental leave packages (currently 480 tax-funded days to share between a couple) and heavily subsidized day care -  capped at some 1,230 Swedish krona ($141; Â£108) a month - Ms Lundeteg argues Sweden is less progressive than many might think. ""We're really good at bragging about how good we are... but if you ask most women in Sweden I definitely don't think that they are satisfied."" On the plus side, more than 80% of mothers work and Sweden leads the industrialised world in terms of public sectorgender equality,external, according to theOECD,external; butAllbright's,externalresearch shows the private sector - and the rapidly growing startup scene - is struggling to keep up. In 2016, more than 80% of managers at listed Swedish companies were men and not a single new business on the stock market had a woman boss. Martin Hector: ""There's still a lot of fathers who don't take their parental leave"" The main reason for this imbalance is that traditional gender stereotypes prevail, despite decades of legislation designed to even things out, says Ms Lundeteg. ""It's possible to live a gender-equal life in Sweden, but we don't do it because of traditions. ""As a man you're supposed to be the one who works and brings home the meat to the cave. It's about stereotypes and privileges that will take time to break down."" Figures fromStatistics Sweden,externalconfirm that women still take more than 80% of a couple's parental leave while their first child is under the age of two. Women also remain much more likely to work part-time than men. When it comes to the wage gap, Sweden is close to theOECD average,externaland drops to 35th place on theWorld Economic Forum's,externalgender equality ranking. It isn't difficult to find Swedes who are willing to talk about the discrepancies. ""There's still a lot of fathers who don't take their parental leave so it's not perfect yet,"" says Martin Hector, 32, as he takes his baby son for a stroll in Ralambshovs park in central Stockholm. ""Over the summer, for three months or something like that, feels the most common."" He's planning to take a total of nine months off work. Camilla Dath, a lawyer who is also braving unusually chilly May temperatures of 2C with her seven-month-old, is taking 11 months' leave and says her husband will take a similar period off work. But other parents might not have the same opportunities, she argues, if one partner earns substantially more than the other or because they work in organisations with more old-fashioned  cultures. ""I have friends working in big law firms and they have a harder time to take parental leave,"" she says. Lawyer Camilla Dath and her husband may be sharing their parental leave - but many other Swedes are not When it comes to the number of women in management, the biggest discrepancies are still in  the traditionally ""male"" industries of manufacturing and technology. However, Allbright's research suggests that financial services and property companies have made ""significant"" improvements in recent years. Rental accommodation firm Heba, for example, recently climbed 100 places in Allbright's rankings after replacing several of its top male executives, resulting in a female majority in management. However its chief executive, Lennart Karlsson, is candid enough to admit that reaching gender equality was not his original goal. ""I thought competence was the main thing - competence and attitude - not sex, but I've changed my mind. The workplace works better because of the [gender] mix,"" he says. ""The discussion climate is better, you have a better conversation and a better understanding for each other."" Amanda Lundetag argues this should boost his business too, citing several recent studies including a high-profile report for thePeterson Institute for International Economics,external, which concluded that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in leadership roles and an organisation's performance. It's a link that is definitely not lost on the Swedish politicians spearheading what they've described as""the first feminist government in the world"",external. The Nordic nation's Left-Green coalition pushed through anew lawin 2015, aimed to encourage men to take a greater share of the parental leave. Ninety days are now reserved for fathers on a ""use it or lose"" it basis. ""What we want to see is an equal participation from the parents in the long run... but we also have to take it slowly so that families will be able to adapt to the changes,"" says Annika Strandhall, Sweden's Minister for Social Security. Simone French says the law is fine but the traditional culture drove her back to work early Next year will even see the launch of a new Gender Equality Authority, an admission, according to Ms Strandhall, that Sweden's world-famous feminist initiatives have not been as joined-up as they might have been. Yet while creating equal opportunities for men and women appears largely hard-wired into the national psyche, Sweden is split on the extent to which the state should intervene to pick up the pace. The government's attempt to introduce legislation that would fine listed companies which fail to appoint women to at least 40% of board seats was rejected by parliament in January. The fear of potential penalties seems to have acted as a catalyst, though; 33% of those put forward for board seats so far in 2017 are women, up 2% on last year, says Allbright, putting Sweden behind only Norway and France, both of which have legally-binding quotas. However, the nationalist Sweden Democrats (currently the second-most popular party in the polls) and the smaller centre-right Christian Democrats -voted against the 90-day parental leave quota for fathers. They want families to have a greater choice when it comes to organising parenting. ""There is a societal pressure...  because everyone goes back to work. I felt I would be going against the norm if I had stayed at home,"" explains Simone French, a 46-year-old who is originally from Australia. She says she would have welcomed the opportunity to stay at home until her son started school. Instead she ended up taking just a year off from her digital marketing career amid pressure from her employer and relatives. ""It was my maternal instinct to be with my son - every fibre in my being fought against going back. It's not really talked about here but I have actually met a couple of Swedish women who felt the same."" However those cheerleading Sweden's march towards a completely gender equal society argue that evening out parental responsibilities is as much about giving fathers the same chance to bond with their children while they are young, as it is giving women greater opportunities to climb the ladder back in the workplace. Sweden's laws on equality aren't lacking - banking analyst Andreas Lundvick is one of the rare fathers making the most of them ""You become closer with the children - a better connection,"" says Andreas Lundvick, 38, one of the other fathers back in Ralambshovs park. He's taking time out from his job at a major Swedish bank to look after his six-month-old son while his wife is studying full-time, a move he believes will have ""no impact"" on his future career. ""I feel lucky, when you speak to people from other countries, and you hear about their situation, it's mostly the mum being home with the children. It's a culture thing.""

Could you last a whole gig without using your phone?,"Good luck to the person who tries to take a phone from a Harry Styles fan Chris Rock fans will have their phones locked up during his forthcoming UK shows. Is this the start of no longer seeing a sea of screens at concerts? Gigs in the pre-smartphone age used to be far less complicated. You'd turn up. Maybe locate the bar and figure out where the bathrooms were. Flick through a programme or chat to your friends, and then just enjoy the show. But these days, such a scene sounds like ancient history. Now, you turn up. Check yourself in on Facebook. Catch up on emails while you're waiting for the show to start, and then when it does, upload some photos and videos you've taken to Instagram. But many concertgoers find the practice irritating, and now some performers are starting to object too. ""No mobile phones, cameras or recording devices will be allowed at Chris Rock's Total Blackout Tour,"" read a message posted on ticketing websites when the comedian'snew UK dateswent on sale this month. Chris Rock's upcoming shows will mark the biggest UK use of Yondr to date ""Upon arrival, all phones and smart watches will be secured in Yondr pouches that will be unlocked at the end of the show."" The term Yondr might make you Wondr what on earth they're talking about. Yondr is a relatively new American company which gives you a pouch as you're going into a gig for you to place your phone in. The pouch is then locked, and you keep it with you for the duration of the gig. At the end of the show, or if you need to use your phone during the performance, you can take the pouch outside of the phone-free zone to have it unlocked. ""We think smartphones have incredible utility, but not in every setting,"" Yondrsay,external. ""In some situations, they have become a distraction and a crutch - cutting people off from each other and their immediate surroundings."" The company says it aims to ""show people how powerful a moment can be when we aren't focused on documenting or broadcasting it"". Audience members keep the locked pouches with them throughout the evening Rock's use of Yondr at his upcoming UK dates marks the biggest use of the company's pouches in the UK to date. ""I think Chris Rock's audiences will probably be disgruntled but compliant,"" says Hattie Collins, features editor at ID. ""If you're talking about a Harry Styles gig on the other hand, you're going to have a whole world of problems - there's a much younger audience who are used to sharing everything they do."" Collins adds that the ubiquity of smartphones has arguably had a damaging effect on music fans who want to connect with an artist. ""It's created a passivity as a viewer, so you're much less engaged. You're focused on taking the picture, opening up social media, adding an emoji, and by that point you've missed half the song."" Asked about the Chris Rock shows, a spokesperson for the SSE Hydro in Glasgow told the BBC: ""Although it isn't standard practice, the artist has requested Yondr be used throughout his tour so we were happy to facilitate."" But are the audience happy with the restrictions, and the potential delays at security? Having their jokes posted online can be damaging for comedians Here's what a few ticket buyers told us: ""As I'm not hooked on my phone it's not an issue for me to leave it at home. Society is far too obsessed with smartphones and recording every detail of life anyway. Kudos to Chris for making a stand."" - Matt ""I am a doctor and I imagine there are a lot of professions that need access to their phone, as well as if your family or babysitter need to contact you in an emergency. Having your phone during a performance is peace of mind."" - Grace ""Those putting the gigs on have worked hard on putting on a show for you, which you've paid for, so protecting that is just as much for you as it is for the performer."" - Qas Some of the fans said they were sympathetic to how problematic it can be for comedians (as opposed to musicians) to have their performances posted online. If a comedian's jokes are leaked, it can spoil it for other audiences who were planning to see the same show later in the tour. It's arguably less of an issue for musicians, as audiences are already familiar with the material they're performing and reaction will be broadly the same regardless of whether live footage from another show had already been posted online. Alicia Keys and Dave Chappelle have previously enlisted the help of Yondr Collins says: ""I'm very torn, because on one hand I feel like it's something of an infringement of your civil liberties, but I appreciate that sounds far-fetched because they're not taking their phone off you, you keep it on you all the time."" All eyes will be on Rock's shows in January to see how the crowds react in person. His tour will be the biggest UK test yet for Yondr and audiences, who have been asked to turn up anhour early,externalto allow for extra time to go through metal detectors. But Rock isn't the first to use Yondr in the UK - Alicia Keys and Dave Chappelle both utilised it at their London dates last year. Could a sea of screens at gigs be a thing of the past? Collins thinks the future of phone restrictions at gigs in the UK is hard to predict, as it largely depends on what kind of concert it is. ""I went to see Bob Dylan this month, and they asked that nobody take videos or photos, and there were two or three people wandering up and down the side of the auditorium to make sure nobody did,"" she explains. ""It was quite a refreshing experience, and so much more compelling to watch. Almost quite strange that it was just the stage and not the shadows of 400 mobile phones."" ""But then when I saw TLC two nights later everyone messaged me saying 'ahh these pictures are great', they really enjoyed seeing the photos from a gig they didn't go to themselves."" She adds: ""I think it's a shame because part of me agrees it would be nice to have fewer phones, but on the other hand it's really nice to be able to share.""

Nick Robinson: The dilemma of Remain voters,"This video can not be played Seven Remain voters discuss the choice they face in the UK general election on Radio 4's Today programme In three weeks' time we will discover whether that referendum vote has dissolved the glue that bound voters to the party they have supported in the past. That is what I have set out to examine in my Election Takeaways - a chat over a bite to eat with different groups of voters to discover what is on their minds and how they are going about deciding who, if anyone, to vote for. This week, I shared a Thai takeaway with seven people who voted Remain in the EU referendum in the Tory marginal of Bedford. Like the Leavers I spoke to last week in Halifax, they were chosen for us by the pollsters Ipsos Mori. When Theresa May strode out of the door of Number 10 to call this election she claimed it was all about Brexit and not, as many believed, about her desire for her own mandate and a bigger Commons majority. The discussion among our Remain voters revealed divided opinions about what should happen next My conversation revealed a fascinating split in the attitudes of Remainers. All seven still believed we should have stayed in the EU and shared their unhappy memories of the moment they realised that Brexit would win, but they are deeply divided in their views about what should happen now. Four of our seven Remainers told me that they thought the debate about our membership of the EU is now over and it is time to ""just get on with it"". Fiorella has lived in Britain all her life but until recently had an Italian passport. ""The reason why Theresa May called a snap election is because she is asking us to choose who we believe is the best person to stand for us all and select the best deal for us,"" she says. And Abhijit agreed.  He moved to Bedford from Italy seven years ago and works for a local engineering firm. ""The election is an opportunity to vote for somebody you think will get the best deal after Brexit,"" he says. Builder James also supported this view: ""This is the situation we're in and it's important now to look forward and come together and get the best deal we can,"" he says. Leela, who works with a local housing association, worries that a second vote might cause more division within society: ""I think the majority of us who voted remain have accepted it and we just want to get on with it now."" Some of the Remain voters believe they should have a say on the final outcome of negotiations The other three felt just as strongly that the public should have another say once the terms of any Brexit deal are known. They do not want to give Theresa May - or indeed, any prime minister - a blank cheque to negotiate with the EU. ""Why can't we vote on the settlement? It seems to be a lot of, 'I'm the leader to do this but you won't be able to vote on what I do,'"" says Alastair, who fixes bikes. ""It's a bit like finding a fire going in your house and saying, 'Well it's going now'. I'd like to think it could change. I'm an optimist,"" says Maria who's in the music business. Jen, a secretary in an estate agents, also remains sceptical. ""We're voting in the general election but we're still going to be voting on something that we've not seen or had an opportunity to have a say on."" TheFinancial Times,externalhas dubbed this a split between Hard Remainers and Re-Leavers - those who voted Remain but now accept we are leaving. Working with the pollsters YouGov they have shown how the 48% who voted to stay in the EU are now split down the middle about what to do next. This split means that parties like the Liberal Democrats, which have promised a second EU referendum, have a far smaller pool of voters to fish in than many suggest - just 22% of Hard Remainers to be precise. They have another problem too if my group in Bedford is representative. Those who wanted a second referendum had no idea that that was Lib Dem policy, and not one of them could name the Lib Dem leader - ""I don't know who he is,"" says Leela.  And yet three of my group had voted for the party in an election for the local mayor. Jen voted for Dave Hodgson. ""Obviously he's Liberal Democrat. I voted not necessarily because of the party he's with but because of the candidate."" No wonder the polls suggest that we are seeing a squeeze on the smaller parties and a return to two-party politics - at least in England. Election campaign latest Bedford constituency details Now you might think that you cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from such a small group of voters. Of course, you would be right to think that they cannot predict the result in any constituency let alone in the country as a whole. What they can do is add flesh to the bones of opinion polls. My takeaway from this week's Election Takeaway is that if - and with three weeks to go it is still a mighty big if - Theresa May can attract the support of both those who voted Leave, whether they previously voted UKIP or Labour rather than Conservative, as well as those who voted Remain but now want the country to get on with leaving, she will have built an unstoppable coalition. There is one thing that I heard that might limit the size of that coalition however, and that is whether Labour can successfully change what this election is seen to be about. All the voters I spoke to in Bedford expressed their deep concern about the pressure on, or future cuts to, the NHS - an issue that has yet to really take off in this campaign.  If Jeremy Corbyn is to have any chance of stopping a Tory landslide let alone winning outright he needs to persuade the sort of voters I have been speaking to that traditional domestic concerns matter as much, if not more, than Brexit. Next week, I'll be in another town talking to those Theresa May has dubbed the ""Just About Managing"" getting their views on which policies, party and politician might do most to help them.

Comedy's golden opportunity under Trump,"This video can not be played Hasan Minhaj: 'There's something amazing in the chai' Comedians have a new-found energy in the era of Donald Trump, says a rising US comedy star. Hasan Minhaj hosted the the White House Correspondents' Dinner in April - an event President Trump snubbed. Speaking to the BBC, Minhaj said there was ""something cool"" happening in response to Mr Trump's policies. He said the political atmosphere was such that it gave him an unexpected opportunity to host the correspondents' dinner. Speakingduring a Facebook Live Q&A,externalwith the BBC, Minhaj said he would ""probably not"" have been given such an opportunity had Hillary Clinton won last November's election. ""I think the narrative of the country would have been different,"" he said. ""I think the collective feeling around who the White House Correspondents' Association should choose to represent, and be the comedian that night - that narrative would have been different."" Mr Trump became the first commander-in-chief to skip the dinner since 1981, when then-President Ronald Reagan was recovering from a gunshot wound. This video can not be played Correspondents' Dinner joke targets Trump During his election campaign, Mr Trump said he would establish a register of Muslims and since then, he has attempted but failed to introduce bans on people from seven Muslim-majority nations travelling to the US. Those moves were met with protests, but Minhaj - a Muslim-American - said the policies had sparked a response among Asian-American and Muslim comedians, adding that ""there's something amazing in the chai right now"". Six takes from the White House Correspondents' dinner How much has Trump achieved so far? ""What I think is really cool is there's different shades of the narrative,"" said Minhaj, who appears on The Daily Show on Comedy Central. ""People are bringing their own personal perspectives, and everyone's being unapologetically themselves."" Hasan Minhaj said he would ""probably not"" have hosted the dinner under Hillary Clinton Minhaj is not the only comedian to have benefited from a Donald Trump presidency - the TV show Saturday Night Live, which has regularly skewered the president and his cabinet, has reported its highest ratings in about 20 years. Wajahat Ali, an author and New York Times contributor who was also a guest of the Facebook session, said he wanted to thank Mr Trump for helping give comedians a voice. The policies of the White House had, he said, ""awakened slumbering giants, queens and kings, princes and princesses, who had stayed dormant"". He added: ""Sometimes it takes a crisis to wake up.""

Wanted: Top doctor to care for 7 billion people,"The WHO confirmed that Zika virus caused microcephaly or small brains in babies There's another big election coming up which will have an impact on hundreds of millions of people all around world - but you probably haven't heard anything about it. Health ministers and officials from 194 countries are due to vote for a new director general of the World Health Organization in Geneva on Tuesday. The UN agency, founded in 1948, describes itself as the ""global guardian of public health"", but it lost a great deal of credibility and trust over its handling of the Ebola crisis in 2014. The new boss could make or break the WHO, which is still trying to prove it is fit for purpose after admitting it was slow to respond to what became the worst Ebola outbreak in history. However, dealing with epidemics is just part of what WHO does. Its stated goal is to ensure ""the highest attainable level of health for all people"". In practice, that means everything from trying to wipe out deadly diseases for good, to trying to deal with the growing number of obesity and diabetes epidemics, to reducing deaths on the roads and saving the lives of mothers and babies during childbirth. Led a mass vaccination campaign which eradicated smallpox in 1979 In 1995 it launched a tuberculosis (TB) control strategy which saved more than 35 million lives By 2006, the number of children dying before their fifth birthday dropped below 10 million for the first time In 2008, it strengthened its focus on diseases such as heart disease and cancer It declared Ebola an international public health emergency in 2014 It confirmed that Zika causes brain damage in babies born to infected mothers in 2016 Heading an organisation responsible for the health of all 7.3 billion people on earth is no small task. ""The word 'health' itself is a burden that it carries,"" said Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. ""Improving health worldwide can mean so many things, from mental health to malaria to unintentional injuriesâ¦ to cancer. ""It's very hard for one agency, with a very limited and very constrained budget - of around $2bn every year - to achieve all those things. "" Prof Sridhar, who has recently written a book looking at WHO funding, said the US's health protection agency, the CDC, has a budget more than three times that of the WHO. She also said most of it comes from donors who earmark their funding for specific projects. Only around 20% of the WHO budget comes from compulsory contributions from member states, she said. Whoever gets the top job will have to be the consummate politician. They will have to get country leaders on board with big - often expensive - global health objectives, while also being above politics and not beholden to the special interests of any particular country. ""There have been two types of leader at the WHO in the past,"" said Prof David Heymann, a former assistant director at the WHO. ""Some have tried to build consensus between 194 member countries, then try to implement what those countries have said. Others have been leaders who have been out in front with a vision, and tried to pull 194 countries along with that vision."" There are three candidates left in the running for the $241,000-a-year job. The vote will take place at the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva. Whoever is elected will serve a minimum five-year term. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former health and foreign minister in the Ethiopian government ""I was born into a poor family. When I was seven, I lost my younger brother, probably to measles. I survived by chance, but it could have been me. ""For me, this position is about standing up for the rights of the poor. ""If I became director general, I would be very vocal on the issue of universal healthcare. ""We complain about emergencies or epidemics, worried it may come to our country. But if we ensure universal health coverage, we can resolve all of those issues. ""Inequity is a central challenge. The world has all the resources to save every life, as long as we believe every life is important. ""Those who have, do not care for the have-nots, and unless we confront that reality honestly, I don't think we will make progress."" Dr Sania Nishtar, cardiologist who set up Heartfelt, which works to improve health systems in Pakistan ""I was born and brought up in Peshawar on the Afghan border in Pakistan. I was raised in a progressive family. My father encouraged us to swim in the summer and play golf. I was a local golf champion by the time I was 16. ""When I was 15, my father passed away silently in his sleep - I think that was a turning point in my life. ""I trained as a cardiologist and I became very disillusioned with the disparity of care between the rich and the poor. ""My vision for this role centres on regaining the WHO's primacy, and ensuring that it has the world's trust as its lead health agency. ""Since the Ebola outbreak, the WHO has come under heavy criticism for its inability to... exercise stewardship during health emergencies. ""I want to make the organisation more accountable and transparent. ""I want it to focus on its core roles, rather than doing everything under the sun, in a half-baked way. I would lead the WHO very differently."" Dr David Nabarro, born in the UK, is UN special adviser on the Sustainable Development goals and is former UN Envoy for Ebola ""My parents are both doctors, and probably because of their influence, I started working outside the UK. ""It was when I was working in Nepal in 1989, that I found how malnutrition and disease were most likely to come from households that faced particularly difficult circumstances in terms of income, the status of women and their access to sanitation and water. ""It seemed to me blindingly obvious that I had to work on the underlying determinants of health. ""My first priority if I become director general of the WHO, is to focus on universal health coverage - everybody being able to access healthcare when and where they need it. ""My second priority is to make sure people can be defended against outbreaks of disease. ""Thirdly, we are seeing increasing levels of diabetes, heart disease and mental ill-health. These kinds of non-communicable conditions could be prevented by better work across governments and society.""

Iran's Rouhani wins big but will he deliver?,"Mr Rouhani has promised to push through reforms but hardliners may obstruct his plans From the outset when the counting of the votes started after midnight in Iran, the early results indicated that President Hassan Rouhani was heading for a landslide. Even in small rural towns many people preferred the vision that he had put forward, a vision in sharp contrast to the inward looking, traditional and hardline Islamic government promised by his main challenger, Ebrahim Raissi. President Rouhani won 23.5 million votes, or 57%. Turnout was unprecedented - nearly 41 million people voted, or 73.5% of the eligible voters. In Tehran, more than five million people came out to vote, twice the number of 2013. One reason for this high turnout was the reports that the hardliners had pulled out all the stops and mobilised their resources to bring out as many of their supporters as possible to vote, a major push to oust President Rouhani. These reports spurred his supporters and all those who favoured moderation or opposed the hardliners to come out in big numbers. Rouhani: A reformist and moderate Iranians urge Rouhani not to disappoint In pictures: Iran's women vote President Rouhani's victory means a major defeat for the hardliners. The vote may indicate that they will never be able to take control of the executive branch through the ballot box, as a big majority of Iranians do not favour them or their vision. In his first televised message after the victory,President Rouhani praised Iranianswho, in his words, had said No to returning to the past. He was echoing his election campaign motto ""We will not go back,"" a reference to his hard-line opponents and their ""backward"" policies. Supporters of President Rouhani celebrated in downtown Tehran Friday's vote in Iran was the revenge of the moderates. A rejection of those who had intimidated them, jailed them, executed them, drove them to exile, pushed them out of their jobs. In his campaign, President Rouhani promised to put an end to extremism, to open up the political atmosphere, to extend individual and political rights, to free political prisoners, to remove discrimination against women and bring under control all those state institutions that are not accountable. To keep and act on these promises, he told his supporters he needed a big mandate, bigger than before. He firmly placed himself in the camp of the reformists. Now, with his re-election, Iran is on the path towards change, with a renewed confidence drawn from the emphatic result. To his supporters on Saturday, he said he would remain committed to his promises. It is a tall order. The hardliners are not done yet. They will fight tooth and tail at every turn over the next four years to stop or frustrate President Rouhani's efforts to push through his reforms. Iran's hardliner Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has congratulated the Iranians for their big show in the exercise for democracy. But he did not congratulate President Rouhani. There are many Rouhani supporters who are willing to argue that the supreme leader had interfered in the elections by constantly criticising the president in the run-up to the elections. Turnout in the election was surprisingly high Mr Rouhani has promised to build bridges with the outside world. His election is a huge endorsement for a nuclear deal that his government reached with world powers, which led to the lifting of the crippling sanctions against Iran and saved the country from the threat of a war. But the deal has serious opponents in the US, where President Donald Trump and the Congress are reviewing their options. Iranians want the nuclear deal to survive, and the signs are that President Rouhani and Iran will keep to their side of the bargain. In big and small cities around the country, millions of Iranians are celebrating the results. There are videos of people dancing in the streets on social media. It is a big day in Iran's torturous political development.

A 146-year-old circus ends. What happens to performers?," The air inside of a 25 foot cannon is hot and smells like metal. It’s dark and loud, and the moments before a launch - even for an experienced human cannonball like 32-year-old “Nitro” Nicole Sanders - are filled with real fear. “There’s no feeling comfortable with it,” she says. The cannonball act is deceptively simple: a cannon large enough to fit a human inside its bore “shoots” an acrobat high into the air, and she lands in a net or an airbag. The mechanics of the cannon are a closely guarded secret, but it works with a combination of hydraulics and air pressure - there’s no gunpowder. The only explosion comes from some fireworks lit for show. The flight of the human cannonball at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is over in just under three seconds, but the preparation takes days. It's up to the human cannonball to control her flight, to use her muscles in order to fly properly, to tumble safely, and land without injuring herself. Any mistake - if the cannon isn’t warmed up enough or Sanders’ footing is off - can cause a bad flight and an even worse landing. A 14-year-old girl named Zazel was the first to be shot out of a cannon, in 1877 London. In the 140 years since, the act’s safety has been vastly improved but never perfected. One circus historian estimated that 30 human cannonballs have died in performance accidents. The most recent death occurred in 2011. Like Zazel, Sanders is an acrobat and an aerialist by training. She is terrifically fit - each muscle must be pulled taut for the moment of launch. She can’t gain or lose too much weight, or else risk throwing off the cannon maker’s calculations with potentially disastrous results. On 7 May, in a downtown arena in Providence, Rhode Island, Sanders rides into the centre of the floor atop the bright red and gold cannon. In her civilian life she is tattooed and favours an all-black wardrobe, but in the show she’s dressed head to toe in a glittery silver jumpsuit. She grins and high-kicks and flourishes with her arms towards the sold-out crowd. As soon as she slides down into the mouth of the cannon, the smile drops. Sanders pulls into herself tightly and calls out to her shooter, Boris, that she’s ready. The ringmaster counts down from five, and with the cracking sound of fireworks, Sanders is launched high in the air, cresting at 40-feet and travelling roughly 66 miles per hour at a G-force of about seven, which is enough to knock out a fighter pilot in flight. She throws out her arms like wings, releasing two fistfuls of glitter. She turns in mid-air, touches her fingertips to her toes, then falls on her back into the airbag. This is when the adrenaline hits, as the crowd roars its approval. Just like she’d envisioned, everything goes perfectly. It is her 596th shot. It may also be her last. After 146 years, these are the final performances of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus, an American institution that was slowly brought to its knees by a combination of evolving cultural tastes, bad luck and political enemies that left it no longer financially viable for its parent company, Feld Entertainment. So, in addition to ignoring the 104-foot expanse of floor between the cannon mouth and the airbag, Sanders has had to force herself to stop thinking about the fact that she’s facing unemployment, the loss of her home, the disbanding of her tight-knit circus family, and the end of her dream job. I’m scrambling, kinda, to try and see what I want to do. This could be the end of my circus career.” A week earlier, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train clatters into Providence at dusk, making its final journey with passengers from the circus’ penultimate performances in Hartford, Connecticut. As soon as the silver cars stamped “GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH” come to a halt, Ivan Vargas, a sixth-generation circus performer from a long line of trapeze artists, clambers down into the muddy gravel. “I learned to walk on the train, my parents were living on the train when I was born,” he says, looking up and down the desolate train tracks. Here we are now, I just took my final train run.” They call it “the city without a zip code”. Sixty-one cars and a little over a mile long, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train is still the primary residence for most of the 107 performers and crew on the Red Unit, one of two remaining touring shows. There are 32 coaches divided into apartments of varying sizes, with as many as 16 people per car sleeping on narrow bunks. The youngest children sleep in the same car with their parents. Some of the families even keep cats and dogs. There is a single, six-table “Pie Car” with a fully functional kitchen staffed 24-hours-a-day when the train is in motion. Performers can shimmy down the razor-thin hallways that connect the cars, order a slab of meatloaf or a slice of pie, and watch the only continuously functioning TV. There is a shop car and a generator car, and 19 flatbeds filled with vehicles, costumes, equipment and tiger toys. The train is followed by a caravan of RVs and trucks ferrying the animals - seven camels, three ponies, 18 tigers, 12 poodles, plus horses, snakes, and goats. The production members hail from 13 different countries including Mongolia, Hungary, Russia, China, and Chile. All the show’s music is performed live, so a full band travels along, as well as a lighting and pyrotechnics crew, a team of veterinarians, vendor and concessions workers, the costume and wardrobe staff, the pie car chefs, interpreters and - at certain times - even a travelling circus ministry. By the time it pulls into Providence, the train had travelled 50,000 miles and visited 83 cities in the two-year tour, titled Circus XTREME. Vargas, 26, whose family is originally from Mexico, was born in between Sunday performances. His father - a trapeze artist - attended the birth while still in costume. Vargas was two years old the first time he got on a trapeze, and 14 the first time he performed in a Ringling Bros show, as an acrobat. When he turned 18, he became a clown, with his own train car room. To me it’s the best way to travel across the country. You take your small apartment with you. You step out on the vestibules and watch the country go by.” Ringling Bros is the last American circus that travels by rail, a tradition that began in the 1830s. In 1872, the showman Phineas T Barnum loaded his brand new circus on to the rails for the first time. By the time of his death, Barnum and his partner James Bailey had grown the show into a multi-ringed kaleidoscopic extravaganza of exotic animals, acrobats and strongmen, contortionists and sword-swallowers, and the train had become as iconic as the circus itself. “They would literally shut towns down when they arrived. Months in advance people knew it was coming,” says Janet Davis, a professor of American studies and history, and author of The Circus Age. “Schools cancelled their classes, factories shut their doors.” Five Wisconsin brothers named Ringling bought the Barnum & Bailey circus after its founders died, and in 1919, Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey debuted as a single show. Life on the circus train in the early days was exciting, seedy, and dangerous. “Love always seemed on the mind of circus folk, although given the cramped quarters, liaisons often took place in lumberyards, warehouses, or even, in extremis, ditches,” wrote photographer Loomis Dean, who travelled on the train as a circus employee. Terrible, unimaginable things happened in [the labourers’] cars, everything from fights to killings.” Courtesy of Circus World Museum This was also the heyday of the freakshow, invented by Barnum and perpetuated by Ringling. “Long, long before we thought about the animals being exploited it was common to exploit people like African Americans and differently abled people,” says Beth Macy, the author of Truevine, the story of two African-American albino brothers from Virginia who were snatched from their home and placed in the circus. Ringling purchased them in 1923. The brothers were first marketed as “Barnum’s monkey men”, then, after their blonde dreadlocks grew out, “Ambassadors from Mars”. It took 13 years for their mother to rescue them and bring them home. In 1956, the last of the circus-owning Ringlings, John Ringling North, announced that the circus would no longer perform under the canvas big top, nicknamed “Big Bertha”, but in brick and mortar arenas. It was a cost-cutting measure, but also seen as punishment for workers who’d attempted to unionise. Hundreds of “canvasmen” who set up and tore down the big top lost their jobs overnight. About a decade later, Irvin and Israel Feld - music promoters who worked with Chubby Checker, Fats Domino, and Paul Anka - bought the circus for $8m (£6.2m) with the help of investors. One of Irvin’s first acts as owner was to end the freakshow. Throughout its changing owners and acts in the constant pursuit of the new and novel, the one thing that remained constant was the train. Ivan Vargas, like generations of circus kids before him, first lived on the train with his parents, and attended school in the travelling classroom that set up amongst the dressing rooms at every stop along the tour. He had two teachers, one to shepherd him through grade school, another for high school, along with the other handful of children who spent 11 months out of the year on tour with their parents. He was not allowed to perform unless he went to class, which often took place in between shows. Sometimes Vargas wondered what it might be like to join the ranks of the “townies” - circus slang for non-circus people. I thought about how I would fit in being in a public school or going to a prom,” Ivan breaks down at the close of the final performance He continues, “but it never crossed my mind that I want to leave the show to go experience this. To me, I would never trade in the circus for anything.” He was married for a time, to a Ukrainian performer who came onto the unit in 2008. They fell in love as an 18-year-old Vargas introduced her to American malls and movies along the train route. But after she got her dream job with Cirque du Soleil and left the tour, the young couple who fell in love by spending 24 hours a day together on the train were unable to sustain the relationship on two weeks a year together. They divorced a year ago. We live so fast, it’s the way that it works.” “I’ve known people who literally come from different backgrounds, different cultures and countries, they don’t know each other. By the end of the tour they’ll be married and have a child already.” In the summer of 2016, for instance, Moroccan high wire walker Mustafa Danguir married Russian juggler Anna Lebedeva in a ceremony performed at the centre of a wire the width of a human thumb. The groom rode in on a camel, the bride did the splits at the “altar” 30 feet in the air. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus. The rise of television, movies, the internet and mobile phones has been siphoning off Ringling’s audience for decades, and the brand sustained irreparable damage during the animal rights movement that began in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Feld Entertainment has famously done battle with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, winning a $25m lawsuit against a group who claimed Ringling’s elephants were being abused. However, they’ve also been investigated and had to pay hefty fines to the US Department of Agriculture over various animal mistreatment allegations. Legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams Public opinion on captive exotic animals shifted, and changes in local laws were making it increasingly difficult to bring the elephants to different markets - cities and then entire states like California and Rhode Island banned the use of bullhooks on elephants, a tool the circus claims is for guiding and training, and which animal rights activists say is an implement of torture. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, banned the display of any exotic animal in its municipally-owned arena. Vargas was a clown on the Gold Unit, a third arm of the travelling tours of the circus, the year before Feld shut it down in 2015. The number of people in the remaining two units, Red and Blue, started to shrink. And in each city, the performers were met with crowds of angry animal rights protesters, and smaller and smaller audiences. In 2016, Feld yielded to public pressure, and the last 11 elephants on tour were transferred to a Florida preserve owned by the Felds. Vargas’ father and 65 others lost their jobs as elephant caretakers. (Some, like Vargas’ father, stayed on to care for the other animals or went to work at the Florida facility.) In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus.

In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. The final blow was delivered on 14 January, 2017, late one night after the last in a “six pack” of performances in Orlando, Florida. Posters printed in English, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Mongolian had gone up earlier in the day announcing a mysterious, mandatory all-staff meeting. There was speculation amongst the performers that the two units might be folded together, or that the rest of the animals would be leaving the tour. So when Feld Entertainment executives delivered the news that the circus was shutting down completely, it landed hard. “You watched hundreds of people burst into tears at the same time,” recalls ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson, Ringling Bros’ first female ringmaster. She had just given up her job, apartment and car to join the circus four months earlier. But the show had to go on. “The next day, we came in and did two more shows.” The five months leading up to the final performances haven’t been easy. Feld set up career counsellors at each stop. One by one, performers who found new gigs dropped off the tour. Foreign performers without new jobs will lose their work visas shortly after the final show, and the Felds are covering plane tickets and reimbursing mileage for road trips home. But it’s not all bad. The last days of the circus found screaming animal rights protesters replaced with sold-out crowds and teary fans. Well-wishers post themselves along the train tracks, sometimes waiting hours with hand-painted signs, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ringmaster waving from the vestibule one last time. For Vargas, the end of the circus is the end of the only way of life he’s ever known. On their day off before the start of performances in Providence, he heads to the local mall after a cursory and futile effort to pack up his train car. Over milkshakes and tater tots at Johnny Rockets, he says he couldn’t stand seeing the removal trucks and dumpsters lined up beside the train. I needed to do something normal, I just want to walk around and kind of be a person.” He wanders around with his 18-year-old cousin Tristan, the sole member of the final class of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey high school. Tristan will graduate that evening at the end-of-tour cast party, dressed in a red cap and gown with the circus insignia on it. They bump into other clowns, a BMX rider, some of the crew, the tiger trainer and his seven-year-old son, Gunther, named after the legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. In their street clothes, they all look just like ordinary people. That Sunday, the performers wake up and log on to social media to mark the last day in the circus. “Worst. Day. Ever,” writes band trombonist Megan O’Malley, along with a picture of her completely empty room on the train. “The final time putting on my RBBB Circus Xtreme makeup,” Ivan Vargas captions an Instagram photo of himself. The Red Unit gathers for a final circus mass, and a prayer from Circus and Travelling Show Ministries’ Father Francis Cancro: Bless with your holy light concession workers, floor crews, transportation crews and office workers and all who make the world of the circus a reality by their labour. Bless those who manifested beauty through the use of their gifts and talents as they walk, run, jump and fly across the sky. Send your angels as their protection. Circus alumni begin descending on Providence, including dozens of retired clowns and showgirls. Brian and Tina Miser, married cannonball coaches who mentored Sanders, arrive with their 13-year-old daughter. Skyler has already been shot out of a miniature, 8-foot cannon built by her father. She will never realise her dream to become a Ringling Bros cannonball. Chimgee Haltarhuu, a former acrobat with the Mongolian State Circus, flies in from her home in Minnesota where she now teaches a circus school. She wants to personally thank Feld Entertainment chief executive Kenneth Feld for hiring her in the ‘90s. The decision whisked her and her 5-year-old son out of an abusive marriage in Mongolia, where there were no resources for victims of domestic violence. Haltarhuu now makes yearly trips to Mongolia to run free circus demos to start a conversation with village women and children about abuse. Chimgee Haltarhuu with the coach of the current “Mongolian Marvels”” Ringling saved my life,” she says. “We built a good life. I have a house, I have a good job and a good husband, so I’m really happy.” If attendees of the last-ever pre-show - when ticket holders are allowed onto the arena floor to mingle with the clowns, contortionists, dancers and BMX bikers - were paying attention, they might have noticed their hosts struggling to maintain their cheery disposition. They might have noticed that Ivan Vargas’ make-up is pooling in milky droplets on his chin. They might have seen that after the camel trainer cheerfully asked the audience to return to their seats, she rushes backstage in tears. Scattered all over the cavernous dressing room areas, performers are finding private corners to try to compose themselves. Outside on the floor it is impossible to tell anything is amiss. The Danguir high wire act is flawless. The Mongolian contortionists beam as they hang upside down from the backs of their camels. The audience gasps as an acrobat jumps rope 50 feet above the arena floor as the Wheel of Steel spins below his feet. Sanders’ lands safely, cradled in the huge black air bag one last time. Then comes Taba Maluenda’s tiger act. A burly, bald Chilean with a scar across one cheek, Maluenda is one of the only performers with his own microphone. It picks up a sob that escapes his throat as the 13 tigers watch curiously from their perches. He summons one of them down and buries his face in her fur. It’s their last time working together - though he’s raised some of the tigers since they were cubs, they don’t belong to him, and Feld is not disclosing where they are being sent. Maluenda thanks each tiger by name as they exit the caged ring. These guys put food on my table for 13 years.” Then he turns to his 19-year-old daughter Tabata, an assistant in the act who is standing on the other side of the cage door. She’s been on the Ringling Bros train since she was seven. “Tabata, I’m sorry for papa stayed and took care of these animals and forgetted about you,” he says. “That’s never gonna happen again - papa love you.” At the end of the act, he gets down on his knees and kisses the arena floor. As ringmaster Wilson closes out their final show with a rendition of Auld Lang Syne - an old, tour-ending tradition - the rest of the circus children come running onto the floor. Some clamber onto the trampolines with their acrobat parents, others are inconsolable. “We never say good-bye in the circus life, all we say is we’ll see you down the road,” Wilson booms into the microphone for the final time, doffing her glittering top hat. “So ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, thank you. We’ll see you down the road.” Monday morning in the train yard after the final performance is quiet, and there’s a sweet smelling breeze wafting off of a nearby bread factory. Parked all along the train are little cars, giant moving trucks, a pick-up truck whose bed is stacked with a unicycle and an APPLAUSE sign. Adam Craig, the owner of the pick-up, is driving his son Stephen, one of the clowns, back home to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “If his career never went any further, to have done this would be the exclamation point on anybody else’s career,” says Craig, a granite countertop fabricator. “I remember how exciting it was the first day that we came out and saw the train.” A little girl walking a teensy chihuahua on a leash steps down from her train car. She’s followed by her mother, Irina Prostetsova, a second-generation circus dog trainer from Moscow who’s been with Ringling Bros for five years. Out of her big baggy costume, Prostetsova is dressed casual but chic. In the show her blonde hair is gelled straight up, now, it’s swept softly to one side of her face. For her, there is nothing to cry about today. It was my last performing day. I’m not a performer anymore. I took not one costume, not one prop, nothing.” Prostetsova has been performing in circuses since she was 11 years old. Her father and her brother also trained dogs for the circus. She was an acrobat as well. She married another circus performer, Alex Emelin, and together they and their 12 poodles came to the US to join Ringling. A year into their contract, Prostetsova and Emelin divorced.Despite the fact that they were in the worst throes of the break-up, they continued performing and travelling together with Ringling. Now, three years later, she says she and Emelin are friends again, but the end of the circus is the first time she’ll be able to live away from her ex-husband. “It’s a good thing,” she says. “Finally, I can start my new life.” She’s enrolled in a beauty school. She and her seven-year-old daughter Valentina are driving to Georgia, to close on a townhouse in a tiny city about 45 minutes from Atlanta. Prostetsova’s father and mother are joining them from Moscow - her mother has ALS, and is paralysed, a perilous condition in wintry Russia. Prostetsova and Emelin found homes for all 12 of their standard and miniature poodles. “No more performing for dogs,” says Prostetsova. “Guys gonna sit on the couch, and just go to the park, and just enjoy the life.” Her greatest hope is that Valentina does not become a circus performer. Maybe, she says, she could be a dentist. Prostetsova, Valentina, and their little dog Yumiko climb into a black SUV hitched to a U-Haul trailer and drive away. One by one, in cars and in taxis and moving vans, all 107 members of the Red Unit drive away from the train yard until it is empty. For some, they’re driving towards permanent addresses, towards apartments with full size stoves and refrigerators, to nine-to-five jobs and consistent wifi signals, toward high schools with homecomings and proms, utility bills and bathtubs instead of showers that suddenly - with an odd curve of the train tracks - tilt so far to the side that the water starts pooling and overflowing, and has to be bailed out the window. A quieter life. Ivan Vargas is joining a pirate-themed dinner theatre in Myrtle Beach called Pirates Voyage, where he’ll be learning to sword fight and stunt dive. The Wheel of Steel act is joining a circus in Spain. The Danguir high wire troupe are going back to Morocco, where they are semi-finalists on the Simon Cowell-produced TV show Arabs Got Talent. Nicole Sanders nearly signed a deal to do cannon in South Africa, but it fell apart at the last minute. She was offered a contract at a smaller American circus, but says the pay was less than minimum wage, with no health insurance. She turned it down. Performing, you know you’re not going to make a load of money, but you want to be able to survive.” She catches a flight to New Orleans, Louisiana, to stay with her mother while she figures out her next move. The last person at the train yard in Providence is ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson. She was hired to be Ringling Bros first female ringmaster, and had held the title for exactly one month when she found out that she would also be its last. Before being whisked into the national spotlight as the face of Circus XTREME, she’d been playing a ringmaster in a circus-themed dinner theatre in Orlando, Florida. She’s heading back to her hometown of Tallahassee without concrete plans for the future. With much groaning and shuddering, the train cars start moving down the track heading north, and slowly pick up speed. The bright red “RINGLING BROS AND BARNUM & BAILEY” banner stamped on the side of each car rolls past Wilson dozens and dozens of times. The Red Unit train will join the Blue Unit train in New Jersey in preparation for their final performance on 21 May in Uniondale, New York. Along the way, the cars that have been purchased at auction (minimum bid: $10,000) will be uncoupled and left behind to be picked up by their new owners. The Misers bought one that will be delivered to their cannonball training grounds in Peru, Indiana, and used as a guest house. At least one is destined to become a dinner train in Cincinnati, Ohio, albeit with the Ringling Bros name scraped off. What is left of the train will make the long, final journey south to the circus’ headquarters in Florida. Unsold cars will be scrapped for metal. The final car disappears over the horizon, the shrill squealing noises get tinier and tinier until they’re gone. An older man in a ball cap who was watching the departure approaches a sleep-deprived Wilson, who’s standing alone outside her moving truck with tears streaming down her face. “Excuse me,” he asks in a thick New England accent. “Are you the ringmaster?” Wilson answers simply, “Yeah,” and they both laugh joylessly. Long after the train has left the yard, Wilson lingers filming the tracks on her iPhone, pacing up and down the parking lot, and fretting because she forgot to thank the circus’ concession workers in her final speech. The sky is filling slowly with ominous dark clouds. Finally, she stops at the cab of her huge yellow moving truck. “It’s been amazing,” she sighs. “Time to get in this bad boy and figure out what I’m gonna do. “I’ll see you down the road.” Built with Shorthand"
County Championship - Yorkshire on top in Roses match,"Essex beat Hampshire by an innings and 97 runs at Chelmsford Kumar Sangakkara hits second century against Middlesex at Lord's Shiv Chanderpaul makes hundred for Lancashire in the Roses match Jonathan Trott scores 175 for Warwickshire against Somerset Glamorgan survive to final day against Notts in Cardiff Paul Grunill and Ged Scott No doubt about the star performers on the latest day of County Championship action. Essex take the collective excellence award after wrapping up an innings victory over Hampshire at Chelmsford, with Jamie Porter taking seven wickets in the game to help put them top of Division One. Individual honours, though go to Kumar Sangakkara, whose second century at Lord's has kept Surrey in the contest against Middlesex, and to Jack Brooks and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the Roses game at Old Trafford. Brooks' maiden first-class century was one for the cricket romantics, those who like to see bowlers shine with the bat and vice versa, while 42-year-old Chanderpaul's was one for the pragmatists. Jonathan Trott's 175 for Warwickshire wasn't half bad either, while in Division Two, Glamorgan are doing their darnedest to deny Notts a fourth successive Championship win. For the next instalment in these and other stories, please join us tomorrow from 10:30 BST. Division One Essex 360 v Hampshire 115 & 148 (following on) Essex won by an innings and 97 runs Yorkshire 448-8 dec v Lancashire 264-6 Yorkshire lead by 184 runs Surrey 313 & 194-4 v Middlesex 411 Surrey lead by 96 runs Warwickshire 413 v Somerset 94-4 Warwickshire lead by 319 runs Division Two Derbyshire 275 v Worcestershire 323-3 Worcestershire lead by 48 runs Nottinghamshire 448 v Glamorgan 187 & 212-5 (following on) Glamorgan need another 49 to avoid an innings defeat Leicestershire 420 v Kent 193-5 Leicestershire lead by 227 runs Durham 287 v Sussex 43-1 - day one Leicestershire 420 v Kent 193-5 (39 overs) Back to the County Championship and all-rounder Darren Stevens hit an unbeaten 54 for Kent, including a six and nine fours, in the final session of an elongated day at Grace Road following rain earlier in the match. Dieter Klein bowled superbly for Leicestershire, taking 4-48, after they earned a full haul of batting points earlier in the day, thanks mainly to Clint McKay's 66 off 58 balls. Kent trail by 227 and will need to bat with care on the final morning to snuff out any possibility of them being asked to follow-on. Mumbai Indians are IPL champions again after beating Rising Pune Supergiant by one run in a nerve-jangling finish in Hyderabad. Set a target of 130, Pune needed 11 off the final over of the game, bowled by Australia's Mitchell Johnson. Three wickets fell, including the run out of Dan Christian off the final delivery attempting a third run that would have tied the scores. South Africa have beaten Northants by 13 runs at Wantage Road in their latest 50-over tour game ahead of the series against England and Champions Trophy. Hashim Amla top-scored with 59 as they made 275-7, and the highlight of the county side's reply was an innings of 54 off 43 balls by debutant Tom Sole, batting at number nine. He was the last to go, at the start of the 48th over, as Morne Morkel wrapped up South Africa's win. Surrey 313 & 194-4 (72 overs) v Middlesex 411 Another day, another peerless batting display by Surrey's Kumar Sangakkara, who passes 20,000 first-class runs shortly before stumps at Lord's. His unbeaten 116 gives his side a 96-run lead to take into the final day's play, but it is hard to see how they might pull off a victory against a team as strong as the reigning champions, without a rapid acceleration on the final morning. The new ball is only eight overs away, which offers a ray of hope for Middlesex. If they can remove Sangakkara early, as they did on the second day of the match, they would be hopeful of cleaning up the rest and then chasing down a target. Izzy WestburyBBC Sport Somerset
captain Tom Abellâs poor start to the season continued at Taunton. He could only manage
8 with the bat as Somerset struggled to 94-4 in reply to Warwickshireâs
total of 413. Jonathan Trott made the bulk of the Warwickshire
runs, amassing 175 in a knock which included three sixes. In reply, only veteran Marcus Trescothick offered much resistance from the home side,
surpassing 25,000 first class runs in his unbeaten knock of 41. A tense day
awaits Somerset tomorrow if they are to avoid making it three defeats from
three. Lancashire 264-6 (94.0 overs) v Yorkshire Lancashire still need a further 35 to make sure they avoid being asked to follow on in the Roses match against Yorkshire. It was a day dominated by Jack Brooks and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who both scored centuries. Brooks, on his first start of the summer, added the six singles he needed to reach his maiden first-class hundred, finishing unbeaten on 109 when Yorkshire declared on 448-8. Chanderpaul's century, by contrast, was his 75th in first-class cricket - a key knock after Brooks had followed up his ton by then uprooting England Test opener Haseeb Hameedâs off stump for
a third duck in four Championship innings. Derbyshire 275 v Worcestershire 323-3 Brett D'Oliveira gives a return catch to Jeevan Mendis as he attempts a slog sweep and that's the final act of the third day's play at Derby. The opener faced 232 balls and hit 15 fours and his innings, coupled with Daryl Mitchell's 120, has given them every chance of maximum batting points in what was a rain-hit match on the first two days. For Worcestershire to win, however, they will need to get a move on and extend their 48-run lead in the hope that a declaration will enable their bowlers to put some pressure on Derbyshire in the final stages of the game tomorrow. Durham 287 v Sussex 43-1 (11 overs) Durham are unable to achieve a second breakthrough after Graham Onions had Harry Finch caught at third slip for a duck with his first delivery. Chris Nash reaches stumps 22 not out, with partner Luke Wells unbeaten on 16, and Sussex will be satisfied with their work on the opening day after Jofra Archer took 5-76 as Durham's first innings only lasted to the 83rd over. They are 244 ahead, though, and Onions and Chris Rushworth will be fresh for a second burst with the new ball in the morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Somerset 94-4 (27 overs) v Warwickshire Somerset closed on 94-4 at Taunton, still trailing fellow Division One strugglers Warwickshire by 319 runs. The Bears would have to take 16 wickets on the final day to win - and that does seem quite so likely given that they still might have to get Marcus
Trescothick out twice. The former England opener was unbeaten at the close on 41, having gone past 25,000 first class runs as Somerset replied to
Warwickshireâs 413 all out. Nottinghamshire 448 v Glamorgan 187 & 212-5 (96 overs) If Glamorgan lose this game, there will still be positives for the Welsh county after succeeding in taking it into a final day at the Swalec, having been forced to follow on. In-form Colin Ingram batted for over five hours to reach 72 not out at stumps, with his side still needing another 49 to avoid an innings defeat. Luke Fletcher (2-52) has the best figures for Notts, but England's Stuart Broad is still waiting for his first wicket of the Glamorgan second innings, ending the day with 0-37 from 23 accurate overs. Surrey 313 & 171-4 (62.3 overs) v Middlesex 411 Two days ago a portrait of Kumar Sangakkara wasunveiled in the Pavilion,externalat Lord's. In it, the Sri Lankan has a serious expression on his face - but perhaps it ought to be smiling as, with an appropriate sense of occasion, he completes his second hundred of the match for Surrey with three runs off Ollie Rayner. Following his 114 in the first innings, this one has taken him 174 balls and has featured 12 fours. Superb batting by the left-hander - and isn't it surprising  that only one of his 38 Test centuries was made at the home of cricket, 147 against England in 2014. Six more runs will take him to 20,000 in first-class cricket. Legend. Somerset 86-4 (24.5 overs) v Warwickshire Grant Thornton adds a second scalp on his County Championship debut as he removes Somerset keeper Steven Davies. Two wickets in 16 balls for the young Coventry-born pace bowler, in his first game for the Bears since being plucked from the Birmingham League earlier this season. Lancashire 247-6 (89.3 overs) v Yorkshire Ben Coad proves a twist late in the day at Old Trafford as he bowls Shiv Chanderpaul, just after the West Indian had reached his ton. Did it perhaps keep a little low? Ryan McLaren, with whom he shared a 112-run stand, is still there but Lancashire supporters are slightly more concerned now as they chase the follow-on avoidance figure of 299. Surrey 313 & 171-4 (61.5 overs) v Middlesex 411 In the context of the match, that may be an important wicket for Middlesex. But Kumar Sangakkara is the main focus of attention at Lord,s with just one more run needed for his second century of the game. Surrey's lead is 73. Worcestershire 282-2 (67 overs) v Derbyshire Tom Fell gone, bowled by Jeevan Mendis. His innings took almost an hour, just when Worcestershire needed to press on a bit. Captain Joe Leach is next to the wicket, as the visitors, looking for a big first-innings lead,  home in on a third batting point. Somerset 78-3 (20.2 overs) v Warwickshire Grant Thornton's maiden first-class wicket - and not a bad one too, trapping Jimmy Hildreth leg before wicket. Somerset have not made the best start, in response to Warwickshire's 413. But Marcus Trescothick is still there on 40, having gone past 25,000 first-class runs in the process. A prodigious effort from the 41-year-old former England opener. Lancashire 237-5 (85 overs) v Yorkshire Shiv Chanderpaul completes the 75th first-class century of his career - a second Roses Match ton of the day, following Jack Brooks' earlier 109 not out for Yorkshire. This one has taken four and a half hours. It is the 42-year-old West Indian's fourth for Lancashire - and also his fourth against Yorkshire. Very well received by an Old Trafford crowd now visibly bolstered by the football having finished just up the road, following Manchester United's final home league game of the season. The partnership for the sixth wicket with Ryan McLaren (50) has reached 102. Nine overs left after this one. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nottinghamshire 448 v Glamorgan 187 & 194-5 (88 overs) Colin Ingram and David Lloyd survive seven overs against the new ball, but Luke Fletcher ends their partnership in the eight as the latter edges a ball which appears to lift more than he expected to second slip. Glamorgan need another 67 to bring the scores level as Chris Cooke joins Colin Ingram, who is 62 not out, at the crease with eight overs left in the day. Â© 2025 BBC.

They cannot pass on instructions to the players but he tried his best and we thank him for it. ""The club had to make a decision, and they did. The language didn't help him.

You need time. it is very hard to get that Upton Park feeling but it is going to get better and better. ""Today we showed character. We finished 11th and are one point from being eighth. It is not a season to talk about, to hail it, but it is not a very bad season. I'm expecting it to be better next season, of course. ""The summer will be busy for every club. Today's game showed we have a quantity of players and a squad. We were without eight players and still we had a good team out. We need a few players to improve our first team. Make no mistake our targets are also the targets for eight to 10 clubs in the Premier League."" Arsenal 3-1 Everton Arsenal Arsene Wenger on missing out on the Champions League for the first time in 20 years:""It is annoying but we had a spell
during the season that was difficult and it was difficult for me in my personal situation. We were playing in
a hostile environment. The players came back stronger in the last two months
and I'm very proud of them for doing that. ""I was focused on my job. I am professional. I love this club
enough to do my best every single day. One thing you cannot question is my love
for this club. I've turned down every club in the world to stay here."" Hull 1-7 Tottenham David PleatFormer Spurs boss at White Hart Lane for 5 live Sport Harry Kane is a good ambassador for the game. I was worried he would become selfish looking for this golden boot but he hasn't. For Spurs to finish with 86 points, more goals than any other team in the league, conceding less goals than any other team in the league and playing the Tottenham way - It's just fantastic.

Hull 1-7 Tottenham It looks like we might not be hearing much from Jose Mourinho. The Manchester United boss nipped into the news conference while his players were still doing a lap of honour - and with barely any journalists in there, he nipped straight out again. He spoke to MUTV for 17 seconds, only to tell them he would like to focus on the Europa League final. Nothing to see here. Match of the Day, 22:30 BST, BBC One Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:""It's an amazing moment for us to celebrate this win, for me and the players. ""Come on Chelsea, come on!"" Southampton 0-1 Stoke Stoke's goalscorer Peter Crouch on BBC Radio 5 live Sport: ""I saw him before the game, he sent me some pictures from the pub before-hand. It was incredible, fair play to him. ""I'm glad we won so I could go and have my picture with a guy in speedos. Absolute hero and I am pleased we got the win for him as well.""

Man Utd 2-0 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce:""We conceded two sloppy goals, and they had two shots in the whole game so defensively we did very well. Creativity wise was not good for us. That means Man United ran out the winners. ""Wilfried Zaha got battered today by not being allowed to play his normal game, there was a lack of protection for him and he had to come off injured. He was tripped, kicked, pushed and fouled. I am disappointed in the referee, he did not handle the situation better. ""We have all worked extremely hard from the owners support throughout the whole football club. My job was to lift everyone on the pitch and behind the scenes and get working in the right direction. With the investment in January, very, very, very good performances came and that is why we stayed in the Premier League. ""Beating Chelsea away, Arsenal at home and Liverpool away in the space of a few days, had we not got them we would have been relegated. They were the big ones. ""We now need to grow, develop and invest. You need to choose the right players and not the wrong ones. Recruitment is the difficult task in the summer. Any players we bring in have to be better than the ones we have now."" Chelsea More from John Terry:""I'd like to thank my wife and my kids for supporting me in this amazing journey I've had. ""You are the best supporters in the world, without a shadow of a doubt. You've given me everything. You picked me up when I was down, sung my name when I had a bad game and disappointed you. ""I'll come back here one day, supporting the team for years to come.""
