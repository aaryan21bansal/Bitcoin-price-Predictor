Calls to ban Coca-Cola Christmas truck,"Coca-Cola launched its Christmas trucks on a TV advert in 1995, but real trucks now visit cities around the world Calls have been made to ban the Coca-Cola truck from Liverpool this Christmas amid concerns about obesity levels in the city. Liverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said the city is ""in the grip of an obesity epidemic"". He believes Coca-Cola's popular festive vehicle promotes a product which is ""grossly unhealthy"",as first reported in the Liverpool Echo.,external A Coca-Cola spokesman said the truck also promotes sugar-free drinks. Mr Kemp has written a letter to managers of the Liverpool One shopping district, setting out his opposition to the ""cynical event"" His concerns come four months after a study by Public Health Liverpool naming and shaming what it said werethe most sugary breakfast cereals. Coca-Cola Great Britain said it had received a ""positive response from many people in Liverpool"" He wrote: ""You are probably aware that Liverpool is in the grip of an obesity epidemic for children and adults. 30% of our 11-year-olds are obese. ""The biggest single cause of this is the consumption of fizzy drinks. ""That is why I am appalled that there is a rumour going round that you will welcome the Coca-Cola van to Liverpool. This cynical event has taken place for the past five years and is not designed to welcome Christmas but to increase the consumption of a product that is grossly unhealthy."" A spokesman for Coca-Cola Great Britain said it had received a ""positive response from many people in Liverpool"" during previous visits. He added: ""People will have the opportunity to see the truck up close, have their photograph taken and enjoy a choice of a small, 150ml can of Coca-Cola Classic or one of our no sugar options, Diet Coke or Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.""

'Nosy' midwife viewed friends' records,"The midwife was dismissed by University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust A midwife who admitted being ""stupidly nosy"" for looking up dozens of confidential medical records has been struck off. Vicky Anne Bloxham, 38, viewed records of friends, an ex-boyfriend and colleagues over 14 years ""without clinical justification"", a panel found. Mrs Bloxham told the panel she was ""very ashamed and embarrassed"" about her ""completely inquisitive"" actions. She was sacked by University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. The midwife from Leicester, who looked up records between October 2002 and January 2016, was dismissed by the trust last year. An investigation began when a patient complained to the trust that Mrs Bloxham had passed on information from her medical records to another person, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard. The midwife initially denied using the computer system to view records, but broke down in tears when told it was possible to find out what records she had accessed. Midlands Live: Local news and breaking stories Mrs Bloxham, who looked up her own records and a former neighbour's as well as viewing some people's records several times a day, claimed her actions also resulted from ""fear about health, illness and death"". The midwife wrote to the panel she had ""learnt a lesson"" from the ""unchangeable events"". ""I hope to be able to move forward and put this harrowing time behind me,"" she said. Panel chair Yvonne Brown said Mrs Bloxham had ""abused her position of trust"" over a sustained period. ""We are satisfied that Mrs Bloxham's misconduct will have brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute,"" she said. University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust added: ""The midwife concerned has not worked for the trust in over a year. ""As soon as these allegations came to light, we launched an immediate investigation and referred this individual to the NMC.""

Father and children feared dead in fire,"This video can not be played Aerial footage of the house shows the devastation caused by the blaze A father and several of his children are feared to have died in a fire at a remote farmhouse in Powys. Three children, aged 10, 12 and 13, escaped the blaze near Llangammarch Wells just after midnight on Monday and are being treated in hospital. One of the people unaccounted for has been named locally as David Cuthbertson who is believed to be in his sixties. Police confirmed people were missing and some had died in the fire, adding the cause of the blaze was unexplained. The fire gutted the entire building Local Conservative MP Chris Davies said: ""I am absolutely devastated at today's news that there was an overnight fire in Llangammarch Wells, which has claimed the lives of a father and his young children. ""As a father to two young girls, this news has shocked me to the core. My thoughts are with the family and local community at this terrible time."" Ron Birchall, 73, who lives at the former Aberceiros Inn in the village, described Mr Cuthbertson as ""a great guy"". He added: ""All I can say is that he was a great father who loved his kids and doted on them. ""I used to see him walking around the village or in his vehicle. We saw the kids coming to pick up the bus to school."" A joint police and fire service statement said the children who escaped had non life-threatening injuries. It continued: ""Due to the severity of damage at the scene we are unable at this stage to identify any of the deceased or confirm numbers. ""Specialist scientists and fire investigators are still assessing the scene prior to further investigation."" Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said its crews were faced with an ""extremely difficult situation"" at the scene and firefighters did all they could to handle the situation. A spokesman added: ""Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and the residents of Llangammarch Wells following this tragic incident."" A number of emergency vehicles remain at the scene Ch Insp Martin Slevin, of Dyfed-Powys Police, told a press conference the investigation into the fire and the recovery of the victims' bodies would be difficult. He described the scene as ""chaotic"" with ""significant"" damage to the structure of the building, but said officers would work to provide answers about the cause of the blaze. Powys councillor Tim Van-Rees, who represents the Llanwrtyd Wells area and who knew the family who lived at the property, described the incident as ""devastating"". He said: ""It is absolutely shocking and a devastating blow and it is possibly just as well we are in half-term at the moment because the effect on our children and the schools would have been very severe. ""I have spoken to the owner of the property who was alerted and telephoned the fire brigade and I must say as a member of the fire authority the local fire brigade were outstanding."" He said firefighters ""risked life and limb"" to see whether anything could be done but ""unfortunately their efforts were not well rewarded"". He added: ""Speaking on behalf of the community our thoughts and prayers will all those affected. The community will come together and do all it can for the surviving children and relations."" Several fire crews attended the blaze at the rural home in Llangammarch Wells Brecon and Radnorshire AM Kirsty Williamstweeted:,external""Tragic, devastating news for the community. My deepest sympathies to those affected."" A number of ambulances were sent to the house, while 20 members of Brecon Mountain Rescue Team helped search the surrounding area for casualties.

Why are people angry about Kevin Spacey coming out?,"Kevin Spacey at the European premiere of Baby Driver in London earlier this year If Kevin Spacey had come out as gay a year ago, the reactions would've been very different to those seen on Monday. For starters, he almost certainly would have been congratulated - a Hollywood A-lister publicly coming out in a world where being gay is considered by many to damage ticket sales. But the House of Cards actor only came out in the wake of accusations that he made a sexual advance towards a male child actor in 1986. Anthony Rapp, who was 14 at the time,told BuzzFeed,externalthat Spacey invited him to a party and seemed drunk when the alleged incident happened. The actor apologised in a statementposted on Twitter,external, writing: ""This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life... I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose to now live as a gay man."" But he's since been criticised for choosing this moment to come out - and some have accused him of using his sexuality as a shield to deflect the negative publicity the allegations have sparked. ""He doesn't get a pass just because he's gay,"" says Josh Rivers, the newly-appointed editor of Gay Times. Anthony Rapp says the alleged encounter with Kevin Spacey happened in the 1980s ""Alleged predatory behaviour is bad behaviour regardless of your sexuality. ""Kevin Spacey has chosen the incorrect moment to assert his sexuality, particularly in this situation where he's being accused of something quite egregious."" Linda Riley, publisher of Diva magazine and co-founder of the British LGBT Awards, says it was ""disappointing"" that the actor chose this moment to come out, adding: ""I felt it was deflecting from the allegations. ""There's been so many times he could've come out in the past and he hasn't. That's his choice but he should've used this time to own the apology, and so to make it about himself instead was disgusting, basically."" She adds: ""I find this whole statement quite manipulative if I'm honest, he's tried to acknowledge what he's done, but used the fact he's gay as subterfuge."" But Benjamin Cohen, CEO of PinkNews, points out: ""I don't think Kevin Spacey could've done anythingbutcome out [after the allegation was made]. This video can not be played Filmmaker and author Carol Gould: Kevin Spacey has ""upset"" a lot of people ""But it's unfortunate he ended up having to come out at the same time as responding to quite serious allegations of inappropriate conduct towards someone who was just 14 at the time."" ""Clearly there's two stories now,"" Cohen continues. ""One is 'Big star Kevin Spacey comes out', and the other one is 'Kevin Spacey accused of sexual misconduct in the 1980s"". ""And I think it's unfortunate that the way he's responded to that means the two issues are kind of conflated."" Spacey's statement, which was published late on Sunday evening, sparked a similar reaction on social media - and not just from the LGBT community. Allow Twitter content?

Rivers says: ""I think the [LGBT] community is understandably upset that he's managed to conflate these two things, it does seem like a deflection technique. ""There are already people who suggest that homosexuality and paedophilia are linked, and we know they're not, but this statement doesn't do anything to rubbish that."" ""Homophobes will use any excuse they're given, so no it's not helpful that he's made it so easy for them to use this against us as a community to kind of reinforce these bigoted views that they have."" Many have expressed their disappointment that the actor decided against coming out earlier in his career. Spacey and Robin Wright star in Netflix's House of Cards ""I think it would've been a brilliant story,"" Cohen says, ""particularly because of his current big role in House of Cards."" ""It would've been an interesting opportunity to have someone in a big mainstream US TV show coming out, it would've been a very positive thing to do, but obviously that wasn't what happened."" Riley thinks if Spacey had come out sooner ""he would've been lauded"". ""It's great for LGBT actors to be able to say they're gay and have it be no big deal. More and more they're coming out, every day. So I don't think there would've been a huge backlash to his career, there are plenty of successful LGBT actors. Spacey received a special Olivier award in 2015 for his contribution to British theatre Instead, Rivers says, he's now facing a wave of criticism. ""We as a community have become acutely attuned to these types of manipulations and deflections, and we can't stand for it,"" he says. Riley adds: ""So many of us who are LGBT have sacrificed so much in our lives to come out, and it's been quite a courageous thing to do, so coming out should be associated with an act of courage, not deflection.""

Trump adviser lied about Russian links,"Papadopoulos says he was told the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton An election campaign adviser to Donald Trump has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. George Papadopoulos admitted the talks happened while he worked for Mr Trump, not before, court papers show. He said he had been told the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. Separately, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering unrelated to the 2016 election. The charges against Mr Papadopoulos are the first to be brought by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating alleged links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Who's who in the Russian drama? Manafort's short reign on the Trump campaign It has the potential to damage the US leader because it relates directly to his campaign, analysts say.

Mr Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - was close enough to then-candidate Trump to be part of a photograph (third from left) of his national security team which Mr Trump tweeted on 1 April 2016. According to the court documents, Mr Trump's former foreign policy adviser admitted on 5 October 2017 to having impeded the FBI's investigation,externalinto alleged collusion with Russia. When he was interviewed by the FBI this January, he falsely claimed that he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. One was an unnamed Russian woman who, Mr Papadopoulos believed, had connections to Russian government officials. He admitted seeking to use her connections in an effort to arrange a meeting ""between the campaign and Russian government officials"". The other person was an unnamed, London-based professor who was said to have ""substantial connections to Russian government officials"". The professor only took an interest in Mr Papadopoulos because of his status within the Trump campaign, the statement says. Russian ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton, in the form of ""thousands of emails"", was allegedly mentioned by the professor at a breakfast meeting in a London hotel on or around 26 April 2016. The professor said he had been informed about the compromising emails when he met senior Russian government officials on a recent trip to Moscow. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Robert Mueller, in journalism terms, buried the story. Initial headlines on Monday morning were about Paul Manafort's indictment for money laundering and undisclosed foreign lobbying activities. The real blockbuster, however, may end up being George Papadopoulos's plea bargain, which was disclosed shortly after the Manafort news came out. Unlike Mr Manafort, pinched for activities largely conducted before he joined the Trump team, Mr Papadopoulos has admitted to lying to the FBI about contacts he had with Russian nationals while serving as a Trump foreign policy adviser. Mr Papadopoulos's indictment document reveals he learned from his connections that Russia claimed to have ""dirt"" on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"" in a late April 2016 meeting. Damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta started emerging, through Wikileaks, just a few months later. Now Mr Papadopoulos is co-operating with the independent counsel's office. At the very least, he has told them who in the top levels of the Trump campaign he was passing this information to. If Mr Mueller's case ends up about more than just illegal activities by Mr Manafort and a business associate years ago, Mr Papadopoulos could be a key piece of the puzzle. Read more:The biggest news wasn't about Manafort This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Mr Manafort and one of his business associates, Rick Gates, appeared in a Washington court on Monday to deny 12 charges, including conspiracy to launder money. The former campaign manager was placed under house arrest and ordered to post a $10m (Â£8m) bond while Mr Gates was also placed under house arrest and ordered to post a bond of $5m. The indictment against the two men,external, which accuses them of ""conspiracy against the United States"", looks at their links to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine between 2006 and 2015. It says they acted as ""unregistered agents"" of Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych and his party, both in opposition and government. What is 'conspiracy against the United States'? Mr Yanukovych was deposed as president in 2014 amid mass unrest over his pro-Russian policies. Mr Manafort is accused of having laundered more than $18m through offshore bank accounts, using it to buy property, goods and services in transactions concealed from the US authorities. Speaking outside the court, Mr Manafort's lawyer, Kevin Downing, said his client was innocent. ""Maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds into the United States as a scheme to conceal from the United States government is ridiculous,"" he added. Mr Gates is accused of having transferred more than $3m from the offshore accounts to other accounts he controlled. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the role of Mr Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign had been ""extremely limited"". This video can not be played White House: ""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president"" He had been in a ""volunteer position"", she said, and ""no activity was done in an official capacity"". She also stressed that none of the charges against Mr Manafort related to the Trump campaign. When it came to allegations of Russian influence, she said, the focus should be on Hillary Clinton's campaign. ""The real collusion scandal, as we've said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS, and Russia,"" she added. According to US media reports,external, Perkins Coie, a law firm representing the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, hired intelligence firm Fusion GPS in April 2016. Fusion GPS, based in Washington DC, was paid to dig up dirt on Mr Trump, who was then Mrs Clinton's rival for the presidency.

Greetings card slave worker kept in loft,"This video can not be played Watch the moment police found a man locked in a loft A man who locked two Polish immigrants in his loft, using violence against them and controlling their ID documents, had been jailed. One of the men was forced to work 20 hours a day making greetings cards. Edward Zielinski, 42, of Birkin Avenue, Hyson Green, Nottingham, admitted two counts of modern slavery and was jailed for three years and four months. Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told Zielinski he had treated the victims in a ""thoroughly degrading way"". Sentencing him at Nottingham Crown Court, he added: ""You made them live in squalor and took away their incomes. ""You took away their dignity as human beings, you fully exploited their vulnerability, you were able to brow beat and control them through threats and intimidation."" The offences took place between 31 May 2013 and 1 June 2017. Zielinski made the men work for little or no money. He would also force his victims to urinate in plastic bottles at night rather than wake him and his wife. Edward Zielinski would force his victims to urinate in plastic bottles in the loft The first victim later started working for an employment agency, but despite earning about Â£300 a week he was only paid with cigarettes, alcohol, occasional pieces of clothing and Â£10 cash. The victim, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he ran away twice but was found by Zielinski and brought back to the loft. ""I slept on the wooden floor, there was no mattress, nothing. I had a blanket to cover myself and I wore a jacket,"" he added. ""He was unpredictable and if I asked him for anything I was scared he would hit me. He didn't hurt me because I had to go to work and look normal. ""I have seen a friend being assaulted by him a few times."" Both victims are being supported by the Salvation Army. Det Sgt Mike Ebbins, who led the investigation, said the two men were seen as ""perfect victims"" because they ""couldn't speak a word of English"". ""The first victim was made to work up to 20 hours a day from 8am to 4am with only limited break, earning only Â£10 a week.""

Outcry over Russian teenage model's death,"Vlada Dzyuba, 14, died less than two weeks after taking part in Shanghai Fashion Week A Chinese modelling agency has denied claims that a Russian teenage model it represented died from overwork. Vlada Dzyuba, 14, died in China on Friday after participating in Shanghai Fashion Week. Her Shanghai-based agency, ESEE Model Management, said she was a happy young girl who enjoyed her modelling work. Many foreign models in China are from the former Soviet Union. China has laws that allow children under the age of 16 to work in certain industries. According to reports, Vlada began feeling dizzy and fell sick and was taken to a Shanghai hospital on Wednesday. She died on Friday from multiple organ failure after her condition quickly worsened. The Chinese Global Times state newspaper said she died of blood poisoning. The Siberian Times, an English-language newspaper in Russia, alleges that the teenager, from the Russian city of Perm, died of meningitis. It says that this was compounded by exhaustion following ""a gruelling fashion show in Shanghai"". Carrie Fang, the chief agent for ESEE who was at Vlada's side when she died, said the young Russian had enjoyed the two months she spent in China before her death. ""She was a very excitable girl, she liked to eat, she liked to eat chips, like a teenager is supposed to do,"" Ms Fang told reporters on Monday.

Woman's life-giving treatment 'can end',"Mrs P was left ""minimally conscious"" in hospital after a fall in 2016 A paralysed elderly woman whose care became the focus of a family dispute can have her life-sustaining treatment discontinued, a judge has ruled. The 72-year-old was left ""minimally conscious"" after suffering an aneurysm following a fall in 2016. Doctors wanted artificial feeding to continue but relatives were divided. A judge concluded the woman would have viewed her ""present high level of dependency and minimal awareness"" to be a ""travesty of life"". The matter came before a Court of Protection hearing, sitting in Preston, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered. The woman's sisters wanted her feeding to carry on in the hope that her condition would improve, but her daughters and partner disagreed. Mr Justice Hayden concluded that the woman, who is being cared for at a unit in the north of England, would have found her ""present circumstances"" to be ""not only intolerable but humiliating"". The court previously heard the woman, identified as Mrs P, had sent an email to one of her daughters nearly four years before her fall, in whichshe wrote about her fear of being left in such a condition. The judge said evidence from family members had permitted the woman's ""voice to be heard"" at the hearing. He said her ""incapacitous state"" did not mean that her wishes could be ""disregarded"". Staff at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust had asked for a ruling on whether the treatment should continue. Following the publication of the judge's ruling on Monday, a lawyer representing one of the daughters said there were no winners or losers. Mathieu Culverhouse, of law firm Irwin Mitchell, said: ""The judge has decided that withdrawing the life-sustaining treatment is in my client's mother's best interests given her current quality of life and her previously expressed wishes and feelings."" ""While the court has dealt with the case very sensitively, my client and her sister have found it distressing and painful to have to go to court to fight for their mother's wishes to be respected, and they hope that in future a different way can be found to resolve cases such as this, so that other families do not have to go through the same ordeal.""

The BBC ghost spoof that duped a nation,"Ghostwatch's creators wanted to break television boundaries - but they did not predict its impact on viewers It was billed as a drama, but many of Ghostwatch's 11 million viewers were taken in by the BBC's fake investigation, which in one tragic case led to a teenager taking his own life. On its 25th anniversary, his parents and the creator of the show talk about its impact. It's Halloween night in 1992, and families across the UK are excitedly huddled around the television. Saturday night TV is at its peak - Gladiators has just premiered on ITV, Casualty is enjoying its seventh series and Noel's House Party is pulling in 15 million viewers a week. But tonight's big draw is the BBC's heavily-promoted Ghostwatch, a supposedly ""live"" investigation into paranormal activity being recorded at a family home in Northolt, north-west London. The programme was the brainchild of horror writer Stephen Volk, who had originally conceived it as a spooky six-part drama, but who was instead asked by producer Ruth Baumgarten to create a 90-minute ghost story for the broadcaster's Screen One series. ""I said to her, 'why don't we do it instead as an investigation, a mystery story - pretending it's a live transmission from a haunted house?',"" Volk recalls. ""I remember that moment very clearly, when she was really excited by that."" Martin Denham, pictured on his 18th birthday, ""became entranced with talk of ghosts"" Volk's idea was arguably visionary, years ahead of today's scripted reality TV shows, where the likes of The Only Way Is Essex routinely blur fact and fiction. The script went through numerous rewrites as TV executives continued to be confused by the concept. ""There was a lot of head-scratching and puzzlement when Baumgarten had meetings with people trying to explain what we were trying to do,"" he remembers. ""They didn't get it when they read it, why it was written in this peculiar way. They didn't understand how it was going to work."" Michael Parkinson was among a host of familiar, trusted faces on the programme The team wanted to push the boundaries of reality even further. They didn't want it fronted by conventional actors - they wanted familiar and friendly TV personalities to bring the story to life. Michael Parkinson, one of the BBC's most trusted faces, was asked to present it. Alongside him was popular children's television presenter Sarah Greene, together with her husband, TV and radio host Mike Smith -  a fact Volk calls a ""happy accident"". ""It was offered to Sarah [initially] and Mike - I think - happened to read it over her shoulder and said ""can I be in it [too]?' ""I quickly thought, 'this is a real bonus',"" says Volk. It was groundbreaking television in many ways - from the infra-red, heat-seeking camera used to ""spot"" ghostly activity to the pixellation of an interviewee's face. They also used videotape, instead of the typical 16mm film, to make it look more homemade. Though the production team wanted it to look realistic, shortly before its transmission the programme featured on the cover of theRadio Times,external, inside which it was explained it was a drama. But not everyone read the Radio Times.  And when Ghostwatch aired at 21:25 GMT, there were consequences the corporation had not foreseen. The show centred on the fictional Early family, of Northolt, Greater London In Nottingham, April and Percy Denham were sitting down to watch the programme together with their sons, Martin 18, and Gavin, 14. The pair recalled how their elder son became more and more agitated throughout the broadcast. ""He sort of curled up while watching it. We asked if he was alright, but he seemed hypnotised by it,"" says Mrs Denham. Ghostwatch's viewers were invited into ""the most haunted house in Britain"", where Pamela Early and her two daughters were being spooked by a poltergeist. The nation was told a team of researchers had spent the last 10 months investigating the mysterious movements of a ghost named Pipes - so-called because it kept banging on the water pipes. In the studio, Parkinson urged viewers to phone in with their own ghost stories on 081 811 8181 - the standard number for BBC phone-ins at the time, used on shows including Crimewatch and Going Live! As Greene followed the paranormal activity around the house, the tension mounted and the Early family were subjected to increasingly terrifying experiences as the spirit of a dead man apparently entered the children. ""Pipes"" the ghost was filmed causing havoc in the suburban family home By the end of the show the ghost had ""seized control"" of the TV cameras. At the Early's house, paramedics and police were seen arriving, and Greene, who was trying to locate one of the possessed girls, disappeared into the blackness. Back in the studio, the floor was deserted apart from a dumbfounded Parkinson. But behind the scenes, the Ghostwatch production team were enjoying celebratory drinks as the programme aired. ""Ruth [Baumgarten] arrived with a white face and said the switchboard had been jammed at the BBC,"" Volk says. ""I kind of laughed lightly and she said very seriously, 'no, they really are jammed with people very irate'. ""That was a bit of a 'gulp' moment."" Viewers were used to seeing Sarah Greene fronting children's television shows More than 20,000 people had tried to get through to Parkinson at one point during the programme. Many of the viewers were children, who had been left traumatised by what they thought they had witnessed. ""I think three women who were pregnant went into labour that evening,"" says Volk. ""A vicar phoned in to complain that even though he realised it wasn't real he thought the BBC had raised demonic forces. ""It was partly that it scared people, but the complaints were actually more that the BBC had made them feel like mugs. ""People felt the BBC was something they could trust, and the programme had destroyed that trust."" In its wake, a tide of anger rose against the BBC, which received thousands of complaints. The Ghostwatch team were together as the programme aired, unaware of the reaction building around the country Meanwhile, in the days that followed the broadcast, the Denhams noticed a change in Martin. The radiators in their house had a habit of being noisy when warming up and Martin suddenly asked to move bedrooms, though he never explained why. ""He seemed entranced with the talk of ghosts,"" Mrs Denham remembers. ""He seemed a bit upset because things were happening at that time in the house that had been happening [on Ghostwatch]. The pipes were banging,"" his stepfather adds. Five days after the broadcast, Martin killed himself. A note in his pocket, addressed to his mother, read: ""If there is ghosts I will now be one and I will always be with you as one"". The Denhams learned of his death when police came to their places of work. ""I went crackers,"" Mr Denham says. ""I started swearing. When I heard about the [contents of] the note, I knew it was that programme."" Martin Denham had everything to live for, his parents say A judicial review the Denhams fought for led to an investigation by the Broadcasting Standards Commission, which concluded the corporation had ""a duty to do more than simply hint at the deception it was practising on the audience"". There had been a ""deliberate attempt to cultivate a sense of menace"", it added, and the BBC issued an apology. The passage of time has seen the Denhams's anger cool a little, although they do not watch BBC channels, or anything that features Michael Parkinson. ""There's nothing you can do. I've just let it go now, but it's still there,"" Martin's stepfather adds. ""It's still just one big mystery and he isn't here so I'm not able to ask him,""  Mrs Denham says. ""Martin was happy. He had never had any problems - he had got a girlfriend and a job and had got everything to live for. ""Even though he was a slow learner he had done well for himself. He had everything going for him and then it changed just like that."" Ghostwatch was heavily promoted in the run-up to its broadcast Volk declined to comment on Martin's death out of respect for the family. But he says he had expected a very different reaction from viewers. ""I think it was 11 million that saw it and you can't think of all those people as individuals,"" he says. ""I was, I guess, writing for myself - aged between 12 and 14 - and I thought of myself watching and thinking, 'well this is interesting, I don't believe it, but I get that this is a drama done in a certain way'. ""That's the basis on which I thought most people would [see] it. ""There was a vast span of different reactions to it, from people who didn't believe it for a second and people who believed it all the way through, and everything in between."" Stephen Volk was awarded a BAFTA for his work in horror The aftermath meant the BBC distanced itself from Ghostwatch. Volk says he would have liked to have explained his intentions as a writer with the broadcaster far sooner than the anniversary DVD a decade later allowed. ""I think if the BBC had maybe not shut it down so completely, there might have been an attempt to have a conversation about it,"" he says. However, when 12-year-old viewers who saw it the first time revisited it 10 years later - in conjunction with the emergence of the internet - people openly started to discuss the programme. ""Suddenly we found a whole pile of people who did like it, they enjoyed it, thought it was challenging and all the things we wanted it to be,"" Volk says. He remains proud of Ghostwatch, the first project he did for television. Volk went on to write an episode of Ghosts for the BBC in 1995, created ITV series Afterlife starring Andrew Lincoln and Lesley Sharp, and was also behind the 2011 film The Awakening. ""The best result [was] people coming up and saying 'I had to sleep with the light on for three weeks but it got me into film-making' and some have said 'it got me into horror',"" he says. However, he tends to agree with acclaimed author Ramsay Campbell on pushing the genre's boundaries. ""I'm a great believer in what he said about horror, and that is that horror is sometimes the business that goes too far.""

Inventor admits dismembering Kim Wall,"Kim Wall went missing after boarding Peter Madsen's submarine The Danish inventor Peter Madsen has admitted dismembering the body of Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard his submarine, but denies killing her. Danish police said in a statement that he also admitted dumping her body parts in the sea. He told police she had died in August from carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine, while he was up on deck. Mr Madsen had previously denied cutting up her body and said she died when a heavy submarine hatch fell on her head. Divers found bags containing her head, legs and clothing in Koge Bay, just south of Copenhagen, earlier this month. Police said they had been weighed down with pieces of metal. âExceptionalâ journalist remembered Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? What we know about Kim Wall case Ms Wall's torso was found on 21 August. A post-mortem examination revealed knife wounds to her genitals and ribcage, which were believed to have been caused ""around or shortly after her death"". Police said on Monday they were extending the charges against Mr Madsen - which already include murder and mutilating Ms Wall's body - to include sexual assault without intercourse.  The inventor denies the charges against him. Ms Wall, 30, was last seen alive on the evening of 10 August as she departed with Mr Madsen on his self-built 40-tonne submarine, UC3 Nautilus, for a story she was writing about his venture. Her boyfriend raised the alarm the next day when she did not return from the trip. Initially, Mr Madsen said he had dropped her off safely in Copenhagen, but the 46-year-old later changed his story to say there had been a ""terrible accident"", that he had ""buried her at sea"" and planned afterwards to take his own life by sinking his submarine. Peter Madsen denies the murder and sexual assault charges Danish Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told a courtearlier this monththat footage of women being decapitated alive had been found on a hard drive believed to belong to Mr Madsen. Mr Madsen said the hard drive was not his. The inventor was supposed to appear in court on Tuesday but will now remain in custody until 15 November.

Sacked Catalan leader 'in Belgium',"Mr Puigdemont has left Catalonia but his portrait was still hanging in government buildings on Monday Sacked Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has gone to Belgium, a lawyer he has hired there says. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert, said he had not gone into hiding and did not confirm whether he would seek asylum. Spain's chief prosecutor has called for rebellion charges to be brought against him and other organisers of Catalonia's banned independence referendum. The Spanish central government took direct control of Catalonia on Monday, replacing sacked officials. It suspended the region's autonomy and called for fresh elections after Mr Puigdemont and his government declared independence last week. On Tuesday, Spain's Guardia Civil - a paramilitary force charged with police duties - raided the offices of the Catalan police force. According to media reports, they searched eight offices for communications relating to the referendum on 1 October. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, has already been accused of failing to help Guardia Civil officers tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters during the run up to the banned vote. Mr Bekaert said Mr Puigdemont was now in the Belgian capital, Brussels. ""He has full rights to be here, there is nothing against him at this moment,"" he told Flemish public radio. Asked whether the Catalan leader was planning to seek asylum in Belgium he added: ""We're keeping all options open - nothing has been decided."" This video can not be played Catalonia's human towers are said to represent the spirit of its people - when they stick together they can achieve big things Theo Francken, Belgium's immigration minister, said over the weekend that an asylum application was ""not unrealistic"" but Prime Minister Charles Michel later said it was ""absolutely not on the agenda"". Mr Francken, a member of the separatist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party, said last week that Catalan ministers could apply for political asylum in Belgium, adding that he had doubts over whether Mr Puigdemont and others would get a fair trial in Spain. Political commentators in Belgium have suggested that Mr Francken's earlier comments could be seen as an invitation to former Catalan members of parliament to seek asylum in the country. On Monday Spanish media reported that Mr Puigdemont had met Flemish politicians in Brussels. The TV stationLa Sexta reported (in Spanish) that he was there with five of his sacked government's ministers,external: Meritxell Serret, agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, health minister Dolors Bassa, labour minister Meritxell BorrÃ¡s, governance minister Joaquim Forn, interior minister Spain's Attorney General JosÃ© Manuel Maza called for rebellion, sedition and misuse of funds charges to be brought against Catalan leaders. If found guilty of rebellion, Mr Puigdemont could face a jail term of up to 30 years. Under the Spanish legal system, Mr Maza's requests will be considered by a judge. The working day on Monday passed off peacefully, despite some Catalan officials defying instructions from Madrid not to turn up. Any ministers who arrived at their offices were given hours to leave under threat of ""action"" by Catalonia's regional police force, Mossos. Madrid's temporary move to impose direct control by invoking Article 155 of the constitution - a first for Spain - will see as many as 150 of the region's top officials replaced. Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Mr Puigdemont and his vice-president Oriol Junqueras reject the central government's moves, arguing that they can only be removed from office by the citizens of Catalonia. Madrid has called for fresh regional elections on 21 December. A spokeswoman for Mr Puigdemont's PDeCAT party said it would field candidates ""with conviction"". The ex-president could run in new elections if he has not been jailed by then, according to Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence On Monday, Mr Dastis said he hoped the forthcoming elections would help to ""restore legal governance and rule of law in Catalonia"". Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. On Friday the regional parliament declared independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader. Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid. This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean Does Catalonia want to leave Spain?

'Maximum number of dogs' rule criticised,"Tracy Flowers says professional dog walkers are being penalised A decision to limit the number of dogs that can be walked by one person in part of Lancashire will ""massively"" affect business, a dog walker has said. South Ribble Borough Council has decided to reduce the maximum number allowed under one person's control in the borough's parks from six to four. The council said this will reduce dog fouling and increase public safety. But dog walker Tracy Flowers, of Leyland, said it means she is being ""penalised for others' behaviour"". The decision means anyone seen walking more than four dogs at any one time, or not carrying a waste disposal bag, can be fined Â£100. Conservative councillor Graham Walton, cabinet member for neighbourhoods, said: ""We thought it was far safer for children on parks and open spaces and also the senior members of our community that if you have four dogs or more you're more likely to lose control of these animals. ""One of the biggest problems we've had over the years is dog fouling and it's one of the major complaints that we have so we are trying to address this."" Ms Flowers said: ""I agree there's a terrible problem with dog fouling but this isn't going to solve it. ""You get your old gentleman walking to the shop for his paper, he's got his Labrador in tow, he's the one that lets the dog foul. In his day they didn't clear up dog mess and they're the ones leaving it. I see it daily. ""When we're out we even clear up everyone else's mess because we don't want to be blamed for it. So it's us dog walkers that are being penalised for other people's behaviour. ""It will affect my livelihood because I don't have the time to walk as many."" Since the decision was approved an online petition opposing the move has attracted 1,700 signatures. A scrutiny committee meeting is due to be held on 6 November to examine the decision.

MPs reveal sexual harassment complaints,"This video can not be played Chi Onwurah: Male and female researchers left 'uncomfortable' in Westminster bar MPs have been speaking out about sexual harassment in the corridors of Westminster - including one claim that bad behaviour at a parliamentary bar was dismissed as typical ""pub"" talk. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom vowed to stamp out ""sleazy, sexist or homophobic banter"", as shefaced MPs in light of allegations of sexual harassmentin Parliament. One of those to speak out, Labour's Chi Onwurah, said some male and female researchers had been made to feel ""deeply uncomfortable"" by MPs while at a parliamentary bar, the Sports and Social club - but her complaint was ignored. The Labour MP said: ""When I complained recently to an officer of Parliament who had some responsibility in this area... I was told that happens in pubs all over the country."" Ms Leadsom gave her ""absolute assurance"" that people going to restaurants and bars in Westminster should feel safe. ""There should be no place here on the estate or in our constituency offices where people can be abused or allegations not taken seriously,"" she said. This video can not be played Liz Saville Roberts says she was told ""distrust is endemic"" among staff of MPs Liz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said she had been told by one employee of an MP that authorities failed to act when she reported an assault claim - leaving the woman ""deeply disappointed and distrustful"". ""She reported being sexually assaulted to the proper authorities earlier this year, who did nothing,"" she said, adding: ""She tells me that distrust is endemic."" Ms Saville Roberts asked: ""How can I assure her that her complaint will now be treated differently?"" For her part, Ms Leadsom said she would be willing to take the complaint up herself. One MP already being investigated for inappropriate behaviour is international trade minister, Mark Garnier, who reportedlyasked his secretary to buy sex toys and called her ""sugar tits"". Conservative MP Matthew Offord said he was recently sent a text message that accused a current MP of being ""utterly foul"" towards a woman - but he did not reveal the name of the sender or the politician. Mr Offord said the sender had described the incident as a ""problem he saw in this place"". He quoted the text as saying the MP was ""utterly foul and I'm sure it's a pattern of behaviour on his part - but in this instance I don't think it'd be fair on the woman in question to name him."" He added that the sender asked him to ""do the best you can"" to widen the investigation from sexual harassment claims to also address complaints about bullying and treating staff like ""dirt"". Monday's question-and-answer Commons session took place in response to anurgent question,externalon plans to tackle sexual harassment in Parliament, brought by Labour MP Harriet Harman. Ms Leadsom's statement prompted ""wittering about a witch hunt"", according to Labour's Jess Phillips. She told the chamber: ""As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament."" This video can not be played The PM is ""too weak"" to tackle abuse allegations amongst her own ministers, says Labour's Lucy Powell Conservative Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, confirmed that some people had expressed ""anguish"" that the allegations could ""unfairly tarnish"" innocent MPs. He insisted that Parliament was not a ""den of inequity"".

Tackling the 'boys' club' of political cartoons,"Why do the UK's national newspapers' full-time cartoonists never seem to be women? Out of nearly 180 cartoons featured in last year's edition of Britain's Best Political Cartoons not one was drawn by a woman. It was flicking through a copy of the book that first highlighted the gender imbalance in the industry for Ella Bucknall, an illustrator currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts in London. This realisation prompted her to start Whip, a magazine of political cartoons by women, to give them a platform that didn't exist elsewhere. ""Particularly at the moment when there are so many aspects of politics affecting women's lives, from Trump to the DUP, we need to be able to have our own voice. We need to be able to argue back,"" she said. The ""boys' club"" is a common complaint of women working as cartoonists. Nicola Jennings, whose work has been published in the Guardian, said: ""Political cartoons are a sort of running joke between the boys. I wonder whether men find it too difficult to be lampooned by a woman? ""Men lampooning each other is like an in-joke and they're just slapping each other on the back, whereas if it's a woman it's seen as much stronger criticism."" The editorial cartoons of the national newspapers remain a distinctly male affair. Tim Benson, editor of Britain's Best Political Cartoons, defended his selection as simply a reflection of the state of the industry. ""My criteria is that the cartoon has to be published in a national newspaper. There are lots of female cartoonists who publish their work online or draw for the Morning Star but they are unpaid,"" he said, ""If you want to be able to call yourself a political cartoonist you have to be able to earn your living as one. I can only pick cartoons from what is available. ""My view is that anyone with the perseverance and the skills will rise to the top, whatever their gender is. Personally I don't think there's a woman out there at the moment who can compete with the very best. ""I've got Nicola Jennings in this year's book but only because she's been published in national newspapers. I would love to have more work by female cartoonists but I'm not going to include them in my book if I don't think they're good enough. I never decide on gender lines. As far as my book is concerned there is absolutely no gender bias at all."" To find female political cartoonists at the moment, it is necessary to look beyond the national newspapers. Nicola Streeten, an illustrator and comics scholar, has researched the history of British feminist cartoons and comics from the 1970s. What she found was that outside the national media there were a host of women drawing political cartoons, from the Suffragettes to 1960s feminist magazine Spare Rib. She is currently co-editing a collection of 250 years of female cartoonists in Britain, The Inking Woman, following an exhibition of the same name at the Cartoon Museum. ""The more we looked the more women we found. You just have to take the trouble to look. Some people are against having a women's-only publication or exhibition but at the moment there just aren't the platforms for women,"" she said. There are only six full-time political cartoonists working for national newspapers. As far as we can tell there has never been a woman among them and most of the men have held their positions for years. ""There was a tradition of editorial cartoonists having a job for life. Those jobs were already taken by men 50 years ago so there haven't been any open doors for women,"" explained Martha Richler, otherwise known as Marf, one of the few women to have worked as a political cartoonist on Fleet Street, for London's Evening Standard. Ms Richler, who was made redundant from the Standard in 2008 after the recession hit, said: ""As budgets were cut, cartoonists were considered a luxury. But the story's not over if you look online."" She admits she misses her salary but prefers the freedom of working online. ""There were times at the Standard when I wasn't allowed to do a darker cartoon. Online I have total freedom and there are no prejudices about what women can draw. We can self-publish. There are amazing opportunities if only we can crack the problem of monetising it."" Ms Richler also said she faced sexism in Fleet Street. In 2004 the Daily Telegraph claimed her jokes were ""regularly rewritten by backbench executives"". The paper later published an apology. Ms Richler said the attack suggested there was an assumption women simply couldn't be good political cartoonists. So how do things look now? Emma Allen was recently appointed as the New Yorker's cartoon editor. The work of Ms Jennings and Kate Evans has been featured in the Guardian. Political blog The Canary has recently launched an all-female political cartoonist collective. And the second issue of Whip is due to be published next month. ""We're hoping to keep expanding. I hope editors will pay attention to what we are doing,"" Miss Bucknall said. ""The ultimate aim is that there will no longer be a Whip, because women are given a mainstream platform. The only reason we exist is because at the moment there isn't one.""

The black missionaries of Colwyn Bay,"The Reverend Hughes with Nkansa (left) and Kinkasa (right); an illustration of the Institute in its heyday As Wales has been observing Black History Month, the near-forgotten story of the African Training Institute in Colwyn Bay, known locally as the Congo House, has received renewed interest. Black History Month is an annual celebration of identity that started in America in the early 1900s and has since spread across the world. A series of events across the country marked the 10th anniversary of the celebration in Wales, commemorating often overlooked culture and history. The story of the Congo House is tragic and inspiring in equal measure. The Reverend William Hughes preached in the Congo from 1882 until poor health forced him to return to Wales in 1885. He brought with him two students: Kinkasa and Nkansa, the Congo Boys. He and his new companions toured Welsh chapels, giving lectures in different languages, raising funds and selling photos. In 1887 Mr Hughes, his wife and his African colleagues settled in Colwyn Bay, where he would establish the Training Institute three years later. The idea of the institute was novel - rather than training white missionaries to preach in Africa, where they would have no immunity to disease or personal connections with locals, the most promising African students would be sent to Britain. There they would be trained in a variety of useful skills, such as law or medicine, so that when they returned they could support their communities themselves. By 1903 more than 20 students from nations like Cameroon, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the United States were training at the institute; by the time it closed more than 100 would have passed through its halls. ""Unlike other missionaries, he did not want to turn Africa into 'Little England',"" explained academic Marian Gwyn. ""He cherished what was different about the people he met in the Congo because he felt that his own Welsh language, culture and traditions had been undervalued by the English back in Britain. ""He wanted black people to have the same advantages as whites, and what many in Europe at that time saw as a lack of ability in Africans, he saw as merely a lack of opportunity. ""He wrote of the black people he met: 'They are like our brethren, of the same blood, the same humour, the same in everything, excepting in education and training'. And he decided to give them those things."" One student, Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu, studied in Colwyn Bay before earning degrees from University College London and Birmingham. DDT Jabavu would later return to Africa, where he set up the South African Native College at Fort Hare in the Cape Province. It was there he would teach a young Nelson Mandela. The future South African leader acknowledged Davison Jabavu as one of his most important mentors who helped shape his attitudes on equality. Dr Lapado Oluwole, Nigeria's first Medical Officer for Health (left); Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu (with his father John Tengo Jabavu), who set up Fort Hare College (right) After a scandal in 1911 involving a Welsh girl bearing the child of one of the students, public opinion turned on the Reverend and his institute, spearheaded by the populist magazine John Bull and editor Horatio Bottomley. Mr Hughes attempted to sue for libel in 1912, but financial issues led to the case being thrown out and the Reverend declared bankrupt. The institute closed and its students scattered. Mr Hughes died in a workhouse in 1924, and was buried in Old Colwyn Cemetery alongside members of his family and those students who had died before him - including his first companions Kinkasa and Nkansa. Kinkasa had died at the age of 13 of ""Congo Sleeping Sickness"" in 1888, not long after arriving in Colwyn Bay. Nkansa survived longer, learning Welsh and English, as well as the New Testament in its entirety. Though he wanted to return to Africa, Nkansa would also die young in Wales, succumbing to heart failure in 1892 at the age of 16. Marian Gwyn said the importance of Mr Hughes and his African Institute ""cannot be overestimated"". She added: ""He showed how people of different backgrounds and skin colour can learn from each other, share skills and appreciate difference. ""We live in a world that is rapidly changing and attitudes to those who we see as different are hardening. ""His vision on how people can live together - by recognising and respecting difference and by helping to improve the lives of those with fewer advantages - is one that we sorely need in our time now. ""He was truly a remarkable man.""

Is your phone listening in? Your stories,"Facebook has always denied using smartphone microphones to gather audio from people's real-life conversations and then use that data to serve advertising. Last week Facebook's vice-president of ads, Rob Goldman, said on Twitter that the technology giant did not and had never carried out the practice. ""Just not true,""he tweeted in response to a call for people's storiesof occasions when they believed it had happened. Given the amount of online advertising that people see every day, there is a strong argument that it is pure coincidence - that perhaps the advert has been served before unobserved and is only now noticeable because of an unrelated discussion. However, there are those who are convinced that they have experienced it. Here are some of the stories you told us. ""My fiancee and I both had wedding ads the day after we got engaged, before we had told anyone,"" said Nate, from Springfield, in the US. ""We bought the ring in the spur of the moment and never looked anything related up. ""And even two weeks ago my fiancee and I went to a friend's and drank a certain kind of liquor neither of us had ever bought or talked about on the phone, and the next morning it was the first ad Facebook showed her."" ""In 2016, I lost the hearing in my right ear. I was given a 'made for iPhone' compatible hearing aid,"" said Jon, in the US. ""This meant I could take calls, stream music, et cetera from my new hearing aid. ""Whenever the phone connected to the hearing aid, there would be an audible change, like a little click, because it would be switching from streaming the world around me to audio from the hearing aid. ""This worked in reverse too, with a microphone. ""In both the Facebook Messenger app for iOS and the main Facebook app, I would hear that click, the flipping over of the audio source for my hearing aid, at inexplicable times, including when I had audio from apps disabled."" ""Just last week I left my employment and was sat with my friend having a chat about which direction I was going to go in,"" said Lindsey, in Lincoln. ""I said, 'I like coffee, I might just end up at Starbucks so I can drink more coffee.' ""Next time I checked my Facebook on my phone, [I saw] a Starbucks advert as they were holding an open event in London to find new staff."" ""I recently had an extremely bizarre and unsettling experience with some targeted advertising that felt like more than coincidence, after a voice call on WhatsApp,"" said Olivia, from Austin. ""I was catching up with a friend who lives in London and she told me a story about how her new landlord purchased an outdoor storage shed for their bins (a product that I think is rather uniquely British). ""We had a good laugh about that, and I expressed how I needed something similar here in Texas. ""The next day as I was scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed I came across an ad from Wayfair advertising a storage shed for outdoor bins and was immediately taken aback. ""Before our conversation happened, this was not a product that I even knew existed."" ""Debated this at a bar with some friends... to test it and settle the debate, we got a random product type from another table: a new mattress,"" said Justin, in Atlanta. ""As I had not bought, searched for, or even thought about a new bed in several years and I couldn't remember seeing a mattress ad online ever, we started talking about beds and mattresses and guessing keywords, like slipping 'California king' and 'buy a mattress online' into the conversation, while intermittently scrolling facebook. ""Two mattress ads in five minutes. None before that conversation."" ""I work in the mobile industry and I've noticed this happening more and more over the last few years,"" wrote Michael, from Grimsby. ""To put it to the test I started learning Spanish on Duolingo, and within one day I had adverts for normal products in Spanish! It was absolutely unbelievable."" ""I visited a friend who was setting up security cameras at her house,"" Melissa, from Australia, wrote. ""I have never used the internet to look at anything remotely linked to home security, yet less than an hour after discussing how to set up the cameras, I had a Facebook ad for home security cameras. ""My phone had been in my pocket the whole time."" ""Once, my friend was over and he discussed that he needed Lasik eye surgery,"" said Austin, from Tigard, Oregon. ""Immediately after, I went on Facebook and a Lasik advertisement appeared. ""I have perfect eyesight, have never searched Lasik ever before."" ""I saw a product at school called the Bug-a-salt salt shooting gun, used for killing flies,"" said Peter, ""something I'd never seen before, nor have I searched for any related products. ""That night I was telling my wife about the product in a personal conversation. ""The following morning after the conversation with my wife about the product, my Facebook opened with an ad from Amazon with the Bug-a-salt fly killer gun listed as 'things you may be interested in'."" ""I have experienced several instances of ads that relate to a conversation that I was having or had just finished,"" said Faris, from Cairo. ""I was talking to my wife about a second child, and on that day there were ads related to the topic. ""We talked about a friend's brother who had passed away, and immediately one of the guys we were talking to found ads for undertakers.

Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas?,"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

Multiple deaths in serious house fire,"This video can not be played Aerial footage of the house shows the devastation caused by the blaze A father and several of his children are feared to have died in a fire at a remote farmhouse in Powys. Three children, aged 10, 12 and 13, escaped the blaze near Llangammarch Wells just after midnight on Monday and are being treated in hospital. One of the people unaccounted for has been named locally as David Cuthbertson who is believed to be in his sixties. Police confirmed people were missing and some had died in the fire, adding the cause of the blaze was unexplained. The fire gutted the entire building Local Conservative MP Chris Davies said: ""I am absolutely devastated at today's news that there was an overnight fire in Llangammarch Wells, which has claimed the lives of a father and his young children. ""As a father to two young girls, this news has shocked me to the core. My thoughts are with the family and local community at this terrible time."" Ron Birchall, 73, who lives at the former Aberceiros Inn in the village, described Mr Cuthbertson as ""a great guy"". He added: ""All I can say is that he was a great father who loved his kids and doted on them. ""I used to see him walking around the village or in his vehicle. We saw the kids coming to pick up the bus to school."" A joint police and fire service statement said the children who escaped had non life-threatening injuries. It continued: ""Due to the severity of damage at the scene we are unable at this stage to identify any of the deceased or confirm numbers. ""Specialist scientists and fire investigators are still assessing the scene prior to further investigation."" Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said its crews were faced with an ""extremely difficult situation"" at the scene and firefighters did all they could to handle the situation. A spokesman added: ""Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and the residents of Llangammarch Wells following this tragic incident."" A number of emergency vehicles remain at the scene Ch Insp Martin Slevin, of Dyfed-Powys Police, told a press conference the investigation into the fire and the recovery of the victims' bodies would be difficult. He described the scene as ""chaotic"" with ""significant"" damage to the structure of the building, but said officers would work to provide answers about the cause of the blaze. Powys councillor Tim Van-Rees, who represents the Llanwrtyd Wells area and who knew the family who lived at the property, described the incident as ""devastating"". He said: ""It is absolutely shocking and a devastating blow and it is possibly just as well we are in half-term at the moment because the effect on our children and the schools would have been very severe. ""I have spoken to the owner of the property who was alerted and telephoned the fire brigade and I must say as a member of the fire authority the local fire brigade were outstanding."" He said firefighters ""risked life and limb"" to see whether anything could be done but ""unfortunately their efforts were not well rewarded"". He added: ""Speaking on behalf of the community our thoughts and prayers will all those affected. The community will come together and do all it can for the surviving children and relations."" Several fire crews attended the blaze at the rural home in Llangammarch Wells Brecon and Radnorshire AM Kirsty Williamstweeted:,external""Tragic, devastating news for the community.

Many women worldwide have shared accounts of sexual harassment using the Twitter hashtag#MeToo,external. In France the equivalent is#balancetonporc,external, meaning ""expose your pig"". Ms Ayari had previously published an account of an alleged assault in a book, without naming the man.

Row over German train called Anne Frank,"DB's ICE high-speed trains The German rail operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) has defended its decision to name a high-speed train after the world-famous Holocaust victim Anne Frank. Anne Frank's name is among those of 25 famous Germans chosen by a jury after a public consultation. A German conservative MP, Iris Eberl,tweeted,externalthat it was a ""tasteless"" choice, as Anne Frank and other Jews had been sent by train to their deaths. But DB spokesperson Antje Neubauer said the girl was a symbol of tolerance. Anne Frank also represented ""peaceful co-existence of different cultures, which is more important than ever in times such as this"", she said. The Diary of Anne Frank is a global bestseller, describing the Jewish girl's life in hiding with her family in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam in World War Two. The Frank family were deported to Auschwitz death camp in 1944, and Anne died later in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of 15. Anne Frank's diary to be read at games The world's most-read diary in pictures The Holocaust year by year DB is state-owned and the successor of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which deported millions of Jews and other victims of the Nazis. Julian Reichelt, a journalist at the popular German daily Bild, tweeted: ""Now DB is naming trains after victims of deportation by train, starting with Anne Frank."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour MP 'sexually harassed' as activist,"This video can not be played Cat Smith: 'I had to push him away and run' All political parties have a ""responsibility"" to deal with sexual harassment, a shadow minister has said, following her own experiences as a young activist. Labour MP Cat Smith said she had to push away and run when a councillor attempted to kiss her after a party. She was speaking to theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Ms Smith also called for a procedure to be put in place for Westminster interns who experience sexual harassment. Ms Smith, who is the shadow deputy leader of the Commons and shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, said the incident took place many years and involved a senior Labour councillor with ""a bit of a reputation"". ""As I was leaving, he chose to leave the party at the same time as me under the guise of wanting to walk me to the nearest station so I got home safely,"" she said. ""I insisted that I was absolutely fine walking on my own and didn't feel the need to be accompanied but he insisted and did try and hold my hand on that walk. ""I resisted and didn't let him, but then once we got to the station he delved in for a kiss that definitely wasn't invited and I pushed him away and basically ran away from him."" Ministers to set out MPs' harassment action Abusive MPs 'must be held to account' Ms Smith said that, along with other female colleagues, she reported the incident and the man was ""dealt with"". ""We did manage to go through our party's procedures and as far as I'm aware he no longer behaves like that,"" she said. Asked about Theresa May's proposals for a mediation service to be set up for all MPs, regardless of their party, Ms Smith said more needed to be done. ""I think every political party has a responsibility to deal with sexual harassment in their own parties. There needs to be a space for MPs' staff and also for interns and work experience as well. ""When you don't have that formal employer-employee relationship there needs to be something in place for them and maybe there is a space there for the House of Commons to have a process in place which could be led by the speaker. ""But it cannot just be that. It needs to be for parties as well, in situations like the one I've just mentioned where I was a party activist."" Ms Smith said the comments made by Labour MP Jared O'Mara were ""totally indefensible"" and ""not welcome in our politics"". She insisted Jeremy Corbyn had a ""zero tolerance approach"" to sexual harassment in Westminster and ""takes these issues very seriously"".

Cancer myths a nurse plans to debunk,"A cancer charity has appointed a digital nurse to combat ""fake news"" online, which they say leaves patients ""scared and at risk of bogus cures"". Macmillan Cancer Support found two-fifths of people with cancer looked up information about their diagnosis on the internet. One in eight of those went online because they didn't fully understand what their doctor had told them. Glaswegian nurse Ellen McPake, who landed the job, says she wants to correct the misinformation that exists. She said: ""Once the doctor says 'cancer', people automatically then shut down and they don't take in the information that they're given. ""So they go home, speak to the family. And then they'll sit online that night and get themselves in a frenzy with what they're reading."" She says people focus on the worst-case scenario: ""There's quite a lot of myths out there,"" she said. Here are some of them: ""Some people think that drinking it or taking it intravenously can cure cancer. There isn't any evidence to support that,"" she said. Working on Macmillan's support line, Ellen said people would report trying it because it seemed less harsh than chemotherapy or radiotherapy. ""For some people it can be quite dangerous - it affects their kidneys and makes them feel quite unwell,"" she said. Some people mistakenly believe that sugar can give you cancer Ellen said some patients misguidedly think sugar causes cancer. Whileobesity has been linked to cancer,consumption of sugar itself does not increase risk. Medical practice the Mayo Clinicwrites:,external""Sugar doesn't make cancer grow faster. All cells, including cancer cells, depend on blood sugar (glucose) for energy. But giving more sugar to cancer cells doesn't speed their growth."" Ellen has seen patients try to eradicate sugar based on false beliefs. ""There's no way you can take sugar out of your diet completely,"" she said. Ellen said: ""I had a call once where a couple had been to a clinic and paid lots of money to be treated with vitamin C, which they were told could cure cancer."" The trips abroad to the clinic cost them their life savings and provided no benefit. ""The man was so upset. He wished he'd used whatever savings they had for a better quality of life. And that decision is with them forever,"" she said. Ellen said there is a belief that only the elderly get cancer ""because it's more common as they get older"". In fact,half of all cancer cases in the UK each year are diagnosed in people aged 70 or over.,externalThis is because over time our body's cells become damaged and this damage can build up and result in cancer. But in recent decades, it is young people who are having thegreatest increase in being affected.,external A great nurse shark was found to have skin cancer in 2010 Ellen said patients think that sharks don't get cancer and therefore their cartilage could be used to fight or cure it. This myth datesback to the 1970s,,externalwhen researchers in Florida exposed them to high levels of a carcinogen and then found no evidence of tumours. But, in a number of studies,there has been no evidence found,externalthat it works as a treatment - not even inmice.,external And in 2010, it was found that sharks could in fact develop cancer aftera female nurse shark in Indianapolis Zoo was found to have a melanoma.,external Ellen said: ""Coffee enemas were popular for a while. Sites were coming up advertising that they could do something to the make-up of the bowel and that would cure cancer."" In fact,Cancer Research UK writes:,external""Coffee enemas have been linked to serious infections, dehydration, constipation, colitis (inflammation of the colon), and dangerous electrolyte imbalances or even death."" Ellen said the myth led many people to travel long distances to special clinics ""being charged lots and lots of money"". ""There is the idea that it's a man-made modern disease,"" says Ellen. ""But it isn't - it's been found in Egyptian mummies."" One of these, from 2,250 years ago,,externalwas found with prostate cancer, while anancient 1.7 million-year-old toe,externalfrom South Africa was found to have an aggressive type of bone cancer.

Ex-Trump aide charged with US tax fraud,"This video can not be played Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort (left) arrives at FBI offices Donald Trump's former presidential campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The 12 charges brought against Mr Manafort and one of his business associates, Rick Gates, include conspiracy to launder money. They stem from an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. It has emerged that another adviser to Mr Trump admitted this month to lying about his links to Russia. George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Manafort and Mr Gates,externaldo not relate to Mr Trump's campaign but to the alleged concealment of payments from the pair's Ukrainian business dealings up to 2016. Live updates on this story Who's who in the Russian drama? Manafort's short reign on the Trump campaign An investigation headed by special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both sides deny any collusion. Responding to news of the charges, Mr Trump tweeted to point out that they did not concern his campaign and asked why ""the focus"" was not on alleged wrongdoing involving Mrs Clinton instead.

Rick Gates (second from left) and Paul Manafort (second from right) on stage with the Trumps on 21 July 2016 For years Paul Manafort operated on the fringes of power, a once-influential Washington player who worked with some less-than-savoury international characters because his services were no longer in high demand domestically, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher writes from Washington. Then, like many other politicos in Donald Trump's orbit, he was thrust into the spotlight because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart's presidential campaign. Mr Manafort got his big break but it may end up breaking him. That resulting spotlight has drawn attention to Mr Manafort's past dealings and raised questions about his actions while in at the top of the Trump campaign. The good news for Mr Trump is these charges stem from Mr Manafort's past business dealings, not his campaign efforts. He is being accused of working for years for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians and laundering millions in subsequent payments. It certainly makes Mr Trump's decision to cut Mr Manafort loose last August after details emerged of his Ukrainian ties seem a wise one. The good news has its limits, however. Mr Manafort will be under growing pressure to co-operate with the Mueller investigation. If he offers up useful information about his time during the campaign, this could be just the first domino to fall. The indictment looks at their links to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine between 2006 and 2015. It says they acted as ""unregistered agents"" of Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych and his party, both in opposition and government. Mr Yanukovych was deposed as president in 2014 amid mass unrest over his pro-Russian policies. Mr Manafort is accused of having laundered more than $18m (Â£14m) through offshore bank accounts, using it to buy property, goods and services in transactions concealed from the US authorities. He is said to have ""used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle"" in America. Altogether, at least $75m in payments from Ukraine flowed through the accounts, the indictment says. Mr Manafort and his lawyer arrived at an FBI office in Washington on Monday. Mr Gates is accused of having transferred more than $3m from the offshore accounts to other accounts he controlled. He has been ordered to surrender to authorities, according to US media reports. No immediate comment from lawyers for Mr Manafort and Mr Gates was reported after the charges were revealed. Mr Manafort, 68, has worked on several Republican presidential campaigns, beginning with Gerald Ford's in 1976. He resigned as chairman of the Trump campaign in August 2016 after being accused over his dealings with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. He denies any wrongdoing. US intelligence agencies believe the Russian government sought to help Mr Trump win the election. The justice department statement on Mr Trump's former foreign policy adviser,externalhas the potential to damage the US leader because it relates directly to his election campaign. When Mr  Papadopoulos was interviewed by the FBI this January, he told them that his interactions with the foreign professor, who is said to have ""substantial connections to Russian government officials"", had taken place before he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016. But according to the US justice department, his meetings with the professor actually took place after he became an adviser to Mr Trump. The professor only took interest in him because of his new status within the Trump campaign, it is alleged. Mr Papadopoulos admitted having sought to arrange a meeting ""between the Campaign and Russian government officials"". The alleged Russian ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton took the form of ""thousands of emails"". No further details were given. On Friday, Mr Trump accused Mrs Clinton of links with Moscow. Republican lawmakers have alleged that a uranium deal with a Russian company in 2010, when Mrs Clinton was secretary of state, was sealed in exchange for donations to her husband's charity. A Congressional investigation has been opened into the case. Democrats say it is an attempt to divert attention from the alleged ties between Russia and Mr Trump.

Spacey apology over 'sexual advance',"Kevin Spacey (L) said he was ""horrified to hear the story"" raised by Anthony Rapp Hollywood star Kevin Spacey has made an apology after being accused of making a sexual advance toward a child actor. Anthony Rapp, who was 14, said Spacey invited him to a party and seemed drunk when the alleged incident happened. Spacey, who was 26, said: ""I honestly do not remember the encounter... but if I did behave then as he describes I owe him the sincerest apology."" Spacey also revealed he was now living as a gay man after years of refusing to address rumours about his sexuality. The US broadcaster, Netflix, said it was ending its popular political drama, House of Cards, which stars Spacey, after the forthcoming sixth season. Netflix said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the allegations, but added that the decision to cancel the critically-acclaimed series had been made months ago. Rapp said he was sharing the story now after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The movie mogul has been accused by more than 50 womenof a range of allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment. Mr Weinstein has denied any claims of non-consensual sex. The accusations have sparked a debate about inappropriate behaviour in the entertainment industry and beyond, and encouraged more people to share their experiences. Allow Twitter content?

His final tweet said ""everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article, and I have no further comment about it at this time"". In his interview with BuzzFeed News,,externalthe 46-year-old Star Trek: Discovery actor said he was sitting on the edge of a bed after the party - held in Spacey's apartment in 1986 - when Oscar-winning Spacey, now 58, came into the bedroom. ""He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don't, like, squirm away initially, because I'm like, 'What's going on?' And then he lays down on top of me,"" Rapp said. ""He was trying to seduce me... I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually."" Rapp said he was able to go to the bathroom before he left. At the time of the alleged incident, Rapp was winning plaudits for his role in the Broadway production of the play Precious Sons. He has since appeared in numerous other theatre, television and film productions. Responding to the allegation, Spacey said he was ""sorry for the feelings [Rapp] describes having carried with him all these years"". Allow Twitter content?

Parachute wife 'sent bump-me-off text',"Winchester Crown Court was shown a police interview with Victoria Cilliers conducted shortly after her fall The wife of an Army sergeant accused of tampering with her parachute told police she asked her husband ""did you try to bump me off?"", a court heard. Victoria Cilliers also told officers the skydive in which she suffered multiple injuries in a 4,000ft fall in April 2015 would be her last. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies attempting to murder his former Army officer wife, Appearing at Winchester Crown Court, he also denies damaging a gas valve, recklessly endangering life. The jury was shown a number of police interviews, during one of which Mrs Cilliers, 40, said she sent the ""tongue in cheek"" remark in a text message to her husband, following the gas leak at their home. In a later interview, Mrs Cilliers told officers she had been angry after discovering her husband was having an affair. She said the ""red mist came down"" and she ""was gunning for [her husband] in the interview"" and wanted to paint a ""bad picture"" of him in her testimony. However, when asked by a detective if anything she had said was untrue, she said: ""I don't think I lied"". Mrs Cilliers also said that before her near-fatal fall at Netheravon Airfield, in Wiltshire, the parachute jump ""probably was going to be my last jump"". The Army fitness instructor told detectives going back to skydiving after becoming a mother was a ""mental battle"" and she had ""lost confidence"". Mr Cilliers also faces a second attempted murder and a third charge of tampering with a gas fitting at the couple's home Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and removed two slinks - which attach lines to the harness from a reserve chute - the day before her jump. During the police interviews, Mrs Cilliers added she ""could not categorically say"" the main parachute was malfunctioning. She said she agreed with others when they suggested the reason the main parachute failed was as a result of the lines being twisted during packing, because she was ""embarrassed"". ""I was quite embarrassed to admit I potentially cut away a reasonable parachute, but I just completely lost confidence,"" she told the interviewing officers. Mrs Cilliers was questioned in court by the prosecution over evidence she gave to police in one interview shortly after the parachute jump. She said she found it ""odd"" her husband had taken her hire parachute kit into the toilet at the airfield the day before, but admitted giving police differing accounts of his actions because she wanted ""revenge"" and to ""cast suspicion"" on him after discovering his affair. She told officers he had been with the parachute for ""five-10 minutes"", and told the court: ""I expanded on a truth but I knew potentially that was a key point that was going to get him into some hot water. ""At that point, I wanted him to suffer."" Mrs Cilliers only just survived the fall during which she suffered broken vertebrae, ribs and pelvis. Mr Cilliers denies two counts of attempted murder and one of criminal damage recklessly endangering life. The trial continues. Parachute wife 'shouldn't have survived' Wife 'blacked out' as parachute failed Parachute case accused 'despised by wife' Parachute trial accused 'caused gas leak' Parachute sabotage accused 'texted lover' Parachute 'sabotage' possible in minutes Accused husband 'skilled parachute packer' Reserve parachute 'had never failed' Parachute 'not tampered with in toilet' Parachute sabotage trial jury visits site Parachute murder bid accused 'unemotional' Jury shown 'tangled parachute' pictures Parachute fail wife 'among UK's best' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Man sought by police after convenience store incident Fire breaks out at secondary school Secondary school confirms it will be closed after fire Photographs show snow fall in New Forest amid yellow weather warning The Cotswolds named as one of best places to live in country New chairman takes on role at charity after day out with Bobby Van At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Spain calls for Catalan rebellion charges,"Catalan police guarded the regional government as Catalonia returned to work on Monday Spain's chief prosecutor has called for charges including rebellion - which carries a maximum 30 year jail term - to be brought against Catalan leaders. JosÃ© Manuel Maza said they should also face sedition charges following the region's declaration of independence. It comes as Spain takes direct control of Catalonia, replacing top officials. Meanwhile, a lawyer in Belgium says he is representing sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who has travelled to the Belgian capital Brussels. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert, did not comment on speculation that the ex-president could be preparing an asylum application. ""At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him,"" he said. ""I'm his lawyer in case he needs me."" Spanish media reported that Mr Puigdemont would meet Flemish leaders,external. He is said to be travelling with a handful of dismissed ministers. Spanish authorities sacked Mr Puigdemont as regional leader on Friday, and suspended Catalan autonomy. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? JosÃ© Manuel Maza said Catalan ministers should also be charged with misuse of funds Speaking at a news conference earlier, Mr Maza, the Spanish attorney-general, called for Catalonia's leaders to be charged with misuse of funds over the independence referendum they held in October, after it had been declared illegal by the constitutional court. Under the Spanish legal system, Mr Maza's requests will be considered by a judge. There appeared to be no major disruption in Catalan government offices on Monday, despite some officials defying instructions from Madrid not to turn up for work. Any ministers who arrived at their offices were given hours to leave under threat of ""action"" by Catalonia's regional police force, Mossos. Madrid's temporary move to impose direct control by invoking Article 155 of the constitution - a first for Spain - will see as many as 150 of the region's top officials replaced. Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Mr Puigdemont and his vice-president Oriol Junqueras reject the central government's moves, arguing they can only be removed from office by the citizens of Catalonia. Madrid has called for fresh regional elections on 21 December. A spokeswoman for Mr Puigdemont's PDeCAT party said it would field candidates ""with conviction"". The ex-president could run in new elections if he has not been jailed by then, according to Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence On Monday, Mr Dastis said he hoped the forthcoming elections would help to ""restore legal governance and rule of law in Catalonia"". Meanwhile, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has written to all police officers in Catalonia asking for their loyalty as a ""new era"" begins in the region The centre-left and unionist Madrid-basedEl PaÃ­ssays that Sunday's huge pro-union protest in Barcelona ""has shown in this difficult moment that Catalan society is much more plural than what the pro-independence block strives to show"" The pro-union Barcelona-basedEl PeriÃ³dicosays the protest was the ""start of the election campaign"". It adds that ""the new regional elections should serve to move Catalonia out of its current impasse"" The pro-independence Catalan languageArasuggests in an editorial that it would be an ""error"" for the pro-independence parties not to contest the 21 December elections The moderate Barcelona-basedLa Vanguardiafocuses on the importance of ""reconstruction"" and how to overcome the divisions in Catalan society. ""All sides will inevitably discover that there is no political problem that cannot be resolved by dialogue"" it says Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the constitutional court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. On Friday the regional parliament declared independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader. Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid. This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean Does Catalonia want to leave Spain?

'I'm scared of my own autistic child',"This video can not be played Ian Goldsworthy says bars across the windows have made his son's bedroom ""look like a cell"" Parents struggling to cope with their violent autistic children are not being properly supported by local authorities, the National Autistic Society says. For some, a violent outburst can be a daily occurrence. ""I'm scared of him. You live on a knife edge. You don't know what's coming next,"" Lucy Goldsworthy told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She has previously been left with a split lip and bruising following her son Elliot's violent outbursts, while her husband Ian has been left with a scratched cornea. Twelve-year-old Elliot has autism and learning difficulties which, in his case, means he is unable to speak. His condition requires round-the-clock care and he does not understand the effects of his actions. Ian and Lucy say their son became violent and aggressive from the age of five. At his current age, he is becoming increasingly difficult to control. ""If it was a toddler, having a huge tantrum, scratching and kicking you, you can manage it better,"" Lucy says. ""Whereas when Elliot does it, it's like a small man suddenly attacking you. Elliot's bedroom has bars across the window for his safety ""He's still only violent 5% of the time - but the consequences of that violence are getting worse and worse."" Ian and Lucy have had to put bars across the window in Elliot's bedroom and locks on the door to help keep him - and their other children - safe. ""You kind of get used to your child's bedroom looking like a cell of some kind,"" Ian says. Elliot attends a special school, but the couple say they do not get enough specialist support from their local council. ""You have to get to the point where one of you is hospitalised or you've had to call the police out [for help to arrive],"" they say. For its part, the family's local authority, Hertfordshire County Council, says it does provide a range of care support and is deciding if more help is needed. ""Sam"" says she asked for help on a number of occasions One woman who wished to remain anonymous, ""Sam"", says she ""cried and cried"" for help from her local authority to look after her teenage son. She had hoped that one incident, which required her to have a head wound glued after he became violent, would act as a ""turning point"". ""At first I got a bit of help,"" she says, before claiming that the council later tried to ""wash their hands"" of her - providing her with 48 hours' worth of support a year. Assessment of the problems that may provoke challenging behaviour A care plan outlining steps needed to manage it Help to increase structure and minimise unpredictability If all else fails, anti-psychotic medication can be considered Information from NICEGuidelines for health and social care professionals,external One 2011 study,external, of nearly 1,400 children with autism in the US, found more than half were aggressive or violent towards their families or carers. Tim Nicholls, from the National Autistic Society, believes parents and families need more support ""to help them avoid or de-escalate challenging behaviour"". ""Some examples of this would be helping them with positive behavioural strategies or respite for the young person,"" he adds. Tim Nicholls says support systems must identify the needs of autistic children Mr Nicholls is calling on local authorities and NHS England to improve the care they provide. ""If children are not having their needs met, then they are being failed,"" he says. ""We need a special educational needs and disabilities system that identifies all the needs of autistic children, then puts in place the support and the services to allow them to live the life that they and their families want to live."" Nineteen-year-old Cameron is one of 700,000 people in the UK on the autism spectrum. He was diagnosed at the age of three. ""Sometimes you don't know how Cameron's going to react and it is very scary,"" says his father, Doug Clements. ""The [other] children have to lock themselves in the room because they are so scared."" At the moment, Cameron goes to a specialist centre each day. However, life at home has become very difficult, and his parents are currently looking for a residential care home for him, run by the local authority for children and vulnerable adults, close to their own home in Surrey. ""It's horrible, because I love him so much,"" says Hannah Clements of her son Cameron His mother, Hannah, says the family can no longer manage Cameron's behaviour. ""It's really upsetting, because I love him so much,"" she says. ""I don't want people to be scared of him, because his nature is gentle. ""I feel sorry for him because he's frustrated, and he can't tell me why or other people why."" Hannah says in the last six years, they have had ""no direction at all"" from support services, but Surrey County Council said it continued to offer respite care and day support to the family. NHS England says it has ""set out a clear programme"" for those with learning difficulties and autism to ""enable more people to live in the community, with the right support, and close to home"". However, the Local Government Association says that while ""councils are working hard to make sure children with autism and other special needs get access to the support they need... they have been put in an impossible situation due to increasing demand and historic underfunding"". Elliot Goldsworthy's parents believe their need for support will only become greater as their son gets older. ""We've definitely had moments when we've gone to bed sobbing, and despairing at how this is our life,"" says Ian. ""But you can't wallow in it too long, because you've got exactly the same life the next day.""

Jack Reacher creator shares thriller secrets,"Lee Child is writing his 23rd Jack Reacher thriller In a New York apartment offering spectacular views of Central Park, Lee Child, author of the Jack Reacher novels, stares out at a brick wall. The positioning of his writing room is a typically disciplined move from the Birmingham-raised author, who in the 1990s faced up to redundancy from Granada TV by writing a novel. Twenty-three years on from Killing Floor - the first Jack Reacher story - his thrillers are a publishing phenomenon, dominating the fiction charts, sparking film adaptations starring Tom Cruise, and enthralling millions of fans. For the BBC World ServiceIn the Studioseries, Child allowed access to his writing room to record the first three days' work on his next novel - which he revealed will be titled Yesterday and will fill in some of the intriguing gaps surrounding Reacher's father. Tom Cruise starred in the 2016 movie version of Never Go Back while No Middle Name was a collection of mainly Reacher novellas Child's latest novel will begin differently from his previous releases. The all-important first paragraphs, he says, will depart from his famously clipped style. He says he will let the words breathe with a longer than usual introductory sentence marking the end of summer, the migration of birds and a list of States charting Reacher's planned diagonal journey across America. Then a five-word hook - ""He didn't get very far"" - drags the reader back into his dangerous world. The novel will be the 23rd Reacher adventure, after the release of The Midnight Line in November 2017. ""Someone like me is never going to win the Nobel prizeâ¦ this is not admired literature, this is entertainment,"" says Child. ""A novel has a huge number of competitors now - the internet, video games, streaming movies. ""I'm trying to visualise a 25-year-old person somewhere in the world. ""They have a lot of choices and the book has to earn its place. You've got to suck them into that story."" Lee Child keeps some crucial reference books to hand Child's willingness to expose a work in progress is rare among authors. When asked why he's prepared to take questions from a radio journalist while he's concentrating on writing, his answer suggests that, as one of the world's best-selling authors, he feels a little like an ambassador for the popular. ""People who do literary fiction well, I know some of them. They are delightful, smart people with absolutely no issues at all about what I'm doing,"" he says. ""It tends to be the kind of third-rate people or some of the second-rate critics that get all sniffy about it. This is a way of saying: 'Yeah - shut up.'"" By day two, Child has reworked his opening paragraph enough to provide a launch pad for the rest of the novel. There will be a contemplative tone, he says. But despite the paternal theme he resists the suggestion he's been influenced by the death of his own father in 2016. Child aims to write around 1,500 words every day during a writing phase With his opening paragraph locked, he now begins a free-wheeling descent into the plot, which could seem a terrifying way to work for novelists who are used to story charts and planned character arcs. With little idea where his story is heading, Child says he feels like a movie stuntman on the ledge of a tall building. ""What I have to do is fall off, and I'm hoping that the movie crew is going to manoeuvre the safety airbag into position at the side of the landing just in time. ""I hope to land softly, but I cannot guarantee that right now."" Fittingly for the creator of no-nonsense ex-military cop Reacher, Child is keen to suggest that while he wants to defend his genre, he does not want to sound pretentious. He has an audience, and he wants to give them as fun a ride as possible. As a writer of thrillers, he may never be embraced by some literary critics. But he believes well-crafted popular fiction serves a profound purpose, rooted in our earliest history. ""At some point we began telling stories about things that had not happened,"" he explains. ""This made people feel emboldened or empowered and just a little bit more self-confident, which would help them survive. ""You are shown the edge of the cliff, but you're told you don't have to fall off."" In the Studio with Lee Child can be heard on the BBC World Service at 11:30 GMT on 31 October.

Spain calls for Catalonia rebellion case,"Catalan police guarded the regional government as Catalonia returned to work on Monday Spain's chief prosecutor has called for charges including rebellion - which carries a maximum 30 year jail term - to be brought against Catalan leaders. JosÃ© Manuel Maza said they should also face sedition charges following the region's declaration of independence. It comes as Spain takes direct control of Catalonia, replacing top officials. Meanwhile, a lawyer in Belgium says he is representing sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who has travelled to the Belgian capital Brussels. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert, did not comment on speculation that the ex-president could be preparing an asylum application. ""At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him,"" he said. ""I'm his lawyer in case he needs me."" Spanish media reported that Mr Puigdemont would meet Flemish leaders,external. He is said to be travelling with a handful of dismissed ministers. Spanish authorities sacked Mr Puigdemont as regional leader on Friday, and suspended Catalan autonomy. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? JosÃ© Manuel Maza said Catalan ministers should also be charged with misuse of funds Speaking at a news conference earlier, Mr Maza, the Spanish attorney-general, called for Catalonia's leaders to be charged with misuse of funds over the independence referendum they held in October, after it had been declared illegal by the constitutional court. Under the Spanish legal system, Mr Maza's requests will be considered by a judge. There appeared to be no major disruption in Catalan government offices on Monday, despite some officials defying instructions from Madrid not to turn up for work. Any ministers who arrived at their offices were given hours to leave under threat of ""action"" by Catalonia's regional police force, Mossos. Madrid's temporary move to impose direct control by invoking Article 155 of the constitution - a first for Spain - will see as many as 150 of the region's top officials replaced. Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Mr Puigdemont and his vice-president Oriol Junqueras reject the central government's moves, arguing they can only be removed from office by the citizens of Catalonia. Madrid has called for fresh regional elections on 21 December. A spokeswoman for Mr Puigdemont's PDeCAT party said it would field candidates ""with conviction"". The ex-president could run in new elections if he has not been jailed by then, according to Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence On Monday, Mr Dastis said he hoped the forthcoming elections would help to ""restore legal governance and rule of law in Catalonia"". Meanwhile, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has written to all police officers in Catalonia asking for their loyalty as a ""new era"" begins in the region The centre-left and unionist Madrid-basedEl PaÃ­ssays that Sunday's huge pro-union protest in Barcelona ""has shown in this difficult moment that Catalan society is much more plural than what the pro-independence block strives to show"" The pro-union Barcelona-basedEl PeriÃ³dicosays the protest was the ""start of the election campaign"".

""All sides will inevitably discover that there is no political problem that cannot be resolved by dialogue"" it says Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the constitutional court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. On Friday the regional parliament declared independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader.

The lottery-winner who used her win to do good,"Rachel Lapierre set up Le Book Humanitaire after winning the lottery What would you do if you won the lottery? Buy a new house, a sports car, or travel the world perhaps? But how many of us would use our winnings to set up a charity? That is exactly what Rachel Lapierre, a former Miss Quebec, did back in 2013. The Canadian always loved volunteering, and after running her own modelling agency and working as a nurse, she was looking for a way to follow her idol, Mother Teresa, and dedicate her life to charity. Then fate came knocking when she won a lifetime salary of C$1,000 (Â£605) a week in the Quebecois lottery ""Gagnant Ã  vie"", or ""winner for life"". Ms Lapierre meets a family of Congolese refugees living in Quebec ""At first I couldn't believe it, but I didn't celebrate or shout it from the rooftop because I had made a promise to the universe and I was determined to keep it. ""I wanted to do something I loved for the rest of my life. I wanted to help others,"" she says. It took Ms Lapierre only two months to quit her nursing job and launch her own charity, Le Book Humanitaire. Her non-profit organisation, which is located in Saint-Jerome, about 60km north west of Montreal, uses social media to connect those in need with people who can help. Ms Lapierre became Miss Quebec in 1982 On its Facebook page, which has 22,000 followers, those who are struggling can let the community know about their plight. At the same time, members of the public can advertise services or goods they want to donate. ""Let's say that you have clothes to give away. We will put you in contact with a family that needs those clothes and will allow you to go give them yourself,"" Ms Lapierre explains. ""It's not only about material things. You might end up driving a cancer patient to a doctor's appointment."" It's a far cry from Ms Lapierre's former career in the more glamorous, and some might argue consumerist, world of modelling. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music The 'working class boy' who built a Â£1bn business 'I quit Google and launched a business with my mum' The man who built a drinks empire... twice In the early 1980s she joined a local modelling school where she was encouraged to enter the Miss Quebec beauty pageant. To her surprise, the then-21-year-old won the contest. ""I thought modelling was for tall blondes with blue eyes and I was short and brunette... But I am so glad I entered, it was a great experience."" The following year she toured Canada as Miss Quebec and even got to meet Rene Levesque, the then-premier of Quebec. Ms Lapierre meets with a family of Syrian refugees in Saint-Jerome It inspired her to set up her own modelling school in 1984, to teach young women how to build careers in the industry. It had about 10 staff. ""Running my own business taught me about accounting and how to manage employees,"" Ms Lapierre says. She closed the business in the late 1980s to focus on bringing up her four children, but also dedicated herself to voluntary work - making numerous trips with humanitarian organisations to places like India and Haiti. It was this passion that led her to set up Le Book Humanitaire four years ago. This year, the charity has made 15,000 ""direct actions"" in Quebec, ranging from furnishing an apartment for a family of Syrian refugees, to finding a home for a homeless mother who had just given birth. The charity donates food to those in need She has also funded the organisation - which has 10 full-time volunteers and its own board - entirely by herself, investing $70,000 to date. ""This weekly C$1,000 I get from the lottery allows me to not go to work anymore and finance my organisation,"" she says. ""I pay for things such as our office rent and other administrative costs."" There are limits to Ms Lapierre's budget, though. After she was interviewed by a popular Quebecois television station earlier this year, Le Book Humanitaire saw a huge increase in its Facebook followers, from around 4,000 to more than 20,000. It led to an influx of requests for help, as well as donations, and the charity has struggled to keep up. A volunteer, Ms Lapierre and her sister Guylaine discussing strategy at the charity's offices It needs to open several new facilities to store donated items, but Ms Lapierre can't afford to do this alone. ""We are counting on municipalities to lend us offices and make donations,"" she says. ""But there are always ways to make things work."" Jean-Pierre Tchang, the founder ofIRIS Mundial,external, a non-profit group that works to improve visual health in developing countries, says that building a successful charity is not easy. ""The main difficulty is money and getting funding,"" says Mr Tchang, who worked with Ms Lapierre earlier in her volunteering career. ""You also have to know your limits. You can start feeling overwhelmed by all the work and forget oneself... I am sure Rachel's nights must be very short."" Despite the challenges, Ms Lapierre shows no sign of slowing down. She is also taking a workshop class on managing non-profit organisations to get better at what she does. She continues to get joy from her work, which, she says ""is nothing like running a regular business"" and instead ""feeds her soul"". ""Volunteering work represents billions of unrecorded dollars across the world. Without it, the world would not function.""

Google 'drop everything' to fix burger emoji,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has tasked employees returning to work on Monday morning with one key objective: fix the burger emoji.

Amid the cheesy puns (sorrier) and breathless bewilderment, it was the meaty issue (sorry - not sorry) of cheese placement which sparked the most fervent debate. Allow Twitter content?

Record surge in atmospheric CO2 in 2016,"Emissions from human activities have levelled off but concentrations in the atmosphere continue to grow Concentrations of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere surged to a record high in 2016, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Last year's increase was 50% higher than the average of the past 10 years. Researchers say a combination of human activities and the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon drove CO2 to a level not seen in 800,000 years. Scientists say this risks making global temperature targets largely unattainable. This year's greenhouse gas bulletin produced by the WMO is based on measurements taken in 51 countries. Research stations dotted around the globe measure concentrations of warming gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The figures published by the WMO are what's left in the atmosphere after significant amounts are absorbed by the Earth's ""sinks"", which include the oceans and the biosphere. Climate change: a guide A brief history of Earth's CO2 Global Change Calculator 2016 saw average concentrations of CO2 hit 403.3 parts per million, up from 400ppm in 2015. ""It is the largest increase we have ever seen in the 30 years we have had this network,"" Dr Oksana Tarasova, chief of WMO's global atmosphere watch programme, told BBC News. ""The largest increase was in the previous El NiÃ±o, in 1997-1998, and it was 2.7ppm; and now it is 3.3ppm. It is also 50% higher than the average of the last 10 years."" El NiÃ±o impacts the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by causing droughts that limit the uptake of CO2 by plants and trees. Emissions fromhuman sources have slowed down in the last couple of yearsaccording to research, but according to Dr Tarasova, it is the cumulative total in the atmosphere that really matters as CO2 stays aloft and active for centuries. Over the past 70 years, says the report, the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is nearly 100 times larger than it was at the end of the last ice age. Rapidly increasing atmospheric levels of CO2 and other gases have the potential, according to the study, to ""initiate unpredictable changes in the climate system... leading to severe ecological and economic disruptions"". The British Antarctic Survey Halley base was one of the stations where atmospheric measurements were made The study notes that since 1990 there has been a 40% increase in total radiative forcing. That's the warming effect on our climate of all greenhouse gases. ""Geological-wise, it is like an injection of a huge amount of heat,"" said Dr Tarasova. ""The changes will not take 10,000 years, like they used to take before; they will happen fast. We don't have the knowledge of the system in this state; that is a bit worrisome!"" According to experts, the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, in the mid-Pliocene Epoch. The climate then was 2-3C warmer, and sea levels were 10-20m higher due to the melting of Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets. Other experts in the field of atmospheric research agreed that the WMO findings were a cause for concern. Droughts related to El NiÃ±o, such as this one in Colombia, limited the ability of plants and trees to soak up carbon ""The 3ppm CO2 growth rate in 2015 and 2016 is extreme - double the growth rate in the 1990-2000 decade,"" Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway University of London, UK, told BBC News. ""It is urgent that we follow the Paris agreement and switch rapidly away from fossil fuels. There are signs this is beginning to happen, but so far the air is not yet recording the change."" Another concern in the report is the continuing, mysterious rise of methane levels in the atmosphere, which were also larger than the average over the past 10 years. Prof Nisbet says there is a fear of a vicious cycle, where methane drives up temperatures which in turn releases more methane from natural sources. Scientists handling air samples at the Cape Grim monitoring station in Australia ""The rapid increase in methane since 2007, especially in 2014, 2015, and 2016, is different. This was not expected in the Paris agreement. Methane growth is strongest in the tropics and sub-tropics. The carbon isotopes in the methane show that growth is not being driven by fossil fuels. We do not understand why methane is rising. It may be a climate change feedback. It is very worrying."" The implications of these new atmospheric measurements for the targets agreed under the Paris climate pact are quite negative, say observers. ""The numbers don't lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed,"" said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. ""We have many of the solutions already to address this challenge. What we need now is global political will and a new sense of urgency."" The report has been issued just a week ahead of the next instalment of UN climate talks, in Bonn. Despite the declaration by President Trump that he intends to take the US out of the deal, negotiators meeting in Germany will be aiming to advance and clarify the rulebook of the Paris agreement.

Ex-Trump aide 'faces charges over Russia',"This video can not be played Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort (left) arrives at FBI offices Donald Trump's former presidential campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The 12 charges brought against Mr Manafort and one of his business associates, Rick Gates, include conspiracy to launder money. They stem from an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. It has emerged that another adviser to Mr Trump admitted this month to lying about his links to Russia. George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Manafort and Mr Gates,externaldo not relate to Mr Trump's campaign but to the alleged concealment of payments from the pair's Ukrainian business dealings up to 2016. Live updates on this story Who's who in the Russian drama? Manafort's short reign on the Trump campaign An investigation headed by special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both sides deny any collusion. Responding to news of the charges, Mr Trump tweeted to point out that they did not concern his campaign and asked why ""the focus"" was not on alleged wrongdoing involving Mrs Clinton instead.

Rick Gates (second from left) and Paul Manafort (second from right) on stage with the Trumps on 21 July 2016 For years Paul Manafort operated on the fringes of power, a once-influential Washington player who worked with some less-than-savoury international characters because his services were no longer in high demand domestically, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher writes from Washington. Then, like many other politicos in Donald Trump's orbit, he was thrust into the spotlight because more established hands wanted nothing to do with the upstart's presidential campaign. Mr Manafort got his big break but it may end up breaking him. That resulting spotlight has drawn attention to Mr Manafort's past dealings and raised questions about his actions while in at the top of the Trump campaign. The good news for Mr Trump is these charges stem from Mr Manafort's past business dealings, not his campaign efforts. He is being accused of working for years for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians and laundering millions in subsequent payments. It certainly makes Mr Trump's decision to cut Mr Manafort loose last August after details emerged of his Ukrainian ties seem a wise one. The good news has its limits, however. Mr Manafort will be under growing pressure to co-operate with the Mueller investigation. If he offers up useful information about his time during the campaign, this could be just the first domino to fall. The indictment looks at their links to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine between 2006 and 2015. It says they acted as ""unregistered agents"" of Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych and his party, both in opposition and government. Mr Yanukovych was deposed as president in 2014 amid mass unrest over his pro-Russian policies. Mr Manafort is accused of having laundered more than $18m (Â£14m) through offshore bank accounts, using it to buy property, goods and services in transactions concealed from the US authorities. He is said to have ""used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle"" in America. Altogether, at least $75m in payments from Ukraine flowed through the accounts, the indictment says. Mr Manafort and his lawyer arrived at an FBI office in Washington on Monday. Mr Gates is accused of having transferred more than $3m from the offshore accounts to other accounts he controlled. He has been ordered to surrender to authorities, according to US media reports. No immediate comment from lawyers for Mr Manafort and Mr Gates was reported after the charges were revealed. Mr Manafort, 68, has worked on several Republican presidential campaigns, beginning with Gerald Ford's in 1976. He resigned as chairman of the Trump campaign in August 2016 after being accused over his dealings with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. He denies any wrongdoing. US intelligence agencies believe the Russian government sought to help Mr Trump win the election. The justice department statement on Mr Trump's former foreign policy adviser,externalhas the potential to damage the US leader because it relates directly to his election campaign. When Mr  Papadopoulos was interviewed by the FBI this January, he told them that his interactions with the foreign professor, who is said to have ""substantial connections to Russian government officials"", had taken place before he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016. But according to the US justice department, his meetings with the professor actually took place after he became an adviser to Mr Trump. The professor only took interest in him because of his new status within the Trump campaign, it is alleged. Mr Papadopoulos admitted having sought to arrange a meeting ""between the Campaign and Russian government officials"". The alleged Russian ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton took the form of ""thousands of emails"". No further details were given. On Friday, Mr Trump accused Mrs Clinton of links with Moscow. Republican lawmakers have alleged that a uranium deal with a Russian company in 2010, when Mrs Clinton was secretary of state, was sealed in exchange for donations to her husband's charity. A Congressional investigation has been opened into the case. Democrats say it is an attempt to divert attention from the alleged ties between Russia and Mr Trump.

Gordon Brown reveals fight for eyesight,"Gordon Brown has revealed in a new memoir how he feared he might completely lose his eyesight during his third year in Downing Street. The then-prime minister, who has been blind in one eye since his teens, told how he tore a retina in the other eye. He did not tell colleagues and tried to carry on with his cabinet duties despite not being able to see properly. He also writes about his struggles with ""touchy-feely"" modern politics and what he got wrong, and right, as PM. ""When I woke up in Downing Street one Monday in September (2009), I knew something was very wrong. My vision was foggy,"" writes Mr Brown in My Life, Our Times. ""That morning, I was to visit the City Academy in Hackney to speak about our education reform agenda. I kept the engagement, doing all I could to disguise the fact that I could see very little - discarding the prepared notes and speaking extemporaneously. ""Straight afterwards, I was driven to the consulting room of a prominent surgeon at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London."" Gordon Brown visits the City Academy in Hackney in September 2009 Surgeons discovered the retina in his right eye was torn in two places. They eventually decided not to operate, writes Mr Brown, who had lost the sight in his left eye following a teenage rugby accident. ""I am grateful that the (right) retina has held to this day and I feel lucky beyond words,"" he writes. Downing Street released a statement at the time saying there had been ""no change"" in Mr Brown's eyesight and his visit to the hospital had been ""part of regular checks on his eyes and this check was also fine"". Mr Brown, who took over as prime minister from Tony Blair in June 2007, without a Labour leadership contest, also writes about his regret that he could not convince voters of the need for ""radical"" reforms in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Brown struggled to master social media during his time in power Referring to his decision to bail out the banks and co-ordinate international recovery efforts, he says: ""We won the battle - to escape recession. But we lost the war - to build something better. ""I fell short in communicating my ideas. I failed to rally the nation around the necessary fiscal stimulus and my plans for radical change. ""Banking should have been transformed, our international institutions refashioned, inequality radically reversed - and if we are to be properly equipped to face the next crisis this is still the agenda we must pursue."" Mr Brown, who lost power in the 2010 general election to a coalition government headed by Conservative leader David Cameron, also writes about his struggles with social media and personality politics. The Browns kept their sons out of the spotlight until their final day in Downing Street ""The modern version of 'connecting' seems to increasingly include a public display of emotion, with the latter - authentic or not - seen as evidence of a sincerity required for political success,"" he writes. ""In a far more touchy-feely era, our leaders speak of public issues in intensely personal ways and assume they can win votes simply by telling their electors that they 'feel their pain'. ""For me, being conspicuously demonstrative is uncomfortable."" He says he managed to keep his two sons out of the media spotlight and resisted pressure during his time in politics to ""cultivate an image that made the personal constantly public - reticence was the rule"". In pictures: Gordon Brown,external Profile: Gordon Brown,external He also uses the book - to be published next month - to take a swipe at social media, saying: ""During my time as an MP I never mastered the capacity to leave a good impression or sculpt my public image in 140 characters. ""Now no politician can succeed without mastering social media - and yet, in it, the prime minister becomes one among millions of voices competing to be heard."" He says he ""fully understands"" the need to ""lighten up to get a message across"" and accepts that ""in the second decade of the 21st Century, a sense of personal reserve can limit the appeal and rapport of a leader"". But he adds: ""Really, to my mind, what mattered was not what I said about myself, but simply what our government could do for our country.""

Sportsman sorry for topless woman photo,"Nathan Broad wears his premiership medallion after the AFL Grand Final An Australian rules football player has apologised for distributing an image of a topless woman without her consent. Nathan Broad, a player for the Richmond Tigers in the Australian Football League, admitted to sending the image, which then went viral. Police dropped an investigation into the incident at the woman's request. Richmond has suspended Broad for three games in next year's season. Broad, 24, said he took ""full responsibility"". ""I sent a very private picture without this young woman's consent,"" he said at a press conference in Melbourne on Monday. ""I am ashamed and I am embarrassed and I made a very bad drunken decision. Not only have I let down my family, my friends and the Richmond Football Club, but most of all I let down a young woman who I cared about... who I liked and respected."" The image showed the woman wearing a medallion Broad had received after Richmond won the AFL Grand Final last month. Broad read a prepared statement on Monday In a statement released by her lawyer, the woman said she had been ""shocked and extremely confused"" when she spotted the photo online. She had been told that the image was deleted. ""She approached the player and football club for help to getting it removed from the internet, but it soon became apparent that the image had gone 'viral',"" law firm Maurice Blackburn Lawyers said. Richmond president Peggy O'Neal said Broad's actions were ""completely unacceptable"". ""We are incredibly sorry for the distress Nathan's actions have caused the young woman, who deserved better,"" she said.

Spain moves to take control of Catalonia,"This video can not be played Barcelona rally demonstrator: 'I feel forgotten by Catalan government' Spain is set to put in place measures to take direct control of Catalonia in response to the region's declaration of independence last week. On Friday, Madrid stripped Catalonia of its autonomy and removed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont from office. The temporary move will see as many as 150 of the region's ministers replaced. Some have vowed to continue to work. Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan officials may face criminal charges, a move likely to lead to huge protests. Spain's central government is set to take control of Catalan institutions with Spanish officials expected to be put in place in the region's ministries on Monday. Madrid has called for the Spanish constitutional court to revoke Catalonia's unilateral vote for independence. Mr Puigdemont and his vice-president Oriol Junqueras say they do not accept the moves by Madrid, adding that they can only be removed from office by the citizens of Catalonia. If Mr Puigdemont and others refuse to step aside, they face possible arrest and prosecution on charges of rebellion - the maximum sentence for which is 30 years. Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? About 200,000 civil servants are due to arrive on Monday, but it is not clear how many will stay away or refuse to follow instructions. The former Catalan Sustainability Minister, Josep Rull, said he was continuing with his ""scheduled agenda"" andposted an image on Twitter,externalshowing him at his desk. ""I'm at the office carrying out the responsibilities that the people [of Catalonia] entrusted to us,"" he wrote. However, Madrid has given Catalan ministers hours to pack up their belongings and leave their offices or Catalonia's regional police force, known as Mossos, will ""act"". Catalan regional police (Mossos) guard the Catalan regional government headquarters Mossos, whose chief was dismissed last week, are deployed in Sant Jaume square, near the government palace in the centre of Barcelona. Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis has said he expects the officers to ""act professionally"". Spain's chief prosecutor has also been preparing criminal charges against any officials considered to have acted against Spanish law in declaring independence following a referendum deemed illegal under the Spanish constitution. Meanwhile, Madrid has called for fresh regional elections on 21 December. Mr Puigdemont could run in new elections, according to Mr Dastis, but only if the sacked Catalan leader has not been jailed. On Monday, Mr Dastis said he hoped the forthcoming elections would help to ""restore legal governance and rule of law in Catalonia"". ""We hope and believe that after these elections, Catalonia will again be the same society it was before: open and integrated,"" he said during a press briefing in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has written to all police officers in Catalonia asking for their loyalty as a ""new era"" begins in the region. Senior police officers have told the BBC that they have already complied with an order to remove framed photographs of Mr Puigdemont from police stations across the region.

Catalan leaders face rebellion charge,"Catalan police guarded the regional government as Catalonia returned to work on Monday Spain's chief prosecutor has called for charges including rebellion - which carries a maximum 30 year jail term - to be brought against Catalan leaders. JosÃ© Manuel Maza said they should also face sedition charges following the region's declaration of independence. It comes as Spain takes direct control of Catalonia, replacing top officials. Meanwhile, a lawyer in Belgium says he is representing sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who has travelled to the Belgian capital Brussels. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert, did not comment on speculation that the ex-president could be preparing an asylum application. ""At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him,"" he said. ""I'm his lawyer in case he needs me."" Spanish media reported that Mr Puigdemont would meet Flemish leaders,external. He is said to be travelling with a handful of dismissed ministers. Spanish authorities sacked Mr Puigdemont as regional leader on Friday, and suspended Catalan autonomy. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain?

Under the Spanish legal system, Mr Maza's requests will be considered by a judge. There appeared to be no major disruption in Catalan government offices on Monday, despite some officials defying instructions from Madrid not to turn up for work. Any ministers who arrived at their offices were given hours to leave under threat of ""action"" by Catalonia's regional police force, Mossos.

Does Trump have the power to go to war?,"US Army Sgt La David Johnson was killed in Niger US senators are asking cabinet secretaries about the campaign against extremist groups in Niger and other places - and whether a new law authorising the use of military force should be written. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis are speaking on Monday about the president authority to wage war - the first time this has been debated publicly. The hearing, convened by the foreign relations committee, will shine a spotlight on Mr Trump's efforts to combat extremist organisations in Niger. To add to the tension, the committee is chaired by Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who's been engaged in an intense social-media war with the president. Under scrutiny is the 2001 authorisation to use military force (AUMF), which was passed shortly after the 11 September 2001 al-Qaeda attacks. Here are some key questions: The president relies on this law to conduct life-or-death operations. As commander-in-chief, the president can send troops to battle. Yet the US Constitution says that only Congress can declare war for an extended time. White House officials found a workaround in the days after the al-Qaeda attacks, however. Lawmakers approved a resolution that gave President George W Bush authority to track down and destroy al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Members of congress approved a second resolution in 2002, allowing Bush to wage war against Iraq. In recent years, the authorisation began to seem limited. ""It said: 'Destroy al-Qaeda,'"" says Jens David Ohlin, a Cornell Law School professor. US soldiers return home after a seven-month tour of the western Pacific Ocean, the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa ""Well, that's not really applicable."" President Barack Obama maintained that the laws gave him the authority that he needed for the campaign against the Islamic State (IS) group, an organisation that didn't exist when the laws were written. Mr Trump has continued to carry out an aggressive campaign against the militants, whether in Niger or other countries. Obama and Trump, says Ohlin, have both ""shoehorned"" their military efforts into the antiquated authorisations. Most people pay little attention to the president's authorisations or the military campaigns themselves, though, until something happens. In October three staff sergeants, Bryan Black, Jeremiah Johnson and Dustin Wright, as well as Sgt La David Johnson, were killed in Niger. ""All of a sudden people are saying: 'What are we doing there?'"" says Carnegie Mellon's Melanie Marlowe, a scholar who writes about presidential power. Even senators were taken aback. ""I didn't know there was a thousand troops [in Niger],""said Lindsey Graham,external, a Republican from South Carolina, on NBC's Meet the Press. The US troops were training local forces in West Africa so they could fight extremist groups in a more efficient manner. How did US soldiers die in Niger? Did Trump need permission for strikes? Gen Joseph Dunford briefed reporters on the Niger mission two weeks after the fatal skirmish The senators and ordinary US citizens wanted to know why these men were fighting and dying in remote parts of Africa and how their efforts helped to promote the interests of the US. On Monday senators will discuss these questions with Tillerson and Mattis - and will also examine the president's authority to send US soldiers into villages in Niger and other countries around the world. Many people think so. In September Republican Senator Rand Paul tried to repeal the current authorisations. He said the laws allowed the president to engage in war ""anywhere, anytime, any place on the globe"". Most senators agree - in theory - that these resolutions should be modernised. They believe that a new law would help the president and ordinary citizens clarify their goals as a nation and determine what they hope to achieve through military action. Administration officials have said they'd support a new law. Jim Mattis has said he is in favour of a replacement law Mattis told members of congress earlier this year that a new law would help to create a united front against extremist groups. ""It'd be a statement of the American people's resolve,"" he said. But the senators disagree about what the new law should look like. Some want the law to impose a time limit for military operations as well as list the countries where they'd take place. Others think the law should clarify that the military campaign will be limited in scope, conducted without ground troops. The current authorisations are rife with problems, but they've remained in place. It seems unlikely that a new law will be written - at least not soon. Creating a new one means that the president, lawmakers and people across the country would all have to agree on how the US should wage war. It's a broad mandate - one that senators and cabinet secretaries will debate on Monday. Follow@Tara_Mc,external How did US soldiers die in Niger? Did Trump need permission for strikes?

"Scrap student loan interest, ministers urged","Scrapping interest on student loans and extending the time limit on paying it back could help to avoid a future debt crisis,a centre-right think tank says,external. The UK 2020 report said the measures would ""bring down costs"" for students and graduates. Changing payback time limits from 30 to 50 years could also save billions of pounds of taxpayers' money, it said. Ministers are reviewing the student finance system. They said sustainable university funding was a priority. The PM recentlyabandoned an increase in tuition fees due next year, announcing a review of the whole student finance system in England. Those graduating from university in summer 2017 left with an average debt of Â£50,000, according to estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. In a report submitted as part of the review, UK 2020 is proposing that interest on all student loans - typically 6% a year - should be scrapped. May: We 'listened' on student fees Universities accused of running 'cartel' 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees This would reduce unpaid student debt by an average of 10%, it said. Combining that with pushing back the current 30-year limit on debt repayment to retirement age would, the report says, increase the number of loans recovered from 25% at present to 80%, benefiting both graduates and taxpayers. If a graduate left university with a student debt of Â£50,000 and earned around Â£30,000, they would currently repay Â£67 a month. After 30 years, Â£75,000 would have been paid but interest rates mean the loan would still not have been repaid in full. Under the proposals, a student earning the same would pay Â£29 per month towards the debt. And after 50 years, the full Â£50,000 would have been repaid. Source: UK 2020 The report, co-authored by businessman and Leave.EU co-funder Richard Tice, says the current system threatens a student loan debt crisis in the mid-2020s. The proposal argues that loans repayable over 40-50 years would spare ""hundreds of billions of pounds"" of taxpayers money being written off. In the report's foreword, former education minister and the architect of tuition fees, Lord Adonis, welcomed the ""innovative contribution"" to ideas on student funding. He said: ""For too long, universities have had free rein to grab as much as they can from students, graduates and the taxpayer - with precious little regard for the value they provide."" A previous UK 2020 report, issued last month, accused universities of running a ""cartel"" and failing to offer enough two-year degrees that could cut graduate debt. A government spokesperson said: ""Sustainable university funding and student finance are a priority in delivering this government's objectives on higher education. ""As the PM made clear in her conference speech earlier this month, we are reviewing the system and will be setting out further steps to ensure it remains fair and effective in due course.""

Cricketer Chris Gayle wins defamation case,"Chris Gayle said the articles had damaged his reputation West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle has won a defamation case against an Australian publisher over articles that said he exposed himself to a female massage therapist. The claims by Fairfax Media were not true, a jury in Sydney ruled on Monday. Massage therapist Leanne Russell had told the hearing that Gayle exposed himself to her in Sydney in 2015. However, Gayle successfully argued the incident did not happen. It is unclear how much he will seek in damages. ""I am a good man. I am not guilty,"" Gayle told reporters outside Sydney's King Street court complex. ""I am glad the public actually get a chance to read into things and they can hear what actually transpired."" Fairfax Media said it would investigate whether to appeal, claiming that the jury had been ""misled in a way that prejudiced Fairfax"". ""It will cost the company a lot of money unless we can reverse it on appeal,"" said Peter Bartlett, a solicitor acting for the company. Chris Gayle with his lawyer outside court in Sydney During the six-day trial, Ms Russell said that Gayle had partially exposed himself to her in a dressing room, leaving her ""very upset"". She contacted Fairfax Media after being angered when Gayle told a journalist ""don't blush, baby"" in a television interview, the jury heard. Fellow cricketer Dwayne Smith, who was also in the dressing room, supported Gayle's version of events. Gayle's legal team argued that Fairfax journalists wanted to ""destroy"" the cricketer. The jury ruled the company was motivated by malice when the articles were published in the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and the Canberra Times. The court will consider damages on Tuesday. Gayle, 38, is among the world's highest-profile cricketers and in August became the first player to reach 10,000 Twenty20 runs.

Hammond's 'Budget spending dilemma',"Philip Hammond has said driving down the deficit remains 'the right way to go' The chancellor is between ""a rock and a hard place"" for his forthcoming Budget on 22 November,a think tank says,external. Philip Hammond may have to abandon his target for getting rid of the deficit if he wants to increase spending on public services, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. He is also facing a likely cut in the forecast for productivity growth, and uncertainty around Brexit, it said. The Treasury said it would continue to adopt a ""balanced approach"". Mr Hammond is to unveil his Budget on 22 November - the first since the general election. He has said he aims to eliminate the budget deficit - the difference between the government's everyday spending and the money it has coming in - by the middle of the next decade. Kamal Ahmed: Treasury's message remains 'living within our means' Earnings fall for first time in three years Chancellor told to freeze taxes in Budget He told the BBClast week: ""We've already moved the target for balancing the books out from 2020 to 2025, but continuing to drive down the deficit in a measured and sensible way over a period of years... has to be the right way to go."" But the IFS says Mr Hammond is also under ""increasingly intense"" political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a ""very tricky hand indeed"", it says. ""Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?"" said  IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. ""Public sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. ""Given all the current pressures and uncertainties, and the policy action that these might require, it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible."" The deficit is likely to increase significantly if the Office for Budget Responsibility cuts its prediction for productivity growth of 1.6% a year in the face of the sluggish performance of the UK economy. If the OBR reduces its forecast to 1%, the IFS said, the deficit would more than double to almost Â£36bn by 2021-22. The projected deficit could be as much as Â£70bn if the OBR decides that productivity growth is closer to the 0.4% recorded over the past seven years, it said. Even if the Budget includes some ""giveaways"", it was unlikely to mean an end to austerity, Mr Emmerson added. ""That's likely to continue, whatever the chancellor announces."" Carl Emmerson of the IFS says the Chancellor is in a 'very difficult position' The Treasury said it would continue its approach to ""repairing"" the public finances by ""dealing with our debts while also investing in our public services"". It had made good progress in reducing borrowing, but the national debt was still ""far too high"" at almost Â£65,000 per household, it said. Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, told the BBC Today programme that he believes there needs to be an increase in spending on the NHS and social care but it should be done through a tax rise and not by increasing borrowing. He said the public and the parliament might be willing to back a tax rise if it is specifically used to fund these areas. ""I think if we did that, that would command popular support because I think that people do recognise that the pressures in social care and in the health service are too great,"" he said. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the IFS analysis showed Tory economic policies had failed and that it was time for a change of direction. ""Instead of dragging millions of ordinary people through the endless misery of Tory spending cuts, the chancellor now needs to make a decisive break with past Tory failure and end austerity."" Mr Emmerson wrote the report, Autumn 2017 Budget: options for easing the squeeze, with IFS research economist Thomas Pope. It was funded by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Economic and Social Research Council. The IFS is an independent research institute,externalfounded in 1969 that aims to better inform public debate on economics. It releases a closely watched analysis of each Budget the following day.

'Parliament sex pest row' as PM vows to take action,"""MPs fear more sleaze claims will emerge"" isthe Guardian's,externalheadline after Theresa May's insistence yesterday that she'll take ""tough action"" to protect Westminster staff from harassment. Her move followed reports that two Tory MPs had admitted their behaviour was open to question. The political news website,Guido Fawkes,external, has published details of what it describes as a spreadsheet of complaints against 36 MPs - said to have been compiled by Tory aides. No names are revealed, but one MP is described as ""perpetually intoxicated and inappropriate with women."" Another is said to be ""handsy with women at parties"". The website says that many of the allegations are historical, but it believes the spreadsheet is going to ""send shockwaves"" through government and the Tory party. Claims of sexual harassment at the BBC lead theDaily Mirror,external. The paper says the corporation has launched an investigation into the behaviour of 5 Live sports presenter George Riley and another unnamed member of staff. Mr Riley has not commented and the BBC has not confirmed or denied the report. A BBC spokesman said: ""We can't comment on individuals but treat any allegations seriously and have processes in place for investigating them."" The paper goes on to say that BBC chiefs are ""braced for a flood"" of further claims after urging any victims of harassment to come forward. The Mirror's editorial says the BBC has a public duty to take a tough line and argues that in the past, scandals were ""hushed up or ignored"" with victims claiming they weren't believed or were ""actively shunned"".

The lottery-winner who chose to give it back,"Rachel Lapierre set up Le Book Humanitaire after winning the lottery What would you do if you won the lottery? Buy a new house, a sports car, or travel the world perhaps? But how many of us would use our winnings to set up a charity? That is exactly what Rachel Lapierre, a former Miss Quebec, did back in 2013. The Canadian always loved volunteering, and after running her own modelling agency and working as a nurse, she was looking for a way to follow her idol, Mother Teresa, and dedicate her life to charity. Then fate came knocking when she won a lifetime salary of C$1,000 (Â£605) a week in the Quebecois lottery ""Gagnant Ã  vie"", or ""winner for life"". Ms Lapierre meets a family of Congolese refugees living in Quebec ""At first I couldn't believe it, but I didn't celebrate or shout it from the rooftop because I had made a promise to the universe and I was determined to keep it. ""I wanted to do something I loved for the rest of my life. I wanted to help others,"" she says. It took Ms Lapierre only two months to quit her nursing job and launch her own charity, Le Book Humanitaire. Her non-profit organisation, which is located in Saint-Jerome, about 60km north west of Montreal, uses social media to connect those in need with people who can help. Ms Lapierre became Miss Quebec in 1982 On its Facebook page, which has 22,000 followers, those who are struggling can let the community know about their plight. At the same time, members of the public can advertise services or goods they want to donate. ""Let's say that you have clothes to give away. We will put you in contact with a family that needs those clothes and will allow you to go give them yourself,"" Ms Lapierre explains. ""It's not only about material things. You might end up driving a cancer patient to a doctor's appointment."" It's a far cry from Ms Lapierre's former career in the more glamorous, and some might argue consumerist, world of modelling. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music The 'working class boy' who built a Â£1bn business 'I quit Google and launched a business with my mum' The man who built a drinks empire... twice In the early 1980s she joined a local modelling school where she was encouraged to enter the Miss Quebec beauty pageant. To her surprise, the then-21-year-old won the contest. ""I thought modelling was for tall blondes with blue eyes and I was short and brunette... But I am so glad I entered, it was a great experience."" The following year she toured Canada as Miss Quebec and even got to meet Rene Levesque, the then-premier of Quebec. Ms Lapierre meets with a family of Syrian refugees in Saint-Jerome It inspired her to set up her own modelling school in 1984, to teach young women how to build careers in the industry. It had about 10 staff. ""Running my own business taught me about accounting and how to manage employees,"" Ms Lapierre says. She closed the business in the late 1980s to focus on bringing up her four children, but also dedicated herself to voluntary work - making numerous trips with humanitarian organisations to places like India and Haiti. It was this passion that led her to set up Le Book Humanitaire four years ago. This year, the charity has made 15,000 ""direct actions"" in Quebec, ranging from furnishing an apartment for a family of Syrian refugees, to finding a home for a homeless mother who had just given birth. The charity donates food to those in need She has also funded the organisation - which has 10 full-time volunteers and its own board - entirely by herself, investing $70,000 to date. ""This weekly C$1,000 I get from the lottery allows me to not go to work anymore and finance my organisation,"" she says. ""I pay for things such as our office rent and other administrative costs."" There are limits to Ms Lapierre's budget, though. After she was interviewed by a popular Quebecois television station earlier this year, Le Book Humanitaire saw a huge increase in its Facebook followers, from around 4,000 to more than 20,000. It led to an influx of requests for help, as well as donations, and the charity has struggled to keep up. A volunteer, Ms Lapierre and her sister Guylaine discussing strategy at the charity's offices It needs to open several new facilities to store donated items, but Ms Lapierre can't afford to do this alone. ""We are counting on municipalities to lend us offices and make donations,"" she says. ""But there are always ways to make things work."" Jean-Pierre Tchang, the founder ofIRIS Mundial,external, a non-profit group that works to improve visual health in developing countries, says that building a successful charity is not easy. ""The main difficulty is money and getting funding,"" says Mr Tchang, who worked with Ms Lapierre earlier in her volunteering career. ""You also have to know your limits. You can start feeling overwhelmed by all the work and forget oneself... I am sure Rachel's nights must be very short."" Despite the challenges, Ms Lapierre shows no sign of slowing down. She is also taking a workshop class on managing non-profit organisations to get better at what she does. She continues to get joy from her work, which, she says ""is nothing like running a regular business"" and instead ""feeds her soul"". ""Volunteering work represents billions of unrecorded dollars across the world. Without it, the world would not function.""

Kevin Spacey apology over 'sexual advance',"Kevin Spacey (L) said he was ""horrified to hear the story"" raised by Anthony Rapp Hollywood star Kevin Spacey has made an apology after being accused of making a sexual advance toward a child actor. Anthony Rapp, who was 14, said Spacey invited him to a party and seemed drunk when the alleged incident happened. Spacey, who was 26, said: ""I honestly do not remember the encounter... but if I did behave then as he describes I owe him the sincerest apology."" Spacey also revealed he was now living as a gay man after years of refusing to address rumours about his sexuality. The US broadcaster, Netflix, said it was ending its popular political drama, House of Cards, which stars Spacey, after the forthcoming sixth season. Netflix said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the allegations, but added that the decision to cancel the critically-acclaimed series had been made months ago. Rapp said he was sharing the story now after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The movie mogul has been accused by more than 50 womenof a range of allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment. Mr Weinstein has denied any claims of non-consensual sex. The accusations have sparked a debate about inappropriate behaviour in the entertainment industry and beyond, and encouraged more people to share their experiences. Allow Twitter content?

In his interview with BuzzFeed News,,externalthe 46-year-old Star Trek: Discovery actor said he was sitting on the edge of a bed after the party - held in Spacey's apartment in 1986 - when Oscar-winning Spacey, now 58, came into the bedroom. ""He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don't, like, squirm away initially, because I'm like, 'What's going on?' And then he lays down on top of me,"" Rapp said. ""He was trying to seduce me... I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually."" Rapp said he was able to go to the bathroom before he left. At the time of the alleged incident, Rapp was winning plaudits for his role in the Broadway production of the play Precious Sons. He has since appeared in numerous other theatre, television and film productions. Responding to the allegation, Spacey said he was ""sorry for the feelings [Rapp] describes having carried with him all these years"". Allow Twitter content?

The 'philosopher-kings' managing the managers,"Are the new ideas and approaches pioneered by management consultants worth their fees? The place: a textile plant near Mumbai, India. The time: 2008. The scene? Chaos. Rubbish is piled up outside the building - with almost as much inside. There are piles of flammable junk, and open chemical containers. The yarn is at least bundled up in white plastic bags, but the inventory is scattered around the plant in unmarked piles. Such shambolic conditions are typical in the Indian textile industry, and that presents an opportunity. A team of researchers from Stanford University and the World Bank is conducting a novel experiment. They're going to send in a team of management consultants to tidy up some of these companies - but not others. Then they'll track what happens to their profits as part of arigorous, randomised controlled trial,external. It will tell us conclusively whether the management consultants are worth their fees. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. That question has often been raised over the years. If managers often have bad reputations, what should we make of the people who tell managers how to manage? Picture a management consultant. What comes to mind? A young, sharp-suited graduate, earnestly gesturing to a bulleted PowerPoint presentation that reads something like ""holistically envisioneer client-centric deliverables""? Some management consultants are criticised for their reliance on business jargon Okay, I got that from an online random buzzword generator. But you get the idea. The industry battles a stereotype of charging exorbitant fees for advice that, on close inspection, turns out to be either meaningless or common sense. Managers who bring in consultants are often accused of being blinded by jargon, implicitly admitting their own incompetence, or seeking someone else to blame for unpopular decisions. Still, it's big business. The year after Stanford and the World Bank started their Indian study, the UK government alone spent well over $2bn (Â£1.5bn) on management consultants. Globally, consulting firms charge their clients a total of about $125bn (Â£94bn). Where did this strange industry begin? There's a noble way to frame its origins: economic change creates a new challenge, and visionary men of business provide a solution. In the late 19th century the US economy was expanding fast, and thanks to the railway and telegraph it was also becoming more of a national market and less a collection of local ones. Company owners began to realise that there were huge rewards to be had for companies that could bestride this new national stage. So began an unprecedented wave of mergers and consolidations. Heinz, which dates back to 1869, grew substantially at the beginning of the 20th century Companies swallowed each other up, creating giant household names: US Steel, General Electric, Heinz, AT&T. Some employed more than 100,000 people.  And that was the challenge: nobody had ever tried to manage such vast organisations before. Enter a young professor of accountancy by the name of James McKinsey. His breakthrough was a book published in 1922, with the not-entirely-thrilling title Budgetary Control. But for corporate America, Budgetary Control was revolutionary. Rather than using traditional historical accounts to provide a picture of how a business had been doing over the past year, McKinsey proposed drawing up accounts for an imaginary corporate future. These future accounts would set out a business's plans and goals, broken down department by department. And later, when the actual accounts were drawn up they could be compared to the plan, which could then be revised. McKinsey's method helped managers take control, setting out a vision for the future rather than simply reviewing the past. James McKinsey saw the potential of setting out a corporate vision of the future McKinsey was a big character - tall, and fond of chomping cigars, ignoring his doctor's advice. His ideas caught on with remarkable speed: by the mid-1930s he was hiring himself out at $500 (Â£380) a day - about $25,000 (Â£19,000) in today's money. And as his own time was limited, he took on employees. If he didn't like a report they wrote, he'd hurl it in the bin. ""I have to be diplomatic with our clients,"" he told them. ""But I don't have to be diplomatic with you bastards!"" Aged just 48, James McKinsey died of pneumonia. But under his lieutenant, Marvin Bower, McKinsey & Company thrived. Bower was a particular man. He insisted that employees wore a dark suit, a starched white shirt, and, until the 1960s, a hat. McKinsey & Co, he said, was not a business but a ""practice"". It didn't take on jobs, but ""engagements"". It was not a company, but a ""firm"". Eventually it simply became known as ""The Firm"". Duff McDonald wrote a history of The Firm, arguing that its advocacy of scientific approaches to management transformed the business world. It acquired a reputation as perhaps the world's most elite employer. The New Yorker once described McKinsey's young Ivy League hires parachuting into companies around the world as a ""Swat team of business philosopher-kings"". But hold on. Why don't company owners simply employ managers who've studied those scientific approaches themselves? There aren't many situations where you'd hire someone to do a job, and also hire expensive consultants to advise them how to do it. What accounts for why companies like McKinsey gained such a foothold in the economy? Part of the explanation is surprising: government regulation. The Glass-Steagall act of 1933 was a far-reaching piece of American financial legislation. The Glass-Steagall act - signed by Franklin Roosevelt in June 1933 - was meant to limit conflicts of interest Among many provisions, Glass-Steagall made it compulsory for investment banks to commission independent financial research into the deals they were brokering. Fearing conflicts of interest, Glass-Steagall forbade law firms, accountancy businesses and the banks themselves from conducting this work. Effectively, the act made it a legal requirement for banks to hire management consultants. In 1956 the Justice Department banned the emerging computer giant IBM from providing advice about how to install or use computers. Another business opportunity for the management consultants. How market research revolutionised advertising and shopping How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth How much wealth is hidden offshore? The great intellectual property trade-off Minimising conflicts of interest was a noble aim, but it hasn't always worked out well. Some time after McKinsey's long-serving boss, Rajat Gupta, left the firm, hemanaged to get himself convicted and imprisonedfor insider trading. McKinsey also employedEnron's Jeff Skilling,external, and then was paid for advising him, before quietly fading into the background while Enron collapsed and Skilling went to jail. Here's another argument for employing management consultants: ideas on management evolve all the time, so maybe it's worth getting outsiders in periodically for a burst of fresh thinking. But often it doesn't work like that: the consultants continually find new problems to justify their continued employment. Some use the analogy of leeches, attaching themselves and never letting go. It's a strategy known as ""land and expand"".  One UK government ministry recently admitted that 80% of its supposedly temporary consultants had been working there for more than a year - some for up to nine years. Needless to say, it would have been much cheaper to employ them as civil servants. No doubt the consultancy firms will claim that their expertise is giving the taxpayer value for money. Which brings us back to India, and that randomised controlled trial. Management consultants saw an opportunity in the often shambolic Indian textile industry The World Bank hired a global consulting firm to put some structure into these jumbled Mumbai textile factories, instituting preventive maintenance, proper records, systematic storing of spares and inventory, and the recording of quality defects. It worked. Productivity jumped by 17% - easily enough to pay the consulting fees. We shouldn't conclude from this study that cynicism about management consulting is always misplaced. These factories were, after all, what a jargon-filled PowerPoint presentation might call ""low-hanging fruit"". But it's scientific proof of one thing, at least. As so often in life, when an idea is used simply, and humbly, it can pay dividends.

UK 'not ready for new industrial era',"The UK must do more to take advantage of technology such as robotics, a report says Advanced digital technology could give UK manufacturing a huge boost and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, a new report claims. The independent review, chaired by the head of Siemens UK, highlights the benefits of robotics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence. But Juergen Maier said the UK needed ""greater ambition"" to take advantage of such technology. And he said a huge number of workers would need to be retrained. His report calls for a commission to help businesses adjust to changing technologies. The report, Made Smarter, brought together executives from companies such as Rolls Royce, GKN and IBM, with representatives from small firms as well as academics from the universities of Newcastle and Cambridge. Its recommendations will help inform the government's industrial strategy plans. Professor Maier told the BBC's Today programme the transition would mean job losses: ""On the one hand it is going to create productivity and more exports and through that we can create more jobs but at the same time robotics and artificial intelligence will displace some jobs. ""The best thing we can do is to make ourselves ready for it in a very proactive way and that means training our people... we need to up skill one million existing workers in the industrial and manufacturing sector... so they can transition from tasks that might be displaced to, for example, managing or programming robots."" The report proposes: More targeted support for companies, re-skilling workers, and a National Adoption Programme piloted in the north west Five digital research centres to improve innovation and capability A national commission in charge of turning Britain into a global leader in industrial digital technologies The proposals were backed by CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn, who warned about the UK's international competition. ""The UK must compete with China, the USA and much of Europe where there are already advanced plans to embrace the fourth industrial revolution,"" she said. Sean Redmond, chief executive of software firm Vertizan and a contributor to the report, said the UK needed to ""catch up with international competitors"". ""Smaller businesses that are growing at scale, especially industrial companies, need support learning about how digitalisation can help their business grow,"" he said.

Ex-Catalan head 'could run if not in jail',"This video can not be played Barcelona rally demonstrator: 'I feel forgotten by Catalan government' Spain's foreign minister has repeated his government's position that the sacked Catalan leader could run in new elections in December, but stressed that meant only if he was not in jail. Alfonso Dastis spoke as a huge rally for Spanish unity was held in Catalonia's largest city, Barcelona. Carles Puigdemont was removed from office after Madrid stripped Catalonia of autonomy for declaring independence. Spain's central government has now taken control of Catalan institutions. Spain's chief prosecutor is preparing to file criminal charges against Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan officials for breaching Spanish law. This could possibly happen as soon as Monday, the first working day since the independence declaration and the Spanish counter-measures. Mr Puigdemont has said he does not recognise the order from Madrid removing him from power. Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? Mr Dastis  told Sky News: ""We are not taking autonomy away from Catalonia. We are just re-establishing it, in fact."" He added: ""Reality is already sinking in, will continue sinking in and they will realise that they cannot do something without the authority of law and they will be usurping authority."" Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid Meanwhile, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has written to all police officers in Catalonia asking for their loyalty as a ""new era"" begins in the region. He reminded members of the regional police, who are now under direct control from Madrid, of their duty to obey orders and to guarantee ""the rights and liberties of all"". The BBC's Sarah Rainsford, in Madrid, says arresting Mr Puigdemont is likely to spark protests - and is perhaps one of the reasons why the interior minister has written this letter. Senior police officers have told the BBC that they have already complied with an order to remove framed photographs of the sacked leader from police stations across the region. Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Friday saw the regional parliament declare independence, with Madrid responding by declaring the move illegal. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader, and ordered that fresh elections should be held on 21 December. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid. This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean Belgium's Migration Minister Theo Francken has said the separatist leader could be given asylum protection which Spain would find difficult to reverse. ""If you see the situation at the moment, the prison sentences and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences that are bandied about... the question is obviously whether somebody like that has the chance of a fair trial,"" he told Reuters. There is no suggestion that Mr Puigdemont is seeking to leave Catalonia. He had been expected to attend a football match in Girona, the heartland of the pro-independence movement, which saw the local team beat Real Madrid - who Mr Rajoy supports - by 2-1. But he apparently did not make an appearance. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed.

India separated twin 'opens eyes',"Picture released by the hospital two days after the historic surgery One of twin Indian boys who were conjoined at the head has opened his eyes four days after historic surgery to separate them, a doctor says. Two-year-old Jaga has also responded to simple commands, including moving his limbs. He is on a ventilator and needs daily dialysis due to kidney problems. His brother, Kalia, is not yet conscious and has suffered seizures. The boys were born with shared blood vessels and brain tissues and it took 16 hours of surgery to separate them. A team of 30 doctors carried out the operation- the first of its kind in India - at a state-run hospital in the capital, Delhi. Both boys are stable and doctors are satisfied with their progress so far, Professor Deepak Gupta, who was involved in the operation, told the BBC. Living a conjoined life Doctors say they are happy with the twins' progress The twins before the surgery to separate them The twins, who are from a village in eastern Orissa state, were joined at the head - a condition known as craniopagus. Even before the operation they had defeated the odds - craniopagus occurs in one in three million births, and 50% of those affected die within 24 hours, doctors say. The first surgery was performed on 28 August when the doctors created a bypass to separate the shared veins that return blood to the heart from the brain.

Saudi women to be let into sport stadiums,"There was a conservative backlash when women were allowed to celebrate National Day in a Riyadh stadium last month Saudi Arabia will allow women to attend sports events in stadiums for the first time from next year, officials say. Families will be able to enter the stadiums in three major cities - Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. It is another move towards giving more freedom to Saudi women, who face strict gender segregation rules, and follows the historic lifting of a driving ban. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is leading a major drive to modernise Saudi society and boost the economy. Saudi Arabia's sports authority said that preparations would start in the three stadiums so they can be ""ready to accommodate families from early 2018"". Restaurants, cafes and monitor screens would be set up inside the stadiums as part of the changes, it added. Up until now, the venues have been men-only areas. The reforms are in line with a wide-ranging plan announced by 32-year-old Prince Mohammed to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom,known as Vision 2030. Last month, a royal decree said thatwomen would be allowed to drivefor the first time from next June. Concerts are once again being held and cinemas are expected to return soon. Is Saudi Arabia on the cusp of change? What can women still not do in Saudi Arabia? Despite the recent changes, women still face severe restrictions in Saudi Arabia On Wednesday, Prince Mohammed said thatthe return of a ""moderate Islam"" was key to his plansto modernise the country. He said that 70% of the Saudi population was under 30 and that they wanted a ""life in which our religion translates to tolerance"". But analysts warn that the plan is not without risks. The kingdom faced a backlash from conservativeson social media after allowing women to participate in National Day celebrations in Riyadh's King Fahd Stadium for the first time last month. Despite the recent announcements, women still face severe restrictions in the country, which enforces a strict form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism. Women have to adhere to strict dress codes and must not associate with unrelated men. If they want to travel, work or access healthcare they must be accompanied by - or receive written permission from - a male guardian.
