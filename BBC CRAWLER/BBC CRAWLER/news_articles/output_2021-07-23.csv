China imposes sanctions on US officials,"Those targeted include former US Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross China is imposing sanctions on several US individuals and organisations in response to recent US sanctions on Chinese officials in Hong Kong. Those targeted include former US Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross. The counter-sanctions come days before US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman is due to visit China. The US sanctions on Chinese officials in Hong Kong were because of their role in the security crackdown in the territory. Washington also warned its business community of the growing risks of operating in Hong Kong. China introduced the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year in response to massive pro-democracy protests. It criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. China's foreign ministry said on Friday that the recent US sanctions were designed to ""groundlessly smear Hong Kong's business environment"" and ""gravely violate international law and basic norms governing international relations"". It said it would impose sanctions on seven US individuals and entities including Mr Ross. As commerce secretary under former President Donald Trump, Mr Ross expanded the number of firms that could not trade with American firms without a prior license, including Chinese telecom giants like Huawei and ZTE. Others sanctioned by China include Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch's China director; Carolyn Bartholomew, chair of US-China Economic and Security Review Commission; and Adam King of the International Republican Institute. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the US was ""undeterred"" by China's retaliation. ""These actions are the latest examples of how Beijing punishes private citizens, companies and civil society organisations as a way to send political signals,"" she said. BACKGROUND: China brings in new law to fight Trump's sanctions The relationship between Beijing and Washington became even more strained under the Trump administration. They remain sour on issues including the origins of Covid-19, human rights and cybersecurity. This weekend, Ms Sherman will travel to China in an effort to address deteriorating ties. It will be the most senior official visit under President Joe Biden. Mr Ross is just the latest former member of the Trump administration to be hit with sanctions by China. In January, it announced sanctions against outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other top Trump officials. The Biden administration called that move ""unproductive and cynical"".

Southgate urges young people to have jab,"This video can not be played Gareth Southgate, speaking on Twitter in a 10 Downing Street message: ''Go and get it (your Covid vaccine) done'' England manager Gareth Southgate is urging younger people to get vaccinated, saying it is a chance to ""get your freedom back"". It comes after it was revealed the proportion of people aged 20 to 29 testing positive for Covid in England had hit record levels. In the message, released by 10 Downing Street, he said vaccination was ""our best route out of this problem"". Many young adults have not received a first vaccine dose yet. Covid cases at record levels for 20 to 29-year-olds Two jabs needed to enter nightclubs from September What do under-30s need to know about the vaccine? About 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - have not been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. But half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to people in their 20s in June. And the vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Southgate started by thanking fans for their support of the England team at Euro 2020, before saying: ""We know the last 18 months have been incredibly difficult for everybody. ""And there's no doubt that the vaccination programme is our best route out of this problem, not only for us as a country but across the world. ""So I just wanted to say how important it is, if you haven't had your vaccine yet, to go and get it done."" He said ""oldies"" like him could now ""crack on"" with their lives if they were fully vaccinated, adding that ""for you younger ones especially, it's the chance for everything to open up, to get your freedom back"". The former England player continued: ""So much of that is going to rest on you having the vaccine. ""So, don't put it off any longer, go and get it done, we can open everything up, we can protect the people we need to protect and you guys will get your freedom back."" The video has been shared widely on social media. Gareth Southgate thanked England fans for supporting the team Public Health England'sfigures show,external, in the last week, 1,155 people in their 20s tested positive for every 100,000 in the population. That is the highest rate of cases in any age group since mass-testing began, experts said, urging everyone in this group to get both jabs.

Double-jabbed students denied quarantine exemption,"Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, right, and her two St Andrews University friends received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland Three students have been refused exemption from travel quarantine rules because their vaccination certificates do not show they have had two jabs. The St Andrews University friends all received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland. But only the second jab shows up on their NHS Scotland paperwork - meaning they would have to isolate if they travel abroad. The BBC has also learned of problems for English students studying in Wales. The Scottish and Welsh governments and NHS Digital - which covers England - have said they are working to resolve the issue. Since 19 July, adults in Scotland who were fully-vaccinated in the UK haveno longer had to quarantine for 10 dayson return from amber-list countries, with the exception of France. On the same day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that ministers planned to makeproof of full vaccination a condition of entry to venues with large crowdsin England from the end of September. But Giulia Benedetta Calabrese - a PhD student at St Andrews - fears the paperwork confusion between health authorities in Scotland and England may force her to miss her brother's wedding at home in Italy. Do I need a vaccine certificate to travel? What are the rules for foreign holidays this summer? She said: ""I have been very careful to ensure I got both vaccines and had all the paperwork ready to travel. ""I can't understand why the vaccination programmes in England and Scotland are struggling to match up people who have moved across the border, between jabs. ""I know there are many more people that have had similar experiences to me and I don't think it's fair that we have to go through all of that."" Ms Calabrese, 28, moved to St Andrews to start her PhD in neuroscience in November 2020. She has sought the help of her new MP, Liberal Democrat Wendy Chamberlain, who has raised the issue with Scotland's health secretary Humza Yousaf. Ms Chamberlain described the confusion between NHS Scotland and NHS England as ""a shameful situation that should never even have come up"". She said: ""Many people, including thousands of students every year, move between the four nations of the UK. ""Yet confusion between our separate vaccine programmes has reached the point where jags received elsewhere in the UK have not been recognised by NHS Scotland."" There is currently no UK-wide system to show where individual doses of the vaccine were delivered The BBC also heard from Kate Loynes from London, whose son is at university in Cardiff. She said that it had been ""incredibly frustrating trying to establish how to obtain proof of his full vaccination"". Her son had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in Wales and his second at a walk-in vaccination centre in London. Ms Loynes said that when he tried to get proof of his fully-vaccinated status, the Welsh health system could not trace the vaccine administered in England. Meanwhile, his GP in London was unable to record the Welsh vaccination on the software system in England. The Scottish government told the BBC it would look to see if it could assist with the St Andrews cases. A spokesman said: ""We are working at pace to align vaccination records from different nations of the UK and have a process in place for sharing data between England and Scotland. ""We continue to work towards replacing the record of vaccination status with a digital record of Covid status, which will include vaccination and testing data to be used for outbound international travel."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are working with NHS Digital to resolve this issue."" An NHS Digital spokeswoman said: ""The NHS Covid Pass service is helping tens of thousands of people to demonstrate their vaccination status quickly, easily and for free. We are currently working to ensure that all vaccination information is shared across the devolved administrations. ""We are working on a solution for people who are registered with a GP in England, who have received one or both of their vaccinations in Wales or Scotland, to see their records in the NHS Covid Pass, and will roll it out as soon as it is ready.""

"Firm fined for claiming clothes prevent CovidAustralian activewear company Lorna Jane is branded ""exploitative"" and ""predatory"" by a judge.","Lorna Jane sells a range of activewear An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m (5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". However, in a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" said Lorna Jane chief executive Bill Clarkson. Lorna Jane claimed its clothing could prevent the spread of Covid-19 ""They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers."" The legal action,externalwas brought by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) after Lorna Jane began marketing the clothing last July during the Covid pandemic. In a judgement published on Friday, a federal court judge found that Lorna Jane ""represented to consumers that it had a reasonable scientific or technological basis"" to make its claims when it had none. The court fined the company ""for making false and misleading representations to consumers and engaging in conduct liable to mislead the public"". Rod Sims, chairman of the ACCC, said: ""This was dreadful conduct as it involved making serious claims regarding public health when there was no basis for them."" He added: ""The whole marketing campaign was based upon consumers' desire for greater protection against the global pandemic."" The company also admitted that its founder, Lorna Jane Clarkson, who is also its chief creative officer, authorised and approved the LJ Shield activewear promotional material and personally made some false statements in a press release and an Instagram video. The judge said he had taken into account that ""the conduct emanated from a high managerial level within the company"" and ""was directed by Ms Clarkson"". Lorna Jane Clarkson started the business more than 30 years ago Ms Clarkson, who was born in Lancashire but emigrated to Australia with her family when she was a child, started the business more than 30 years ago. Lorna Jane, which has stores across Australia, New Zealand, the US and Singapore, has been ordered by the judge to publish corrective notices. It is also not allowed to make any anti-virus claims related to its activewear clothing for three years unless it has reasonable basis to do so. Last week, the company was also fined 40,000 Australian dollars by the Therapeutic Goods Administration drug regulator for ""alleged unlawful advertising"" in relation to Covid. It said: ""This kind of advertising could have detrimental consequences for the Australian community, creating a false sense of security and leading people to be less vigilant about hygiene and social distancing.""

Food isolation exemption scheme delayed by 3 days,"New Covid daily contact testing sites for workers at supermarket depots and food manufacturers won't begin operating until next week. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers in England will be exempt from quarantine rules as the government tries to prevent food supply problems. The government had initially promised to begin testing at 15 ""crucial"" supermarket depots on Friday. But the BBC has learned that testing will be delayed until Monday 26 July. Up to 10,000 staff are expected to qualify for the scheme, but supermarket workers are not included. Earlier on Friday, the Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: ""We've identified 15 depots covering around five supermarkets where they have the most acute problem with staff absences at the moment and we intend to roll that out today. They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites."" However, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started. ""No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,"" he said. He added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets say shortages not widespread Warning that 'pingdemic' threatens shop openings The move comes after thehigh number of retail staff self-isolatingaffected the availability of some products. Iceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves. ""The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,"" said Iceland boss Richard Walker. Initially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. It will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated. Krissy Fremont says she is driving delivery vans because many of Birchall Foodservice's drivers are self-isolating Krissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes. She says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. ""We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,"" she told the BBC. ""We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case."" She says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. ""So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,"" she said. ""We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out."" The scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. M&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. But it said more needed to be done to ""mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace"". Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a ""really significant undertaking"". ""You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system."" However, he added that the government would keep the policy ""under review, but we think this is a sensible first step"". ""We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,"" he added. The government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the ""pingdemic"" keeping staff away from work. Arecord 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid appbetween 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. While some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said ""disruption is limited at the moment"", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary. Separately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated. This scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. Are you a food worker? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, ""it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high"". CBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: ""The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up."" Businesses have already exhausted contingency plans to get in extra staff and are ""at risk of grinding to a halt in the next few weeks"", he added. Phil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was ""a step in the right direction"". ""People having to isolate meant that a number of our suppliers, the service providers that are doing the transport for us, have just said they cannot cope. Roughly half of the deliveries that we would expect to be done are not being done routinely and we're having to scramble to actually get product to its destination on time. ""If you think of the food chain as just that - as a chain, and like any chain, you're only as good as the weakest link - if you cannot get your goods to the market, then you've got a problem,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Scotland has also launcheda system of exemptions from self-isolation, covering workers in sectors such as health and social care. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily testing of food industry staff would ""minimise the disruption caused by rising cases in the coming weeks, while ensuring workers are not put at risk"".

Key obtained to unlock files from cyber attackThe gang behind the attack had previously asked for $70m to access the stolen files.,"A computer key that can unlock the files of hundreds of companies which were hacked in a large-scale cyber-attack has been obtained. US IT firm Kaseya - which was the first to be targeted earlier this month - said it got the key from a âtrusted third partyâ. Ransomware is malicious software that steals computer data and scrambles it so the victim cannot gain access. The hackers then ask for payment in return for releasing the files. Kaseyaâs decryptor key will allow customers to retrieve missing files, without paying the ransom. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The companyâs spokeswoman Dana Liedholm declined to answer whether Kaseya had paid for access to the key. She told tech blogBleeping Computer,externalthat the firm was actively helping customers restore their files. The ""supply chain"" attack initially targeted Kaseya, before spreading through corporate networks which use its software. Kaseya estimated that between 800 and 1,500 businesses were affected, including500 Swedish Coop supermarketsand11 schools in New Zealand.,external After the attack at the beginning of July, criminal ransomware gang REvil demanded $70m worth of Bitcoin in return for a key that would unlock the stolen files. But members of the groupdisappeared from the internetin the days following the incident, leaving companies with no way of retrieving the data until now. Who is the mystery gifter? Thatâs the big question in the cyber-security world at the moment. But really it is irrelevant for two reasons. Firstly, giving away the key now is far too late for most of the victims of this massive ransomware attack. The most desperate companies would have paid the gang already to get their operations back online, and others would hopefully be on their way to recovering by now without the help of the criminals. Secondly, the mystery gifter was most probably linked to - or working with - the criminals directly. It seems improbable that a well-run and experienced cyber-crime group like REvil would have accidentally leaked its most prized possession, or had it taken by some sort of secret law enforcement operation. Iâm told by a hacker who claims to be a part of the inner circle that it was ""a trusted partner"" who gave the key away on behalf of the groupâs leader, who calls himself Unknown. My contact says itâs all part of ""a new beginning"". So while some are calling this the end of the REvil group, it could well be the start of something else.

Firm fined for claiming clothes prevent Covid,"Lorna Jane sells a range of activewear An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m (5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". However, in a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" said Lorna Jane chief executive Bill Clarkson. Lorna Jane claimed its clothing could prevent the spread of Covid-19 ""They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers."" The legal action,externalwas brought by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) after Lorna Jane began marketing the clothing last July during the Covid pandemic. In a judgement published on Friday, a federal court judge found that Lorna Jane ""represented to consumers that it had a reasonable scientific or technological basis"" to make its claims when it had none. The court fined the company ""for making false and misleading representations to consumers and engaging in conduct liable to mislead the public"". Rod Sims, chairman of the ACCC, said: ""This was dreadful conduct as it involved making serious claims regarding public health when there was no basis for them."" He added: ""The whole marketing campaign was based upon consumers' desire for greater protection against the global pandemic."" The company also admitted that its founder, Lorna Jane Clarkson, who is also its chief creative officer, authorised and approved the LJ Shield activewear promotional material and personally made some false statements in a press release and an Instagram video. The judge said he had taken into account that ""the conduct emanated from a high managerial level within the company"" and ""was directed by Ms Clarkson"". Lorna Jane Clarkson started the business more than 30 years ago Ms Clarkson, who was born in Lancashire but emigrated to Australia with her family when she was a child, started the business more than 30 years ago. Lorna Jane, which has stores across Australia, New Zealand, the US and Singapore, has been ordered by the judge to publish corrective notices. It is also not allowed to make any anti-virus claims related to its activewear clothing for three years unless it has reasonable basis to do so. Last week, the company was also fined 40,000 Australian dollars by the Therapeutic Goods Administration drug regulator for ""alleged unlawful advertising"" in relation to Covid. It said: ""This kind of advertising could have detrimental consequences for the Australian community, creating a false sense of security and leading people to be less vigilant about hygiene and social distancing.""

"Critical health and food staff exempt from isolationEmergency services, transport and government workers will also be among those who can apply to avoid isolating.ScotlandComments","Critical staff working in the health, food and transport sectors can apply to be exempt from self-isolation, under a new Scottish government scheme. People who work in the emergency services, government and finance could also qualify for an exemption. But they must be double vaccinated, have a negative PCR test and agree to take daily lateral flow tests. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the changes would ""ensure staff shortages do not put key services at risk"". The exemptions would be limited and applied on a ""case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary"", she added. Previously anyone who came into contact with someone who had tested positive must isolate for 10 days. The new scheme will allow employers to apply to the Scottish government for permission to exempt those who work in critical roles and where staff shortages could jeopardise essential services. Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread The 'pingdemic' in Scotland The exemption will only be granted where workers have voluntarily agreed not to self-isolate. The changes come after businesses across the UK were affected by large numbers of workers self-isolating, leading to shortages of some products in supermarkets. Health and social care also remains under pressure from staff shortages. In Lanarkshire urgent social care is being prioritised only for the most vulnerable by reducing home care packages ""where it is safe to do so"" as a result of the ""exceptional"" pressures on the NHS. The Scottish government has said employers who meetthe definition of Critical National Infrastructure,externalcan apply for the exemption. There are 13 national infrastructure sectors: Chemicals Civil Nuclear Communications Defence Emergency Services Energy Finance Food Government Health Space Transport Water There were some empty shelves at this Co-op in Glasgow on Thursday Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is essential that lifeline services and critical national infrastructure are maintained and we are implementing these changes now ahead of possible changes to self-isolation rules for close contacts that may apply more generally in future. ""We have seen significant staff shortages in a small number of organisations in recent days and we have worked with them to protect services. ""Clinical evidence tells us we can safely and effectively release some critical staff from self-isolation, with appropriate safeguards. However, this is a very limited change at this stage, to be applied on a case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary."" The move was widely criticised by unions including Unite, Unison and GMB Scotland. Louise Gilmour, of GMB Scotland, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethat the ""pretty shocking"" decision was ""driven by resource - not what is safe for our workers or their families"". ""We believe it's the cuts, the underfunding and the under-staffing of these services that means they don't have the capacity we need in times of crisis - that's within our NHS, our social care and our supermarkets,"" she added. Meanwhile Unison's Willie Duffy warned that the new rules were not an ""appropriate or well evidenced"" response and could lead to further spread of the virus. However it was described as a ""step forward in... a fast-moving situation"" by the Scottish Retail Consortium. ""Whilst it is vexing that store staff are not explicitly in scope, it will hopefully help the grocery supply chain as its grapples with a conflux of pressures at the current time including elevated levels of self-isolation amongst staff in logistics, distribution, and production,"" a spokesman added. He said the availability of products on shop shelves ""remains good"". The move was also welcomed as a ""cautious step in the right direction"" by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. ""However, many questions must be clarified by the SNP if these changes are to have the right effect,"" he added.  ""They must be clear on who exactly will qualify for an exemption and for how long an exemption will last for."" The haulage industry already faced a shortage of drivers but the situation has been made worse by the Covid pandemic Earlier Colin Smith, chief executive of the Scottish Wholesale Association, said his members were ""critical"" to keeping the shops supplied. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthere was on average a 13% shortfall of required drivers in Scotland but staff shortages were not as bad as in England. ""The problems is the supply chain is heavily interlinked with England, so higher cases down there means less staff to pick and deliver to our depots so we can get it out our end users,"" he added. He said fast moving goods such as soft drinks, pet food and alcohol are goods where ""we can't replenish quick enough"". In the transport sector, ScotRail said a ""very limited number of trains"" have been cancelled due to staff shortages, but it has not amended its timetables. On Thursday a Loganair flight was cancelled due to staff isolation. The airline is understood to be experiencing shortages of cabin crew and pilots. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Key obtained to unlock files from cyber attackThe gang behind the attack had previously asked for $70m to access the stolen files.Technology,"A computer key that can unlock the files of hundreds of companies which were hacked in a large-scale cyber-attack has been obtained. US IT firm Kaseya - which was the first to be targeted earlier this month - said it got the key from a âtrusted third partyâ. Ransomware is malicious software that steals computer data and scrambles it so the victim cannot gain access. The hackers then ask for payment in return for releasing the files. Kaseyaâs decryptor key will allow customers to retrieve missing files, without paying the ransom. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The companyâs spokeswoman Dana Liedholm declined to answer whether Kaseya had paid for access to the key. She told tech blogBleeping Computer,externalthat the firm was actively helping customers restore their files. The ""supply chain"" attack initially targeted Kaseya, before spreading through corporate networks which use its software. Kaseya estimated that between 800 and 1,500 businesses were affected, including500 Swedish Coop supermarketsand11 schools in New Zealand.,external After the attack at the beginning of July, criminal ransomware gang REvil demanded $70m worth of Bitcoin in return for a key that would unlock the stolen files. But members of the groupdisappeared from the internetin the days following the incident, leaving companies with no way of retrieving the data until now. Who is the mystery gifter? Thatâs the big question in the cyber-security world at the moment. But really it is irrelevant for two reasons. Firstly, giving away the key now is far too late for most of the victims of this massive ransomware attack. The most desperate companies would have paid the gang already to get their operations back online, and others would hopefully be on their way to recovering by now without the help of the criminals.

It was written by Hazel Shearing, Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Mary O'Connor and Kelly Leigh-Cooper and edited by Vanessa Barford, Holly Wallis and Jenny Matthews. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates soon. And here's a round-up of the key headlines in the UK today:  We're wrapping up our Covid live page coverage for the day soon, thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest developments from around the world:  As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the UK, Public Health England is warning thatthere is an increased risk of becoming reinfected with the Delta variantfirst identified in India if you have had Covid before. It says897 cases out of 68,688 Delta infections recorded in an 11-week period from April to June,externalwere possible reinfections. PHE said that further work is now being undertaken to examine the risk of reinfection. Meanwhile, swab tests conducted for the Office for National Statistics' infection survey suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus, up from one in 100 the week before - with the Delta strain accounting for almost every case. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2)currently accounts for 99% of new Covid cases in the UK, but UK officials say there is no evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Everyone wants to have passed the peak of the third wave and
be confident weâre on the home straight to normality. The data on daily cases looks positive. It was only a week
ago the UK shot above 50,000 cases for the first time since January. Now itâs closer to 36,000 after four consecutive days of
falling cases. Yet, it is still too soon to say weâve passed the peak. The impact of relaxing restrictions on 19 July has not yet
been seen in the data. It is also unclear how much Englandâs run to the final of
the Euros â cheered on in packed pubs â distorted trends by leading to a surge
in cases that has since calmed down. Health sources say there is still huge uncertainty about the
weeks to come, but it is possible we may not reach the 100,000 daily cases that
had been predicted. As always, closely monitoring the data in the weeks to come
will be crucial. We've been hearing a lot today about thegovernment's planto allow critical sectors in England to apply for named workers to be exempt from self-isolation and instead doing daily Covid testing. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has saidthe proposed scheme is ""undeliverable,""saying the list of 16 sectors earmarked for it would soon be ""significantly challenged"". John Foster, CBI director of policy said: ""If we want the economy to stay open, we need a confident but balanced plan."" He urged the government to bring forward the 16 August date from when fully-vaccinated people pinged by the NHS Covid app as close contacts do not have to self-isolate. Mr Foster also called for a test-and-release programme for people who are not double-vaccinated. The government's plans allow 16 key sectors in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers who are fully vaccinated. It covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. The Philippines has sent millions of children back into lockdown as fears rise over a Delta variant surge. Almost 50% of the 47 cases of the more virulent Delta strain detected so far were locally acquired, the health department said. There are now stricter limits on indoor dining, beauty salons and religious gatherings, while children aged five to 17 have been told to stay home. It comes just two weeks after a ban was lifted on minors going outside that had been in place since March 2020, but was often ignored. The rule had been justified on the grounds that young people were at risk of passing the virus on to older members of the family. The Philippines is struggling to vaccinate its population of 110 million due to short global supplies and logistical problems. More than 5 million people are fully vaccinated while 10.5 million have received their first jab. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Taking a moment to see what is going on elsewhere in the world - the Czech Republic has announced changes to restrictions on incoming travel from several European countries. The changes will come into effect on Monday. The Netherlands, Spain and the Balearic Islands will be moved into the dark red (very high risk) category. Greece and Monaco will be deemed as red (high risk), while Estonia will become orange (medium risk). The colour coding affects which tests visitors and returnees need to carry out and when. However, fully vaccinated citizens and residents of the Czech Republic will continue to be able to visit and return from them without having to do anything but fill in a passenger locator form. Meanwhile, Czechs will no longer be able to present a sworn statement saying they have tested negative using a self-testing kit or having been tested at work in order to enter restaurants, sports facilities etc. From now on it has to be proof of full vaccination, negative test in a certified lab or confirmation of previous infection to use such facilities. Meanwhile, another 43,000 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, while 174,742 have had a second dose, according to thegovernment's dashboard.,external Due to a technical issue, today's vaccination figures do not include data from Wales. So far, a total of 83,239,491 vaccinations have been given in the UK - with 46,476,845 first doses. Meanwhile, 36,762,646 people are now fully vaccinated - equal to 69.5% of the adult population. The UK has recorded 36,389 new coronavirus infections and a further 64 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. The latest update brings the cumulative total of positive cases to 5,637,975 and and the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test to 129,044. Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), but speaking in a personal capacity, has said asking people who are contact traced to take tests every day, for about five to seven days, can be as effective as asking them to quarantine for 10 days. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that was the result of modelling, which had been backed up by hard evidence from a randomised control trial done in children. ""The level of infection in schools where the students were asked to self-isolate was exactly the same as the level of infection in schools where they had the daily testing for contacts,"" he said. He added that the results of a another trial, a randomised control trial in the community, should give results ""in the coming weeks"". He said isolating cases, quarantining contacts or - ""if it's feasible"" - daily testing are ""really important measures"" to stop the epidemic getting worse. More than 3.6 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given in more than 190 countries worldwide. However, there arevast differences in the pace of progress across the globe. While some nations have secured and administered jabs to a large proportion of their population, others are some way behind. China and India have given the largest total number of doses, with about 1.5 billion (104.5 doses per 100 people) and 417 million (30.3 doses per 100 people) respectively. In the UK,more than 46 million people have had at least one dose of a vaccine. The UK roll-out is calculated at 124.3 doses per 100 people. While countries in Europe and the Americas are getting on well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa are experiencing supply issues. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. It can be kept in a normal fridge, which makes it easy to distribute and store. Meanwhile, more than 200 possible jabs continue to undergo trials around the world to test their efficacy and safety. Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, right, and her two St Andrews University friends received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland Three students have been refused exemption from travel quarantine rules because their vaccination certificates do not show they have had two jabs. The St Andrews University friends all received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland. But only the second jab shows up on their NHS Scotland paperwork - meaning they would have to isolate if they travel abroad. The Scottish government has said it is working to resolve the issue. From 19 July, adults in Scotland who were fully vaccinated in the UKno longer have to quarantine for 10 dayson return from amber-list countries, with the exception of France. PhD student Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, 28, fears the confusion between  may force her to miss her brother's wedding at home in Italy. ""I have been very careful to ensure I got both vaccines and had all the paperwork ready to travel,"" she says. She said she couldn't understand why the vaccination programmes in England and Scotland are ""struggling to match up people who have moved across the border"". ""I know there are many more people that have had similar experiences to me, and I don't think it's fair that we have to go through all of that.""  We told you earliercoronavirus infections have continued to risearound much of the UK, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Swab tests,externalin the community suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus in the week to 17 July, up from one in 100 the week before. You can see how cases are rising in the chart below. The chair of the parliamentary science and technology committee has said that a test-to-release system should start immediately. The government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England. If someone tests positive for the virus they will still be legally required to self-isolate. Conservative MP Greg Clark told Radio 4âs World at One programme that âmany people think that 10 days' isolation is pretty onerous and some of them will not comply with it"". Referring to the change of rules from 16 August, he said: ""I don't see why we can't begin that now."" Mr Clark cited experts who suggest this would be a sensible course of action, adding: ""Of course people testing positive for Covid need to isolate, but contacts should be able to take a test, and isolate if positive but go about their business if negative."" He said that would increase compliance levels as ""at the moment you have hundreds of thousands - and possibly millions of people eventually - who are told to isolate but are not convinced of the case for it"". An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m(5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". In a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" its chief executive said. Read the full story here. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has revealed it has been struggling to deliver
agreed amounts of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to Argentina. ""There has been a delay,"" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told a daily press briefing today after Argentina threatened to
cancel the contract. He added that Russia's sovereign wealth fund,RDIF, which
funded Sputnik V's development, was ""in touch with its partners to settle
the problems that have been arising"". Mr
Peskov implied that the delay in supplies to Argentina may have been
caused by the government's focus on demand at home. ""We've always said that the main priority is
satisfying Russians' demand for vaccination. You will know that the campaign of
total vaccination has been significantly stepped up, and citizens'
conscientiousness is constantly growing, vaccination is proceeding at an ever
faster pace. That's why this is a definite priority,"" he said. But he also gave assurances that ""commitments to foreign
markets including Argentina will definitely be met"". His
comments come after Argentine newspaper La Nacionpublished an email,externalsent
by key presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini to RDIF, in which
she complained of a ""very critical situation"" caused by the delay in
supplies of Sputnik V. ""The
entire contract is at risk of being publicly cancelled"" as Argentina is still waiting to
receive more than 18 million doses from Russia, she said. Argentina is
one of the first countries to widely use Sputnik V, and it has been used by the
Russian government as a showcase for its best-known vaccine. However, problems
fulfilling the contract may turn into a major obstacle to Moscowâs efforts to
market the jab abroad. The latest estimate of the reproduction (R) number in England - which measures how quickly the Covid virus is spreading - is unchanged from the previous week at 1.2 to 1.4, officials figures show. It means that on average, every 10 people infected with coronavirus goes on to infect between 12 and 14 others. However, the estimated daily growth rate shows signs of a possible slowdown. This week's estimate is that infections are growing at between 4% and 6% a day, down from between 4% and 7% last week. These estimates represent transmission which happened two to three weeks ago, due to a delay between people being infected, developing symptoms and needing healthcare. As we reported earlier, thousands of people have been heading to Suffolk for the Latitude Festival, which was cancelled last year because of the pandemic. The four-day music and arts festival - which began yesterday - is expected to attract about 40,000 people per day and is operating under a government event safety trial. Triathlete Libby Butler was determined to attend the festival and continue with her training. She's camping there all week and says she's been swimming in the lake on-site. ""I feel really safe,"" she says. ""Everyone is very much aware that Covid is still around and everybody is being really respectful. ""It is very odd. I live on my own in a little village in the Cotswolds so there are not many people about. So I found it very strange in the arena last night being around all of these people. ""I'm sure that will ease off as the weekend goes on and I'll be a bit more relaxed."" Josh Gosling, 18, who is enjoying his fourth Latitude Festival, says it's really nice to be back. ""It is the first big event we've had since lockdown so it was a bit weird really with having all the crowds and mingling with people."" Any concerns soon faded however he said he even enjoyed a spell of crowd surfing on Thursday night. ""Quite a lot of us have already had Covid in the past couple of months,"" says friend Gus Pater. ""So we all feel pretty confident about it and quite safe. ""I was fine with it [Covid], though I still can't smell anything. It kind of reassures me that I will be all right.""

Train companies have said they may have to reduce timetables to cope with shortages of staff forced to isolate by the NHS Covid app. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said that as Covid cases were increasing, more staff were being ""pinged"" by the app. Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Thameslink and Southern trains, has already announced it will introduce a reduced timetable from Monday 26 July. Meanwhile, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway have revealed it cancelled 600 trains last week as the number of staff self-isolating surged.

Critical health and food staff exempt from isolation,"Critical staff working in the health, food and transport sectors can apply to be exempt from self-isolation, under a new Scottish government scheme. People who work in the emergency services, government and finance could also qualify for an exemption. But they must be double vaccinated, have a negative PCR test and agree to take daily lateral flow tests. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the changes would ""ensure staff shortages do not put key services at risk"". The exemptions would be limited and applied on a ""case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary"", she added. Previously anyone who came into contact with someone who had tested positive must isolate for 10 days. The new scheme will allow employers to apply to the Scottish government for permission to exempt those who work in critical roles and where staff shortages could jeopardise essential services. Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread The 'pingdemic' in Scotland The exemption will only be granted where workers have voluntarily agreed not to self-isolate. The changes come after businesses across the UK were affected by large numbers of workers self-isolating, leading to shortages of some products in supermarkets. Health and social care also remains under pressure from staff shortages. In Lanarkshire urgent social care is being prioritised only for the most vulnerable by reducing home care packages ""where it is safe to do so"" as a result of the ""exceptional"" pressures on the NHS. The Scottish government has said employers who meetthe definition of Critical National Infrastructure,externalcan apply for the exemption. There are 13 national infrastructure sectors: Chemicals Civil Nuclear Communications Defence Emergency Services Energy Finance Food Government Health Space Transport Water There were some empty shelves at this Co-op in Glasgow on Thursday Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is essential that lifeline services and critical national infrastructure are maintained and we are implementing these changes now ahead of possible changes to self-isolation rules for close contacts that may apply more generally in future. ""We have seen significant staff shortages in a small number of organisations in recent days and we have worked with them to protect services. ""Clinical evidence tells us we can safely and effectively release some critical staff from self-isolation, with appropriate safeguards. However, this is a very limited change at this stage, to be applied on a case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary."" The move was widely criticised by unions including Unite, Unison and GMB Scotland. Louise Gilmour, of GMB Scotland, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethat the ""pretty shocking"" decision was ""driven by resource - not what is safe for our workers or their families"". ""We believe it's the cuts, the underfunding and the under-staffing of these services that means they don't have the capacity we need in times of crisis - that's within our NHS, our social care and our supermarkets,"" she added. Meanwhile Unison's Willie Duffy warned that the new rules were not an ""appropriate or well evidenced"" response and could lead to further spread of the virus. However it was described as a ""step forward in... a fast-moving situation"" by the Scottish Retail Consortium. ""Whilst it is vexing that store staff are not explicitly in scope, it will hopefully help the grocery supply chain as its grapples with a conflux of pressures at the current time including elevated levels of self-isolation amongst staff in logistics, distribution, and production,"" a spokesman added. He said the availability of products on shop shelves ""remains good"". The move was also welcomed as a ""cautious step in the right direction"" by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. ""However, many questions must be clarified by the SNP if these changes are to have the right effect,"" he added.  ""They must be clear on who exactly will qualify for an exemption and for how long an exemption will last for."" The haulage industry already faced a shortage of drivers but the situation has been made worse by the Covid pandemic Earlier Colin Smith, chief executive of the Scottish Wholesale Association, said his members were ""critical"" to keeping the shops supplied. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthere was on average a 13% shortfall of required drivers in Scotland but staff shortages were not as bad as in England. ""The problems is the supply chain is heavily interlinked with England, so higher cases down there means less staff to pick and deliver to our depots so we can get it out our end users,"" he added. He said fast moving goods such as soft drinks, pet food and alcohol are goods where ""we can't replenish quick enough"". In the transport sector, ScotRail said a ""very limited number of trains"" have been cancelled due to staff shortages, but it has not amended its timetables. On Thursday a Loganair flight was cancelled due to staff isolation. The airline is understood to be experiencing shortages of cabin crew and pilots. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Key obtained to unlock files from cyber attack,"A computer key that can unlock the files of hundreds of companies which were hacked in a large-scale cyber-attack has been obtained. US IT firm Kaseya - which was the first to be targeted earlier this month - said it got the key from a âtrusted third partyâ. Ransomware is malicious software that steals computer data and scrambles it so the victim cannot gain access. The hackers then ask for payment in return for releasing the files. Kaseyaâs decryptor key will allow customers to retrieve missing files, without paying the ransom. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The companyâs spokeswoman Dana Liedholm declined to answer whether Kaseya had paid for access to the key. She told tech blogBleeping Computer,externalthat the firm was actively helping customers restore their files. The ""supply chain"" attack initially targeted Kaseya, before spreading through corporate networks which use its software. Kaseya estimated that between 800 and 1,500 businesses were affected, including500 Swedish Coop supermarketsand11 schools in New Zealand.,external After the attack at the beginning of July, criminal ransomware gang REvil demanded $70m worth of Bitcoin in return for a key that would unlock the stolen files. But members of the groupdisappeared from the internetin the days following the incident, leaving companies with no way of retrieving the data until now. Who is the mystery gifter? Thatâs the big question in the cyber-security world at the moment. But really it is irrelevant for two reasons. Firstly, giving away the key now is far too late for most of the victims of this massive ransomware attack. The most desperate companies would have paid the gang already to get their operations back online, and others would hopefully be on their way to recovering by now without the help of the criminals. Secondly, the mystery gifter was most probably linked to - or working with - the criminals directly. It seems improbable that a well-run and experienced cyber-crime group like REvil would have accidentally leaked its most prized possession, or had it taken by some sort of secret law enforcement operation. Iâm told by a hacker who claims to be a part of the inner circle that it was ""a trusted partner"" who gave the key away on behalf of the groupâs leader, who calls himself Unknown. My contact says itâs all part of ""a new beginning"". So while some are calling this the end of the REvil group, it could well be the start of something else.

Firm fined Â£2.6m for claiming clothes prevent Covid,"Lorna Jane sells a range of activewear An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m (5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". However, in a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" said Lorna Jane chief executive Bill Clarkson. Lorna Jane claimed its clothing could prevent the spread of Covid-19 ""They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers."" The legal action,externalwas brought by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) after Lorna Jane began marketing the clothing last July during the Covid pandemic. In a judgement published on Friday, a federal court judge found that Lorna Jane ""represented to consumers that it had a reasonable scientific or technological basis"" to make its claims when it had none. The court fined the company ""for making false and misleading representations to consumers and engaging in conduct liable to mislead the public"". Rod Sims, chairman of the ACCC, said: ""This was dreadful conduct as it involved making serious claims regarding public health when there was no basis for them."" He added: ""The whole marketing campaign was based upon consumers' desire for greater protection against the global pandemic."" The company also admitted that its founder, Lorna Jane Clarkson, who is also its chief creative officer, authorised and approved the LJ Shield activewear promotional material and personally made some false statements in a press release and an Instagram video. The judge said he had taken into account that ""the conduct emanated from a high managerial level within the company"" and ""was directed by Ms Clarkson"". Lorna Jane Clarkson started the business more than 30 years ago Ms Clarkson, who was born in Lancashire but emigrated to Australia with her family when she was a child, started the business more than 30 years ago. Lorna Jane, which has stores across Australia, New Zealand, the US and Singapore, has been ordered by the judge to publish corrective notices. It is also not allowed to make any anti-virus claims related to its activewear clothing for three years unless it has reasonable basis to do so. Last week, the company was also fined 40,000 Australian dollars by the Therapeutic Goods Administration drug regulator for ""alleged unlawful advertising"" in relation to Covid. It said: ""This kind of advertising could have detrimental consequences for the Australian community, creating a false sense of security and leading people to be less vigilant about hygiene and social distancing.""

'Clear opportunities and frictions' in NI Protocol,"The opportunities offered and frictions caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol are clear, the chief executive of Invest NI has said. Kevin Holland said there was now more clarity for businesses and investors after a long period of uncertainty when the Brexit deal was being negotiated. The protocol is the part of the deal that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Mr Holland said Invest NI was helping firms explain how the protocol worked. He made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with BBC Radio Ulster's Inside Business programme as the economic development agency published its end-of-year results. He said there had been ""frictions"" resulting from the post-Brexit trade arrangement for Northern Ireland. ""There have been frictions because we've seen them,"" he said. Kevin Holland says potential investors want to know the practicalities of setting up in Northern Ireland ""We have invested a lot of time in webinars and advice sessions with businesses in Northern Ireland to explain to them how the new configuration works between the UK and Europe, what is the best way to manage the frictions. ""We've had companies who have talked to us and want to explore the opportunities."" This week the UK governmentdemanded a redrawing of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which it had agreed with the EU last winter. It said the resulting checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain had proven to be unsustainable and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. But the EU responded by saying it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the deal. Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? Asked if potential foreign investors had queried the political split between the UK and the EU in relation to the protocol, Mr Holland said: ""When we talk to businesses we focus on the practicalities. ""In terms of political discussions that go on on a daily basis, that is not the part we focus on. ""There has been real progress over the last few years. Some unionists have protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, claiming it weakens the UK union ""If you look at where we were last June, there was very little clarity and businesses were saying 'we want certainty, we want to understand what is happening'. ""[Since the Brexit deal], I think it's pretty clear actually what businesses need to do to operate successfully in Northern Ireland. ""[It's clear] what frictions... are still there and what the opportunities there can be for the future for the benefit of businesses setting up in or expanding from Northern Ireland."" Invest NI's end-of-year results show it made 3,000 offers of financial assistance during the 2020-21 financial year. Mr Holland said the organisation had adapted quickly to also assist with the rollout of government support schemes during the pandemic. He said he was confident about attracting new investors. ""We are having a lot of conversations... our pipeline is very strong, as strong as it has been over the last four years,"" he said. ""The challenge is actually bringing people here because of Covid and travel restrictions. Invest NI is the publicly-funded economic development agency for Northern Ireland ""Northern Ireland is a very attractive destination and I think over the last year it has made a name for itself with global companies. ""They've seen the resilience of Northern Irish businesses and the speed at which they adapted quickly. ""Just to move a deal across the line, to get the final signature on a dotted line, we really need some of those investors to come here and we look forward to the opening-up to be able to do that."" Invest NI to be hit by loss of EU grants Mr Holland was also asked if Invest NI provided value for money. ""In spite of the traumatic year we've lived through we have hit the targets we set four years ago before anyone had heard about Covid or even Brexit,"" he replied. ""We certainly deliver what we commit to. ""If you look at our investment returns, for every Â£1 we invest into businesses they match with Â£5. ""So for every Â£1 we disperse, you get Â£6 into the economy.""

Olympic men's football players to watchArchibald on her Tokyo dreams & pressure,"The Olympics football kicks off on July 21 Euro 2020 and the Copa America may be over, but the summer of international tournament football is not done yet. The Tokyo Olympics is just around the corner and some well-known faces, as well as some stars of tomorrow, will be going for gold. The Team GB women's squad will be going for glory in Tokyo, and, even without a British man's team going, there is plenty to look forward to in the men's competition. Two groups of four teams will compete for gold between 21 July and 7 August. Typically, each team must select a squad of players under the age of 23 with three designated over-age players, but because the Olympics was delayed by a year due to Covid-19, that has been changed to under 24, meaning players must be born after 1 January 1997. Teams qualified through each regional confederation's respective developmental tournament, for example the 2019 European Under-21 Championships, which has seen Spain, Romania, France and Germany reach Tokyo. In 2012, when London was hosting, Team GB put forward a men's team for the first time. But subsequent attempts to re-form in 2016 were shelved after the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations didn't back the plans and they haven't been tried again. Because of England's failure to get out of the groups at the Under-21 Euros, Team GB wouldn't have qualified anyway. However, Tokyo 2020 will be Great Britain's women's second appearance at the tournament. Superstars including Neymar and Lionel Messi have competed in the past and won gold. Here are some of the teams and players to watch at this Games... Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli will represent Brazil in Tokyo Gold medallists from five years ago when they hosted the Games in Rio, Brazil will once again be red hot favourites to defend their crown. Notable members of this squad include Arsenal strikerGabriel Martinelli,Reinier, a midfielder on loan from Real Madrid at Borussia Dortmund, and perhaps their key player, Everton'sRicharlison,who helped the senior side to the Copa America final earlier in the summer. Eleven of the 22 players selected currently ply their trade outside their homeland, including Aston Villa midfielderDouglas Luiz. Having initially turned down requests for 24-year-old Richarlison to head to the Games, the Toffees relented and allowed him to go. But having played so much football since the end of last season, it is unlikely he'll return for Rafael Benitez's Premier League game against Southampton just a week after the Olympic men's football final. Hertha Berlin strikerMatheus Cunhais another talent worth watching, having scored seven goals in the struggling Bundesliga side last term. Sevilla defenderDiego Carlos, 28, and Barcelona legendDani Alves,now 38 and with Sao Paolo, join Athletico Paranaense goalkeeperSantos, 31, as the overaged contingent. Six Spain players from Euro 2020 including Unai Simon, Pedri and Dani Olmo have been selected No fewer than six players from Luis Enrique's Euro 2020 squad have been chosen to represent La Roja again. That list includes 17-year-oldPedri,who was a breakout star at the tournament having impressed at Barcelona last season, Real Sociedad'sMikel Oyarzabal, Dani Olmoof RB Leipzig, Athletic Bilbao goalkeeperUnai Simon, Eric Garcia,formerly of Manchester City and now Barcelona and Villarreal'sPau Torres. Their three designated older players were not involved in Spain's journey to the Euros semi-finals:Mikel Merino,once of Newcastle United and now Real Sociedad, former Arsenal loaneeDani Ceballos,and Real Madrid wingerMarco Asensio,all of whom will be 25 during the Games, are their choices. StrikerRafa Mircould be something of a wildcard. Despite joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2018, he is yet to make a mark at Molineux, but he enjoyed an impressive season in La Liga despite getting relegated with Huesca, scoring 13 goals in 38 games. Manchester United's Amad Diallo will play for Ivory Coast There will be a number of players familiar to those who watch the English top flight, including Burnley strikerChris Wood,who will be looking to lead the line for New Zealand as one of their over-aged selections. The 29-year-old has scored 24 goals in 57 appearances for the All Whites since making his debut in 2009. West Ham defenderWinston Reid,33, who spent last season on loan at Brentford, is also in their squad. Manchester United defenderEric Bailly, 27, will be there for Ivory Coast alongside clubmateAmad Diallo,the exciting teenage winger who joined the Red Devils from Atalanta last season. Interestingly, Tottenham Hotspur starSonHeung-minhas been left out of South Korea's squad despite the 28-year-old being given the green light by his club, because coach Hak-bum Kim says his fitness needs to be protected. Liverpool'sMohamed Salahhas been left out of Egypt's squad, despite being named provisionally. Takefusa Kubo is the hosts' big hope There are a number of exciting prospects looking to make a name for themselves. Argentina'sEsequiel Barcois a pacey, dynamic winger currently with Atlanta United in Major League Soccer. He'll be hoping to help La Albiceleste win gold for the first time since 2008. Japan hold home advantage, which could be key, andTakefusa Kubowill be a big player for them. The Real Madrid playmaker is only 20 and hasn't played for Los Blancos yet but has begun to establish himself in Spain through loan spells at Real Mallorca, Villarreal and Getafe. France's depth of youth is evident again, despite Rennes objecting to midfield sensationEduardo Camavingabeing included in their squad. BothAndre Pierre-Gignac,35, and former Newcastle wingerFlorian Thauvin,28, who now play for Tigres in Mexico, join the overage list.Maximilian Arnold,27, andMax Kruse,33, are the biggest names in Stefan Kuntz's Germany side.

Archibald on her Tokyo dreams & pressure,"Katie Archibald is aiming for gold in the team pursuit for the second successive Olympic Games Olympic Games on the BBC Hosts:Tokyo, JapanDates:23 July-8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. You might hear lots of athletes saying it's their dream to win an Olympic gold medal. The difference for Katie Archibald is she actually dreams about it. ""I imagine gold,"" the Scot tells BBC Sport. ""When I'm going through the events in my mind, we win... in my dream."" Archibald already has a coveted gold medal, having been part of the record-setting team pursuit quartet which swept all before them in Rio de Janeiro five years ago. She has a chance of another in the same event in Tokyo, as well as the Madison, which is on the women's programme for the first time. Britain's cyclists - now viewed as a prolific mine for medals - have barely competed in 2021, but the expectation to deliver remains, particularly in the women's pursuit, where the team broke the world record in every round on route to victory in 2016 as the distance went from 3,000 to 4,000m. ""It's a strange world when there becomes an expectation of a world record, isn't it? Because it happened at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics,"" Archibald laughs. ""If I'm totally honest, I do still have the expectation that world record will tumble at the Games. We've seen quite a few nations come close to it through this cycle but not quite there."" A ferocious competitor in her own right, Archibald will be a major player in one of the main storylines of the Olympics from a British perspective. Laura Kenny is aiming to become the country's most successful Olympian ever, with fellow cyclist husband Jason - who currently shares the British record of six gold medals with Chris Hoy - her main competitor for that title. As well as working together in the team pursuit, Archibald and Kenny are partners in the Madison. So does the Scot feel the extra pressure of helping her team-mate make history? ""If I took a second to step back and think about the external image of it all there would be a lot of pressure,"" she says. ""I haven't so far felt a lot of pressure but I'm sure it'll come. ""Because our primary team is the team pursuit - we're definite equals there and the strength we both bring and the dynamic it lays down makes it feel really natural when we transition to a Madison pairing. ""It's funny, big and little. We're a funny pair. Laura's Britain's most successful female Olympian - four Olympic gold medals - she has a 100% hit rate. ""To have that on side, you forget about it sometimes. I think we work pretty well together. I'm - what's the synonym we use now that we use for bossy now that's not as sexist sounding? - yeah, I'm quite often the forceful voice of the team, but we get it done."" Every athlete has their own story about the pandemic. Some were raring to go last year and the postponement robbed them of a chance to compete at their peak, others are grateful for the extra time. Archibald falls into the latter camp having been - by her own assessment - slightly short of her best in 2020, but has now taken strength from the isolation inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. A ""borderline robotic"" lifestyle which consisted of mile after mile after mile on the bike has allowed her to get into peak condition once more. So after a long slog to get to this point, and with the pressure of success building, will Archibald be able to enjoy the Games? ""That's something that I've not reflected on,"" she says. ""I've told you the way I imagine things in my head. When it's my dream it goes the way I'd like it to so I imagine enjoying every single second. ""I know it'll be different with either a reduced crowd or no crowd at all. But that's the way it's got to be and we're just thrilled to get the chance to go to an Olympic Games.""

"Greensill probe scapegoated my husband, says widowLady Heywood calls a report on the Greensill lobbying scandal a ""fabricated attack"" on her late husband.UK Politics","The widow of the former head of the civil service has told the BBC her late husband was effectively ""gagged"" by a government inquiry into lobbying.

A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the process had been ""fair"" and the review had listened to Lady Heywood's concerns.

Key obtained to unlock files from ransomware attack,"A computer key that can unlock the files of hundreds of companies which were hacked in a large-scale cyber-attack has been obtained. US IT firm Kaseya - which was the first to be targeted earlier this month - said it got the key from a âtrusted third partyâ. Ransomware is malicious software that steals computer data and scrambles it so the victim cannot gain access. The hackers then ask for payment in return for releasing the files. Kaseyaâs decryptor key will allow customers to retrieve missing files, without paying the ransom. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The companyâs spokeswoman Dana Liedholm declined to answer whether Kaseya had paid for access to the key. She told tech blogBleeping Computer,externalthat the firm was actively helping customers restore their files. The ""supply chain"" attack initially targeted Kaseya, before spreading through corporate networks which use its software. Kaseya estimated that between 800 and 1,500 businesses were affected, including500 Swedish Coop supermarketsand11 schools in New Zealand.,external After the attack at the beginning of July, criminal ransomware gang REvil demanded $70m worth of Bitcoin in return for a key that would unlock the stolen files. But members of the groupdisappeared from the internetin the days following the incident, leaving companies with no way of retrieving the data until now. Who is the mystery gifter? Thatâs the big question in the cyber-security world at the moment. But really it is irrelevant for two reasons. Firstly, giving away the key now is far too late for most of the victims of this massive ransomware attack. The most desperate companies would have paid the gang already to get their operations back online, and others would hopefully be on their way to recovering by now without the help of the criminals. Secondly, the mystery gifter was most probably linked to - or working with - the criminals directly. It seems improbable that a well-run and experienced cyber-crime group like REvil would have accidentally leaked its most prized possession, or had it taken by some sort of secret law enforcement operation. Iâm told by a hacker who claims to be a part of the inner circle that it was ""a trusted partner"" who gave the key away on behalf of the groupâs leader, who calls himself Unknown. My contact says itâs all part of ""a new beginning"". So while some are calling this the end of the REvil group, it could well be the start of something else.

Mum of woman who vanished from yacht 'has hope',"This video can not be played Sarm Heslop's parents said they ""still have hope"" she will be found The parents of a British woman who vanished from her boyfriend's yacht in the US Virgin Islands ""still have hope"" she will be found alive. Sarm Heslop, 41, from Southampton, was reported missing by Ryan Bane, from his boat off St John over four months ago. Peter Heslop and Brenda Street say they are in a ""living nightmare"" and still have no answers about what happened. Mr Bane, the last person to have seen her,has declined detectives' request for an interview, according to police. Speaking toBBC Breakfast, from their home in Essex, Ms Heslop's parents said they ""still believe she will come back"" and just want to find her and uncover the truth. Ms Street said: ""I feel like I'm in a numb bubble - I can't bear anybody talking about her or looking sorry for me, it's just horrible. I wake up every morning and it's the same nightmare. ""I really believe in my heart that if she was gone I'd feel it - I still have hope."" Ms Heslop, a former flight attendant, had been staying and working with Mr Bane, a US citizen, on the catamaran Siren Song. She was known to have gone for dinner in St John, which was under a 22:00 local-time Covid curfew, with Mr Bane on 7 March. He reported her missing to police at 02:30 on 8 March - his call to the coastguard then took a further nine hours. Four months after she vanished, what happened to the former flight attendant is still not known ""It just drives me nuts. What happened between 02:00 and 11:45 in the morning? He didn't shout and holler - he didn't ask for nobody, he just made a phone call to the police. There's just no answers,"" Mr Heslop said. Ms Street added: ""We can't understand why it took him so long - there's such a time lapse and nobody has seen her since she left the restaurant. ""If you were that last person to see that person wouldn't you just go and answer the questions, be involved in the investigation, be there asking questions? ""Any person would surely do anything they could to help find somebody that he was supposed to love. What sort of human being wouldn't be there to help - he should just come forth and cooperate."" She added the only time she saw Mr Bane was ""when he called on that fateful day on WhatsApp"". Sarm Heslop had been staying on the catamaran Siren Song They want Mr Bane to come forward to police and a full forensic search to be carried out on the boat. Ms Heslop's possessions, including her bank cards and mobile phone, were found on the boat when she vanished. Following her disappearance, Virgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) searched the island and its coastline using divers, drones and dogs. In a statement issued at the time, VIPD spokesman Toby Derima said: ""Soon after reporting Ms Heslop missing, Mr Bane acquired the services of an attorney. ""Upon his attorney's advice, Mr Bane exercised his constitutional right to remain silent and denied officers' requests to search the vessel."" US citizen Ryan Bane reported Sarm Heslop missing to police at 02:30 on 8 March In April the force said detectives hadbeen unable to confirmif she was onboard the catamaran as reported by Mr Bane on 7 March. In its latest statement VIPD said: ""We would like to interview Ryan Bane. ""We cannot confirm Mr Bane's location, however, we urge him to make contact with us to aid us with this investigation."" Ms Heslop is known to have had dinner in St John with US citizen Mr Bane on 7 March Mr Bane's lawyer said: ""If Mr Bane's presence is legally required in the territory, he will return upon such a demand. ""He met with the US Coast Guard, answered all questions posed to him, and gave them unfettered access to the vessel as well as to Sarm's personal belongings including her phone and iPad. ""Mr Bane had nothing to do with Sarm's disappearance and remains heartbroken that she is missing."" Friends of Ms Heslop in the UK have offereda reward of up to $10,000for information and set up aMissing Sarm Heslop Facebook page,externalto share information about her disappearance.

'Ghost school' with no students for a second year,"Alison Drew says the language school in Scarborough should be crowded with students For English language schools, the vocabulary that's been most important in recent times has been ""empty"". Because since the pandemic began last year, many language schools have not had any overseas students to teach. Dan Methven, who teaches in the Anglolang school in Scarborough, says for two summers now they have had a ""ghost school"" without students. English UK, representing language schools, says the sector, worth Â£1.4bn each year, is in danger of collapse. Language schools have complained that their problems have been overlooked, with fee-paying overseas students still staying away because of worries about Covid and travel restrictions. At the Anglolang school, in the North Yorkshire resort town, there should be about 2,500 students coming for English lessons each year, from countries such as Spain and Italy, says academic manager Alison Drew. ""We're a forgotten industry,"" she says, walking through empty classrooms and the school's big garden which would usually be packed with teenagers heading out on trips. In a series of special reports, BBC News has been looking at the challenges and opportunities in seaside towns such as Scarborough. Zoom workers moving to new seaside homes Seaside poor health overlooked, warns Whitty My seaside hometown's changing fortunes, by BBC arts correspondent David Sillito Meet Mick, Scarborough's fly-tipping 'hero' As well as the worsening financial pressure on the school, she says there is a wider loss to the seaside town's local economy. ""Students pay to stay with host families, we take them out on excursions, 10 coaches at a time. There's a knock-on effect,"" she says. The doors are open but there are no students to teach this summer ""Imagine any business with 16 months of no money,"" says Mr Methven, a senior teacher at the school. ""Missing one summer was inconceivable, missing two is ridiculous."" He says while other parts of tourism and hospitality are getting back on their feet, language schools are still effectively closed, when parents are unwilling to risk sending their children overseas during the pandemic. The cancellations started before the official lockdown last March, he says, and in such a seasonal business this year has more or less been written off, meaning it will have been two years without students. As well as the town's missing income, the teachers are disappointed about the cultural exchanges being lost. ""It's a really important part of young people's lives, the first time they've been away from home,"" says Mr Methven. Staff at the Anglolang school have been furloughed, but the teachers are worried about how long such private schools can survive. A group of 36 MPs have written to Boris Johnson calling for support for a language-teaching sector they say is of ""huge national strategic importance"". The MPs warn that many language schools are on the ""brink of collapse"", putting at risk 35,000 jobs and the Â£1.4bn brought each year into local economies. The wider seaside economy is losing out from the lack of language students ""As a seasonal industry relying on inbound tourism, there is a very real risk that many of these businesses will close,"" says the letter signed by MPs, including Andrew Lewer and Sir Graham Brady. Jodie Grey, chief executive of English UK, said: ""We cannot now see any prospect of significant recovery until 2022."" She said some language schools, such as Anglolang, had received help with business rates from councils - but others were still facing charges which she said could force them to close. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business (BEIS) said: ""We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on businesses, including English language schools, which is why we have backed them with our unprecedented Â£352bn package of support. ""The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is also in place until September, and eligible businesses continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year, VAT cuts and the Recovery Loan Scheme.""

Food workers given exemption from Covid isolationIceland warns the move will not solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves.BusinessComments,"New Covid daily contact testing sites for workers at supermarket depots and food manufacturers won't begin operating until next week. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers in England will be exempt from quarantine rules as the government tries to prevent food supply problems. The government had initially promised to begin testing at 15 ""crucial"" supermarket depots on Friday. But the BBC has learned that testing will be delayed until Monday 26 July. Up to 10,000 staff are expected to qualify for the scheme, but supermarket workers are not included. Earlier on Friday, the Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: ""We've identified 15 depots covering around five supermarkets where they have the most acute problem with staff absences at the moment and we intend to roll that out today. They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites."" However, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started. ""No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,"" he said. He added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets say shortages not widespread Warning that 'pingdemic' threatens shop openings The move comes after thehigh number of retail staff self-isolatingaffected the availability of some products. Iceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves. ""The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,"" said Iceland boss Richard Walker. Initially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. It will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated. Krissy Fremont says she is driving delivery vans because many of Birchall Foodservice's drivers are self-isolating Krissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes. She says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. ""We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,"" she told the BBC. ""We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case."" She says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. ""So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,"" she said. ""We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out."" The scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. M&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. But it said more needed to be done to ""mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace"". Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a ""really significant undertaking"". ""You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system."" However, he added that the government would keep the policy ""under review, but we think this is a sensible first step"". ""We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,"" he added. The government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the ""pingdemic"" keeping staff away from work. Arecord 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid appbetween 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. While some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said ""disruption is limited at the moment"", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary. Separately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated. This scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. Are you a food worker? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, ""it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high"". CBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: ""The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up.""

Phil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was ""a step in the right direction"". ""People having to isolate meant that a number of our suppliers, the service providers that are doing the transport for us, have just said they cannot cope.

""If you think of the food chain as just that - as a chain, and like any chain, you're only as good as the weakest link - if you cannot get your goods to the market, then you've got a problem,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

Food workers given exemption from Covid isolation,"New Covid daily contact testing sites for workers at supermarket depots and food manufacturers won't begin operating until next week. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers in England will be exempt from quarantine rules as the government tries to prevent food supply problems. The government had initially promised to begin testing at 15 ""crucial"" supermarket depots on Friday. But the BBC has learned that testing will be delayed until Monday 26 July. Up to 10,000 staff are expected to qualify for the scheme, but supermarket workers are not included. Earlier on Friday, the Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: ""We've identified 15 depots covering around five supermarkets where they have the most acute problem with staff absences at the moment and we intend to roll that out today. They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites."" However, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started. ""No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,"" he said. He added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets say shortages not widespread Warning that 'pingdemic' threatens shop openings The move comes after thehigh number of retail staff self-isolatingaffected the availability of some products. Iceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves. ""The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,"" said Iceland boss Richard Walker. Initially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. It will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated. Krissy Fremont says she is driving delivery vans because many of Birchall Foodservice's drivers are self-isolating Krissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes. She says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. ""We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,"" she told the BBC. ""We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case."" She says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. ""So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,"" she said. ""We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out."" The scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. M&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. But it said more needed to be done to ""mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace"". Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a ""really significant undertaking"". ""You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system."" However, he added that the government would keep the policy ""under review, but we think this is a sensible first step"". ""We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,"" he added. The government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the ""pingdemic"" keeping staff away from work. Arecord 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid appbetween 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. While some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said ""disruption is limited at the moment"", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary. Separately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated. This scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. Are you a food worker? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, ""it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high"". CBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: ""The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up."" Businesses have already exhausted contingency plans to get in extra staff and are ""at risk of grinding to a halt in the next few weeks"", he added. Phil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was ""a step in the right direction"".

People splash out on food and drink for Euro 2020,"Retail sales in the UK rose between May and June, boosted by demand for food and drink as millions watched the Euro 2020 football tournament. Sales rose 0.5% month-on-month following a drop in May, official figures showed. Growth came from ""food and drink sales, boosted by football fans across Britain enjoying the Euros"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. June retail sales were 9.5% higher than before the pandemic in February 2020. The largest contribution to total retail sales growth in June was from food shops where sales rose by 4.2%. Supermarkets sales had dropped in May as shoppers chose to dine out after some Covid restrictions were lifted in the hospitality sector. The ONS said: ""Feedback from some retailers suggested that sales were positively boosted in June by the start of the Euro 2020 football championship."" Conversely, sales at non-food shops dropped by 1.7% between May and June, with a sharp fall in demand for furniture and clothing. The ONS said sales of petrol and diesel rose by 2.3% ""as people continued to increase their amount of travel"". But it said sales of automotive fuel remain 2,1% below pre-pandemic levels. Coronavirus restrictions easing explained the sharp monthly rise in sales in April; non-essential shops reopened and there was pent-up demand. There was subsequent a drop in May, the month hospitality re-started outdoors so people could eat out again. With no big changes of restrictions in June, the overall number is less dramatic. But retailers are likely to view these figures as encouraging, especially with June sales more than 9% above pre-virus levels. Despite a small fall, internet shopping still accounted for comfortably over a quarter of spending. That's still a greater proportion than before the pandemic. Further evidence of how the past 18 months have shifted consumer behaviour, potentially for good. Total retail sales for June were better than an expected 0.1% fall. Aled Patchett, head of retail and consumer goods at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Retailers will be hoping June marked the start of the turnaround they have been hoping for."" He added: ""All eyes now are on the impact of the gradual unlocking of society across the UK. On the surface the easing of restrictions and commuters returning back to city centre offices should be good news for the sector, but workers having to self-isolate means many businesses are reporting a shortage of staff just as demand looks likely to peak."" People continued to shop online but the amount they spent fell by 4.7% between May and June in all sectors except for clothing. The overall proportion of retail spending online fell to 26.7% from 28.4% in May, the fourth consecutive monthly fall. ""Retailers suggested that the easing of retail restrictions had affected online sales as consumers returned to physical stores,"" said the ONS.

Olympic men's football players to watch,"The Olympics football kicks off on July 21 Euro 2020 and the Copa America may be over, but the summer of international tournament football is not done yet. The Tokyo Olympics is just around the corner and some well-known faces, as well as some stars of tomorrow, will be going for gold. The Team GB women's squad will be going for glory in Tokyo, and, even without a British man's team going, there is plenty to look forward to in the men's competition. Two groups of four teams will compete for gold between 21 July and 7 August. Typically, each team must select a squad of players under the age of 23 with three designated over-age players, but because the Olympics was delayed by a year due to Covid-19, that has been changed to under 24, meaning players must be born after 1 January 1997. Teams qualified through each regional confederation's respective developmental tournament, for example the 2019 European Under-21 Championships, which has seen Spain, Romania, France and Germany reach Tokyo. In 2012, when London was hosting, Team GB put forward a men's team for the first time. But subsequent attempts to re-form in 2016 were shelved after the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations didn't back the plans and they haven't been tried again. Because of England's failure to get out of the groups at the Under-21 Euros, Team GB wouldn't have qualified anyway. However, Tokyo 2020 will be Great Britain's women's second appearance at the tournament. Superstars including Neymar and Lionel Messi have competed in the past and won gold. Here are some of the teams and players to watch at this Games... Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli will represent Brazil in Tokyo Gold medallists from five years ago when they hosted the Games in Rio, Brazil will once again be red hot favourites to defend their crown. Notable members of this squad include Arsenal strikerGabriel Martinelli,Reinier, a midfielder on loan from Real Madrid at Borussia Dortmund, and perhaps their key player, Everton'sRicharlison,who helped the senior side to the Copa America final earlier in the summer. Eleven of the 22 players selected currently ply their trade outside their homeland, including Aston Villa midfielderDouglas Luiz. Having initially turned down requests for 24-year-old Richarlison to head to the Games, the Toffees relented and allowed him to go. But having played so much football since the end of last season, it is unlikely he'll return for Rafael Benitez's Premier League game against Southampton just a week after the Olympic men's football final. Hertha Berlin strikerMatheus Cunhais another talent worth watching, having scored seven goals in the struggling Bundesliga side last term. Sevilla defenderDiego Carlos, 28, and Barcelona legendDani Alves,now 38 and with Sao Paolo, join Athletico Paranaense goalkeeperSantos, 31, as the overaged contingent. Six Spain players from Euro 2020 including Unai Simon, Pedri and Dani Olmo have been selected No fewer than six players from Luis Enrique's Euro 2020 squad have been chosen to represent La Roja again. That list includes 17-year-oldPedri,who was a breakout star at the tournament having impressed at Barcelona last season, Real Sociedad'sMikel Oyarzabal, Dani Olmoof RB Leipzig, Athletic Bilbao goalkeeperUnai Simon, Eric Garcia,formerly of Manchester City and now Barcelona and Villarreal'sPau Torres. Their three designated older players were not involved in Spain's journey to the Euros semi-finals:Mikel Merino,once of Newcastle United and now Real Sociedad, former Arsenal loaneeDani Ceballos,and Real Madrid wingerMarco Asensio,all of whom will be 25 during the Games, are their choices. StrikerRafa Mircould be something of a wildcard. Despite joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2018, he is yet to make a mark at Molineux, but he enjoyed an impressive season in La Liga despite getting relegated with Huesca, scoring 13 goals in 38 games. Manchester United's Amad Diallo will play for Ivory Coast There will be a number of players familiar to those who watch the English top flight, including Burnley strikerChris Wood,who will be looking to lead the line for New Zealand as one of their over-aged selections. The 29-year-old has scored 24 goals in 57 appearances for the All Whites since making his debut in 2009. West Ham defenderWinston Reid,33, who spent last season on loan at Brentford, is also in their squad. Manchester United defenderEric Bailly, 27, will be there for Ivory Coast alongside clubmateAmad Diallo,the exciting teenage winger who joined the Red Devils from Atalanta last season. Interestingly, Tottenham Hotspur starSonHeung-minhas been left out of South Korea's squad despite the 28-year-old being given the green light by his club, because coach Hak-bum Kim says his fitness needs to be protected. Liverpool'sMohamed Salahhas been left out of Egypt's squad, despite being named provisionally. Takefusa Kubo is the hosts' big hope There are a number of exciting prospects looking to make a name for themselves. Argentina'sEsequiel Barcois a pacey, dynamic winger currently with Atlanta United in Major League Soccer. He'll be hoping to help La Albiceleste win gold for the first time since 2008. Japan hold home advantage, which could be key, andTakefusa Kubowill be a big player for them. The Real Madrid playmaker is only 20 and hasn't played for Los Blancos yet but has begun to establish himself in Spain through loan spells at Real Mallorca, Villarreal and Getafe. France's depth of youth is evident again, despite Rennes objecting to midfield sensationEduardo Camavingabeing included in their squad. BothAndre Pierre-Gignac,35, and former Newcastle wingerFlorian Thauvin,28, who now play for Tigres in Mexico, join the overage list.Maximilian Arnold,27, andMax Kruse,33, are the biggest names in Stefan Kuntz's Germany side.

The 'pingdemic' in Scotland,"The 'pingdemic' in England is causing havoc with its workforce and economy, bringing knock-on effects to supply chains in other parts of the UK. Scotland's contact tracing app is supposed to have the same sensitivity. There are other reasons that might explain a much lower 'ping' rate. The ""United Pingdom"" can get as technologically diverse as its politics. Scotland seems to be avoiding the huge hit to business from the NHS Covid app in England, sending vast numbers of ""pings"" that tell people they have to self-isolate. In only one week this month, England had 520,000 pings of the contact-tracing app. Entire business critical teams are off work. More than a 10th of workers in Sunderland's Nissan plant are off. It's affecting the teams that make sea ports function. Around 900 workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant were sent home after being told to self-isolate Warehouse workers are decimated. The existing difficulties with a big shortage of lorry drivers, due to Brexit and a backlog of driver tests, are being made much worse. Businesses are being forced toclose, cut shifts or reduce opening hours. Goods are not being picked up on schedule, and deliveries are being delayed. That could soon begin to affect fuel supplies to petrol stations. The knock-on effect of disruption in warehouses and supply chains is affecting the supply of goods into other parts of the UK, with fresh food the first to become obvious. Yet the root problem of the contact-tracing app - doing its job assiduously, we have to assume, rather than simply going rogue - is not affecting Scotland to anything like the same extent. Why? I've been trying to find out. Since its launch last September, the Protect Scotland app has had fewer than 60,000 notification ""pings"" in total, which should be for those within two metres of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. That could be explained by different patterns of infection. And although Scottish infections have very recently been falling while English ones rise, the patterns have not been so different that they could be the only explanation. A further reason may be that the NHS England app is combined with a code scanner with which people can register their presence in a restaurant or pub. The Scottish app lacks that incentive to download it, and to keep it active. Figures show around half of those who originally downloaded the Scottish appno longer have it active.  There is no equivalent figure for the English app. In England, any positive Covid test will be automatically registered through the app Asked at a media briefing earlier this week why there are far fewer app pings, the deputy chief medical officer, Nicola Steedman, explained the software is more complex in the English app, but no less sensitive. While the difference may reflect the falling number of infections in Scotland, she also suggested it has to to do with those asked to key in a code to say they have had a positive test. In England, if you book a Covid test through the app, any positive result will be automatically registered. In Scotland, it requires the affected person to do that. It is anonymous, so there is no penalty for failing to do so, but Dr Steedman called on people to help the test and protect system by doing so. Larry Breen is head of health and life sciences at NearForm, the Irish company that designed the Protect Scotland app. The Irish software firm provides a similar service to Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Jersey, Gibraltar, New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia and Delaware. He can explain how his system works, but isn't able to say how the English one is different. He confirms, however, that it is more complex than ""deployed in the marketplace elsewhere"". Bluetooth technology can be set to register every connection as you walk down the street The technology depends on Bluetooth connections with other smart phones in proximity. As you walk down the street, it can be set to register everyone you pass within, say, five metres. That would create a very high level of connection. So different variables can be set, primarily those of distance and time. Scotland and England are both supposed to be set to the same: up to two metres proximity for 15 minutes. Is there any way of knowing the non-compliance rate of those Scots being pinged with a positive infection, and then failing to register that with the system?  No. The Scottish app is ""privacy-preserving first"".  It's completely anonymised. It is possible to see what happens on the app, but obviously impossible to tell when and where it's being ignored.

"Road schemes can ignore climate, campaigners claimGovernment guidelines mean road planners can effectively ignore climate change, campaigners say.BusinessComments","Planners can effectively ignore climate change when they are deciding whether to grant permission for new road schemes, environmentalists have said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has promised a review of Â£27bn highways policy which will be completed within two years. But in the meantime, planners can use existing guidelines. Campaigners say these ignore the cumulative effects of major road projects. They say Mr Shapps should be blocking new schemes until a new climate-friendly policy is developed. Climate change: US pushes China to make faster carbon cuts Climate change: Airbus aims for 'climate-neutral' flights by 2035 Many scientists say no new infrastructure should be built unless it is low-carbon. The debate has been raised because government policies for infrastructure were devised before ministers committed to virtually abolishing carbon emissions for the whole UK economy. The policy debate is still catching up. Currently guidance to planners states: âAny increase in carbon emissions is not a reason to refuse development consent, unless the increase in carbon emissions resulting from the proposed scheme are so significant that it would have a material impact on the ability of government to meet its carbon reduction targets.â Campaigners say the government must take account of the cumulative climate effect of its entire roads programme â not just of individual schemes. They have been chivvying Mr Shapps for 18 months to update the roads strategy to combat the climate crisis. He has now promised to review it â but not for up to two years. Chris Todd, from Transport Action Network, said, ""As our roads melt and places around the world face record temperatures and floods, the words âclimate emergencyâ appear to have no meaning within the Department for Transport. âInstead, all we seem to get are delay, delay and yet more delay. Having now finally accepted the inevitable, Mr Shapps is still fiddling while the planet burns.â Mr Todd said the test for carbon in the guidelines was ""utterly ridiculous"". ""A road scheme's emissions, however large, are never going to be significant compared to a five year carbon budget for the whole of the UK,"" he said. ""It's high time the government corrected this ludicrous state of affairs."" AA president Edmund King has called for better rural broadband However, Edmund King, AA president, said that zero emission cars will still need roads to drive on. âSo while it is correct to review the roads programme and especially the expansion of smart motorways, it is naÃ¯ve to think we wouldnât need to sort out the bottlenecks and dangerous hotspots.â Mr King, though, also wants amajor government investment in rural broadbandto reduce the need for travel. And Mr Shapps himself says hewants to get people out of their carsto reduce emissions and improve health. A government spokesman said that the Department for Transport and Highways England have both published ""ambitious plans to get to net zero highways"". ""This will see the UK rapidly cut carbon fromâ¯road construction, maintenance and operations, and support the transition to zero emission vehicles - putting roads at the heart of the low carbon economy,"" a spokesperson said. Among the schemes pending approval is the Lower Thames Crossing â a massive project that campaigners complain would produce over5 million tonnes,externalof carbon emissions. Other major schemes include: A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet A66 Northern Trans-Pennine A417 A27 Arundel Bypass A5036 Port of Liverpool A57 Link Roads A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Scheme Four A47 schemes in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk The campaigners also complain that smart motorways, which allow vehicles to run on the hard shoulder, are treated as permitted development without the need for planning permission or any assessment of carbon impacts. Emissions come from the creation of the road-building materials such as cement, as well as from petrol and diesel cars and lorries that will be using new road space.

"Road schemes can ignore climate, campaigners claim","Planners can effectively ignore climate change when they are deciding whether to grant permission for new road schemes, environmentalists have said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has promised a review of Â£27bn highways policy which will be completed within two years. But in the meantime, planners can use existing guidelines. Campaigners say these ignore the cumulative effects of major road projects. They say Mr Shapps should be blocking new schemes until a new climate-friendly policy is developed. Climate change: US pushes China to make faster carbon cuts Climate change: Airbus aims for 'climate-neutral' flights by 2035 Many scientists say no new infrastructure should be built unless it is low-carbon. The debate has been raised because government policies for infrastructure were devised before ministers committed to virtually abolishing carbon emissions for the whole UK economy. The policy debate is still catching up. Currently guidance to planners states: âAny increase in carbon emissions is not a reason to refuse development consent, unless the increase in carbon emissions resulting from the proposed scheme are so significant that it would have a material impact on the ability of government to meet its carbon reduction targets.â Campaigners say the government must take account of the cumulative climate effect of its entire roads programme â not just of individual schemes. They have been chivvying Mr Shapps for 18 months to update the roads strategy to combat the climate crisis. He has now promised to review it â but not for up to two years. Chris Todd, from Transport Action Network, said, ""As our roads melt and places around the world face record temperatures and floods, the words âclimate emergencyâ appear to have no meaning within the Department for Transport. âInstead, all we seem to get are delay, delay and yet more delay. Having now finally accepted the inevitable, Mr Shapps is still fiddling while the planet burns.â Mr Todd said the test for carbon in the guidelines was ""utterly ridiculous"". ""A road scheme's emissions, however large, are never going to be significant compared to a five year carbon budget for the whole of the UK,"" he said. ""It's high time the government corrected this ludicrous state of affairs."" AA president Edmund King has called for better rural broadband However, Edmund King, AA president, said that zero emission cars will still need roads to drive on. âSo while it is correct to review the roads programme and especially the expansion of smart motorways, it is naÃ¯ve to think we wouldnât need to sort out the bottlenecks and dangerous hotspots.â Mr King, though, also wants amajor government investment in rural broadbandto reduce the need for travel. And Mr Shapps himself says hewants to get people out of their carsto reduce emissions and improve health. A government spokesman said that the Department for Transport and Highways England have both published ""ambitious plans to get to net zero highways"". ""This will see the UK rapidly cut carbon fromâ¯road construction, maintenance and operations, and support the transition to zero emission vehicles - putting roads at the heart of the low carbon economy,"" a spokesperson said. Among the schemes pending approval is the Lower Thames Crossing â a massive project that campaigners complain would produce over5 million tonnes,externalof carbon emissions. Other major schemes include: A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet A66 Northern Trans-Pennine A417 A27 Arundel Bypass A5036 Port of Liverpool A57 Link Roads A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Scheme Four A47 schemes in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk The campaigners also complain that smart motorways, which allow vehicles to run on the hard shoulder, are treated as permitted development without the need for planning permission or any assessment of carbon impacts. Emissions come from the creation of the road-building materials such as cement, as well as from petrol and diesel cars and lorries that will be using new road space. Only last week Mr Shapps told holidaymakers they could carry on flying because technology would solve emissions from aviation. This flew in the face of a recommendation from the Climate Change Committee which says ministers must dampen the projected increase in demand for flying â as well as seeking technology solutions.

Which workers don't have to self-isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates soon. And here's a round-up of the key headlines in the UK today:  We're wrapping up our Covid live page coverage for the day soon, thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest developments from around the world:  As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the UK, Public Health England is warning thatthere is an increased risk of becoming reinfected with the Delta variantfirst identified in India if you have had Covid before. It says897 cases out of 68,688 Delta infections recorded in an 11-week period from April to June,externalwere possible reinfections. PHE said that further work is now being undertaken to examine the risk of reinfection. Meanwhile, swab tests conducted for the Office for National Statistics' infection survey suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus, up from one in 100 the week before - with the Delta strain accounting for almost every case. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2)currently accounts for 99% of new Covid cases in the UK, but UK officials say there is no evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Everyone wants to have passed the peak of the third wave and
be confident weâre on the home straight to normality. The data on daily cases looks positive. It was only a week
ago the UK shot above 50,000 cases for the first time since January. Now itâs closer to 36,000 after four consecutive days of
falling cases. Yet, it is still too soon to say weâve passed the peak. The impact of relaxing restrictions on 19 July has not yet
been seen in the data. It is also unclear how much Englandâs run to the final of
the Euros â cheered on in packed pubs â distorted trends by leading to a surge
in cases that has since calmed down. Health sources say there is still huge uncertainty about the
weeks to come, but it is possible we may not reach the 100,000 daily cases that
had been predicted. As always, closely monitoring the data in the weeks to come
will be crucial. We've been hearing a lot today about thegovernment's planto allow critical sectors in England to apply for named workers to be exempt from self-isolation and instead doing daily Covid testing. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has saidthe proposed scheme is ""undeliverable,""saying the list of 16 sectors earmarked for it would soon be ""significantly challenged"". John Foster, CBI director of policy said: ""If we want the economy to stay open, we need a confident but balanced plan."" He urged the government to bring forward the 16 August date from when fully-vaccinated people pinged by the NHS Covid app as close contacts do not have to self-isolate. Mr Foster also called for a test-and-release programme for people who are not double-vaccinated. The government's plans allow 16 key sectors in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers who are fully vaccinated. It covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. The Philippines has sent millions of children back into lockdown as fears rise over a Delta variant surge. Almost 50% of the 47 cases of the more virulent Delta strain detected so far were locally acquired, the health department said. There are now stricter limits on indoor dining, beauty salons and religious gatherings, while children aged five to 17 have been told to stay home. It comes just two weeks after a ban was lifted on minors going outside that had been in place since March 2020, but was often ignored. The rule had been justified on the grounds that young people were at risk of passing the virus on to older members of the family. The Philippines is struggling to vaccinate its population of 110 million due to short global supplies and logistical problems. More than 5 million people are fully vaccinated while 10.5 million have received their first jab. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Taking a moment to see what is going on elsewhere in the world - the Czech Republic has announced changes to restrictions on incoming travel from several European countries. The changes will come into effect on Monday. The Netherlands, Spain and the Balearic Islands will be moved into the dark red (very high risk) category. Greece and Monaco will be deemed as red (high risk), while Estonia will become orange (medium risk). The colour coding affects which tests visitors and returnees need to carry out and when. However, fully vaccinated citizens and residents of the Czech Republic will continue to be able to visit and return from them without having to do anything but fill in a passenger locator form. Meanwhile, Czechs will no longer be able to present a sworn statement saying they have tested negative using a self-testing kit or having been tested at work in order to enter restaurants, sports facilities etc. From now on it has to be proof of full vaccination, negative test in a certified lab or confirmation of previous infection to use such facilities. Meanwhile, another 43,000 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, while 174,742 have had a second dose, according to thegovernment's dashboard.,external Due to a technical issue, today's vaccination figures do not include data from Wales. So far, a total of 83,239,491 vaccinations have been given in the UK - with 46,476,845 first doses. Meanwhile, 36,762,646 people are now fully vaccinated - equal to 69.5% of the adult population. The UK has recorded 36,389 new coronavirus infections and a further 64 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. The latest update brings the cumulative total of positive cases to 5,637,975 and and the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test to 129,044. Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), but speaking in a personal capacity, has said asking people who are contact traced to take tests every day, for about five to seven days, can be as effective as asking them to quarantine for 10 days. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that was the result of modelling, which had been backed up by hard evidence from a randomised control trial done in children. ""The level of infection in schools where the students were asked to self-isolate was exactly the same as the level of infection in schools where they had the daily testing for contacts,"" he said. He added that the results of a another trial, a randomised control trial in the community, should give results ""in the coming weeks"". He said isolating cases, quarantining contacts or - ""if it's feasible"" - daily testing are ""really important measures"" to stop the epidemic getting worse. More than 3.6 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given in more than 190 countries worldwide. However, there arevast differences in the pace of progress across the globe. While some nations have secured and administered jabs to a large proportion of their population, others are some way behind. China and India have given the largest total number of doses, with about 1.5 billion (104.5 doses per 100 people) and 417 million (30.3 doses per 100 people) respectively. In the UK,more than 46 million people have had at least one dose of a vaccine. The UK roll-out is calculated at 124.3 doses per 100 people. While countries in Europe and the Americas are getting on well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa are experiencing supply issues. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. It can be kept in a normal fridge, which makes it easy to distribute and store. Meanwhile, more than 200 possible jabs continue to undergo trials around the world to test their efficacy and safety. Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, right, and her two St Andrews University friends received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland Three students have been refused exemption from travel quarantine rules because their vaccination certificates do not show they have had two jabs. The St Andrews University friends all received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland. But only the second jab shows up on their NHS Scotland paperwork - meaning they would have to isolate if they travel abroad. The Scottish government has said it is working to resolve the issue. From 19 July, adults in Scotland who were fully vaccinated in the UKno longer have to quarantine for 10 dayson return from amber-list countries, with the exception of France. PhD student Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, 28, fears the confusion between  may force her to miss her brother's wedding at home in Italy. ""I have been very careful to ensure I got both vaccines and had all the paperwork ready to travel,"" she says. She said she couldn't understand why the vaccination programmes in England and Scotland are ""struggling to match up people who have moved across the border"". ""I know there are many more people that have had similar experiences to me, and I don't think it's fair that we have to go through all of that.""  We told you earliercoronavirus infections have continued to risearound much of the UK, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Swab tests,externalin the community suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus in the week to 17 July, up from one in 100 the week before. You can see how cases are rising in the chart below. The chair of the parliamentary science and technology committee has said that a test-to-release system should start immediately. The government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England. If someone tests positive for the virus they will still be legally required to self-isolate. Conservative MP Greg Clark told Radio 4âs World at One programme that âmany people think that 10 days' isolation is pretty onerous and some of them will not comply with it"". Referring to the change of rules from 16 August, he said: ""I don't see why we can't begin that now."" Mr Clark cited experts who suggest this would be a sensible course of action, adding: ""Of course people testing positive for Covid need to isolate, but contacts should be able to take a test, and isolate if positive but go about their business if negative."" He said that would increase compliance levels as ""at the moment you have hundreds of thousands - and possibly millions of people eventually - who are told to isolate but are not convinced of the case for it"". An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m(5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". In a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" its chief executive said. Read the full story here. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has revealed it has been struggling to deliver
agreed amounts of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to Argentina. ""There has been a delay,"" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told a daily press briefing today after Argentina threatened to
cancel the contract. He added that Russia's sovereign wealth fund,RDIF, which
funded Sputnik V's development, was ""in touch with its partners to settle
the problems that have been arising"". Mr
Peskov implied that the delay in supplies to Argentina may have been
caused by the government's focus on demand at home. ""We've always said that the main priority is
satisfying Russians' demand for vaccination. You will know that the campaign of
total vaccination has been significantly stepped up, and citizens'
conscientiousness is constantly growing, vaccination is proceeding at an ever
faster pace. That's why this is a definite priority,"" he said. But he also gave assurances that ""commitments to foreign
markets including Argentina will definitely be met"". His
comments come after Argentine newspaper La Nacionpublished an email,externalsent
by key presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini to RDIF, in which
she complained of a ""very critical situation"" caused by the delay in
supplies of Sputnik V. ""The
entire contract is at risk of being publicly cancelled"" as Argentina is still waiting to
receive more than 18 million doses from Russia, she said. Argentina is
one of the first countries to widely use Sputnik V, and it has been used by the
Russian government as a showcase for its best-known vaccine. However, problems
fulfilling the contract may turn into a major obstacle to Moscowâs efforts to
market the jab abroad. The latest estimate of the reproduction (R) number in England - which measures how quickly the Covid virus is spreading - is unchanged from the previous week at 1.2 to 1.4, officials figures show. It means that on average, every 10 people infected with coronavirus goes on to infect between 12 and 14 others. However, the estimated daily growth rate shows signs of a possible slowdown. This week's estimate is that infections are growing at between 4% and 6% a day, down from between 4% and 7% last week. These estimates represent transmission which happened two to three weeks ago, due to a delay between people being infected, developing symptoms and needing healthcare. As we reported earlier, thousands of people have been heading to Suffolk for the Latitude Festival, which was cancelled last year because of the pandemic. The four-day music and arts festival - which began yesterday - is expected to attract about 40,000 people per day and is operating under a government event safety trial. Triathlete Libby Butler was determined to attend the festival and continue with her training. She's camping there all week and says she's been swimming in the lake on-site. ""I feel really safe,"" she says. ""Everyone is very much aware that Covid is still around and everybody is being really respectful. ""It is very odd. I live on my own in a little village in the Cotswolds so there are not many people about. So I found it very strange in the arena last night being around all of these people. ""I'm sure that will ease off as the weekend goes on and I'll be a bit more relaxed."" Josh Gosling, 18, who is enjoying his fourth Latitude Festival, says it's really nice to be back. ""It is the first big event we've had since lockdown so it was a bit weird really with having all the crowds and mingling with people."" Any concerns soon faded however he said he even enjoyed a spell of crowd surfing on Thursday night. ""Quite a lot of us have already had Covid in the past couple of months,"" says friend Gus Pater. ""So we all feel pretty confident about it and quite safe. ""I was fine with it [Covid], though I still can't smell anything. It kind of reassures me that I will be all right.""

Train companies have said they may have to reduce timetables to cope with shortages of staff forced to isolate by the NHS Covid app. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said that as Covid cases were increasing, more staff were being ""pinged"" by the app. Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Thameslink and Southern trains, has already announced it will introduce a reduced timetable from Monday 26 July. Meanwhile, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway have revealed it cancelled 600 trains last week as the number of staff self-isolating surged. The number of drivers self-isolating was 32 on 21 June and 131 a month later. London Northwestern services will change from Saturday with buses replacing trains on some  services and four services between Northampton and Euston being removed on weekdays GWR, Avanti, Thameslink and Southern will reduce services from Monday.

"Mum of woman who vanished from yacht 'has hope'Four months after she vanished, it is still not known what happened to Sarm Heslop.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","This video can not be played Sarm Heslop's parents said they ""still have hope"" she will be found The parents of a British woman who vanished from her boyfriend's yacht in the US Virgin Islands ""still have hope"" she will be found alive. Sarm Heslop, 41, from Southampton, was reported missing by Ryan Bane, from his boat off St John over four months ago. Peter Heslop and Brenda Street say they are in a ""living nightmare"" and still have no answers about what happened. Mr Bane, the last person to have seen her,has declined detectives' request for an interview, according to police. Speaking toBBC Breakfast, from their home in Essex, Ms Heslop's parents said they ""still believe she will come back"" and just want to find her and uncover the truth. Ms Street said: ""I feel like I'm in a numb bubble - I can't bear anybody talking about her or looking sorry for me, it's just horrible. I wake up every morning and it's the same nightmare. ""I really believe in my heart that if she was gone I'd feel it - I still have hope."" Ms Heslop, a former flight attendant, had been staying and working with Mr Bane, a US citizen, on the catamaran Siren Song. She was known to have gone for dinner in St John, which was under a 22:00 local-time Covid curfew, with Mr Bane on 7 March. He reported her missing to police at 02:30 on 8 March - his call to the coastguard then took a further nine hours. Four months after she vanished, what happened to the former flight attendant is still not known ""It just drives me nuts. What happened between 02:00 and 11:45 in the morning? He didn't shout and holler - he didn't ask for nobody, he just made a phone call to the police. There's just no answers,"" Mr Heslop said. Ms Street added: ""We can't understand why it took him so long - there's such a time lapse and nobody has seen her since she left the restaurant. ""If you were that last person to see that person wouldn't you just go and answer the questions, be involved in the investigation, be there asking questions? ""Any person would surely do anything they could to help find somebody that he was supposed to love. What sort of human being wouldn't be there to help - he should just come forth and cooperate."" She added the only time she saw Mr Bane was ""when he called on that fateful day on WhatsApp"". Sarm Heslop had been staying on the catamaran Siren Song They want Mr Bane to come forward to police and a full forensic search to be carried out on the boat. Ms Heslop's possessions, including her bank cards and mobile phone, were found on the boat when she vanished. Following her disappearance, Virgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) searched the island and its coastline using divers, drones and dogs. In a statement issued at the time, VIPD spokesman Toby Derima said: ""Soon after reporting Ms Heslop missing, Mr Bane acquired the services of an attorney.

It was written by Hazel Shearing, Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Mary O'Connor and Kelly Leigh-Cooper and edited by Vanessa Barford, Holly Wallis and Jenny Matthews. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates soon. And here's a round-up of the key headlines in the UK today:  We're wrapping up our Covid live page coverage for the day soon, thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest developments from around the world:  As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the UK, Public Health England is warning thatthere is an increased risk of becoming reinfected with the Delta variantfirst identified in India if you have had Covid before. It says897 cases out of 68,688 Delta infections recorded in an 11-week period from April to June,externalwere possible reinfections. PHE said that further work is now being undertaken to examine the risk of reinfection. Meanwhile, swab tests conducted for the Office for National Statistics' infection survey suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus, up from one in 100 the week before - with the Delta strain accounting for almost every case. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2)currently accounts for 99% of new Covid cases in the UK, but UK officials say there is no evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Everyone wants to have passed the peak of the third wave and
be confident weâre on the home straight to normality. The data on daily cases looks positive. It was only a week
ago the UK shot above 50,000 cases for the first time since January. Now itâs closer to 36,000 after four consecutive days of
falling cases. Yet, it is still too soon to say weâve passed the peak. The impact of relaxing restrictions on 19 July has not yet
been seen in the data. It is also unclear how much Englandâs run to the final of
the Euros â cheered on in packed pubs â distorted trends by leading to a surge
in cases that has since calmed down. Health sources say there is still huge uncertainty about the
weeks to come, but it is possible we may not reach the 100,000 daily cases that
had been predicted. As always, closely monitoring the data in the weeks to come
will be crucial. We've been hearing a lot today about thegovernment's planto allow critical sectors in England to apply for named workers to be exempt from self-isolation and instead doing daily Covid testing. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has saidthe proposed scheme is ""undeliverable,""saying the list of 16 sectors earmarked for it would soon be ""significantly challenged"". John Foster, CBI director of policy said: ""If we want the economy to stay open, we need a confident but balanced plan."" He urged the government to bring forward the 16 August date from when fully-vaccinated people pinged by the NHS Covid app as close contacts do not have to self-isolate. Mr Foster also called for a test-and-release programme for people who are not double-vaccinated. The government's plans allow 16 key sectors in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers who are fully vaccinated. It covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. The Philippines has sent millions of children back into lockdown as fears rise over a Delta variant surge. Almost 50% of the 47 cases of the more virulent Delta strain detected so far were locally acquired, the health department said. There are now stricter limits on indoor dining, beauty salons and religious gatherings, while children aged five to 17 have been told to stay home. It comes just two weeks after a ban was lifted on minors going outside that had been in place since March 2020, but was often ignored. The rule had been justified on the grounds that young people were at risk of passing the virus on to older members of the family. The Philippines is struggling to vaccinate its population of 110 million due to short global supplies and logistical problems. More than 5 million people are fully vaccinated while 10.5 million have received their first jab. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Taking a moment to see what is going on elsewhere in the world - the Czech Republic has announced changes to restrictions on incoming travel from several European countries. The changes will come into effect on Monday. The Netherlands, Spain and the Balearic Islands will be moved into the dark red (very high risk) category. Greece and Monaco will be deemed as red (high risk), while Estonia will become orange (medium risk). The colour coding affects which tests visitors and returnees need to carry out and when. However, fully vaccinated citizens and residents of the Czech Republic will continue to be able to visit and return from them without having to do anything but fill in a passenger locator form. Meanwhile, Czechs will no longer be able to present a sworn statement saying they have tested negative using a self-testing kit or having been tested at work in order to enter restaurants, sports facilities etc. From now on it has to be proof of full vaccination, negative test in a certified lab or confirmation of previous infection to use such facilities. Meanwhile, another 43,000 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, while 174,742 have had a second dose, according to thegovernment's dashboard.,external Due to a technical issue, today's vaccination figures do not include data from Wales. So far, a total of 83,239,491 vaccinations have been given in the UK - with 46,476,845 first doses. Meanwhile, 36,762,646 people are now fully vaccinated - equal to 69.5% of the adult population. The UK has recorded 36,389 new coronavirus infections and a further 64 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. The latest update brings the cumulative total of positive cases to 5,637,975 and and the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test to 129,044. Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), but speaking in a personal capacity, has said asking people who are contact traced to take tests every day, for about five to seven days, can be as effective as asking them to quarantine for 10 days. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that was the result of modelling, which had been backed up by hard evidence from a randomised control trial done in children. ""The level of infection in schools where the students were asked to self-isolate was exactly the same as the level of infection in schools where they had the daily testing for contacts,"" he said. He added that the results of a another trial, a randomised control trial in the community, should give results ""in the coming weeks"". He said isolating cases, quarantining contacts or - ""if it's feasible"" - daily testing are ""really important measures"" to stop the epidemic getting worse. More than 3.6 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given in more than 190 countries worldwide. However, there arevast differences in the pace of progress across the globe. While some nations have secured and administered jabs to a large proportion of their population, others are some way behind. China and India have given the largest total number of doses, with about 1.5 billion (104.5 doses per 100 people) and 417 million (30.3 doses per 100 people) respectively. In the UK,more than 46 million people have had at least one dose of a vaccine. The UK roll-out is calculated at 124.3 doses per 100 people. While countries in Europe and the Americas are getting on well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa are experiencing supply issues. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. It can be kept in a normal fridge, which makes it easy to distribute and store. Meanwhile, more than 200 possible jabs continue to undergo trials around the world to test their efficacy and safety. Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, right, and her two St Andrews University friends received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland Three students have been refused exemption from travel quarantine rules because their vaccination certificates do not show they have had two jabs. The St Andrews University friends all received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland. But only the second jab shows up on their NHS Scotland paperwork - meaning they would have to isolate if they travel abroad. The Scottish government has said it is working to resolve the issue. From 19 July, adults in Scotland who were fully vaccinated in the UKno longer have to quarantine for 10 dayson return from amber-list countries, with the exception of France. PhD student Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, 28, fears the confusion between  may force her to miss her brother's wedding at home in Italy. ""I have been very careful to ensure I got both vaccines and had all the paperwork ready to travel,"" she says. She said she couldn't understand why the vaccination programmes in England and Scotland are ""struggling to match up people who have moved across the border"". ""I know there are many more people that have had similar experiences to me, and I don't think it's fair that we have to go through all of that.""  We told you earliercoronavirus infections have continued to risearound much of the UK, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Swab tests,externalin the community suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus in the week to 17 July, up from one in 100 the week before. You can see how cases are rising in the chart below. The chair of the parliamentary science and technology committee has said that a test-to-release system should start immediately. The government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England. If someone tests positive for the virus they will still be legally required to self-isolate. Conservative MP Greg Clark told Radio 4âs World at One programme that âmany people think that 10 days' isolation is pretty onerous and some of them will not comply with it"". Referring to the change of rules from 16 August, he said: ""I don't see why we can't begin that now."" Mr Clark cited experts who suggest this would be a sensible course of action, adding: ""Of course people testing positive for Covid need to isolate, but contacts should be able to take a test, and isolate if positive but go about their business if negative."" He said that would increase compliance levels as ""at the moment you have hundreds of thousands - and possibly millions of people eventually - who are told to isolate but are not convinced of the case for it"". An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m(5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". In a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" its chief executive said. Read the full story here. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has revealed it has been struggling to deliver
agreed amounts of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to Argentina. ""There has been a delay,"" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told a daily press briefing today after Argentina threatened to
cancel the contract. He added that Russia's sovereign wealth fund,RDIF, which
funded Sputnik V's development, was ""in touch with its partners to settle
the problems that have been arising"". Mr
Peskov implied that the delay in supplies to Argentina may have been
caused by the government's focus on demand at home. ""We've always said that the main priority is
satisfying Russians' demand for vaccination. You will know that the campaign of
total vaccination has been significantly stepped up, and citizens'
conscientiousness is constantly growing, vaccination is proceeding at an ever
faster pace. That's why this is a definite priority,"" he said. But he also gave assurances that ""commitments to foreign
markets including Argentina will definitely be met"". His
comments come after Argentine newspaper La Nacionpublished an email,externalsent
by key presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini to RDIF, in which
she complained of a ""very critical situation"" caused by the delay in
supplies of Sputnik V. ""The
entire contract is at risk of being publicly cancelled"" as Argentina is still waiting to
receive more than 18 million doses from Russia, she said. Argentina is
one of the first countries to widely use Sputnik V, and it has been used by the
Russian government as a showcase for its best-known vaccine. However, problems
fulfilling the contract may turn into a major obstacle to Moscowâs efforts to
market the jab abroad. The latest estimate of the reproduction (R) number in England - which measures how quickly the Covid virus is spreading - is unchanged from the previous week at 1.2 to 1.4, officials figures show. It means that on average, every 10 people infected with coronavirus goes on to infect between 12 and 14 others. However, the estimated daily growth rate shows signs of a possible slowdown. This week's estimate is that infections are growing at between 4% and 6% a day, down from between 4% and 7% last week. These estimates represent transmission which happened two to three weeks ago, due to a delay between people being infected, developing symptoms and needing healthcare. As we reported earlier, thousands of people have been heading to Suffolk for the Latitude Festival, which was cancelled last year because of the pandemic. The four-day music and arts festival - which began yesterday - is expected to attract about 40,000 people per day and is operating under a government event safety trial. Triathlete Libby Butler was determined to attend the festival and continue with her training. She's camping there all week and says she's been swimming in the lake on-site. ""I feel really safe,"" she says. ""Everyone is very much aware that Covid is still around and everybody is being really respectful. ""It is very odd. I live on my own in a little village in the Cotswolds so there are not many people about. So I found it very strange in the arena last night being around all of these people. ""I'm sure that will ease off as the weekend goes on and I'll be a bit more relaxed."" Josh Gosling, 18, who is enjoying his fourth Latitude Festival, says it's really nice to be back. ""It is the first big event we've had since lockdown so it was a bit weird really with having all the crowds and mingling with people."" Any concerns soon faded however he said he even enjoyed a spell of crowd surfing on Thursday night. ""Quite a lot of us have already had Covid in the past couple of months,"" says friend Gus Pater. ""So we all feel pretty confident about it and quite safe. ""I was fine with it [Covid], though I still can't smell anything. It kind of reassures me that I will be all right.""

Train companies have said they may have to reduce timetables to cope with shortages of staff forced to isolate by the NHS Covid app. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said that as Covid cases were increasing, more staff were being ""pinged"" by the app. Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Thameslink and Southern trains, has already announced it will introduce a reduced timetable from Monday 26 July. Meanwhile, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway have revealed it cancelled 600 trains last week as the number of staff self-isolating surged. The number of drivers self-isolating was 32 on 21 June and 131 a month later. London Northwestern services will change from Saturday with buses replacing trains on some  services and four services between Northampton and Euston being removed on weekdays GWR, Avanti, Thameslink and Southern will reduce services from Monday.

Government rules out Hancock private emails search,"The government has said it will not search the private email account of former Health Secretary Matt Hancock for discussions on official business. Downing Street has admitted Mr Hancock, who quit last month, used his personal address for this reason. The campaign group Good Law Project argued his inbox should be checked for the sake of transparency. But the government rejected this, saying a sweep of emails was ""neither necessary nor proportionate"". The Sunday Times has reported that, as a result of Mr Hancock's use of his personal account, the government does not have a record of much of his decision-making during the pandemic. This, it said, included negotiating PPE contracts, creating the test-and-trace programme and overseeing the care homes strategy. Can ministers use private emails for work? Gove loses 'private email' battle Ministers are not banned from using personal emails for work purposes. But, according toguidance,,externalthey should consider whether communications contain ""substantive discussions or decisions generated in the course of conducting government business"". If they do, ministers should ""take steps to ensure the relevant information is accessible"", such as copying emails from their personal account to a government account, so they are automatically stored on Whitehall systems. But the advice goes on to say that what counts as government business is not always ""clear cut"" - and that it is up to ministers themselves to decide. In a letter sent by its lawyers on 13 July, the Good Law Project asked the government to search the private email account of Mr Hancock, as well as those of health minister Lord Bethell, international trade minister Greg Hands and former Treasury minister Lord Deighton. It said this was a ""straightforward"" request that should be dealt with in a ""straightforward manner"". But the government responded that, in the course of a ""disclosure exercise"", it had already searched more than 1.4 million documents. It added: ""Nothing in those documents... indicated that it was necessary to search the private emails of the four named individuals to ensure that all relevant information and all material facts were put before the court in compliance with the duty of candour."" Responding to this, Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: ""We have arrived a rather bizarre situation. ""The government won't look to see what business [ministers] chose to use their private email addresses to conduct. ""They clearly don't want the public to know what's there - and perhaps they fear finding out themselves."" Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner described the government's response as ""completely unacceptable"". She added that emails sent and received by current and former ministers ""must be secured"" for any future public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic. The Cabinet Office - which co-ordinates government policy and sets guidelines for ministers' email use - declined to comment. Mr Hancockresigned as health secretarylast month after admitting breaching social distancing guidelines by kissing an aide in his government office. It was later reported by the Sunday Times that he and Lord Bethell had used their personal email accounts to conduct government business. Downing Street initially said this was not the case, but later corrected this statement. A spokesperson at the time said ministers could use ""various forms of communication as long as they take heed of the guidance"".

Food workers given exemption from Covid isolationKey parts of the food industry move to daily testing after isolating workers led to supply shortages.BusinessComments,"New Covid daily contact testing sites for workers at supermarket depots and food manufacturers won't begin operating until next week. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers in England will be exempt from quarantine rules as the government tries to prevent food supply problems. The government had initially promised to begin testing at 15 ""crucial"" supermarket depots on Friday. But the BBC has learned that testing will be delayed until Monday 26 July. Up to 10,000 staff are expected to qualify for the scheme, but supermarket workers are not included. Earlier on Friday, the Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: ""We've identified 15 depots covering around five supermarkets where they have the most acute problem with staff absences at the moment and we intend to roll that out today. They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites."" However, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started. ""No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,"" he said. He added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets say shortages not widespread Warning that 'pingdemic' threatens shop openings The move comes after thehigh number of retail staff self-isolatingaffected the availability of some products. Iceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves. ""The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,"" said Iceland boss Richard Walker. Initially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. It will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated. Krissy Fremont says she is driving delivery vans because many of Birchall Foodservice's drivers are self-isolating Krissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes. She says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. ""We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,"" she told the BBC. ""We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case."" She says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. ""So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,"" she said. ""We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out."" The scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. M&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. But it said more needed to be done to ""mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace"". Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a ""really significant undertaking"". ""You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system."" However, he added that the government would keep the policy ""under review, but we think this is a sensible first step"". ""We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,"" he added. The government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the ""pingdemic"" keeping staff away from work. Arecord 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid appbetween 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. While some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said ""disruption is limited at the moment"", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary. Separately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated. This scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. Are you a food worker? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, ""it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high"". CBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: ""The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up."" Businesses have already exhausted contingency plans to get in extra staff and are ""at risk of grinding to a halt in the next few weeks"", he added. Phil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was ""a step in the right direction"". ""People having to isolate meant that a number of our suppliers, the service providers that are doing the transport for us, have just said they cannot cope. Roughly half of the deliveries that we would expect to be done are not being done routinely and we're having to scramble to actually get product to its destination on time. ""If you think of the food chain as just that - as a chain, and like any chain, you're only as good as the weakest link - if you cannot get your goods to the market, then you've got a problem,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Scotland has also launcheda system of exemptions from self-isolation, covering workers in sectors such as health and social care. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily testing of food industry staff would ""minimise the disruption caused by rising cases in the coming weeks, while ensuring workers are not put at risk"".

LiveLiveDaily testing to tackle Covid app pings9 minutes ago,"The UK has reported 36,389 new coronavirus infections and a further 64 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Earlier data showed infections still rising in the UK, with community swab tests in England show one in every 75 people has the virus In Scotland it is one in 80, in Wales it is one in 210 and in Northern Ireland it is one in 170 Critical parts of the food industry will be allowed to do daily Covid testing instead of asking staff to self-isolate after bosses warned of severe staff shortages A more limited scheme will cover other key sectors in England, amid pressure to change the system as record number are ""pinged"" by NHS Covid-19 app School pupils who are close contacts of someone who tests positive could do daily rapid testing instead - study The opening ceremony for the delayed 2020 Olympic Games has taken place in Tokyo Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from today's live page team. It was written by Hazel Shearing, Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Mary O'Connor and Kelly Leigh-Cooper and edited by Vanessa Barford, Holly Wallis and Jenny Matthews. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates soon. And here's a round-up of the key headlines in the UK today:  We're wrapping up our Covid live page coverage for the day soon, thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest developments from around the world:  As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the UK, Public Health England is warning thatthere is an increased risk of becoming reinfected with the Delta variantfirst identified in India if you have had Covid before. It says897 cases out of 68,688 Delta infections recorded in an 11-week period from April to June,externalwere possible reinfections. PHE said that further work is now being undertaken to examine the risk of reinfection. Meanwhile, swab tests conducted for the Office for National Statistics' infection survey suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus, up from one in 100 the week before - with the Delta strain accounting for almost every case. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2)currently accounts for 99% of new Covid cases in the UK, but UK officials say there is no evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Everyone wants to have passed the peak of the third wave and
be confident weâre on the home straight to normality. The data on daily cases looks positive. It was only a week
ago the UK shot above 50,000 cases for the first time since January. Now itâs closer to 36,000 after four consecutive days of
falling cases. Yet, it is still too soon to say weâve passed the peak. The impact of relaxing restrictions on 19 July has not yet
been seen in the data. It is also unclear how much Englandâs run to the final of
the Euros â cheered on in packed pubs â distorted trends by leading to a surge
in cases that has since calmed down. Health sources say there is still huge uncertainty about the
weeks to come, but it is possible we may not reach the 100,000 daily cases that
had been predicted. As always, closely monitoring the data in the weeks to come
will be crucial. We've been hearing a lot today about thegovernment's planto allow critical sectors in England to apply for named workers to be exempt from self-isolation and instead doing daily Covid testing. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has saidthe proposed scheme is ""undeliverable,""saying the list of 16 sectors earmarked for it would soon be ""significantly challenged"". John Foster, CBI director of policy said: ""If we want the economy to stay open, we need a confident but balanced plan."" He urged the government to bring forward the 16 August date from when fully-vaccinated people pinged by the NHS Covid app as close contacts do not have to self-isolate. Mr Foster also called for a test-and-release programme for people who are not double-vaccinated. The government's plans allow 16 key sectors in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers who are fully vaccinated. It covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. The Philippines has sent millions of children back into lockdown as fears rise over a Delta variant surge. Almost 50% of the 47 cases of the more virulent Delta strain detected so far were locally acquired, the health department said. There are now stricter limits on indoor dining, beauty salons and religious gatherings, while children aged five to 17 have been told to stay home. It comes just two weeks after a ban was lifted on minors going outside that had been in place since March 2020, but was often ignored. The rule had been justified on the grounds that young people were at risk of passing the virus on to older members of the family. The Philippines is struggling to vaccinate its population of 110 million due to short global supplies and logistical problems. More than 5 million people are fully vaccinated while 10.5 million have received their first jab. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Taking a moment to see what is going on elsewhere in the world - the Czech Republic has announced changes to restrictions on incoming travel from several European countries. The changes will come into effect on Monday. The Netherlands, Spain and the Balearic Islands will be moved into the dark red (very high risk) category. Greece and Monaco will be deemed as red (high risk), while Estonia will become orange (medium risk). The colour coding affects which tests visitors and returnees need to carry out and when. However, fully vaccinated citizens and residents of the Czech Republic will continue to be able to visit and return from them without having to do anything but fill in a passenger locator form. Meanwhile, Czechs will no longer be able to present a sworn statement saying they have tested negative using a self-testing kit or having been tested at work in order to enter restaurants, sports facilities etc. From now on it has to be proof of full vaccination, negative test in a certified lab or confirmation of previous infection to use such facilities. Meanwhile, another 43,000 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, while 174,742 have had a second dose, according to thegovernment's dashboard.,external Due to a technical issue, today's vaccination figures do not include data from Wales. So far, a total of 83,239,491 vaccinations have been given in the UK - with 46,476,845 first doses. Meanwhile, 36,762,646 people are now fully vaccinated - equal to 69.5% of the adult population. The UK has recorded 36,389 new coronavirus infections and a further 64 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. The latest update brings the cumulative total of positive cases to 5,637,975 and and the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test to 129,044. Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), but speaking in a personal capacity, has said asking people who are contact traced to take tests every day, for about five to seven days, can be as effective as asking them to quarantine for 10 days. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that was the result of modelling, which had been backed up by hard evidence from a randomised control trial done in children. ""The level of infection in schools where the students were asked to self-isolate was exactly the same as the level of infection in schools where they had the daily testing for contacts,"" he said. He added that the results of a another trial, a randomised control trial in the community, should give results ""in the coming weeks"". He said isolating cases, quarantining contacts or - ""if it's feasible"" - daily testing are ""really important measures"" to stop the epidemic getting worse. More than 3.6 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given in more than 190 countries worldwide. However, there arevast differences in the pace of progress across the globe. While some nations have secured and administered jabs to a large proportion of their population, others are some way behind. China and India have given the largest total number of doses, with about 1.5 billion (104.5 doses per 100 people) and 417 million (30.3 doses per 100 people) respectively. In the UK,more than 46 million people have had at least one dose of a vaccine. The UK roll-out is calculated at 124.3 doses per 100 people. While countries in Europe and the Americas are getting on well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa are experiencing supply issues. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. It can be kept in a normal fridge, which makes it easy to distribute and store. Meanwhile, more than 200 possible jabs continue to undergo trials around the world to test their efficacy and safety. Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, right, and her two St Andrews University friends received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland Three students have been refused exemption from travel quarantine rules because their vaccination certificates do not show they have had two jabs. The St Andrews University friends all received their first dose in England and their second in Scotland. But only the second jab shows up on their NHS Scotland paperwork - meaning they would have to isolate if they travel abroad. The Scottish government has said it is working to resolve the issue. From 19 July, adults in Scotland who were fully vaccinated in the UKno longer have to quarantine for 10 dayson return from amber-list countries, with the exception of France. PhD student Giulia Benedetta Calabrese, 28, fears the confusion between  may force her to miss her brother's wedding at home in Italy. ""I have been very careful to ensure I got both vaccines and had all the paperwork ready to travel,"" she says. She said she couldn't understand why the vaccination programmes in England and Scotland are ""struggling to match up people who have moved across the border"". ""I know there are many more people that have had similar experiences to me, and I don't think it's fair that we have to go through all of that.""  We told you earliercoronavirus infections have continued to risearound much of the UK, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Swab tests,externalin the community suggests 1.3% of the population - or one in 80 people - has the virus in the week to 17 July, up from one in 100 the week before. You can see how cases are rising in the chart below. The chair of the parliamentary science and technology committee has said that a test-to-release system should start immediately. The government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England. If someone tests positive for the virus they will still be legally required to self-isolate. Conservative MP Greg Clark told Radio 4âs World at One programme that âmany people think that 10 days' isolation is pretty onerous and some of them will not comply with it"". Referring to the change of rules from 16 August, he said: ""I don't see why we can't begin that now."" Mr Clark cited experts who suggest this would be a sensible course of action, adding: ""Of course people testing positive for Covid need to isolate, but contacts should be able to take a test, and isolate if positive but go about their business if negative."" He said that would increase compliance levels as ""at the moment you have hundreds of thousands - and possibly millions of people eventually - who are told to isolate but are not convinced of the case for it"". An Australian activewear firm has been fined Â£2.6m(5m Australian dollars) for claiming its clothing ""eliminated"" and stopped the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane had advertised that its clothing used ""a groundbreaking technology"" called LJ Shield to prevent the ""transferal of all pathogens"". In a ruling, a judge said the company's claim was ""exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous"". Lorna Jane said it accepted the court's ruling. The company maintained that it had been misled by its own supplier. ""A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,"" its chief executive said. Read the full story here. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has revealed it has been struggling to deliver
agreed amounts of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to Argentina. ""There has been a delay,"" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told a daily press briefing today after Argentina threatened to
cancel the contract. He added that Russia's sovereign wealth fund,RDIF, which
funded Sputnik V's development, was ""in touch with its partners to settle
the problems that have been arising"". Mr
Peskov implied that the delay in supplies to Argentina may have been
caused by the government's focus on demand at home. ""We've always said that the main priority is
satisfying Russians' demand for vaccination. You will know that the campaign of
total vaccination has been significantly stepped up, and citizens'
conscientiousness is constantly growing, vaccination is proceeding at an ever
faster pace. That's why this is a definite priority,"" he said. But he also gave assurances that ""commitments to foreign
markets including Argentina will definitely be met"". His
comments come after Argentine newspaper La Nacionpublished an email,externalsent
by key presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini to RDIF, in which
she complained of a ""very critical situation"" caused by the delay in
supplies of Sputnik V. ""The
entire contract is at risk of being publicly cancelled"" as Argentina is still waiting to
receive more than 18 million doses from Russia, she said. Argentina is
one of the first countries to widely use Sputnik V, and it has been used by the
Russian government as a showcase for its best-known vaccine. However, problems
fulfilling the contract may turn into a major obstacle to Moscowâs efforts to
market the jab abroad. The latest estimate of the reproduction (R) number in England - which measures how quickly the Covid virus is spreading - is unchanged from the previous week at 1.2 to 1.4, officials figures show. It means that on average, every 10 people infected with coronavirus goes on to infect between 12 and 14 others. However, the estimated daily growth rate shows signs of a possible slowdown. This week's estimate is that infections are growing at between 4% and 6% a day, down from between 4% and 7% last week. These estimates represent transmission which happened two to three weeks ago, due to a delay between people being infected, developing symptoms and needing healthcare. As we reported earlier, thousands of people have been heading to Suffolk for the Latitude Festival, which was cancelled last year because of the pandemic. The four-day music and arts festival - which began yesterday - is expected to attract about 40,000 people per day and is operating under a government event safety trial. Triathlete Libby Butler was determined to attend the festival and continue with her training. She's camping there all week and says she's been swimming in the lake on-site. ""I feel really safe,"" she says. ""Everyone is very much aware that Covid is still around and everybody is being really respectful. ""It is very odd. I live on my own in a little village in the Cotswolds so there are not many people about. So I found it very strange in the arena last night being around all of these people. ""I'm sure that will ease off as the weekend goes on and I'll be a bit more relaxed."" Josh Gosling, 18, who is enjoying his fourth Latitude Festival, says it's really nice to be back. ""It is the first big event we've had since lockdown so it was a bit weird really with having all the crowds and mingling with people."" Any concerns soon faded however he said he even enjoyed a spell of crowd surfing on Thursday night. ""Quite a lot of us have already had Covid in the past couple of months,"" says friend Gus Pater. ""So we all feel pretty confident about it and quite safe. ""I was fine with it [Covid], though I still can't smell anything. It kind of reassures me that I will be all right.""

Train companies have said they may have to reduce timetables to cope with shortages of staff forced to isolate by the NHS Covid app. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said that as Covid cases were increasing, more staff were being ""pinged"" by the app. Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Thameslink and Southern trains, has already announced it will introduce a reduced timetable from Monday 26 July. Meanwhile, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway have revealed it cancelled 600 trains last week as the number of staff self-isolating surged. The number of drivers self-isolating was 32 on 21 June and 131 a month later. London Northwestern services will change from Saturday with buses replacing trains on some  services and four services between Northampton and Euston being removed on weekdays GWR, Avanti, Thameslink and Southern will reduce services from Monday.

Euro 2020 boosts food and drink retail salesSales rose by 0.5% as millions stocked up on food and drink to watch the Euro 2020 football tournament.,"Retail sales in the UK rose between May and June, boosted by demand for food and drink as millions watched the Euro 2020 football tournament. Sales rose 0.5% month-on-month following a drop in May, official figures showed. Growth came from ""food and drink sales, boosted by football fans across Britain enjoying the Euros"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. June retail sales were 9.5% higher than before the pandemic in February 2020. The largest contribution to total retail sales growth in June was from food shops where sales rose by 4.2%. Supermarkets sales had dropped in May as shoppers chose to dine out after some Covid restrictions were lifted in the hospitality sector. The ONS said: ""Feedback from some retailers suggested that sales were positively boosted in June by the start of the Euro 2020 football championship."" Conversely, sales at non-food shops dropped by 1.7% between May and June, with a sharp fall in demand for furniture and clothing. The ONS said sales of petrol and diesel rose by 2.3% ""as people continued to increase their amount of travel"". But it said sales of automotive fuel remain 2,1% below pre-pandemic levels. Coronavirus restrictions easing explained the sharp monthly rise in sales in April; non-essential shops reopened and there was pent-up demand. There was subsequent a drop in May, the month hospitality re-started outdoors so people could eat out again. With no big changes of restrictions in June, the overall number is less dramatic. But retailers are likely to view these figures as encouraging, especially with June sales more than 9% above pre-virus levels. Despite a small fall, internet shopping still accounted for comfortably over a quarter of spending. That's still a greater proportion than before the pandemic. Further evidence of how the past 18 months have shifted consumer behaviour, potentially for good. Total retail sales for June were better than an expected 0.1% fall. Aled Patchett, head of retail and consumer goods at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Retailers will be hoping June marked the start of the turnaround they have been hoping for."" He added: ""All eyes now are on the impact of the gradual unlocking of society across the UK. On the surface the easing of restrictions and commuters returning back to city centre offices should be good news for the sector, but workers having to self-isolate means many businesses are reporting a shortage of staff just as demand looks likely to peak."" People continued to shop online but the amount they spent fell by 4.7% between May and June in all sectors except for clothing. The overall proportion of retail spending online fell to 26.7% from 28.4% in May, the fourth consecutive monthly fall.

NI theatre and concert hall opening decision delay,"A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Northern Ireland Executive said ""modest relaxations"" had been agreed after careful consideration. It followed an update from health and scientific advisers on how the virus is progressing, including the increasing numbers of cases and hospital admissions, the statement added. It comes asanother 1,430 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours. No further deaths were recorded. The frustration here is not totally surprising. A pause has been put on things which some people hoped would be given the green light and the most disappointed people will be those who run our theatres and concert halls. Today's decision doesn't mean reopening of those venues won't happen, but it's not going to happen as quickly as the people who own them want. However, when you consider some of the figures that ministers were considering today, that is not a surprise. This all happens before the executive meets on 12 August to consider the mandatory wearing of facemasks and the end of social distancing. It doesn't look like 'freedom day' - or anything like it - will be announced in Northern Ireland anytime soon. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to make modest changes to restrictions was made ""in the context of a rapid increase in the number of cases"". She said there had also been a doubling of the number of people in hospital in the last eight days, the majority of whom were unvaccinated. Ms O'Neill reiterated a call for young people to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated at pop-up centres across Northern Ireland. ""A cautious approach is what is required here and a steady approach,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says some progress had been made regarding the easing of restrictions Ms O'Neill said health officials had advised there would be more data available next week, which would help them understand the correlation between Covid-19 cases and admissions to hospital. She said this information would help inform decisions around restrictions that may be further eased. Dr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, described the Northern Ireland Executive's decision as ""sensible and measured"". He said the executive had not bowed to pressure to ease restrictions but has instead based its decision on data and the risks faced. ""The temptation is that we move too soon, we need that little bit more time,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. However, Dr Stout added that Northern Ireland was ""not losing the race"" between infections and vaccines. ""We are doing well and we are protecting people. We would shudder to think what position we would be in right now if we had not vaccinated as many people,"" he said. However, Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was ""regrettable"" more progress could not have been made in the wider reopening of the economy. He added that the executive also needed to take action about the number of people being required to self-isolate. ""We have received numerous calls from members this week indicating that they could well have to close because of staff having to self-isolate,"" he said. ""At the very least, we need the executive to bring Northern Ireland into line with the English date of 16 August, which allows 'pinged' double-vaccinated workers to take a PCR test, rather than self-isolation for 10 days."" Meanwhile, Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the number of Covid-19 cases related to overseas travel had increased ""very sharply"". He said 676 cases were reported in the last fortnight in people returning from Spain, Great Britain and Portugal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a series of posts on Twitter, Dr Glynn said it was ""strongly advised"" that people should only travel on the basis of their vaccination status or immunity after recovering from Covid-19. By Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter We know younger people are currently affected more by Covid-19 because a large part of that cohort simply have not had a vaccination yet. The uptake is slow in that age group. Of all the positive tests in the previous seven days, more than 90% were in those aged under 60. Anecdotally, we are hearing from some people that they are getting vaccinated but some are still catching the virus. A lot of people have said to us that they really would not like to see what they would have had to go through if they had not been vaccinated. It is a complicated, hard-hitting and unpleasant virus. Our hospital figures are remaining reasonably low but today we have 162 people in hospital. There is a lag, however. In another two to three weeks, we are going to see those rising case numbers reflected in hospital admissions. The Northern Ireland Executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to ten people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Other decisions, including removing the restrictions on sound levels from indoor venues, the holding of conferences and exhibitions and reducing social distancing to one metre will be considered next Thursday. Many Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland have been lifted in recent months, after a lockdown that lasted about four months. Hospitality Ulster has previously urged the executive to lift further restrictions on hospitality However,theatres and live music venues have been closed in Northern Ireland for the best part of 16 months, with all other parts of the UK already allowing them to reopen. The arts and music sector had been urging the executive to stick to the latest indicative date and allow the industry to resume trading, with mitigations. They had been looking at allowing a range of relaxations including: 10 people from three households to meet indoors at home - children aged 12 and under are exempt from the limit 15 people from an unlimited number of households to meet in a private garden Theatres and concert halls to reopen, with social distancing of 1m (3ft) required Removing the restrictions on sound levels of music at indoor venues Conferences and exhibitions to resume Hair and beauty salons to operate without requirements for appointments and overlapping appointments to be permitted Social distancing legal requirement to be reduced to 1m indoors, and removed for all outdoor activities MoT centres to resume normal services, allowing customers to be present in testing halls The executive previously said that it intended to remove the so-called ""bubble"" caring provision if it approved the relaxations for increasing numbers of people allowed to meet at home. Although mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland Although mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland. Ministers have discussed the issue in recent days but they are moving more cautiously with lifting that rule. They did put in place an indicative date of 26 July, which would see face coverings no longer compulsory in places of worship or for students in school classrooms in the new term - but that has yet to be signed off by ministers. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered 'We've lost count of the performances postponed' Ministers are due to review the wearing face coverings in places of worship at next Thursday's executive meeting. Looking at ending the mandatory use of face coverings more widely is unlikely to be discussed by ministers until a meeting on 12 August. Masks have been legally required in Northern Ireland on public transport, in shops and in a range of other settings since last summer, with a limited number of exemptions. That is not entirely clear. Decisions on easing or imposing restrictions must be agreed by the five parties in the executive. They have to consider advice from health officials about the spread of the variant, as well as social and economic effects of restrictions on the public. The first and deputy first ministers have indicated that they will meet again on 12 August to look at lifting requirements for face coverings in other settings, the requirement for self-isolation and travel.

Road planners 'can ignore climate change',"Planners can effectively ignore climate change when they are deciding whether to grant permission for new road schemes, environmentalists have said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has promised a review of Â£27bn highways policy which will be completed within two years. But in the meantime, planners can use existing guidelines. Campaigners say these ignore the cumulative effects of major road projects. They say Mr Shapps should be blocking new schemes until a new climate-friendly policy is developed. Climate change: US pushes China to make faster carbon cuts Climate change: Airbus aims for 'climate-neutral' flights by 2035 Many scientists say no new infrastructure should be built unless it is low-carbon. The debate has been raised because government policies for infrastructure were devised before ministers committed to virtually abolishing carbon emissions for the whole UK economy. The policy debate is still catching up. Currently guidance to planners states: âAny increase in carbon emissions is not a reason to refuse development consent, unless the increase in carbon emissions resulting from the proposed scheme are so significant that it would have a material impact on the ability of government to meet its carbon reduction targets.â Campaigners say the government must take account of the cumulative climate effect of its entire roads programme â not just of individual schemes. They have been chivvying Mr Shapps for 18 months to update the roads strategy to combat the climate crisis. He has now promised to review it â but not for up to two years. Chris Todd, from Transport Action Network, said, ""As our roads melt and places around the world face record temperatures and floods, the words âclimate emergencyâ appear to have no meaning within the Department for Transport. âInstead, all we seem to get are delay, delay and yet more delay. Having now finally accepted the inevitable, Mr Shapps is still fiddling while the planet burns.â Mr Todd said the test for carbon in the guidelines was ""utterly ridiculous"". ""A road scheme's emissions, however large, are never going to be significant compared to a five year carbon budget for the whole of the UK,"" he said. ""It's high time the government corrected this ludicrous state of affairs."" AA president Edmund King has called for better rural broadband However, Edmund King, AA president, said that zero emission cars will still need roads to drive on. âSo while it is correct to review the roads programme and especially the expansion of smart motorways, it is naÃ¯ve to think we wouldnât need to sort out the bottlenecks and dangerous hotspots.â Mr King, though, also wants amajor government investment in rural broadbandto reduce the need for travel. And Mr Shapps himself says hewants to get people out of their carsto reduce emissions and improve health. A government spokesman said that the Department for Transport and Highways England have both published ""ambitious plans to get to net zero highways"". ""This will see the UK rapidly cut carbon fromâ¯road construction, maintenance and operations, and support the transition to zero emission vehicles - putting roads at the heart of the low carbon economy,"" a spokesperson said. Among the schemes pending approval is the Lower Thames Crossing â a massive project that campaigners complain would produce over5 million tonnes,externalof carbon emissions. Other major schemes include: A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet A66 Northern Trans-Pennine A417 A27 Arundel Bypass A5036 Port of Liverpool A57 Link Roads A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Scheme Four A47 schemes in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk The campaigners also complain that smart motorways, which allow vehicles to run on the hard shoulder, are treated as permitted development without the need for planning permission or any assessment of carbon impacts. Emissions come from the creation of the road-building materials such as cement, as well as from petrol and diesel cars and lorries that will be using new road space. Only last week Mr Shapps told holidaymakers they could carry on flying because technology would solve emissions from aviation. This flew in the face of a recommendation from the Climate Change Committee which says ministers must dampen the projected increase in demand for flying â as well as seeking technology solutions.

NI Water has also asked the public to ""use water responsibly"" as there is a ""possibility"" that a hosepipe ban may be introduced. In response, Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council have turned off all water features in the area, including the water jets in Lisburn's Market Square. The council said it had taken the precautions due to increased temperatures and ""the need to protect our water supplies"". The hot weather caused disruption to travel in parts of Northern Ireland on Thursday. Rail services were delayed after speed restrictions were put in place due to high track temperatures. Ticket sales to Helen's Bay, County Down, were also suspended in an attempt to manage the large number of passengers travelling to the area. Translink said it had taken the decision to manage capacity for return journeys. It asked people to consider whether their journey was ""completely necessary"" and to allow extra time for travel. New NI top temperature 'may be exceeded this week' Extreme heat warning issued for Northern Ireland Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said people should avoid visiting places where there is a chance large numbers of people will gather. Ms Mallon said the high temperatures have also affected the road network, with bitumen in some roads having softened. The Met Office issued the extreme heat warning, with Met Ãireann warnings also in place in the Republic of Ireland. The Met Office warning comes with an appeal to watch out for heat exhaustion and sunburn. Temperatures on Valentia Island did not fall below 20.5C on Wednesday night Elsewhere, the Republic of Ireland recorded its first tropical night for 20 years. Temperatures on Valentia Island, County Kerry, one of Ireland's most westerly points, did not fall below 20.5C overnight on Wednesday. Tropical nights, meaning shaded air remains above 20C all night, are rare in Ireland, having previously only been recorded six times.

Fashion for Crocs continues to break records,"Pandemic fashionistas have been accessorising their Crocs with Jibbitz charms From the Oscar's to the Love Island fire pit - there's no doubt Crocs have made a pandemic comeback. On Thursday, the chunky shoe-maker reported record sales of $640m (Â£465m) in the three months to 30 June - nearly double the same period last year. And the trend shows no sign of slowing down - the firm raised its revenue outlook for the rest of the year. The company's boss said there was strong demand for the shoes globally. Net income before tax grew to $190.5m between April and the end of June from a previous $54.7m. Its chief executive, Andrew Rees, now expects revenue for 2021 to rise by as much as 65%, compared to an increase of up to 50% the company forecast in April. ""We continue to see strong consumer demand for the Crocs brand globally,"" Mr Rees said. People have turned to the footwear company for foamy clogs to pair with their lockdown outfits. Foot Locker boss says casual wear is here to stay Kanye West's Yeezy trainers sell for record $1.8m Boosted by customers staying at home, the Colorado-based firm said on Thursday that digital sales were up 25.4% and make up more than a third of total sales. But even as restrictions ease, TikTokkers taking part in the #CrocsChallenge and celebrities haven't put the shoes to the back of the wardrobe yet. Suits you sir: Questlove wore a pair of gold Crocs at this year's Academy Awards As the shoes, popular with medical professionals, have staged a comeback, copy-cat versions have sprung up. Crocs said last month that it had filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) in a bid to crack down on companies it says are importing copies from overseas. It has also recently filed trademark infringement lawsuits against 21 shops, including retail giant Walmart, according to trade publicationFootwear News,external. And there are some worries the firm might not be able to keep up with demand for its collaborations with the likes of singer Justin Bieber and fashion house Balenciaga because of the pandemic. Mr Rees told journalists on Thursday that its biggest manufacturing site in Vietnam may see temporary closures. Despite that, he said Crocs is still ""incredibly optimistic about our business"". In a presentation for investors, it said it was counting on sandals and ""Jibbitz"" shoe charms, which Crocs aficionados can use to customise their shoes, for future growth. It is also set to focus on celebrity campaigns in Asia, and China in particular, where it sees the ""largest long-term growth opportunity"".
