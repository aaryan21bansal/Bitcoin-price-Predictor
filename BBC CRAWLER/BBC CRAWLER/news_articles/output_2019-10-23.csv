On Mondaythe band announced their latest album in a letter to a fan. Lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, who grew up in Flintshire, tweeted he once had a holiday job at the newspaper. Similar adverts have appeared in newspapers in England - inExeter's Express and Echo,external, which is lead singer Chris Martin's hometown, andSouthampton's Daily Echo,external, where drummer Will Champion is from.

""To be honest, it's a brilliant bit of marketing by Coldplay, to get everyone talking about their new album and the track listing. ""Maybe someone from the record company, maybe Jonny Buckland himself phoned up the adverts team and placed the advert.""

Scottish and Welsh leaders back general election,"The first ministers of Wales and Scotland have both said they would welcome a general election. But Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said they wanted to see the details of any Brexit extension before backing a vote before Christmas. Ms Sturgeon said it was important to ensure the risk of no-deal had been removed. They were speaking at a news conference in Westminster where they joined forces to oppose Boris Johnson's Brexit Bill. The pair accused the UK government of trying to rush through the EU Withdrawal Agreement without scrutiny. The first ministers urged the prime minister Boris Johnson to allow more time for the bill, after he""paused"" his Brexit billwhen the Commons rejected his plan to get it signed off in three days. PM to seek election if EU offers three-month delay How would another Brexit delay work? How soon could there be a general election? Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford said the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were likely to refuse to give consent for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and called for the devolved nations to be given a greater say. Notes to the bill say the UK government will seek legislative consent, however, and Welsh government ministers say the UK government has written to them making the request. In the Commons on Wednesday, however, the prime minister said the Scottish Parliament ""has no role"" in approving his deal. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford agreed there should be adequate time to scrutinise the bill if it proceeds - with Ms Sturgeon saying that must be aÂ ""decent, proper period of time"".Â Ms Sturgeon told the conference it was ""almost certain"" the UK would not leave the EU on 31 October, but added ""the reprieve is currently only a temporary one"". Mr Drakeford echoed her sentiments and warned that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may be ""in limbo or in purgatory"", but was ""not yet dead"". Nicola Sturgeon declared: ""I want to see a general election. I would be very happy to see that general election before Christmas but the circumstances of that have to be such that it doesn't open the risk of a no-deal Brexit. ""And I think all responsible opposition MPs who want to see an election have a duty to make sure that that is the case."" The Welsh first minister said: ""I have always been agnostic on whether a general election or a referendum is the best way to get this decision put back in the hands of the people. ""But I've never been anything but clear that that should be the end, the end objective."" He added: ""What I want to see is this decision put back in the hands of the people who made it in the first place. ""If a referendum comes our way we should grab it with both hands. If a general election comes our way first, I absolutely want a general election."" They welcomed the UK parliament's decision on Tuesday to reject the UK government's timetable of scrutiny of the Withdrawal Bill. The two first ministers have jointly written to Boris Johnson and the president of the European Council asking for an extension to give more time to scrutinise the bill. ""The way in which the prime minister sought to bully parliament into accepting it was shameful,"" Ms Sturgeon said. She added: ""Nobody voted to have the core principles of devolution trampled over in a stampede to get out of the EU come what may."" The Senedd opposes the Withdrawal Bill Wales voted 52.5% to leave in the EU referendum, while Scotland voted by 62% to remain. On Tuesday, theSenedd passed a motion opposing the bill's passage in Parliament. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh government had a ""critical interest"" because many of the provisions of the bill touched on devolved matters. He said that having asked the Senedd to give consent ""the government here in London must respect both the time we need to consider the bill properly and to respect the decisions of devolved parliaments on that question of consent"". He added it was a ""bad deal"" for Wales and the whole of the UK, calling it ""absolutely unacceptable to the Welsh government"". Mr Drakeford said that he ""could not encourage any MP to vote for it because of the damage it would do to Wales"". He warned it would mean lost jobs, investment and income for families and would have an impact on Welsh manufacturing and the agrifood sector. Ms Sturgeon said an extension should not just give time to ""scrutinise a bad bill for a week or two longer"", but long enough to secure a general election or referendum, ""or perhaps... the former leading to the latter"". She confirmed her government would not recommend consent when MSPs considered the legislation. Ms Sturgeon added: ""If this legislation does proceed the consent of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly will be required. The UK government has explicitly accepted that fact."" Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, however, Boris Johnson rejected the idea that the approval of devolved parliaments was necessary. He said: ""The Scottish Parliament has no role in approving this deal. ""On the contrary, it is up to the members of this Parliament to approve the deal."" Since 1999, UK governments have followed the Sewel convention that the UK parliament will not normally legislate with on devolved matters without the consent of the devolved parliaments. But in 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that since it is a political convention, enforcing it is not a matter for the courts. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive  Those MPs described as ""Did not vote"" may not have done so for a number of reasons. It could be they wished to abstain, or that they had constituency or ministerial business.  The Speaker and his deputies cannot vote and Sinn Fein members traditionally do not vote. The prime minister told MPs on Tuesday he would ""pause"" the Withdrawal Agreement Bill until the EU took a decision on whether to grant another extension to the current Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Johnson added: ""Let me be clear. Our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on 31 October and that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the House. ""And one way or another we will leave the EU with this deal, to which this House has just given its assent.""

Lorry driver held as 39 found dead in trailer,"This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found inside the trailer The bodies of 39 people have been found in a lorry trailer in Essex. The vehicle was found shortly before 01:40 BST at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, police said. Essex Police said the trailer has been moved to a secure location where the bodies of those inside - a teenager and 38 adults - can be recovered. The driver, named locally as Mo Robinson, 25, from Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Essex Police said the trailer arrived via ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet on the River Thames. The ship docked in the Thurrock area shortly after 00:30, the force said. It is believed the lorry then left the port about 35 minutes later. The arrested lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from the Portadown area of County Armagh Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said identifying the victims remained a ""number one priority"", but was expected to be a ""lengthy process"". The National Crime Agency said it had sent officers to assist and identify any ""organised crime groups who may have played a part"". Essex lorry deaths: Latest updates Why do people risk their lives to get to the UK? Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the trailer appeared to be a refrigerated unit, where temperatures could be as low as -25C. He described conditions for anyone inside as ""absolutely horrendous"". Officers inspected the lorry at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays A spokesman for the Bulgarian foreign affairs ministry confirmed the truck was registered in the country. ""The Scania truck was registered in Varna (on the east coast) under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen,"" he said. ""Police said that it is highly unlikely that they are Bulgarians,"" he added. Police have appealed for witnesses and anyone with information about the lorry's route to contact them. The force said it believed the tractor unit - or front part - of the lorry had come from Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was an ""unimaginable tragedy and truly heartbreaking"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said: ""I know that the thoughts and prayers of all members will be with those who lost their lives and their loved ones. ""I'm receiving regular updates. The Home Office will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""shocked and saddened,external"", while Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price said it was ""sickening news,external"". During PMQs, Ms Doyle-Price said: ""To put 39 people into a locked metal container shows a contempt for human life that is evil. The best thing we can do in memory of those victims is to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice."" Mr Johnson responded saying ""all such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice"". This video can not be played Essex lorry deaths: CCTV shows arrival at industrial park Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was an ""unbelievable human tragedy"", adding: ""Can we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container?"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told the Dail that investigations would be undertaken to establish if the lorry had passed through Ireland. Since the Calais migrant camps were shut three years ago and security measures were increased at Dover and the Channel Tunnel, people smugglers have increasingly moved to other routes. Asked which ports are being used, the National Crime Agency told me: ""All of them."" More dangerous methods are being used to get human cargo through. The most common one is being hidden in the back of a lorry, but increasingly commercial shipping containers are being used, sometimes even refrigerated ones of the type seen on the back of the truck in Essex.

Expert wins Â£2m decades after diabetes invention,"Prof Shanks said he was relieved his 13-year legal battle to get compensation was over A scientist has been awarded Â£2m compensation by the UK's highest court for his invention of pioneering technology to test blood sugar levels nearly 40 years ago. Professor Ian Shanks developed the system, used by many diabetics, while working for Unilever in the 1980s. The rights to his invention belonged to the company and until now he was not entitled to a share of the benefits. Prof Shanks said he wasrelieved by the result,external, after a 13-year legal battle. While working for a subsidiary of multinational giant Unilever in Bedfordshire in 1982, Prof Shanks developed new technology to measure the concentration of glucose in blood and other liquids. Using plastic film and glass slides from his daughter's toy microscope kit and bulldog clips to hold it together, he built the first prototype of what is now known as the electrochemical capillary fill device (ECFD). His ECFD technology eventually appeared in most glucose testing products, which are used by diabetics to monitor their condition. Prof Shanks first applied for compensation in 2006 but lost every step in his legal battle until it reached the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the court unanimously ruled that Prof Shanks's invention had provided his former employer with an ""outstanding benefit"" for which he should receive compensation. Judge Lord Kitchin said the rewards Unilever enjoyed ""were substantial and significant"" and Prof Shanks was entitled to a ""fair share"" of the company's net benefit of around Â£24m from the patents. Speaking after the ruling, Prof Shanks, who lives near Dundee, said he was pleased his ""13-year slog"" to get compensation was over. However, the 72-year-old told the BBC the legal battle was not ""without its costs"" and had caused him a great deal of stress. ""In 2007 I had a heart attack - which wasn't at all helped by the strain I was under,"" he added. A finger-prick blood test is one way someone with diabetes can check their blood sugar levels However, he said his persistence was driven by a desire to help future inventors, rather than for his own financial reward, adding that most of the compensation would go towards his legal costs. ""I would much prefer that employee inventors believe that if they do something that turns out to be really profitable and significant, they may actually stand a chance of getting an award,"" he said. When he first applied for compensation, he said not one employee inventor had benefitted from the provisions of the Patents Act, introduced 30 years earlier. The Act entitles workers who invent something from which their employer gains an ""outstanding benefit"" to a ""fair share"" of these benefits. Why are so few women inventors named on patents? This little-known inventor has probably saved your life Prof Shanks added that he felt great pride for his invention which he said had probably helped several hundred million people living with diabetes. Outlining the background to the case, Lord Kitchin said Prof Shanks accepted that the rights to his inventions belonged to Unilever, but argued that he was still entitled to compensation. The judge said Prof Shanks' ECFD technology became something most significant companies in the field were willing to pay millions of pounds to use. Prof Shanks had argued at an earlier hearing that, while Unilever ultimately received around Â£24m from the patents, the company could have earned royalties for ""as much as one billion US dollars"" had his invention been ""fully exploited"". A spokesperson for Unilever said the company was ""disappointed"" with the decision to award Dr Shanks ""a share of the licence revenue obtained by Unilever in addition to the salary, bonuses and benefits he was compensated with while employed to develop new products for the business.""

Energy supplier Toto ceases trading,"Energy supplier Toto has ceased trading, becoming the 16th smaller provider to go bust since the start of last year. The company, which had 134,000 domestic customers, had bought 43,000 of those from another failing supplier - Solarplicity - in July. Energy regulator Ofgem said it did not have the power to step in at the time of that handover. The regulator said Toto customers should take a meter reading. But it stressed that their energy supply will not be cut off. They should not switch away but wait for another supplier to be appointed to take up their account. ""Toto Energy customers do not need to worry, as under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies are secure and customers' credit balances are protected,"" said Philippa Pickford from Ofgem. Thousands of Toto customers will be furious at their treatment, having been automatically shifted from Solarplicity in July. Solarplicity went bust in August after being crippled by poor service and many customers found that nothing improved at Toto. They will soon find themselves with their third supplier in as many months. Toto owed Â£4m in its renewable energy obligations to Ofgem, with a deadline for payment looming at the end of the month. Three other suppliers have outstanding bills. ""Toto were known to be struggling with customer service and running their operations efficiently,"" said Cordelia Samson of price comparison website Uswitch. The Energy Ombudsman has said it is unlikely to be able to complete any ongoing cases against Toto, and would not be able to deal with any new complaints. It has received 730 complaints about Toto this year. Ofgem has proposed stronger powers that would allow it to step in when smaller suppliers grow to such a size that they struggle to provide adequate customer service. A spokesman said the current rules meant that it could not have approved or rejected the purchase of customers by Toto from Solarplicity. Among the host of smaller suppliers that have gone bust, Toto is the fourth-largest in terms of domestic customers to have failed since November 2016, behind GB Energy, Economy Energy and Spark Energy.

Thomas Cook ex-bosses reject blame for collapse,"Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Harriet Green were questioned by MPs A former Thomas Cook chief executive has denied contributing to the collapse of the travel firm. Manny Fontenla-Novoa told MPs looking into the demise that a series of acquisitions under his watch had not left the firm with unmanageable debt. But Harriet Green, who succeeded him, told the hearing on Wednesday she inherited a ""huge wall of debt"". The most recent chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, has also blamed debt as a contributory factor in the collapse. Mr Fontenla-Novoa told MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee that his strategy, including acquisitions such as a 2007 merger with MyTravel, had left the company ""in great shape"" for future growth. When challenged by committee chair Rachel Reeves, who cited evidence to MPs by Mr Fankhauser that he had ""had his hands tied"" and found his job ""impossible"" due to the debt, Mr Fontenla-Novoa said: ""I can't accept that, because if Peter felt that, then maybe they should have done something about that debt. ""They should have looked at what we did in 2010 in disposing of some assets. Maybe they should have done that earlier. If they'd believed that they could not service that debt, they should have done something about it before 2019."" Thomas Cook: What went wrong at the holiday firm? Thomas Cook boss grilled over Â£500,000 bonus Who are the family buying Thomas Cook's shops? Mr Fontenla-Novoa said that from about 2011, after he had left the business, Thomas Cook ""shrank capacity"" in real terms by reducing the number of available seats on aircraft or hotel rooms. ""You look at turnover in 2010, it was Â£9bn. You look at turnover in 2019, [it was] Â£9bn, which in effect, because of inflation, capacity has gone down,"" Mr Fontenla-Novoa said. ""In the same period of time, Jet2holidays have grown from nowhere to four million passengers a year. On the Beach have grown from nowhere to 1.6 million passengers a year. Love Holidays, similar amounts. I believe there was growth in the market. I believe we would have grown with that growth in the market. Instead, Thomas Cook... has shrunk, competitors have grown."" Ms Reeves cited Mr Fankhauser's comments that Thomas Cook could not have grown because it was spending Â£150m to Â£170m per year servicing debt. However, Mr Fontenla-Novoa said it ""was not about buying businesses or investing in technology, it's about the capacity that you put onto the marketplace."" Former chief executive Harriet Green said she had inherited in 2012 ""three profit warnings, a huge wall of debt, and a business model that was entirely out of sync with the industry."" ""That's what I fought for 28 months, 22 hours a day, to change. And my responsibility is that I failed to complete that. This is a brand that was loved, with staff as loyal and as amazing as I've seen anywhere in the world,"" she added. Ms Green, who now works for IBM, said she had implemented a strategy that was more focused on technology, but was asked to leave her post by the chairman before she had fully implemented it. Thomas Cook, whose founder was born during the Industrial Revolution, was Britain's oldest holiday company before going into liquidation in September. This put around 9,000 UK jobs at risk and left 150,000 holiday-makers overseas, who were repatriated at an estimated cost of Â£100m to the taxpayer. Former Thomas Cook staff protested outside Parliament after the company went into liquidation Mr Fankhauser last week toldMPs on the committeethat the company was dragged down by its debts, which reached over Â£1.4bn in 2018. ""I'm sorry for not being able to turn around this company at pace and to really pay back this debt. ""Since 2012 we paid Â£1.2bn of interest costs and refinancing costs. Imagine if we had only half of that reinvested in the business, we could have been faster,"" Mr Fankhauser said. Former senior Thomas Cook executives told the BBC the company's debt problems began with the MyTravel merger. ""We were told we're carrying this debt from a deal that was done many years ago and now we've got this baggage around our necks,"" said one former executive, who asked not to be identified. ""What that means is we have to sell about 2,000 holidays to even pay a very small piece of that debt back. What we're doing is essentially working to pay back the interest,"" she said. The year after the MyTravel deal, Mr Fontenla-Novoa was awarded a Â£5m bonus. He said it was ""not for delivering the deal"" but ""for delivering the synergies"". He said ""those synergies were not just delivered, they were audited by external auditors"".

Boeing expects 737 Max to fly again by New YearThe news comes just hours after investigators in Indonesia blamed design problems for a fatal crash.Business,"Boeing has said it expects its troubled 737 Max aircraft to return to the skies before the end of the year. The jet was grounded after two fatal crashes, including last year's Lion Air disaster which killed 189 people. Just hours after Indonesian investigators blamed mechanical and design problems for the crash, Boeing said it had developed software updates. The investigators focused on a system used to improve handling and prevent stalling on the Boeing 737 Max. The official report by the Indonesian authorities into the disaster, which occurred 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on 29 October 2018, is expected to be published on Friday. But on Wednesday, the authorities informed the victims' families of the findings. Boeing did not comment ahead of formal publication of the report. But according to the information provided to the families, mechanical and design problems with the flight control system were among the causes of the crash. The report highlighted issues with the MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly. Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee told families that MCAS would be a ""contributing factor"". According to reports, families have been told that there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the ""deficiencies"" had been highlighted during training. Slides from the briefing to the families showed that there was a lack of documentation about how a ""stick shaker"" - warning pilots of a loss of lift - would work. Reuters reported that a ""stick shaker"" was warning of a stall throughout the 13 minutes the plane was in air, with investigators believing this was based on erroneous data on its angle to the oncoming air. ""During the design and certification of the [737 Max], assumptions were made about pilot response to malfunctions which, even though consistent with current industry guidelines, turned out to be incorrect,"" the report said, according to AFP. The report found the system relied on a sole sensor for inputs and that a replaced sensor had been ""miscalibrated"" during an earlier repair. The planes were grounded after an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March 2019, which took the death toll to 346 people. Boeing said on Wednesday it was working with regulators to return the jet to service. ""Our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 Max, and we're making steady progress,"" Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg said. Lion Air JT610 crash: What the preliminary report tells us Boeing staff texted about 737 Max issue in 2016 What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing and the battle for blame The firm said it had also developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to take off again before the beginning of 2020. ""We've also taken action to further sharpen our company's focus on product and services safety, and we continue to deliver on customer commitments and capture new opportunities, with our values of safety, quality and integrity always at the forefront,"" Mr Muilenburg said. The grounding of the 737 Max hurt the planemaker's financial results in the third quarter. Profits more than halved to $895m (Â£694m) and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties. Mr Muilenberg was stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive. On Tuesday, Boeing ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, becoming the most senior official to leave since the two crashes. Mr Muilenburg is under pressure to explain what the company knew about issues with the 737 Max. Questions about how much Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max have been raised since Boeing provided documents to US lawmakers that showed employees had exchanged instant messages about issues with MCAS as it was being certified in 2016. A pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests, saying he ""basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]"". The documents were provided ahead of Mr Muilenburg's appearance before Congress next week. The testimony from relatives of those on board Lion Air flight 610 raises yet more uncomfortable questions about the design of the 737 Max. And the focus remains on the aircraft's new flight control system, known as MCAS, which erroneously pushed the plane into a nosedive. The notion that assumptions made by Boeing and the regulators who signed the aircraft off about how that system would perform and how pilots would react to it were ""incorrect"" suggests something went badly wrong. Every air crash is a chain of events and according to the families, the actions of the pilots were also a factor. But the vulnerability of the MCAS system, which previously relied on data from one single sensor, is again in the spotlight. The departure of Kevin McAllister, who ran Boeing's commercial planes division, speaks of the wider fallout. The fundamental question belying everything is: why was more drastic action not taken after the Lion Air crash before a second accident killed another 157 people and grounded the plane worldwide? Boeing 'misjudged 737 Max pilot reactions' Boeing to pay bereaved 737 families $144,500 each Europe will not accept US verdict on 737 Max safety LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

'We got no help when my husband died in Italy',"Exactly how Briton Russell Cowan died in Italy in 2016 remains unclear The widow of a man who died in Italy in suspicious circumstances says the support she got was ""like a jigsaw that had not been put together effectively"". Trudy Cowan's husband Russell, 44, from Derbyshire, died of ""catastrophic"" head injuries during a trip in 2016. She says her family was ""essentially left on our own"" by the UK authorities. Her comments come as a report from the victims' commissioner for England and Wales called on the government to offer more help in such cases. Dame Vera Baird said support for the bereaved was ""patchy and sometimes inadequate"". The Foreign Office said it had a team supporting the families of British people killed abroad and would look at implementing the commissioner's recommendations. Every year between 60 and 90 UK citizens die in suspicious circumstances overseas. Ex-RAF officer Russell, from Chesterfield, had been in Menaggio near Lake Como with three friends to take part in a classic car rally for charity. He phoned his wife, with whom he had two children, on Saturday, 4 June, 2016 to say he was going out for a meal and was leaving his phone in his room. Trudy received a call on the Sunday morning from one of Russell's friends telling her that her partner of 25 yearshad been involved in an accident and had died. Trudy Cowan (right) says her family were offered no help following her husband's death ""Our priorities were getting to Italy, finding out what happened, and getting Russell back home,"" she says. ""But the support mechanisms that should have been in place for somebody that had lost someone abroad - they weren't there or available for us."" She says the Foreign Office emailed to say nobody would be coming to meet them or help them with the local police. The family were not offered a translator or a family liaison officer, she says, while police in the UK said the incident was out of their jurisdiction. ""Everywhere we turned, we were basically told 'I'm sorry but we can't help you',"" she says. ""It was like trying to swim in a sea of custard, blindfolded. ""It's just not a joined-up approach. It's unwieldy for families that are trying to navigate through a system at a time when you're expected to make decisions at the worst point in your life, when your mind is like a fog."" Mr Cowan's body was found at the bottom of a fence by a private villa (left) Italian authorities concluded his death was an accident after he fell 8m (26ft) from a fence. But his family do not believe it was an accident - a UK coroner ruled in 2017 that there may have been third party involvement - and an appeal against the Italian ruling is being heard in Como next month. Trudy's case was one of those looked at as part of the report published by the Victims' Commissioner on Wednesday. Despite the dedicated team the Foreign Office set up four years ago to support people whose loved ones were killed or murdered outside the UK, Dame Vera Baird said it was still an uphill struggle. Her report cites the case of a bereaved mother who said the Foreign Office would not provide an interpreter for a court hearing in case they made a mistake - the family sued them. A woman whose partner died in India claimed the Foreign Office advised her to have the body cremated rather than repatriated because it was cheaper. Dame Vera said families should get the same entitlements as they do in the UK. Among 17 recommendations, she said families of those murdered abroad should be entitled to financial help under the criminal injuries compensation scheme. The Ministry of Justice said the proposal would be considered as part of a wider review. Trudy says she ""fully endorses"" the recommendations, although she says she would not personally have pursued financial compensation. ""As a family we just want the truth. We want justice for Russell,"" she says. Robert Sebbage, 18, was stabbed to death by a taxi driver in 2011 while on holiday with his friends in Zakynthos. His mother Rhian Sebbage, from Tadley in Hampshire, said she felt ""just a number"" when dealing with the fallout from his death. Stelios Morfis was eventually sentenced to 16 years and four months in prison for murder - after three trials and an appeal hearing in Greece. At the time of Robert's death, theForeign Office said it was providing consular assistanceto his family.  But Mrs Sebbage said British diplomats were unable to ""intervene"" in the case. ""You are on your own,"" she said, adding that the family were not entitled to help from Greece and had to find and pay for lawyers, interpreters, doctors, hotels and flights themselves. ""We were backwards and forwards for three years after the event. I've never sat down and worked out all the costs, but my husband and I will probably be working for a very long time,"" she said. Mrs Sebbage added her husband had to take unpaid time off work after suffering a stress-induced heart attack. ""You're just trying to make sense of it and get your head round it all and move on."" The Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said it helps UK nationals with some of the issues cited by the report and urged anyone who is facing those problems to contact the charity. The Foreign Office said it helped more than 22,000 British people overseas last year, including cases involving more than 4,000 deaths. ""We now have a dedicated team to support families of homicide victims, including funding translation where required,"" it added in a statement. ""We will look at what more we can do, including implementing many of these recommendations."" The Foreign Office said it had recently conducted a review of consular services and it would set out proposals shortly.

Boeing expects 737 Max to fly again by New YearThe news comes just hours after investigators in Indonesia blamed design problems for a fatal crash.,"Boeing has said it expects its troubled 737 Max aircraft to return to the skies before the end of the year. The jet was grounded after two fatal crashes, including last year's Lion Air disaster which killed 189 people. Just hours after Indonesian investigators blamed mechanical and design problems for the crash, Boeing said it had developed software updates. The investigators focused on a system used to improve handling and prevent stalling on the Boeing 737 Max. The official report by the Indonesian authorities into the disaster, which occurred 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on 29 October 2018, is expected to be published on Friday. But on Wednesday, the authorities informed the victims' families of the findings. Boeing did not comment ahead of formal publication of the report. But according to the information provided to the families, mechanical and design problems with the flight control system were among the causes of the crash. The report highlighted issues with the MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly. Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee told families that MCAS would be a ""contributing factor"". According to reports, families have been told that there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the ""deficiencies"" had been highlighted during training. Slides from the briefing to the families showed that there was a lack of documentation about how a ""stick shaker"" - warning pilots of a loss of lift - would work. Reuters reported that a ""stick shaker"" was warning of a stall throughout the 13 minutes the plane was in air, with investigators believing this was based on erroneous data on its angle to the oncoming air. ""During the design and certification of the [737 Max], assumptions were made about pilot response to malfunctions which, even though consistent with current industry guidelines, turned out to be incorrect,"" the report said, according to AFP. The report found the system relied on a sole sensor for inputs and that a replaced sensor had been ""miscalibrated"" during an earlier repair. The planes were grounded after an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March 2019, which took the death toll to 346 people. Boeing said on Wednesday it was working with regulators to return the jet to service. ""Our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 Max, and we're making steady progress,"" Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg said. Lion Air JT610 crash: What the preliminary report tells us Boeing staff texted about 737 Max issue in 2016 What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing and the battle for blame The firm said it had also developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to take off again before the beginning of 2020. ""We've also taken action to further sharpen our company's focus on product and services safety, and we continue to deliver on customer commitments and capture new opportunities, with our values of safety, quality and integrity always at the forefront,"" Mr Muilenburg said. The grounding of the 737 Max hurt the planemaker's financial results in the third quarter. Profits more than halved to $895m (Â£694m) and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties. Mr Muilenberg was stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive. On Tuesday, Boeing ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, becoming the most senior official to leave since the two crashes. Mr Muilenburg is under pressure to explain what the company knew about issues with the 737 Max. Questions about how much Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max have been raised since Boeing provided documents to US lawmakers that showed employees had exchanged instant messages about issues with MCAS as it was being certified in 2016. A pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests, saying he ""basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]"". The documents were provided ahead of Mr Muilenburg's appearance before Congress next week. The testimony from relatives of those on board Lion Air flight 610 raises yet more uncomfortable questions about the design of the 737 Max. And the focus remains on the aircraft's new flight control system, known as MCAS, which erroneously pushed the plane into a nosedive. The notion that assumptions made by Boeing and the regulators who signed the aircraft off about how that system would perform and how pilots would react to it were ""incorrect"" suggests something went badly wrong. Every air crash is a chain of events and according to the families, the actions of the pilots were also a factor. But the vulnerability of the MCAS system, which previously relied on data from one single sensor, is again in the spotlight. The departure of Kevin McAllister, who ran Boeing's commercial planes division, speaks of the wider fallout. The fundamental question belying everything is: why was more drastic action not taken after the Lion Air crash before a second accident killed another 157 people and grounded the plane worldwide?

Tim Dunn's son died in a crash outside RAF Croughton with a car owned by US citizen Anne Sacoolas, who later left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said she would beinterviewed under caution. Officers from Northamptonshire Police are waiting for the necessary visas. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas had asked to be interviewed by officers from his force ""in order for them to see her and the devastation this has caused her and her family"". Tim Dunn said the family's way to get justice would be to ""get the whole truth of what went on"" On Wednesday, Mr Dunn toldBBC Radio Northampton: ""We are obviously very pleased to hear they are travelling out to America - that's great news. ""Hopefully, they are getting somewhere to help get her to come back to the UK and start proceedings.

He died in hospital. Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan is a US intelligence official who was working at the base at the time of the crash. Both the British and US governments agree that by returning to the US, Mrs Sacoolas forfeited the right to diplomatic immunity. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, left the UK after the crash However, Mr Dunn's father said he did not expect her to return to the UK. ""If I'm honest, I don't think she'll come back,"" he said. ""After our meeting with the president and the way that went, they were adamant that she would not be coming back to the UK. ""Of course I hope for it, but in my heart I don't think she will be."" Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity?

Hong Kong scraps law that sparked protests,"The extradition bill sparked months of protest but its withdrawal is unlikely to quell unrest Hong Kong's legislature has formally withdrawn a controversial extradition bill that has sparked months of unrest. The bill - which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China - prompted outrage when it was introduced in April. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and the bill was eventually suspended. But protesters have continued regular demonstrations, which spiralled into a wider pro-democracy movement. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words HK frees murder suspect who sparked protest crisis It is the worst crisis for Hong Kong since the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997. It has also presented a serious challenge to China's leaders in Beijing, who have painted the demonstrators as dangerous separatists and accused foreign powers of backing them. The proposed bill would have allowed for Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to places it does not have an extradition treaty with, including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau. Critics of the planned law had feared extradition to mainland China could subject people to arbitrary detention and unfair trials. The bill's formal withdrawal meets only one of five key demands emphasised by some protesters, who have often chanted ""five demands, not one less"" in Hong Kong's streets. The others are: For the protests not to be characterised as a ""riot"" Amnesty for arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Implementation of complete universal suffrage Connie, a 27-year-old protester, told Reuters news agency the move was ""too little, too late"". ""There are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality,"" she said. Carrie Lam, the embattled Hong Kong leader, has insisted that other demands by protesters are outside her control. Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong Kong What led to a single gunshot being fired? The protests - which began peacefully - now often descend into violent running battles between Hong Kong police and hardcore demonstrators who have vandalised shops and hurled petrol bombs at security forces. Police have used water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets in response. Live rounds have been fired on a few occasions, andan 18-year-old was shot by police in the chest on 1 October. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence The Financial Times newspaper reports that China's government is drawing up plans to remove Ms Lam,external, a figure loathed by protesters whom Beijing has thus far stood by. If Chinese President Xi Jinping approves the plan, the paper says, she will be replaced by an interim chief executive after calm returns to Hong Kong. Carrie Lam 'never tendered resignation to Beijing' Ms Lam's office told the BBC: ""We do not comment on speculation."" China's foreign ministry said the FT report was ""a political rumour with ulterior motives"". Separately on Wednesday,Hong Kong released the murder suspect whose case led to the extradition bill in the first place. Chan Tong-kai is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong. But Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition treaty, and his case was cited when the government proposed amending the law.

'Sex work paid my student bills. Now I regret it',"When he was out of money and stealing the milk in student digs, he decided there was only one option to earn some cash. The individual, who does not want to be named, said he visited men when he was a teenage university student to earn between Â£20 and Â£120 a time. ""That line of work was sort of always on my radar as an easy way to make money in tough times. I only did it when I really needed it,"" he said. Eventually, his parents found out and put a stop to it. He never talked to anyone else, including a subsequent girlfriend, about what had happened. He now has a job, but says he is not in a position to preach to other students who are struggling for money. ""I regret it looking back. But if I was put back in that same situation, I might do the same thing,"" he said. A survey of students suggested that one in 25 undergraduates have tried adult work, including sugar dating by going out with older men, selling used underwear and having sex for money. TheNational Student Money Survey,external, by website Save the Student, gathers the views of more than 3,000 people currently studying. The proportion of those asked - who had done some kind of adult work - was double the proportion of the previous year. An additional 6% of students said they would try adult work if they needed emergency cash. Nearly four in five students worried about making ends meet, according to the survey which was published in August.  Â£807 a monthUK studentsâ average living costs 79%worry about making ends meet 71%of students turn to parents for cash in an emergency 4%have done some kind of adult work Another student, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was shocked how many of her fellow students were involved in adult work of some kind to make ends meet. ""I've never been as poor in my life as I was as a student, the rent was so high. I went to the shops and all I could afford was an oven pizza for the day,"" she said. In desperation, she found information on social media on how to sell photos on an online fetish site. She made Â£100 or more a week selling pictures and videos of her feet to men. ""I was open about it. My Dad knew, my boyfriend knew. I do not regret it because I was finding a way to make money to eat,"" she said. ""But uni was horrific because it pushed me to that work, which is so unfair. I will always be bitter about it."" Student side-hustles to help pay for university Student loan overpayments of Â£28m going unclaimed Universities told not to 'scaremonger' ahead of fee cut The National Student Money Survey found that 57% of those asked said they suffered poor mental health because of money worries - up 11 percentage points from the previous year. Psychotherapist Hannah Morish said that intimate work could easily lead to anxiety and depression. ""Adult work can feel isolating because of the stigma attached to it, meaning that if the student has a negative or dangerous experience they might feel unable to talk about it, leading to a deeper sense of loneliness,"" she said. ""Universities and student unions need to review whether they have advice and safe spaces on campus or online to support students who are considering or actively involved in this kind of work."" Jake Butler, from Save the Student, said that student funding should be given a top priority. ""The doubling of students involved in adult and sex work over two years is alarming and very concerning. But it's not all that unexpected, given the financial situation students are put in,"" he said. ""It is more important than ever for students to be aware of the financial pressures from the outset, so they can plan and budget effectively."" The National Union of Students (NUS) has information aboutdealing with stress,external,managing finances,externalandsupport for student sex workers,external. ""It is important that we break down stigma that prevents student sex workers seeking help from their institutions, family and friends, public health and survivor support services when they require them,"" said Rachel Watters, NUS Women Students' Officer. ""Almost all universities and colleges, as well as most larger students' unions have some kind of advice centre offering support and information about student finance.""

Scottish and Welsh leaders oppose PM's Brexit bill,"The first ministers of Wales and Scotland have both said they would welcome a general election. But Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said they wanted to see the details of any Brexit extension before backing a vote before Christmas. Ms Sturgeon said it was important to ensure the risk of no-deal had been removed. They were speaking at a news conference in Westminster where they joined forces to oppose Boris Johnson's Brexit Bill. The pair accused the UK government of trying to rush through the EU Withdrawal Agreement without scrutiny. The first ministers urged the prime minister Boris Johnson to allow more time for the bill, after he""paused"" his Brexit billwhen the Commons rejected his plan to get it signed off in three days. PM to seek election if EU offers three-month delay How would another Brexit delay work? How soon could there be a general election? Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford said the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were likely to refuse to give consent for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and called for the devolved nations to be given a greater say. Notes to the bill say the UK government will seek legislative consent, however, and Welsh government ministers say the UK government has written to them making the request. In the Commons on Wednesday, however, the prime minister said the Scottish Parliament ""has no role"" in approving his deal. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford agreed there should be adequate time to scrutinise the bill if it proceeds - with Ms Sturgeon saying that must be aÂ ""decent, proper period of time"".Â Ms Sturgeon told the conference it was ""almost certain"" the UK would not leave the EU on 31 October, but added ""the reprieve is currently only a temporary one"". Mr Drakeford echoed her sentiments and warned that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may be ""in limbo or in purgatory"", but was ""not yet dead"". Nicola Sturgeon declared: ""I want to see a general election. I would be very happy to see that general election before Christmas but the circumstances of that have to be such that it doesn't open the risk of a no-deal Brexit. ""And I think all responsible opposition MPs who want to see an election have a duty to make sure that that is the case."" The Welsh first minister said: ""I have always been agnostic on whether a general election or a referendum is the best way to get this decision put back in the hands of the people. ""But I've never been anything but clear that that should be the end, the end objective."" He added: ""What I want to see is this decision put back in the hands of the people who made it in the first place. ""If a referendum comes our way we should grab it with both hands. If a general election comes our way first, I absolutely want a general election."" They welcomed the UK parliament's decision on Tuesday to reject the UK government's timetable of scrutiny of the Withdrawal Bill. The two first ministers have jointly written to Boris Johnson and the president of the European Council asking for an extension to give more time to scrutinise the bill. ""The way in which the prime minister sought to bully parliament into accepting it was shameful,"" Ms Sturgeon said. She added: ""Nobody voted to have the core principles of devolution trampled over in a stampede to get out of the EU come what may."" The Senedd opposes the Withdrawal Bill Wales voted 52.5% to leave in the EU referendum, while Scotland voted by 62% to remain. On Tuesday, theSenedd passed a motion opposing the bill's passage in Parliament. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh government had a ""critical interest"" because many of the provisions of the bill touched on devolved matters. He said that having asked the Senedd to give consent ""the government here in London must respect both the time we need to consider the bill properly and to respect the decisions of devolved parliaments on that question of consent"". He added it was a ""bad deal"" for Wales and the whole of the UK, calling it ""absolutely unacceptable to the Welsh government"". Mr Drakeford said that he ""could not encourage any MP to vote for it because of the damage it would do to Wales"". He warned it would mean lost jobs, investment and income for families and would have an impact on Welsh manufacturing and the agrifood sector. Ms Sturgeon said an extension should not just give time to ""scrutinise a bad bill for a week or two longer"", but long enough to secure a general election or referendum, ""or perhaps... the former leading to the latter"". She confirmed her government would not recommend consent when MSPs considered the legislation. Ms Sturgeon added: ""If this legislation does proceed the consent of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly will be required. The UK government has explicitly accepted that fact."" Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, however, Boris Johnson rejected the idea that the approval of devolved parliaments was necessary. He said: ""The Scottish Parliament has no role in approving this deal. ""On the contrary, it is up to the members of this Parliament to approve the deal."" Since 1999, UK governments have followed the Sewel convention that the UK parliament will not normally legislate with on devolved matters without the consent of the devolved parliaments. But in 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that since it is a political convention, enforcing it is not a matter for the courts.

It could be they wished to abstain, or that they had constituency or ministerial business.  The Speaker and his deputies cannot vote and Sinn Fein members traditionally do not vote. The prime minister told MPs on Tuesday he would ""pause"" the Withdrawal Agreement Bill until the EU took a decision on whether to grant another extension to the current Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Johnson added: ""Let me be clear. Our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on 31 October and that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the House. ""And one way or another we will leave the EU with this deal, to which this House has just given its assent.""

EU eyes Brexit flextension... again,"The Brexit deal is now in limbo after Tuesday's votes in the House of Commons ""The ball is not in our court. The balls are all stuck in the UK's net."" The EU diplomat I was speaking to was frustrated. Hugely frustrated that the EU's newly negotiated Brexit deal was now stuck in limbo after Tuesday's votes in the House of Commons. He was irritated too that the prime minister said the next move would be decided in Brussels. ""We've done our part,"" said the diplomat, who represents a key EU country. ""The 'what next' cannot be seen as our responsibility. We negotiated two Brexit deals with two different UK prime ministers over more than three years. Now we're asked to grant yet another Brexit extension. We have to dance like Pinocchio in this game that isn't ours. It's very upsetting."" But like it or not, Brussels is now the focus of attention. Will the EU grant a new Brexit extension? If so, for how long? What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? A PM intent on giving up on Parliament? Listen to the latest Brexitcast The answer to these questions will most likely influence the next political events in the UK. For example, if the EU refuses a new extension, MPs might well rush to approve the new Brexit deal, rather than face the possibility of no deal. The EU is hardly likely to run that risk though. But if the bloc goes for a longer Brexit delay, then Boris Johnson will want to hold a general election (if parliament grants him one). In Brussels, as European Council president, Donald Tusk, tweeted, some kind of new extension is seen as all but inevitable. The EU doesn't need to wait for the prime minister to ask for one.  Forced to do so under UK law (even though he made his personal opposition obvious) the prime minister submitted a letter of request at the weekend. EU leaders are painfully aware that the length of any extension they now grant will be viewed through a political prism in Brexit-divided UK. A short delay could be seen by those who want to Remain and who hope for a second referendum - as Brussels throwing the UK out on the streets. While a long extension could be perceived by Brexiteers as an EU attempt at holding on to the UK for dear life. Anxious to come across as being as neutral as possible and to avoid becoming entangled in the bitter UK debate, many EU leaders seem to prefer adopting the UK request outlined in the prime minister's letter: a three month Brexit extension lasting until 31 January, to avoid a no deal scenario. As Donald Tusk tweeted, a Brexit extension is seen as all but inevitable For the EU, any Brexit delay is a so-called 'flextension' - meaning the extension can fall way ahead of time. In this case, as soon as parliament ratifies the new Brexit deal. But don't expect the EU to deliver its decision in a hurry. EU leaders are openly fed-up with having to interrupt busy schedules to rush to Brussels for more emergency Brexit summits. They intend to try to agree the length of this new extension in writing, rather than in person. And this will only work if there are no major disagreements between EU members over the length of the new delay. In the meantime, you can expect at least some posturing/grandstanding from certain countries like France, which want to keep the pressure up on MPs and the government. This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Tuesday? Immediately after Tuesday night's vote for example, the French Europe minister growled that ""an extension is requested but with what justifications? Time alone will not bring a solution (to Brexit)."" EU leaders have welcomed the fact that on Tuesday - for the first time ever - a Brexit deal did get the nod from the UK parliament but diplomats point out that the reason they are all especially fatigued and frustrated by the one step forward, at least two steps back Brexit political dance in the UK, is because they fully appreciate this is not even nearly the end of the road. What the EU and UK are grappling with now is merely the UK's leaving process. Real negotiations on the future trade and security relationship - including painful political trade-offs involving fishing rights, work visas and the UK's ability to do trade with other countries - only begin in earnest after Brexit. The words of one exasperated EU diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK were ""I feel like this will never end.""

European press sigh over Brexit 'dragging process',"Many in the European press believe UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to keep his promise of leaving the EU by 31 October following Parliament's rejection of his plan to pass his Brexit bill in three days. The deadline is ""hardly possible"",external, says Germany's Bild.It will ""definitely have to be delayed"",externalsays Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza.Brexit ""will not take place on 31 October, but it is approaching"",external, says France's LibÃ©ration. The question for several is, as the Belgian financial daily De Tijd puts it: ""Will [Mr Johnson] take it to the people after all,external... Polls predict that his Conservatives would quickly win that... On the other hand, he now has a deal and a parliamentary majority. Is that fetish date of 31 October so important?"" ""The question is about the length of a delay,external,"" Italy's Il Corriere della Sera believes. ""Boris apparently will not mind a short one... But if Europe, quite possibly, prefers a longer extension... Johnson might decide that it would be better to resolve the matter once and for all through early elections before Christmas - and he is sure to win the popular vote."" ""In the looming election campaign the prime minister can tell Britons tired of Brexit that, first,he arranged an orderly exit,externalwith the Europeans... Second, he can point at the opposition as those 'guilty' of the ongoing agony of leaving the EU,"" says Germany's Welt. Handelsblatt says Mr Johnson's warning he could call a general election was an ""empty threat"" But ""without the opposition's support, he cannot call a new election,"",externalnotes the financial daily Handelsblatt. Despite his Brexit bill passing its second reading, ""Boris Johnson's obstacle course has not ended,external. The opposition intends to put a whole set of amendments in his way,"" France's Le Figaro says. But this doesn't mean he won't triumph, says Czechia's SeznamZpravy website. ""Boris Johnson might have lost another battle but in the warhe is on his way to a final victory,external. That is if the unbelievably dragging process of the UK's departure from the EU can be called a victory."" And it is not the only commentary exasperated by the process. ""Clarity must be provided quickly now, becausethe human cost of Brexit is already impossible to express,externalin terms of numbers,"" pleads De Morgen in Belgium. ""Politicians are not sufficiently considering the emotional consequences of Brexit."" ""Brexit has turned from a tragicomedy into a distasteful horro,externalr, which is likely to haunt us for the next decade,"" says the Polish Rzeczpospolita. ""The Brexit deal is just the start. It will be followed by a fight over trade, services, farming, and all sorts of issues... Only lawyers and satirists will earn from this divorce.""

"'We got no help when my husband died in Italy'Support for families of British people murdered abroad can be ""patchy and inadequate"", a report says.","Exactly how Briton Russell Cowan died in Italy in 2016 remains unclear The widow of a man who died in Italy in suspicious circumstances says the support she got was ""like a jigsaw that had not been put together effectively"". Trudy Cowan's husband Russell, 44, from Derbyshire, died of ""catastrophic"" head injuries during a trip in 2016. She says her family was ""essentially left on our own"" by the UK authorities. Her comments come as a report from the victims' commissioner for England and Wales called on the government to offer more help in such cases. Dame Vera Baird said support for the bereaved was ""patchy and sometimes inadequate"". The Foreign Office said it had a team supporting the families of British people killed abroad and would look at implementing the commissioner's recommendations. Every year between 60 and 90 UK citizens die in suspicious circumstances overseas. Ex-RAF officer Russell, from Chesterfield, had been in Menaggio near Lake Como with three friends to take part in a classic car rally for charity. He phoned his wife, with whom he had two children, on Saturday, 4 June, 2016 to say he was going out for a meal and was leaving his phone in his room. Trudy received a call on the Sunday morning from one of Russell's friends telling her that her partner of 25 yearshad been involved in an accident and had died. Trudy Cowan (right) says her family were offered no help following her husband's death ""Our priorities were getting to Italy, finding out what happened, and getting Russell back home,"" she says. ""But the support mechanisms that should have been in place for somebody that had lost someone abroad - they weren't there or available for us."" She says the Foreign Office emailed to say nobody would be coming to meet them or help them with the local police. The family were not offered a translator or a family liaison officer, she says, while police in the UK said the incident was out of their jurisdiction. ""Everywhere we turned, we were basically told 'I'm sorry but we can't help you',"" she says. ""It was like trying to swim in a sea of custard, blindfolded. ""It's just not a joined-up approach. It's unwieldy for families that are trying to navigate through a system at a time when you're expected to make decisions at the worst point in your life, when your mind is like a fog."" Mr Cowan's body was found at the bottom of a fence by a private villa (left) Italian authorities concluded his death was an accident after he fell 8m (26ft) from a fence. But his family do not believe it was an accident - a UK coroner ruled in 2017 that there may have been third party involvement - and an appeal against the Italian ruling is being heard in Como next month. Trudy's case was one of those looked at as part of the report published by the Victims' Commissioner on Wednesday. Despite the dedicated team the Foreign Office set up four years ago to support people whose loved ones were killed or murdered outside the UK, Dame Vera Baird said it was still an uphill struggle. Her report cites the case of a bereaved mother who said the Foreign Office would not provide an interpreter for a court hearing in case they made a mistake - the family sued them. A woman whose partner died in India claimed the Foreign Office advised her to have the body cremated rather than repatriated because it was cheaper. Dame Vera said families should get the same entitlements as they do in the UK. Among 17 recommendations, she said families of those murdered abroad should be entitled to financial help under the criminal injuries compensation scheme. The Ministry of Justice said the proposal would be considered as part of a wider review. Trudy says she ""fully endorses"" the recommendations, although she says she would not personally have pursued financial compensation. ""As a family we just want the truth. We want justice for Russell,"" she says. Robert Sebbage, 18, was stabbed to death by a taxi driver in 2011 while on holiday with his friends in Zakynthos. His mother Rhian Sebbage, from Tadley in Hampshire, said she felt ""just a number"" when dealing with the fallout from his death. Stelios Morfis was eventually sentenced to 16 years and four months in prison for murder - after three trials and an appeal hearing in Greece. At the time of Robert's death, theForeign Office said it was providing consular assistanceto his family.  But Mrs Sebbage said British diplomats were unable to ""intervene"" in the case. ""You are on your own,"" she said, adding that the family were not entitled to help from Greece and had to find and pay for lawyers, interpreters, doctors, hotels and flights themselves. ""We were backwards and forwards for three years after the event. I've never sat down and worked out all the costs, but my husband and I will probably be working for a very long time,"" she said. Mrs Sebbage added her husband had to take unpaid time off work after suffering a stress-induced heart attack. ""You're just trying to make sense of it and get your head round it all and move on."" The Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said it helps UK nationals with some of the issues cited by the report and urged anyone who is facing those problems to contact the charity. The Foreign Office said it helped more than 22,000 British people overseas last year, including cases involving more than 4,000 deaths. ""We now have a dedicated team to support families of homicide victims, including funding translation where required,"" it added in a statement. ""We will look at what more we can do, including implementing many of these recommendations."" The Foreign Office said it had recently conducted a review of consular services and it would set out proposals shortly.

Influencers' Instagram posts banned by watchdog,"The ASA said it was concerned that The Only Way Is Essex star Lauren Goodger's waist looked ""artificially thin"" A trio of influencers have had Instagram posts touting diet products banned by the UK's ad regulator. TV stars Katie Price and Lauren Goodger promoted a BoomBod shot drink on their accounts, while Georgia Harrison showed off Protein Revolution's weight loss gummies. The Advertising Standards Authority said the influencers' posts were irresponsible. ""The ads must not appear again in the same form,"" it ruled. BoomBod claims its ""10-calorie shots"" stop people from snacking or overeating, while Protein Revolution says its V24 gummies keep cravings at bay thanks to a vegetable extract. The ASA also banned several posts posted by BoomBod and Protein Revolution via their own accounts. ""It was clear from the ads that the influencers did not need to lose weight in order to achieve a healthy weight,"" the ASA wrote in the BoomBod ruling. Loose Women panellist Katie Price shared before and after photos on her Instagram account ""I can't get enough of it!"" Ms Price wrote in September when she posted a photo of the drink, before going on to describe how it contained vitamins and natural fibre but no laxatives. In March, Ms Goodger shared a photo of herself wearing athletic clothing and holding a BoomBod box. ""Can't believe these amazing results I've gotten with @boombod's 7 day Achiever,"" the former Only Way Is Essex cast member posted. ""The difference I've noticed from using this stuff is amazing."" The regulator said it had concerns that the photo of Ms Goodger appeared to have been edited to make her waist look ""artificially thin"" resulting in a situation ""that the images were not representative of her real body shape"". The ASA said the ads from Ms Price and Ms Goodger had created the impression that it was ""necessary or advisable"" for people who were already slim to use products that suppress their appetites. This represented ""an irresponsible message"", the watchdog added. One fitness expert told the BBC that dieting product companies often rely on health and wellness themes to market their goods. ""It's a real shame the information online [is sometimes] distorted by these companies and influencers,"" personal trainer Will Latta said. He added that people who suffer from self-esteem issues, anxiety, and eating disorders were among those who tended to get drawn in. Love Island contestant Ms Harrison shared a photo of herself promoting weight loss gummies in March. Love Island's Georgia Harrison was criticised by her followers after sharing this ad ""They're delicious and when taken with water they suppress your hunger cravings,"" she posted. At the time, many of her 847,000 followerscalled her out,externalfor being irresponsible and ignorant about body image. ""We received assurances from both advertisers that they have/are removing the posts,"" a spokesman for the ASA told the BBC. This is not the first time the authority has raised concern that influencers' social media posts have encouraged people to lose weight in unhealthy ways. The ASA removed BoomBod ads featuring other models as part of its ban Reality star Jemma Lucy had a post of her advertising weight loss coffeebanned in July, for example. The ASA has published anadvertising guide for influencers,external. Ms Price, Ms Goodger, and Ms Harrison did not respond to requests for comment.

Withdrawal bill explained,"The government'sWithdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB),external, which will take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, has passed all its stages in Parliament and been given Royal Assent. The WAB turns Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement, which is a draft international treaty, into UK law and gives the government permission to ratify it. No new clauses or amendments were passed by MPs, who also rejected changes made in the House of Lords. What does the WAB actually cover? Among other things: It sets out exactly how the UK will make ""divorce bill"" payments to the EU for years to come It repeals the European Communities Act, which took the UK into the EU, but then reinstates it immediately until the end of 2020 when the transition period ends It contains language on how the new protocol on Ireland - setting up what amounts to a customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - will work in practice It sets out areas in which the European Court of Justice still plays a role in the UK, and makes the withdrawal agreement in some respects ""supreme"" over other areas of UK law One of those areas may be in the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement. The bill introduces a duty for the government to report on this It prohibits any extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020, even if a free trade deal isn't ready in time In the section on citizens' rights it sets up an independent monitoring authority (IMA) with which EU nationals in the UK can lodge any complaints about the way the government treats them In several policy areas, particularly in Northern Ireland, the bill gives ministers a lot of power to change the law (through secondary legislation) without MPs getting to vote It introduces a duty for the government to report on its use of the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement A number of clauses in the previous version of the bill have been removed. They include: The possibility of an extension to the transition period and the procedures around that. The bill now prohibits ministers asking for an extension. Workers' rights protections - the government says these will now be part of a separate bill. Checks and balances that MPs were offered as an inducement to pass the old bill in October. For example, the requirement for the government's negotiating position on the future relationship with the EU to be approved by Parliament has gone. And the government's position no longer needs to be in line with the political declaration - the non-legally binding document that accompanied the withdrawal agreement and sets out aspirations for the future relationship. A clause on child refugees. The bill removes the requirement,introduced by Lord Dubs,to agree a deal that if an unaccompanied child claims international protection in the EU, they may come to the UK if they have relatives living in the country. The new bill only requires a government minister to make a statement setting out policy on the subject within two months. Between 2016 and 2018, 426 unaccompanied children came to the UKin this way,external. After the WAB becomes law, the withdrawal agreement also needs to be ratified by the European Parliament. What is the transition period? What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? Then the stage will be set for Brexit on 31 January, when the post-Brexit transition period will begin. For 11 months, the UK will still follow all the EU's rules and regulations, it will remain in the single market and the customs union, and the free movement of people will continue. The challenge for the government will be to get all its new rules and policies in place by the end of this year. This article was originally published on 21 October and has been updated to reflect changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and its passage towards becoming law.

UK 'should consider legalising drug possession',"The government should investigate decriminalising the possession of all illegal drugs in a bid to prevent the rising number of related deaths, a group of MPs has said. The health and social care committee said the level of such deaths in the UK had become a public health ""emergency"". It found the UK's position on drugs was ""clearly failing"" and called for a ""radical new approach"" in policy. The government said it had no plans to decriminalise drug possession. There were 2,670 deaths directly attributed to drug misuse in England last year - an increase of 16% from 2017, according to the committee's report. However, if other causes of premature death among people who used drugs were included, it is likely the number of deaths would be roughly double this, it found. Drugs policy- The UK versus Portugal The UK 'will legalise cannabis', say MPs Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? MPs on the committee said they were so concerned by the consequences of the UK's drugs policy that they had rushed their report out early. They urged the government to urgently consult on making the possession of drugs for personal use a civil rather than criminal matter - an approach they witnessed in Portugal, where drug death rates have fallen dramatically. Such a move would ""save money"" from the criminal justice system and allow for more investment in prevention and treatment, they say. ""Evidence heard throughout this inquiry leads the committee to conclude that UK drugs policy is clearly failing,"" the report said. ""The United Kingdom has some of the highest drug death rates in Europe, particularly in Scotland. ""This report shows how the rate of drug-related deaths has risen to the scale of a public health emergency."" Committee chairman, and Lib Dem MP, Dr Sarah Wollaston said: ""Every drug death should be regarded as preventable, and yet across the UK the number of drugs-related deaths continues to rise to the scale of a public health emergency. ""Recommendations put forward in this report propose changes to drugs policy that are desperately needed to prevent thousands of deaths."" Denmark is among the countries to have introduced supervised drug consumption rooms MPs said the decriminalisation of the possession of drugs would not be effective without investing in harm reduction, support and treatment services for addiction. Responsibility for drugs policy, they argue, should be moved from the Home Office to the Department of Health and Social Care. They also called for a reverse to recent cuts to drug treatment services, as well as ""sufficient funding"" for alternative approaches, like a pilot of drug consumption rooms - supervised healthcare facilities where users can take drugs in safer conditions. Dr Emily Finch, vice-chairman of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, backed the committee's report. She said: ""The increasing number of people needlessly dying from drug addiction shows the government's approach to treating addictions is failing. ""We emphatically support the report's calls for urgent investment in drug treatment services and a return to harm reduction."" A government spokesman said the decriminalisation of drug possession in the UK would not eliminate drugs crime or address harms caused by drug taking. He added: ""We are committed to reducing the use of drugs and the harms they cause, and the Home Office has commissioned a major independent review to examine these issues. ""We must prevent drug use in our communities, support people through treatment and recovery, and tackle the supply of illegal drugs.""

There was widespread international condemnation of the air strike, which the United Nations said may have been a war crime. Since the fighting began on the outskirts of Tripoli more than six months ago, the World Health Organization says that at least 1,000 people have been killed, including around 100 civilians, and 120,000 displaced.

EU eyes 'flextension' (again),"The Brexit deal is now in limbo after Tuesday's votes in the House of Commons ""The ball is not in our court. The balls are all stuck in the UK's net."" The EU diplomat I was speaking to was frustrated. Hugely frustrated that the EU's newly negotiated Brexit deal was now stuck in limbo after Tuesday's votes in the House of Commons. He was irritated too that the prime minister said the next move would be decided in Brussels. ""We've done our part,"" said the diplomat, who represents a key EU country. ""The 'what next' cannot be seen as our responsibility. We negotiated two Brexit deals with two different UK prime ministers over more than three years. Now we're asked to grant yet another Brexit extension. We have to dance like Pinocchio in this game that isn't ours. It's very upsetting."" But like it or not, Brussels is now the focus of attention. Will the EU grant a new Brexit extension? If so, for how long? What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? A PM intent on giving up on Parliament? Listen to the latest Brexitcast The answer to these questions will most likely influence the next political events in the UK. For example, if the EU refuses a new extension, MPs might well rush to approve the new Brexit deal, rather than face the possibility of no deal. The EU is hardly likely to run that risk though. But if the bloc goes for a longer Brexit delay, then Boris Johnson will want to hold a general election (if parliament grants him one). In Brussels, as European Council president, Donald Tusk, tweeted, some kind of new extension is seen as all but inevitable. The EU doesn't need to wait for the prime minister to ask for one.  Forced to do so under UK law (even though he made his personal opposition obvious) the prime minister submitted a letter of request at the weekend. EU leaders are painfully aware that the length of any extension they now grant will be viewed through a political prism in Brexit-divided UK. A short delay could be seen by those who want to Remain and who hope for a second referendum - as Brussels throwing the UK out on the streets. While a long extension could be perceived by Brexiteers as an EU attempt at holding on to the UK for dear life. Anxious to come across as being as neutral as possible and to avoid becoming entangled in the bitter UK debate, many EU leaders seem to prefer adopting the UK request outlined in the prime minister's letter: a three month Brexit extension lasting until 31 January, to avoid a no deal scenario. As Donald Tusk tweeted, a Brexit extension is seen as all but inevitable For the EU, any Brexit delay is a so-called 'flextension' - meaning the extension can fall way ahead of time. In this case, as soon as parliament ratifies the new Brexit deal. But don't expect the EU to deliver its decision in a hurry. EU leaders are openly fed-up with having to interrupt busy schedules to rush to Brussels for more emergency Brexit summits. They intend to try to agree the length of this new extension in writing, rather than in person. And this will only work if there are no major disagreements between EU members over the length of the new delay. In the meantime, you can expect at least some posturing/grandstanding from certain countries like France, which want to keep the pressure up on MPs and the government. This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Tuesday? Immediately after Tuesday night's vote for example, the French Europe minister growled that ""an extension is requested but with what justifications? Time alone will not bring a solution (to Brexit)."" EU leaders have welcomed the fact that on Tuesday - for the first time ever - a Brexit deal did get the nod from the UK parliament but diplomats point out that the reason they are all especially fatigued and frustrated by the one step forward, at least two steps back Brexit political dance in the UK, is because they fully appreciate this is not even nearly the end of the road. What the EU and UK are grappling with now is merely the UK's leaving process. Real negotiations on the future trade and security relationship - including painful political trade-offs involving fishing rights, work visas and the UK's ability to do trade with other countries - only begin in earnest after Brexit. The words of one exasperated EU diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK were ""I feel like this will never end.""

Withdrawal Agreement Bill explained,"The government'sWithdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB),external, which will take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, has passed all its stages in Parliament and been given Royal Assent. The WAB turns Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement, which is a draft international treaty, into UK law and gives the government permission to ratify it. No new clauses or amendments were passed by MPs, who also rejected changes made in the House of Lords. What does the WAB actually cover? Among other things: It sets out exactly how the UK will make ""divorce bill"" payments to the EU for years to come It repeals the European Communities Act, which took the UK into the EU, but then reinstates it immediately until the end of 2020 when the transition period ends It contains language on how the new protocol on Ireland - setting up what amounts to a customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - will work in practice It sets out areas in which the European Court of Justice still plays a role in the UK, and makes the withdrawal agreement in some respects ""supreme"" over other areas of UK law One of those areas may be in the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement. The bill introduces a duty for the government to report on this It prohibits any extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020, even if a free trade deal isn't ready in time In the section on citizens' rights it sets up an independent monitoring authority (IMA) with which EU nationals in the UK can lodge any complaints about the way the government treats them In several policy areas, particularly in Northern Ireland, the bill gives ministers a lot of power to change the law (through secondary legislation) without MPs getting to vote It introduces a duty for the government to report on its use of the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement A number of clauses in the previous version of the bill have been removed. They include: The possibility of an extension to the transition period and the procedures around that. The bill now prohibits ministers asking for an extension. Workers' rights protections - the government says these will now be part of a separate bill. Checks and balances that MPs were offered as an inducement to pass the old bill in October. For example, the requirement for the government's negotiating position on the future relationship with the EU to be approved by Parliament has gone. And the government's position no longer needs to be in line with the political declaration - the non-legally binding document that accompanied the withdrawal agreement and sets out aspirations for the future relationship. A clause on child refugees. The bill removes the requirement,introduced by Lord Dubs,to agree a deal that if an unaccompanied child claims international protection in the EU, they may come to the UK if they have relatives living in the country. The new bill only requires a government minister to make a statement setting out policy on the subject within two months. Between 2016 and 2018, 426 unaccompanied children came to the UKin this way,external. After the WAB becomes law, the withdrawal agreement also needs to be ratified by the European Parliament. What is the transition period? What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? Then the stage will be set for Brexit on 31 January, when the post-Brexit transition period will begin. For 11 months, the UK will still follow all the EU's rules and regulations, it will remain in the single market and the customs union, and the free movement of people will continue. The challenge for the government will be to get all its new rules and policies in place by the end of this year. This article was originally published on 21 October and has been updated to reflect changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and its passage towards becoming law.
