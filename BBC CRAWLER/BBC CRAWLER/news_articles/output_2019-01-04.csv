Airport to host Brexit lorry park trial,"The government hopes to prevent a repeat of Operation Stack, which shut the M20 in 2015 Plans to tackle post-Brexit traffic queues by holding lorries in a disused Kent airport will be tested on Monday, it has been revealed. More than 100 HGVs will travel the 20-mile route from Manston Airport, near Ramsgate, to the Port of Dover. Hauliers fear that a no-deal Brexit will create additional border checks, leading toqueues of up to 29 miles. The government said it had to ""prepare for all eventualities... including a possible no deal"". Theresa May is attempting to persuade MPs to support her draft deal, but hasfaced opposition, including from the DUP,which props up the Conservative government. Duncan Buchanan, of the Road Haulage Association (RHA), which helped to organise the trial, told the BBC: ""These sort of practical, pragmatic tests need to be done - it just shouldn't be done as late as this. ""It should have taken place nine months ago."" Manston Airport closed in May 2014 It is part of Operation Brock, which is intended to maintain traffic flow on the M20 and prevent a repeat of road closuresexperienced in 2015 under Operation Stack. The trial, which will take place between 08:00 and 11:00 GMT on the day many return to work for the first time after Christmas, will test how the A256 copes with increased lorry traffic. It has been organised with the help of the RHA and the Freight Transport Association. Mr Buchanan said import and export businesses on both sides of Channel had ""no idea how they are going to deal with the customs process"" under a no-deal Brexit. Additional customs procedures are expected to create tailbacks He said any additional customs checks would lead to queues, adding: ""The more rigorous the customs, the longer the queues are likely to be."" He said the Department for Transport (DfT) had hoped to keep the trial ""pretty confidential"", but details wereleaked to local press,external. A DfT spokesman said: ""We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU. However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal. ""We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that, if it needs to be implemented, the system is fully functional."" Kent County Council said: ""We are working with the Department for Transport to ensure there is an effective plan in place should there be any disruption once the UK has left the EU."" It said Operation Brock ""would have taken place regardless of the result of the referendum, to improve contingency arrangements for a range of scenarios which could result in cross-Channel disruption, including bad weather and industrial action"".

Women who defied temple mobs 'have no fear',"This video can not be played One of the women who defied protesters to enter the Sabarimala temple says she has 'no fear' Two women who defied protesters to enter one of Hinduism's holiest temples say they have no fear of mobs enraged by their actions. Kanakadurga, 39, and Bindu Ammini, 40, made history by entering Sabarimala shrine in India's Kerala state on Wednesday, sparking protests. The women told the BBC they felt it necessary to uphold women's rights. In September the Indian Supreme Court said the temple's ban against women of menstruating age was discriminatory. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating at the time. Some protesters argue that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayappa, and reacted angrily. How a Temple divided India's women Mob attacks women near Sabarimala temple The Indian god who bars women from his temple Since then women have had their entry blocked in defiance to the ruling, and even been subjected to violence. After prolonged resistance, Ms Ammini and Ms Kanakadurga successfully entered under nightfall alongside plain-clothed police officers on Wednesday. This video can not be played Sabarimala: Women defy historic temple ban After they entered, thousands protesting put Kerala state into virtual lockdown. Right-wing groups, supported by India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demanded a state-wide shutdown, and businesses and transportation became paralysed. Across the state hundreds were arrested, and at least one person was killed in clashes. Speaking to BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi  from a secret location on Friday, Ms Ammini, a law teacher, said she felt it was important for her to visit the shrine in order to uphold ""constitutional principles"" and ""constitutional morality"" within India. ""Gender justice is a big issue facing our society, and the implementation of this judgement helps to implement gender justice,"" she said of their visit. ""I may be killed by the people,"" she said, of the protest response. But Ms Ammini maintained she ""had no fear"" of the angry mobs. The women were photographed during an earlier attempt to enter in December The sentiment was shared by Ms Kanakadurga. ""I am not afraid. But every time women make any progress, society has always made a lot of noise,"" she told the BBC. A religious devotee, she wanted to visit Sabarimala and pray to the deity, she said. The site, which attracts millions of visitors every year, is one of the most prominent in the country. ""Even though I believe in God, I am a person who feels there are some practices that have to change,"" she said. Her view echoes that of Chief Justice Dipak Misra. Handing down the ruling in September,he said religion stood for ""dignity and identity""and women should have equal right to practice it. An effigy of Kerala's Chief Minister burns during a protest Despite the protests, Ms Kanakadurga says she will return to the site next year. The issue has become increasingly contentious in India in the run-up to a general election, which is due to be held by May. The Kerala state government, run by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, supports the court verdict and has vowed to provide protection. Critics have accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda on the issue to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. A day before Ms Ammini and Ms Kanakadurga were able to enter,a 620km (385-mile) human chain of women was organisedin support. After two days of protest in the aftermath, only small demonstrations were reported across Kerala on Friday. ""Overall, the situation is calm, especially around the Sabarimala temple where large number of devotees continue to visit,"" police spokesman VP Pramod Kumar told AFP news agency. Reports suggest a third woman may now have also entered the temple on Thursday, escorted by her husband and under police protection.

"Ellen urges Kevin Hart to reconsider Oscars""I believe in second chances... you should host the Oscars,"" she said, after homophobic tweet scandal.Entertainment & Arts","Ellen DeGeneres said she will ""talk"" Kevin Hart into hosting the Oscars. US comedian and actor Hartpulled out of hosting the awards in December, amid controversy over homophobic tweets he posted almost a decade ago. In an hour-long interview onThe Ellen Show,external, Hart said he is ""evaluating"" his options. It is airing in the US on Friday on NBC at 15:00 GMT. DeGeneres also revealed she had spoken to the Academy about Hart, and tweeted the hashtag, #OscarsNeedHart. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""In this conversation, @KevinHart4real was authentic and real, and I'm in his corner,"" she said. During the interview with DeGeneres, who is openly gay and hosted the Oscars in 2014 and 2007, Hart apologised again for the tweets, but said he did not want the awards to be about his ""tweets from 10 years ago and homophobia"". ""I do not want to stand on that stage and make that night about me and my past, when you have got people who have worked hard to step on that stage for the first time and receive a reward."" The hour-long interview addresses Hart's resignation from hosting next month's Oscars He added: ""Either my apology is accepted or it isn't. Either I can move forward as a person or I can't. But you can't grow as a person without mistakes. ""There is no perfect bone in my body. I have made mistakes and I have embraced them all because I am a better man today because of it. I want to be done with this conversation."" He added that he had apologised at the time, 10 years ago, for the tweets. DeGeneres said: ""I know you are not that guy because I know you. I think the night will be about you, and it should be about you, and you should host the Oscars, and I'm going to talk you into it."" But Nick Levine, a UK journalist who writes about pop culture and LGBT issues, told the BBC: ""Like Ellen DeGeneres, I believe in forgiveness and second chances, but I also believe those things need to be earned. ""Has Kevin Hart made any meaningful effort to reach out to the... community and listen to their perspective on why his past comments are so offensive and damaging? ""I think if he did that, he'd understand why things he said a long time ago - which he's apologised for, and I'm sure completely regrets - have caused him to lose this incredible global platform. ""Once he demonstrates a greater awareness of why his comments hurt... we can start talking about forgiveness and the possibility of Hart hosting the Oscars again.""

Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU,"The route from North Africa to Spain is now Europe's most active The number of people caught trying to enter the EU illegally has fallen to its lowest level in five years, the bloc's border agency says. An estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were registered by Frontex last year, the lowest amount since 2013. It highlighted a sharp fall in the numbers crossing the Mediterranean to Italy, where a populist government has refused to allow rescue boats to dock. But it said that arrivals in Spain had doubled for the second year in a row. The number of people detected in 2018 was 92% below that of 2015, when Europe's migration crisis was at its peak. The figure also fell by a quarter compared to 2017, with the biggest fall reported along the central Mediterranean route from northern Africa to southern Italy. The number of illegal crossings detected there plummeted by 80% to slightly more than 23,000, Frontex says. It added that the number of departures from Libya dropped by 87% in one year, and those from Algeria fell by nearly a half. Frontex says the western Mediterranean route is now Europe's most active. The number of illegal arrivals in Spain - mostly from Morocco - doubled to 57,000 in 2018. This video can not be played Meeting Spain's illegal migrants The agency also gathered data on the gender and ages of those caught trying to enter the EU illegally. Women accounted for 18% of them, it says, while nearly one in five said they were under the age of 18. The figures differ from those recorded by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR),externalwhich says that 123,109 illegal migrants arrived in the EU last year. Frontex says this discrepancy is due to the fact that they cover all of the EU's external land borders whereas the UN primarily measure sea borders. The recent fall in the number of migrants attempting to take the central Mediterranean route to Italy follows the election of a populist government that has taken a hardline stance on immigration. The government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. It has pursued a number of measures to prevent rescued migrants from landing on its shores. In September, it passed a bill that was intended to make it easier to deport migrants and strip them of Italian citizenship. The Italian government's tough immigration policies have drawn protests Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has also frequently come into conflict with migrant rescue ship operators and has banned these ships from docking at Italian ports. Italian policy is that migrants picked up at sea should be returned to Libya by that country's coastguard. But charities and human rights groups say migrants face appalling conditions in Libya, where abuse at the hands of people-trafficking gangs are rife. The man who cut the migrant flow to Italy Migration to Europe in charts On board the migrant ship Aquarius Officials have also warned that those crossing the Mediterranean face a more dangerous journey than ever before. A migrant is rescued off the coast of Malta on Friday, where rescue ships are being denied permission to dock In September, UNHCR said that while the number of people arriving in Europe had fallen, the number of deaths had risen sharply. International Organization for Migration (IOM) data says thatmore than 2,000 people died or went missing making crossings last year.,external ""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risks, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean, said at the time.

Escape room fire kills five in Poland,"The girls were visiting the escape room to celebrate a birthday Five teenage girls have died after a fire broke out while they were playing an escape room game in northern Poland. The girls, all aged 15, were visiting the attraction in the city of Koszalin to celebrate a birthday. A 25-year-old man was seriously injured in the blaze which started at around 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Friday. Leaking gas cylinders are believed to have caused the blaze. Escape rooms have become popular in Poland in the last four years. The authorities have ordered that all venues now be checked to ensure they meet safety standards. Participants are generally locked in a room and must solve a series of puzzles in order to get out. The craze of paying to escape from a locked room Budapest escape games: Behind the scenes The games are popular around the world. The industry has grown rapidly in recent years. It is estimated there are around 1,000 in Poland. In the UK, the number of escape rooms soared from just seven in 2013 to more than 1,000 as of last year. The room was 7.3 sq m (78 sq ft), authorities say. Leaking gas cylinders used to heat the building started a fire in the adjacent waiting room, a prosecutor said. Flames and toxic smoke spread quickly and firefighters used specialised equipment to break in, but it was already too late. The teenagers are believed to have died of asphyxiation. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the fire was an ""appalling tragedy"".

"Sharp fall in illegal migration to EUThe number of people trying to enter the bloc illegally falls to a five-year low, an EU body says.Europe","The route from North Africa to Spain is now Europe's most active The number of people caught trying to enter the EU illegally has fallen to its lowest level in five years, the bloc's border agency says. An estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were registered by Frontex last year, the lowest amount since 2013. It highlighted a sharp fall in the numbers crossing the Mediterranean to Italy, where a populist government has refused to allow rescue boats to dock. But it said that arrivals in Spain had doubled for the second year in a row. The number of people detected in 2018 was 92% below that of 2015, when Europe's migration crisis was at its peak. The figure also fell by a quarter compared to 2017, with the biggest fall reported along the central Mediterranean route from northern Africa to southern Italy. The number of illegal crossings detected there plummeted by 80% to slightly more than 23,000, Frontex says. It added that the number of departures from Libya dropped by 87% in one year, and those from Algeria fell by nearly a half. Frontex says the western Mediterranean route is now Europe's most active. The number of illegal arrivals in Spain - mostly from Morocco - doubled to 57,000 in 2018. This video can not be played Meeting Spain's illegal migrants The agency also gathered data on the gender and ages of those caught trying to enter the EU illegally. Women accounted for 18% of them, it says, while nearly one in five said they were under the age of 18. The figures differ from those recorded by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR),externalwhich says that 123,109 illegal migrants arrived in the EU last year. Frontex says this discrepancy is due to the fact that they cover all of the EU's external land borders whereas the UN primarily measure sea borders. The recent fall in the number of migrants attempting to take the central Mediterranean route to Italy follows the election of a populist government that has taken a hardline stance on immigration. The government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. It has pursued a number of measures to prevent rescued migrants from landing on its shores. In September, it passed a bill that was intended to make it easier to deport migrants and strip them of Italian citizenship. The Italian government's tough immigration policies have drawn protests Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has also frequently come into conflict with migrant rescue ship operators and has banned these ships from docking at Italian ports. Italian policy is that migrants picked up at sea should be returned to Libya by that country's coastguard. But charities and human rights groups say migrants face appalling conditions in Libya, where abuse at the hands of people-trafficking gangs are rife. The man who cut the migrant flow to Italy Migration to Europe in charts On board the migrant ship Aquarius Officials have also warned that those crossing the Mediterranean face a more dangerous journey than ever before. A migrant is rescued off the coast of Malta on Friday, where rescue ships are being denied permission to dock In September, UNHCR said that while the number of people arriving in Europe had fallen, the number of deaths had risen sharply. International Organization for Migration (IOM) data says thatmore than 2,000 people died or went missing making crossings last year.,external ""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risks, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean, said at the time.

Briton 'must not be used as diplomatic pawn',"Russia must not use UK citizens as ""pawns in diplomatic chess"", Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said, after the arrest of a former US Marine with British and American nationality. Mr Hunt said he was ""extremely worried"" about Paul Whelan, who has been detained on suspicion of spying. He added that ""every support"" is being given to the 48-year-old. Mr Whelan's family said he was attending a wedding, while Russia said he was ""caught spying"" in Moscow. It has been reported that Mr Whelan also holds an Irish passport. Who is Paul Whelan? Mr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. He now lives in Michigan and is director of global security for automotive components supplier BorgWarner. He has been visiting Russia for business and pleasure for more than a decade, his brother said. His twin David said he had been told his brother was fine and looking healthy, after US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman visited him this week. In a statement, David said: ""Our focus remains on ensuring that Paul is safe, well treated, has a good lawyer, and is coming home. ""We urge the US Congress and the state department to help on Paul's behalf to secure his release and return him home soon."" Mr Hunt said: ""Individuals should not be used as pawns of diplomatic leverage. We need to see what these charges are against him and understand whether there is a case or not. ""We are giving every support we can, but we don't agree with individuals being used in diplomatic chess games. ""Because it is desperately worrying, not just for the individual but their families, and we are all extremely worried about him and his family as we hear this news."" He added that the UK had not yet had access to Mr Whelan and that the US was leading on this case. Asked about reports he is also Irish, the Irish embassy in Moscow said: ""The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow has requested consular access to an Irish citizen currently detained in Russia after receiving a request for assistance. ""The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will provide all possible and appropriate assistance in relation to this case."" Russia and America have traded spying allegations at regular intervals since the Cold War. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities Mr Whelan travelled to Russia on 22 December and planned to fly home on 6 January, but was arrested in Moscow on 28 December. Under the charge of espionage, he could face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent There is much we still don't know about the detention of Paul Whelan. What are the precise charges against him? Did he really have a memory stick containing a list of Russian intelligence officials when he was arrested, as claimed by one Russian news agency but not thus far corroborated? What lies behind his long-standing interest in Russia and engagement with Russian social media? And how many nationalities does he actually have - American and British, yes, but does he also have Irish and Canadian passports? This lack of certainty about the facts makes Jeremy Hunt's decision to accuse Russia of playing diplomatic chess games all the more interesting. The foreign secretary's remarks support the premise of speculation in the US that Mr Whelan's arrest is a strategic move by Moscow. The suggestion - and it is no more than that - is that the former US marine could be exchanged for a Russian woman who was jailed in the United States last month.Maria Butina, a pro-gun activist, pleaded guilty to trying to influence US conservative groups on behalf of the Russian government. Moscow certainly has a track record of using individuals for unpredictable and aggressive diplomacy. But Mr Hunt has shown that he, for now at least, is ready to respond robustly at a time when Anglo-Russian relations are still struggling to recover from last year's poisoning incident in Salisbury. Mr Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said he had appealed to the court against the detention of his client and requested he was released on bail. He added that Mr Whelan remained in good spirits.

Women who defied temple mobs 'have no fear'The two women who defied a religious ban to enter an Indian temple speak exclusively to the BBC.India,"This video can not be played One of the women who defied protesters to enter the Sabarimala temple says she has 'no fear' Two women who defied protesters to enter one of Hinduism's holiest temples say they have no fear of mobs enraged by their actions. Kanakadurga, 39, and Bindu Ammini, 40, made history by entering Sabarimala shrine in India's Kerala state on Wednesday, sparking protests. The women told the BBC they felt it necessary to uphold women's rights. In September the Indian Supreme Court said the temple's ban against women of menstruating age was discriminatory. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating at the time. Some protesters argue that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayappa, and reacted angrily. How a Temple divided India's women Mob attacks women near Sabarimala temple The Indian god who bars women from his temple Since then women have had their entry blocked in defiance to the ruling, and even been subjected to violence. After prolonged resistance, Ms Ammini and Ms Kanakadurga successfully entered under nightfall alongside plain-clothed police officers on Wednesday. This video can not be played Sabarimala: Women defy historic temple ban After they entered, thousands protesting put Kerala state into virtual lockdown. Right-wing groups, supported by India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demanded a state-wide shutdown, and businesses and transportation became paralysed. Across the state hundreds were arrested, and at least one person was killed in clashes. Speaking to BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi  from a secret location on Friday, Ms Ammini, a law teacher, said she felt it was important for her to visit the shrine in order to uphold ""constitutional principles"" and ""constitutional morality"" within India. ""Gender justice is a big issue facing our society, and the implementation of this judgement helps to implement gender justice,"" she said of their visit. ""I may be killed by the people,"" she said, of the protest response. But Ms Ammini maintained she ""had no fear"" of the angry mobs. The women were photographed during an earlier attempt to enter in December The sentiment was shared by Ms Kanakadurga. ""I am not afraid. But every time women make any progress, society has always made a lot of noise,"" she told the BBC. A religious devotee, she wanted to visit Sabarimala and pray to the deity, she said. The site, which attracts millions of visitors every year, is one of the most prominent in the country. ""Even though I believe in God, I am a person who feels there are some practices that have to change,"" she said. Her view echoes that of Chief Justice Dipak Misra. Handing down the ruling in September,he said religion stood for ""dignity and identity""and women should have equal right to practice it. An effigy of Kerala's Chief Minister burns during a protest Despite the protests, Ms Kanakadurga says she will return to the site next year. The issue has become increasingly contentious in India in the run-up to a general election, which is due to be held by May. The Kerala state government, run by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, supports the court verdict and has vowed to provide protection. Critics have accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda on the issue to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. A day before Ms Ammini and Ms Kanakadurga were able to enter,a 620km (385-mile) human chain of women was organisedin support. After two days of protest in the aftermath, only small demonstrations were reported across Kerala on Friday. ""Overall, the situation is calm, especially around the Sabarimala temple where large number of devotees continue to visit,"" police spokesman VP Pramod Kumar told AFP news agency. Reports suggest a third woman may now have also entered the temple on Thursday, escorted by her husband and under police protection.

13 people file for divorce on Christmas Day,"Thirteen people filed for divorce on Christmas Day in England and Wales, official figures show. They were among 455 online divorce applications submitted to HM Courts & Tribunals Service between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day. Twenty-six people submitted applications on Christmas Eve, 23 on Boxing Day and 77 on New Year's Day. Since April 2018 spouses have been able to complete the divorce application process using the internet. Instead of sending paperwork, people can fill in applications, upload the documents needed and pay fees online. Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show more than 23,000 online divorce applications have been made since the platform was introduced. 'I was married and divorced in my 20s' Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? Divorce rates for opposite-sex couples in England and Wales are at their lowest level since 1973, according to the latest figurespublished by the Office for National Statistics,external. In 2017 there were 101,669 divorces of opposite-sex couples in England and Wales, a decrease of 5% on the previous year. There were 338 divorces of same-sex couples in 2017, more than three times the number in 2016. However, same-sex marriages have only been possible in England and Wales since March 2014. Ammanda Major, from relationship support charity Relate, said her organisation typically saw an increase in requests for help in January. ""Many people hope that the festive period will be a time of coming together, so when this doesn't happen the sense of failure and sadness can further exacerbate problems that were there in the first place,"" she said. ""Pressures can build up when people are spending an extended period of time together. ""For some people it might be the additional financial pressure of Christmas that triggers a problem, while for others it could be the stress of trying to keep everyone from the in-laws to the children happy."" When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK The introduction of ""fully digital"" divorces is part of a Â£1bn plan to modernise the justice system. The MoJ said more than 150,000 people had used online justice services in 2018, taking the total to more than 300,000 in the past four years. This included to lodge civil money claims, for probate applications, personal independence payment appeals and pleas in fare evasion cases and low level-motoring offences. Justice minister Lucy Frazer said: ""These online services are already making a difference to people who use the justice system."" ""As we reach this milestone, it's encouraging to see people are reporting these services work well for them and are a better fit around their busy lives."" The MoJ said the services do not replace existing paper-based applications, but provide a quicker, easier service for many people.

The lucky pair's identities were revealed at a press conference just outside Belfast on Friday. Speaking to the media, Frances Connolly said the money will be shared between family, friends and charitable causes. The couple have made a list of people they want to share their win with ""This is a massive sum of money and we want it to have a huge impact on the lives of other people we know and love, as well as on our future too."" The 52-year-old said the most important thing they have done since their win was to have made a list of people they want to give the money to. ""At the minute there are about 50 people,"" she said, adding that most of those on the list do not yet know they are on it. ""It's going to be so much fun giving it away,"" she said. ""The pleasure for me is going to be seeing their faces."" Her husband Patrick Connolly, 54, said: ""I've got a wonderful wife, a wonderful family and wonderful friends, so this is the icing on the cake. Patrick Connolly said he was ""blessed with a great family"" before the win ""Money doesn't bring you happiness. We already had happiness and were very blessed in life."" Mr Connolly is a businessman who once ran his own firm. He predicted he would not be able to sit around long before he had to get back to doing something. He said his expertise was in manufacturing and he hoped to create more jobs using part of their fortune. They said they were hard-working people who did not carry a lot of debt and did not indulge in luxuries before their win. ""We are quite level-headed people, we're not overly extravagant - yet,"" said Mr Connolly. Asked by a reporter if they had thought about personal security, Mrs Connolly quipped: ""I've never met anyone I couldn't take down myself!"" The couple - who have three daughters and three grandchildren - are regular Lotto players but only normally buy tickets for EuroMillions when there is a big jackpot. The pair live in a rented home and were previously considering a move to Croydon in March as Mr Connolly had been offered a new job as an operations manager. Mrs Connolly, who had worked as an educational programme coordinator, is planning to do a PhD in clinical psychology. The couple laughed and joked with the assembled press The winning numbers - 01, 08, 11, 25, 28, with Lucky Stars 04 and 06 - were selected at random, they said. ""Totally random, sure how would you pick those numbers? They're weird,"" Mrs Connolly joked, before adding that a holiday to Mauritius is on the cards. She admitted that she will find it heartbreaking to read letters from people the couple cannot help, adding: ""It will keep me up at night."" After the press conference, the couple went outside the hotel and laughed and joked as they sprayed champagne and kissed for photographers. At one point, Mrs Connolly joked with the assembled media pack that she only wanted images that showed her with ""one chin"". The grandparents punched the air and waved their bumper cheque as the champagne flowed to toast their win. After spraying multiple bottles, Mrs Connolly asked lottery advisers: ""Who's going to clean all this up?"" Speaking to BBC News NI, Andy Carter of the National Lottery said its most important role is ""looking after someone as they're going through a really life-changing experience"". ""We make sure they have access to good legal advice and good financial advice, but it's primarily about supporting them through a period of both shock and excitement,"" he said. Mr Carter explained that the decision on whether or not to go public about a win can be a difficult one. ""The greatest advice is to take your time - do nothing quickly. Our advice is go away and have a holiday - take some time to really come to terms with it."" He added that past winners rarely make ostentatious purchases at an early stage. ""We often ask them what was your first purchase and they'll say the toilet seat was broken or the kettle wasn't working. Nothing surprises us!"" Northern Ireland has had a history of big wins. In December 2013,an unemployed woman from Strabane, County Tyrone, won almost Â£27m in the EuroMillions lottery. At the time, Margaret Loughrey said that on the day she bought the ticket, she had been to the job market to get an application form for a job with a charity. In 2004,a cancer patient from Belfast became the biggest ever winner of the UK's National Lottery.,external Iris Jeffrey scooped Â£20.1m with a ticket she bought on 14 July but only realised she had hit the jackpot the following month after hearing an appeal by lottery organisers Camelot.

Ellen urges Kevin Hart to reconsider Oscars,"Ellen DeGeneres said she will ""talk"" Kevin Hart into hosting the Oscars. US comedian and actor Hartpulled out of hosting the awards in December, amid controversy over homophobic tweets he posted almost a decade ago. In an hour-long interview onThe Ellen Show,external, Hart said he is ""evaluating"" his options. It is airing in the US on Friday on NBC at 15:00 GMT. DeGeneres also revealed she had spoken to the Academy about Hart, and tweeted the hashtag, #OscarsNeedHart. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""In this conversation, @KevinHart4real was authentic and real, and I'm in his corner,"" she said. During the interview with DeGeneres, who is openly gay and hosted the Oscars in 2014 and 2007, Hart apologised again for the tweets, but said he did not want the awards to be about his ""tweets from 10 years ago and homophobia"". ""I do not want to stand on that stage and make that night about me and my past, when you have got people who have worked hard to step on that stage for the first time and receive a reward."" The hour-long interview addresses Hart's resignation from hosting next month's Oscars He added: ""Either my apology is accepted or it isn't. Either I can move forward as a person or I can't. But you can't grow as a person without mistakes. ""There is no perfect bone in my body. I have made mistakes and I have embraced them all because I am a better man today because of it. I want to be done with this conversation."" He added that he had apologised at the time, 10 years ago, for the tweets. DeGeneres said: ""I know you are not that guy because I know you. I think the night will be about you, and it should be about you, and you should host the Oscars, and I'm going to talk you into it."" But Nick Levine, a UK journalist who writes about pop culture and LGBT issues, told the BBC: ""Like Ellen DeGeneres, I believe in forgiveness and second chances, but I also believe those things need to be earned. ""Has Kevin Hart made any meaningful effort to reach out to the... community and listen to their perspective on why his past comments are so offensive and damaging? ""I think if he did that, he'd understand why things he said a long time ago - which he's apologised for, and I'm sure completely regrets - have caused him to lose this incredible global platform. ""Once he demonstrates a greater awareness of why his comments hurt... we can start talking about forgiveness and the possibility of Hart hosting the Oscars again.""

DeGeneres called the academy prior to the interview, because she had initially been ""so excited"" about Hart being asked. ""They were like, 'Oh my God, we want him to host,'"" DeGeneres recounted, explaining that they admitted the situation could possibly have been mishandled. ""The academy is saying, 'What can we do to make this happen?'"", she said. DeGeneres urged the Get Hard actor to ""not pay attention"" to the ""haters on the internet."" However, Hart described the revelation of his past tweets as a ""malicious attack on his character...to destroy (him)"". ""It's bigger than just the Oscars,"" he said, emphatically stating that ""somebody has to take a stand against the trolls"". ""Then they win,"" DeGeneres responded, before saying she prays that he comes back. ""You have grown. You have apologised. You're apologising again right now... don't let those people win. Host the Oscars."" Hollywood Reporter recent said:""It's January, so why is there still no host?"",externalsaying only twice before has the host not been announced until this month.

"Cervical screening campaigner, 31, dies","Cervical cancer screening campaigner Natasha Sale died six days after her 31st birthday A mum who campaigned to lower the cervical screening age from 25 to 18 has died of cancer aged 31. Natasha Sale, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016, launched an online petition in August. The mum of four, from Newton Abbot, Devon, achieved more than 78,000 signatures before her death. Her supporters are now trying to get more than 100,000 before 3 February so that the issue will get debated in Parliament. ""It's too late for me but it's not too late for the next generation of young ladies,"" Ms Sale wrote in August. ""By reducing the age of smear tests and cervical screenings today we can save lives, we can tackle cell changes early and prevent cervical cancer. ""If I can do anything with my life I want to make this change happen."" More stories from across Devon and Cornwall The mum of four leaves behind Josh, 12, Ella, 11, Lily, nine and four-year-old Oakley Her friends and supporters launched Natasha's Army to continue the campaign with the aim of helping women ""lose the fear and get the smear"". Best friend Amanda Scott, 30, said the group wanted to carry on Ms Sale's mission to get 100,000 signatures following her death. She added that Natasha's Army was also raising money to support her friend's young family. Best friend Amanda Scott said Natasha's Army would carry on Ms Sale's campaign Ms Sale, who died on 28 December, six days after her birthday, left behind her partner Dean and children Josh, 12, Ella, 11, Lily, nine, and four-year-old Oakley.

'No way' DUP will back Brexit deal,"The DUP's Sammy Wilson is worried the UK will remain closely aligned to EU rules in perpetuity There is ""no way"" the Democratic Unionist Party will back Theresa May's Brexit deal, a leading figure has said. Sammy Wilson told the BBC he was ""more alarmed"" than ever about what the deal would mean for Northern Ireland. The DUP, which props up Theresa May's government, has held talks with the PM in recent days as she tries to persuade MPs to back the deal later this month. The PM is seeking further legal assurances from the EU but it has said negotiations will not be re-opened. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. MPs will decide whether to accept or reject the withdrawal terms negotiated by Mrs May, as well as the framework of future relations, in a vote expected on 15 January. Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Ireland and the EU - a special case The vote was due to be held in December but Mrs May postponed it after it became clear she would be heavily defeated. In the three weeks since then, she has been appealing to EU leaders to do more to allay MPs' concerns over parts of the agreement, particularly the proposed Irish backstop. This arrangement would see the UK remain closely aligned to EU rules if the two sides' future relationship is not settled by the end of 2020, when the proposed transition period will end, or if another way is not found of preventing physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The prime minister has said the UK can ""turn a corner"" if the Brexit deal is approved Mrs May, who had a ""friendly phone call"" with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Friday, insists it is a contingency plan that all sides agree should not be needed. But the DUP are adamantly opposed, saying it will create new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and could end up as the default template for future relations. Mr Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that little had changed since mid-December and his party believed the backstop was a ""con trick"" that was being imposed on the UK. Asked if there was any way the party could support the PM's deal, he replied ""no there is not"". ""It is not just because of the regulations which Northern Ireland would be subject to with the backstop, but also the fact we would have to treat the rest of the UK as a third country and we would not participate in any trade deals which the UK may enter into the future"". This video can not be played ""A problem created in the United Kingdom"" - Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Brexit On Thursday, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the border issue was the only ""red line"" his country has had in the Brexit negotiations and that would not change. While he and other EU leaders were prepared to offer assurances and clarifications to help Mrs May get the agreement through Parliament, he said it has ""to be a proposal that we can accept"". ""It can't be a proposal that contradicts what is already in the withdrawal agreement,"" he said. ""It can't be something that renders the backstop inoperable, for example."" The DUP have said talk of the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland is ""nonsense propaganda"", since neither London nor Dublin wants it or is willing to construct the infrastructure. No-deal Brexit 'biggest threat' to unis Airport to host Brexit lorry park trial Farmers warned of Brexit no-deal 'turbulence' The BBC understands that up to 40 Conservative MPs are likely to vote against the Brexit agreement even if Mrs May secures further concessions on the backstop. This would mean almost certain defeat for Mrs May, since Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have all vowed to vote against the deal. Many Tory members of the European Research Group remain opposed to the UK handing over Â£39bn, as part of the proposed financial settlement, in return for what they say are vague promises over future trading terms and would prefer the UK to leave without a deal. Meanwhile, preparations for a possible no-deal exit are being stepped up in a number of areas. A plan to keep traffic moving around Kent and to minimise disruption and delays at Channel ports is to be tested in the coming days. More than 100 HGVs will be parked at the disused Manston airport near Ramsgate and then driven the 20 miles down the A256 to the Port of Dover. The Department for Transport said the manoeuvres, part of Operation Brock, were being carried out so that if they ""need to be implemented, the system is fully functional"". And a new government website advising the public and business on how to prepare will be launched on Tuesday. The Department for Exiting the European Union said the site, which will be available through the gov.uk portal, will contain ""some new information"". There will be sections devoted to European nationals living in the UK and British expats living on the Continent. A spokesman said there would be ""advice"" on what people need to do in the event of the UK leaving without a deal. The website will also cover other scenarios, including if the UK leaves on the basis of Mrs May's agreement. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson When Theresa May pulled the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit last month, the day before MPs were about to pass their verdict on her deal, Downing Street hoped two things would happen. First, that the EU would offer some form of legal guarantee that the Northern Irish backstop - the arrangements for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland - would be temporary. This, in turn, would bring the DUP on board - and unlock further support from previously hostile Conservative backbenchers. Second, that some sceptical MPs, once away from the febrile atmosphere at Westminster, would quietly reflect over Christmas that the deal wasn't as bad as all that, as it at least guarantees that the UK will leave the EU at the end of March. So perhaps any rebellion would diminish, if not evaporate. But neither hope has - yet - been realised, with the vote now less than two weeks away. Is May any closer to get deal over the line? What are the Brexit backstop options? What happens now that a deal's been done?

"Briton 'must not be used as diplomatic pawn'The foreign secretary says he's worried about Paul Whelan, held in Russia on suspicion of spying.","Russia must not use UK citizens as ""pawns in diplomatic chess"", Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said, after the arrest of a former US Marine with British and American nationality. Mr Hunt said he was ""extremely worried"" about Paul Whelan, who has been detained on suspicion of spying. He added that ""every support"" is being given to the 48-year-old. Mr Whelan's family said he was attending a wedding, while Russia said he was ""caught spying"" in Moscow. It has been reported that Mr Whelan also holds an Irish passport. Who is Paul Whelan? Mr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. He now lives in Michigan and is director of global security for automotive components supplier BorgWarner. He has been visiting Russia for business and pleasure for more than a decade, his brother said. His twin David said he had been told his brother was fine and looking healthy, after US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman visited him this week. In a statement, David said: ""Our focus remains on ensuring that Paul is safe, well treated, has a good lawyer, and is coming home. ""We urge the US Congress and the state department to help on Paul's behalf to secure his release and return him home soon."" Mr Hunt said: ""Individuals should not be used as pawns of diplomatic leverage. We need to see what these charges are against him and understand whether there is a case or not. ""We are giving every support we can, but we don't agree with individuals being used in diplomatic chess games. ""Because it is desperately worrying, not just for the individual but their families, and we are all extremely worried about him and his family as we hear this news."" He added that the UK had not yet had access to Mr Whelan and that the US was leading on this case. Asked about reports he is also Irish, the Irish embassy in Moscow said: ""The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow has requested consular access to an Irish citizen currently detained in Russia after receiving a request for assistance. ""The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will provide all possible and appropriate assistance in relation to this case."" Russia and America have traded spying allegations at regular intervals since the Cold War. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities Mr Whelan travelled to Russia on 22 December and planned to fly home on 6 January, but was arrested in Moscow on 28 December. Under the charge of espionage, he could face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent There is much we still don't know about the detention of Paul Whelan. What are the precise charges against him? Did he really have a memory stick containing a list of Russian intelligence officials when he was arrested, as claimed by one Russian news agency but not thus far corroborated? What lies behind his long-standing interest in Russia and engagement with Russian social media? And how many nationalities does he actually have - American and British, yes, but does he also have Irish and Canadian passports? This lack of certainty about the facts makes Jeremy Hunt's decision to accuse Russia of playing diplomatic chess games all the more interesting. The foreign secretary's remarks support the premise of speculation in the US that Mr Whelan's arrest is a strategic move by Moscow. The suggestion - and it is no more than that - is that the former US marine could be exchanged for a Russian woman who was jailed in the United States last month.Maria Butina, a pro-gun activist, pleaded guilty to trying to influence US conservative groups on behalf of the Russian government. Moscow certainly has a track record of using individuals for unpredictable and aggressive diplomacy. But Mr Hunt has shown that he, for now at least, is ready to respond robustly at a time when Anglo-Russian relations are still struggling to recover from last year's poisoning incident in Salisbury. Mr Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said he had appealed to the court against the detention of his client and requested he was released on bail. He added that Mr Whelan remained in good spirits.

Man stabbed to death on train,"Police and paramedics were called to Horsley station A man has been murdered in front of horrified passengers on board a train in Surrey. The victim was stabbed to death on the 12:58 Guildford to London Waterloo service, British Transport Police (BTP) said. An eyewitness told the BBC he had been involved in a ""vicious fight"" on the train beforehand. His attacker then fled and is being hunted. The train is currently being held at Horsley railway station. Emergency crews remain at the scene, in the village of East Horsley and police teams are searching the surrounding area for the suspect. No arrests have been made. A BTP spokesman said the victim suffered a fatal stab wound. Det Supt Gary Richardson said it was a ""shocking and violent attack which took place on board a train in broad daylight"". He said it was an ""incredibly frightening"" incident for passengers on the train. Police are searching the Clandon area for the suspect Police believe the suspect and victim boarded the train at London Road (Guildford) at 13:01 GMT. It is understood the offender then left the train at Clandon railway station, police said. Timetable information,externalfor the train shows it left Clandon at 13:06 - five minutes after the pair boarded the service. Police said a number of officers were now in the Clandon area trying to find the man responsible. ""We would encourage anyone who was on this train to come forward, regardless of whether or not they think they can help,"" Det Supt Richardson said. Forensics officers are at the scene in Horsley Vicky Carter and Adrian Harms, BBC News Police are stopping everyone from getting through to the station in Horsley. There is crime tape sealing off the paths in the area and a private ambulance has been spotted driving past. Initially unaware of the news, more and more people are driving up and being turned away by officers. Clandon and Horsley are picturesque villages in the heart of the Surrey commuter belt - a very affluent part of the county with big houses, quiet roads, country pubs and very little crime. The last murder that rocked the community in Horsley took place about 20 years ago,external- when John Duffy, abducted 15-year-old Maartje Tamboezer who was last seen near the station. But at the moment, it's the manhunt that is foremost in residents' minds. Everyone is shocked and bewildered and people are expressing their worry and concern about a knifeman who remains on the run. John Tindall, who runs a cycle shop at Horsley station, saw police and paramedics who were first on the scene. He said: ""The paramedic went over the bridge with the officer and they attended some sort of an incident involving the gentleman."" About half a dozen police cars and two ambulances were also there. He said: ""There was no panic at all, it was just people calmly getting off the train and just wandering around. That's why I didn't think much of it really, but it appears it was much worse than I thought."" South East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed crews were called to the station at about 13:30 and were joined by police and the Surrey Air Ambulance. A statement issued by the ambulance trust said: ""Despite the best efforts of everyone, a man was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."" The train is currently being held at Horsley railway station Rail services are suspended between Guildford and Effingham Junction.

"Train stabbing victim was with son, 14","A cordon was in place at Horsley station A man who was stabbed to death on a train in Surrey was with his 14-year-old son at the time, police have said. A manhunt is under way for the 51-year-old victim's killer, who fled from the train after the stabbing during a ""vicious fight"" on board the London-bound service. The victim and the attacker had both boarded the train at the same station. British Transport Police say they do not believe the pair were known to each other. Supt Paul Langley said the teenager would have seen the killing. ""This would have been an horrific and hugely traumatic event to have witnessed and we are providing him with as much support as possible,"" he said. Early indications suggested the boy's father received multiple stab wounds in the attack. The offender is described as black, in his 20s or 30s, with a slim build and a beard, dressed all in black with white trainers. People have been urged not to approach him but to call 999. Forensics officers took items away from Horsley station Police have said the suspect and victim had got on the train at London Road (Guildford) at 13:01 GMT and the offender left the service at Clandon, five minutes later. Officers boarded the train at the next stop, Horsley. Describing the attack as ""violent and deadly"", Supt Langley said there had been a number of sightings of the suspect, who fled towards Dedswell Drive. He said officers were in the area looking for the killer and BTP was working closely with Surrey Police and the National Police Air Service. An eyewitness to the killing told the BBC there had been a ""vicious fight"" on the train. One social media user who said she had been on the train praised the ""incredible"" response of the guards and driver in a tweet to South Western Railway. She wrote: ""I was on this train, how those guards and especially that train driver went into action was nothing short of incredible."" A private ambulance was seen arriving Oliver Thompson, a 16-year-old student living in Clandon, said he was stopped by police in the area at roughly 14:30 and asked if he had seen a ""man running from the station"". A little later he saw police helicopters circling the area before being joined by ""a police van with high-powered lights"" as night fell. ""It is definitely unnerving to think there is a murderer maybe somewhere in the village."" Horsley station was closed for several hours while forensic investigations took place Matt Phelps, 35, who works at a business on Epsom Road in West Clandon, said there were three helicopters circling overhead when they locked up and went home. ""To think there was someone like that potentially hiding around the corner somewhere certainly made us want to pack up and go home quicker than usual,"" he said. After the attacker left the train at Clandon, emergency services were called to help the injured man when the train reached Horsley. Emergency teams were at the scene for several hours Transport Secretary Chris Grayling described the stabbing as ""tragic"" and said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the victim and their family."" The train remained at Horsley station for several hours, blocking the line into London Waterloo. Rail services were suspended between Guildford and Effingham Junction while police carried out investigations, but South Western Railway has said trains are now calling at Clandon and Horsley again.

Tips on how to limit excessive screen time,"Is your family's screen use out of control? New guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) has stopped short of recommending specific limits on screen time, saying there is little evidence that it is harmful. But some parents have told the BBC they are frustrated by the advice and England's children's commissioner has said parents need more support. Andy, whose son is 14, contacted the BBC to say he was disappointed by the advice. ""There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that screen time is damaging school performance and sports performance and dangerously addictive. ""I have had to restrict my son's screen time to a Friday after school and a Saturday, due to lack of focus at school. His default was to head straight to the Xbox (which I would certainly classify as screen time... it is just a game after all which most boys are engaging in across all devices). ""After some grumbling, he has settled in and we have seen an improvement in school performance. ""I coach the under-15 football team and it is very clear, even with a 14:00 kick-off on a Sunday, who has been up all night on some form of screen."" Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, believes guidance is sorely needed by parents. ""The fact that there isn't enough evidence doesn't mean we shouldn't have a view and try to work out what's best to do. Children are getting screens earlier, the average age to get a smartphone is now nine. Parents tell me that it is the one thing that drives them mad, causes huge rows, and they don't know what to do about it. ""Parents are worried their kids will be socially damaged if they don't give them a phone, so they're in a tough spot."" Parents can 'worry less' about screen time How much screen time is 'too much'? Screen time can disrupt sleep The RCPCH said there was no good evidence yet that time in front of a screen is definitely ""toxic"" to health, although they did publish a list of questions families can ask to assess whether screen use is affecting their children negatively. The questions are: Is your family's screen time under control? Does screen use interfere with what your family want to do? Does screen use interfere with sleep? Are you able to control snacking during screen time? So if parents feel like screen time is having an adverse impact on their children's life, what should they do? Last year, Anne Longfield published the Digital 5 A Day campaign, which encouraged the whole family to have a healthy digital lifestyle, including parents. ""It can't be that parents have their phones in their hand the whole time. It works best if the whole family can look into a healthy digital way of life."" Anne Longfield's tips for managing screen time include: Set some boundaries. You wouldn't let a nine-year-old walk alone down a busy road. Phone use is the same, if a child has a smartphone at a young age you need to be aware of the dangers on their behalf. If screen time is affecting sleep, meal time interaction, diet, and exercise then negotiate and make a deal. This might be that the phone is not used at the dinner table or in the bedroom, or before breakfast, or until homework is completed. Consider your own use, parents need to demonstrate good behaviour. Ms Longfield is now calling on the government to put digital emotional resilience into schools in Years 6 and 7. She is also calling for tech companies to be more ""robust and have a duty of care for their users"". Dr Richard Graham is a child and adolescent psychiatrist. In 2010, he launched the UK's first Technology Addiction Service for young people, and is on the board of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety. He recommends that clients adopt the American Academy of Pediatricsfamily media plan,external, which allows a family to set limits together. ""This plan helps a family to look at the sort of media you are going to access, rather than restriction without explanation. ""There is good stuff online, which can make us feel well and healthy. A funny filter on Snapchat for example, can lift a child's mood. But there is also toxic content, and also the fact that screen time can disrupt important and necessary things like sleep, exercise and conversation."" His tips include: Prioritise sleep. A well-rested child is more in control and able to think and discuss than a tired and irritable one. The American Academy of Pediatrics website offers a guide to the length of sleep your child needs for their age. Calculate their bedtime based on when they have to get up. Be wary about surveillance as it can drive behaviour underground. It's important children feel they can talk about issues. Less time online equals less exposure to the possibility of toxic content. Says Dr Graham: ""It makes sense that if the window is not open so wide, less dirt will fly in."" Dr Tara Porter, a clinical psychologist specialising in child and adolescent mental health, says she is concerned about screen use as a clinician and a parent. ""Girls are being sucked into drama at a younger age, things said face-to-face are often less hurtful than things said in the online echo chamber, which can be escalated,"" she says. ""A focus on the best appearance can also lead to dissatisfaction and unhappiness."" Her tips include: Supervise the device until they are 16 years old. Make it a condition of them having the device that you help them use it sensibly. Use parental control apps like Our Pact and Circle to limit access to devices. Stay on the front foot - before you give them a device, set out a contract of use Concerned parents have a bewildering array of options to choose from when seeking to manage how much time their children spend on screens. Some home routers and security packages allow parents to set time limits for devices and monitor and police what can be seen online. Some can be used to impose time limits but these can be very blunt tools. Most game consoles and computers include tools that can restrict how long the particular gadget is used for. Finally, there are apps and other tools from Apple, Google, Facebook and others that can monitor how much time is spent on various programmes. Some let parents set hard limits so net access, apps or machines are locked at specific times.

Who is Paul Whelan?,"Former US Marine Paul Whelan has been released from a Russian prison after more than five years in custody. Mr Whelan, 54, was given a 16-year jail sentence in 2020 after being detained in Moscow two years earlier on suspicion of spying. The Michigan native had been left out of two previous prisoner swaps, including the one that freed US women's basketball star Brittney Griner. President Joe Biden, who pledged to ""never give up"" on securing his freedom, hailed the release of Mr Whelan and 15 other Westerners on Thursday as ""a feat of diplomacy"". The US had previously designated Mr Whelan as ""wrongfully detained"" - a classification that committed the government to work on his release. Grim life of American 'spy' in Russian labour camp I'm more Mr Bean than James Bond, says spy suspect Mr Whelan is a citizen of four countries - the US, Canada, the UK and the Republic of Ireland. From Novi, Michigan - a suburb of Detroit - he was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. Military records show he joined the US Marine Corps Reserves in 1994, about six years after reportedly working in law enforcement as a police officer and sheriff's deputy in Michigan. He started as an IT project manager for a company called Kelly Services in the early 2000s, but deployed with the Marines within a couple of years on the first of two tours to Iraq, in 2004 and then 2006. It was while serving in the Marines that he made his first trip to Russia, a visit he detailed on his website, which was shut down several years ago. Sharing pictures of the visit, he described having a ""quite enjoyable time"" exploring the cities of Moscow and St Petersburg. But in 2008, Mr Whelan - who had by then achieved the rank of staff sergeant - was discharged from the Marines for bad conduct. The Pentagon, which released his records, said the charges related to larceny.CNN reports he was accused of using someone else's social security number,external, and ""writing bad cheques"". His family was reportedly unaware of these events. Mr Whelan continued to work for Kelly Services, and was promoted to senior manager of global security and investigations in 2010. According to court documents, he was in charge of the company's campus security group, and his duties included managing and conducting investigations, as well as handling some purchasing. He left the company in 2016, moving to become director of global security for US-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner. Mr Whelan was ""responsible for overseeing security"" at facilities in Michigan and around the world, a company statement said. The company does not have any facilities in Russia, but the former Marine often travelled there. Since his first visit in 2006, Mr Whelan made a number of other trips to Russia and developed an in-depth knowledge of the country. It was due to his knowledge of Russia that he had been asked to attend the wedding of a fellow former Marine in Moscow in December 2018, his brother David told the BBC's Newshour after his arrest. ""His experience of having already been to the Kremlin and walked around Red Square and navigating the metro, his friend felt Paul could assist a bunch of Americans who hadn't otherwise ever been to Moscow,"" David Whelan said. On 28 December, however, he was arrested by Russia's FSB state security agency, which claimed he had been ""caught spying"" in Moscow. At the time, there were uncorroborated reports he had been caught receiving a digital storage device containing a list of intelligence officials. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities There was also speculation over other possible motives for the arrest, which included a suggestion Mr Whelan was detained so he could be exchanged for Maria Butina - a Russian gun rights activist, who was jailed in the US in December 2018. She was deported back to Russia in October 2019. David Whelan, meanwhile, has dismissed the allegations as nonsense. ""I can't imagine how someone with a law enforcement background who is also a former US Marine, and who is now working in corporate security and is also aware of the risks of travel, would have broken any law let alone the law related to espionage,"" he said. Mr Whelan's friends in Russia, some with military connections like him, have also rebutted the charges of spying, all telling the BBC the idea was laughable. In court in Moscow, he was nervous at first - but soon began speaking out to call himself a political hostage and denounce a 'kangaroo court'. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford has followed Mr Whelan's case from the very start and interviewed him multiple times. The last time they spoke by phone from prison, he told her he felt ""abandoned"" and ""seriously betrayed"" by the US government. Left behind in previous prisoner swaps, he had grown despondent. Life in prison was tough, with guards waking him up multiple times to check he hadn't escaped. Stuck serving a 16-year sentence, Mr Whelan said his parents were elderly, his beloved dog had died and his life was ""slipping away"" while the US government looked for a deal. ""Now that's finally happened,"" Rainsford writes. ""Paul Whelan is going home and I suspect he himself can barely believe it.""

Trump 'isn't going to back off' on shutdown,"This video can not be played President Trump confirms he's prepared to shut down the government for months or years US President Donald Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a US-Mexico border wall without the approval of Congress. It came after he met senior Democrats, who refused his requests for funding. The stand-off has seen Mr Trump withhold support for a bill to fully fund the government until he gets money for the border wall. He said he was prepared for the partial government shutdown - now in its third week - to last years. Around 800,000 federal workers have been without pay since 22 December. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Trump aides and lawmakers will meet later on Saturday in a fresh bid to resolve the impasse. The Republican president initially gave a positive account of the 90-minute meeting at the White House, describing it as ""very productive"". But when asked whether he had considered using emergency presidential powers to bypass congressional approval of funding, Mr Trump said he had. ""I may do it. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it."" Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing ""I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing,"" the president added. ""I don't call it a shutdown, I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and safety of our country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday's meeting had been ""contentious"", while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted."" Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington Donald Trump says he can declare a ""national emergency"" and build his promised wall along the border without congressional approval. If that's the case, the question becomes why he doesn't go ahead and do that. Why put federal workers through the pain of forgoing pay and hamstring key government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, if he could bypass Democratic objections with the snap of his presidential fingers? The answer is because the solution isn't that simple. There are provisions of US law that allow the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from Defence Department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes. Such a move may prompt Congress, including Republicans, to push back. Then there's the inevitable legal challenge from Democrats to such an exercise of presidential authority. Any presidential order to build a wall would be met by an equally imposing wall of court filings blocking its construction. The president's latest suggestions are best viewed as simply another attempt to gain the upper hand in negotiations with Democrats. This may not be a threat, more a bluff. Democrats, who now hold the majority in the House, passed spending bills on Thursday to reopen the government, including $1.3bn (Â£1bn) of border security funds until 8 February. But the legislation cannot take effect unless it passes the Republican-controlled Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell said his party would not back any measure without the president's support. This video can not be played Five historic moments as new US Congress opens The Kentucky senator called the Democratic budget ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump also told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 raise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. The fiscal fiasco began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Two vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 - Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine - have broken ranks to back approving the budget and ending the shutdown. The White House is again floating the idea of a deal for ""Dreamers"" - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"".

Mass data attack on German politicians,"Angela Merkel, Greens leader Robert Habeck and TV satirist Jan BÃ¶hmermann have all been targeted by the attack Hundreds of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, have had personal details stolen and published online. Contacts, private chats and financial details were put out on Twitter that belong to figures from every political party except the far-right AfD. Data from celebrities and journalists were also leaked. It is unclear who was behind the attack, which emerged on Twitter in the style of an advent calendar last month. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the authorities were working hard to find the perpetrator. There was, he said in a statement, as yet no evidence that German parliamentary or government systems had been compromised. The leak appears to have originated on a Twitter account operated from Hamburg and the authorities in the north German city say they are now working with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to stop the spread of German politicians' data. AsTwitter's European headquarters are located in Dublin,external, the leak falls under the remit of the Irish data protection authority, national broadcaster RTE reports. The true extent of damage caused by the leak is not yet known although Justice Minister Katarina Barley said it was a ""serious attack"". ""The people behind this want to damage confidence in our democracy and institutions,"" she said. A government spokeswoman said no sensitive data from the chancellor's office had been published. MPs, Euro MPs and MPs from state parliaments were affected, said Martina Fietz. She said the government was not yet certain that the data had been stolen by cyber-hackers. Some reports suggested a lone leaker might have had access to sensitive data through their work. Although nothing politically explosive is known to have been leaked, the sheer volume of personal data involved suggests the consequences could be considerable, says Michael GÃ¶tschenberg, a reporter for German broadcaster RBB, who researched the attack. Many of those targeted are MPs in Germany's Bundestag The now-suspended Twitter account, identified by German media as @_0rbit, was followed by more than 17,000 people. Although documents had been posted on the account from 1 December to 28 December, it was not until Thursday evening that officials became aware of the theft. Bild newspaper said all the data stolen in the attack dated back to before October 2018 but it was not clear when it began. Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Hacking of German ministries 'ongoing' Interior Minister Seehofer said preliminary analysis showed the data had been obtained through ""wrongful use of log-in information for cloud services, email accounts or social networks"". A cyber analyst told the BBC there was speculation that hackers might have exploited weaknesses in email software to get hold of passwords that those targeted had also used on social media accounts. Data was published in Advent calendar-style daily releases on Twitter. The first ""doors"" at the start of December featured TV presenters, then rappers, and from 20 December it focused on politicians. National and local political figures as well as some TV personalities had their details stolen: Chancellor Angela Merkel: her email address and several letters to and from the chancellor appear to have been published The main parliamentary groups including the ruling centre-right and centre-left parties, as well asThe Greens, left-wingDie LinkeandFDP. Only AfD appears to have escaped Greens leader Robert Habeck, who had private chats with family members and credit card details posted online Journalists from public broadcastersARDandZDFas well as TV satiristJan BÃ¶hmermann, rapperMarteriaand rap groupK.I.Z,reports say Another TV satirist,Christian Ehring,is said to have had 3.4 gigabytes of data stolen and posted online, including holiday photos. Last year he won a court case brought by AfD leader Alice Weidel, who complained when he called her a ""slut"" on his TV show. Centre-left SPD MP Florian Postsaid he felt ""quite shocked"" by the leak of account statements and other details online, but he added that at least one file that had been posted was fake. Immediate suspicion fell on right-wing groups in Germany as well as Russia. German cyber-security analyst Sven Herpig said Russia was a suspect, first because of the method used but also because Germany was facing four state elections in 2019 as well as elections to the European Parliament. However, the fact that no right-wing politicians were targeted while prominent figures who had criticised them had been, suggested domestic right-wingers may also have been responsible, he told the BBC. Russia has been accused of cyber-attacks in Germany before. In 2015, data was stolen from computers in the Bundestag. And last year the government's IT network came under attack amid reports that Russian hackers were also to blame. UK-based expert Graham Cluley said the breadth of the latest attack suggested it was a co-ordinated effort involving a determined group over many months. ""This hack clearly isn't about extortion or financially motivated.  This is about attempting to destabilise Germany society,"" he told the BBC.

Energy firm hit with ban on new customers,"Energy supplier Economy Energy has been banned from taking on new customers until it improves its customer service. The energy regulator, Ofgem, said,externalthe ban would remain in place for three months to allow the firm to improve its customer contact procedures. It must also address billing and payment failures, and issue customer refunds in a timely manner. The company said it was disappointed with the Ofgem ban, but would co-operate with the regulator. Ofgem said if Economy Energy - which has 244,000 customers - failed to improve it could have its licence revoked. One customer who was furious with Economy Energy's service was Mark Johnstone, from Edinburgh. The 51-year-old tried to switch away to another supplier but said the final bills he received from Economy Energy were wrong and the refund he has been due still has not been paid. ""Being told by customer service that my refund is on a spreadsheet and they don't know when I'll get the money back is simply not good enough,"" he said. ""What they need to do is get people's money back to them in a timely manner. My experience of this company has been absolutely infuriating."" In addition to the ban on new customers, Economy Energy has also been prevented from requesting one-off payments and increasing direct debits. Anthony Pygram, Ofgem's director of conduct and enforcement, said: ""Ofgem is taking action to protect customers from suffering more harm from the unacceptable level of customer service provided by Economy Energy. ""We expect the supplier to take immediate action to rectify its failings or face having its ban extended. ""All suppliers are required to treat their customers fairly. Where they do not, Ofgem will take the necessary steps to ensure suppliers change their behaviour and to prevent further harm to customers."" Energy price cap comes into force If Economy Energy fails to make improvements within three months, Ofgem can extend the ban and, ultimately, cancel the company's licence. A spokesman for Economy Energy said: ""In light of the news received from Ofgem, in which we are very disappointed, we wish to advise our customers we will be co-operating fully with Ofgem and are always committed to continual improvement of our business. We thank our customers for their support."" Matthew Vickers, chief executive at the Energy Ombudsman, which referees disputes between companies and consumers, said: ""In November alone we opened investigations into 399 complaints about the company, compared to just 112 last January. ""Common issues include disputed account balances, failure to issue refunds and concerns over billing delays."" Gillian Guy, chief executive of consumers' association Citizens Advice, said: ""Today's action by Ofgem is a welcome and necessary step towards fixing the consistently poor service experienced by Economy Energy customers. ""We've raised a number of concerns in recent months about Economy Energy to the regulator. These include failing to refund customer credit balances and not properly billing people switching to a different supplier. ""But there's a wider problem behind this news. Ofgem's upcoming licensing review offers a major opportunity to stop underprepared firms entering the market. Further action is needed now to address the ongoing issues caused by poorly performing companies already operating."" In the past year, a number of small energy suppliers have gone bust, includingSpark Energy,Extra Energy,Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, One Select and Usio Energy.

'Serious' attack on train hits services,"Police and paramedics were called to Horsley station A man has been murdered in front of horrified passengers on board a train in Surrey. The victim was stabbed to death on the 12:58 Guildford to London Waterloo service, British Transport Police (BTP) said. An eyewitness told the BBC he had been involved in a ""vicious fight"" on the train beforehand. His attacker then fled and is being hunted. The train is currently being held at Horsley railway station. Emergency crews remain at the scene, in the village of East Horsley and police teams are searching the surrounding area for the suspect. No arrests have been made. A BTP spokesman said the victim suffered a fatal stab wound. Det Supt Gary Richardson said it was a ""shocking and violent attack which took place on board a train in broad daylight"". He said it was an ""incredibly frightening"" incident for passengers on the train. Police are searching the Clandon area for the suspect Police believe the suspect and victim boarded the train at London Road (Guildford) at 13:01 GMT. It is understood the offender then left the train at Clandon railway station, police said. Timetable information,externalfor the train shows it left Clandon at 13:06 - five minutes after the pair boarded the service. Police said a number of officers were now in the Clandon area trying to find the man responsible.

"Thailand hit by severe storm in peak seasonStorm Pabuk has made landfall in southern Thailand, leaving thousands stranded on tourist islands.Asia","This video can not be played Pabuk is thought to be the worst storm in decades to hit during the peak holiday season Tropical storm Pabuk has lashed southern Thailand with wind and rain, in what is expected to be the worst storm to hit the region in 30 years. The storm made landfall at 12:45 local time (05:45 GMT), sending trees crashing down into houses in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat. It is moving across southern Thailand, affecting popular tourist spots. Thousands of people have left Koh Samui, Koh Tao and Koh Phangan islands but many are riding out the storm. At least two nearby airports on the mainland have been shut and ferry services have been suspended. Tourists stranded on Koh Samui have told the BBC that the island is seeing heavy rain, wind and waves and there have been short power cuts. People also say they have been advised to stay indoors after 16:00 local time until Saturday morning. ""I talked to foreigners last night and they are not scared, they understand the situation,"" Krikkrai Songthanee, the district chief of neighbouring Koh Phangan, known for its raucous parties, told the AFP news agency. He said 10,000 tourists were still on the island. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The eye of the tropical storm is passing over Nakhon Si Thammarat, to the south, and is expected to weaken into a tropical depression over Surat Thani province. ""But all tourist islands in the Gulf of Thailand including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao will be affected because Pabuk is huge,"" meteorological department chief Phuwieng Prakhammintara said. One fisherman is reported to have died early on Friday in Pattani province, near the Malaysian border, as waves engulfed his boat. The UK Foreign Office is advising Britons to avoid all but essential travel to provinces near the Thai-Malaysia border. Daniel Moroz, from Bristol, said the situation on Koh Phangan was ""fairly calm"". ""It's just persistent rain at the moment but I've been told the worst is coming later. We've been reassured our place is safe and I think by tomorrow afternoon it should have cleared,"" he said. ""What's weird is that the locals aren't too bothered at all as I think the other islands will be hit more than here."" While storms are common in the Gulf of Thailand at this time of year, Pabuk is thought to be the worst in decades to hit during the peak holiday season. Power lines were brought down as the storm approached In the past, tropical storms have killed hundreds of people but authorities say they are well prepared and able to cope with the expected storm surges of up to five metres. The last big storm, Typhoon Gay, struck in 1989 and killed hundreds of people. Authorities say they are well prepared for the tropical storm Thailand's meteorological department said the storm would affect the south of the country for the next few days and that ""widespread rainfall, and torrential downpours are possible [in] much of the area"". ""People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods,"" the authority warned. The storm will weaken as it crosses over from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea, but tourists there are also being warned to be prepared for heavy rain, rough seas and landslides. In Thasala district of Nakhon Si Thammarat, a thousand evacuees had to be relocated to a university gymnasium after the government shelter they were in was damaged by the storm. In the nearby district of Kanom, a businessman told BBC Thai his 1,000-room hotel had to be closed temporarily. He was optimistic that tourists would return after the storm was over.

Gangs 'get prison jobs to smuggle drugs',"This video can not be played The BBC's Danny Shaw tried out the new body scanner, which caught an inmate smuggling drugs on its first day in use Police say there is growing evidence that members of organised criminal gangs are getting prison service jobs to smuggle banned items. A senior officer has told the BBC he has ""strong suspicions"" this is happening, but links are hard to prove. Ministers admit it ""can happen"" but say better search techniques will help. An ""X-ray"" body scanner to detect drugs has been installed at Leeds jail, one of 10 where ministers aim to cut drug-fuelled violence by the summer. Prisons minister Rory Stewart says he's ""cautiously optimistic"". In August he said he would resign if the 10 prisons did not improve within a year under a Â£10m programme to improve their security and living conditions. The programme also includes building repairs, better perimeter security and the use of sniffer dogs at the jails which the Ministry of Justice has identified as having ""acute problems"" with high drug use, violence and poor buildings. ""I believe we can do it,"" Mr Stewart told the BBC in December. ""We've got early indications in some of these prisons we're beginning to get a grip on it."" Rory Stewart: 'I'll resign if drugs and violence in jails don't go down' Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling banned items Prison smuggler: 'I brought mobile phones in for criminals' The 10 prisons are Hull, Humber, Isis, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Nottingham, Ranby, Wealstun and Wormwood Scrubs. Official figures, analysed by BBC News, show that the number of assaults has increased steadily since 2014 and was projected to increase last year in all the jails except Nottingham and Wormwood Scrubs. However, Mr Stewart acknowledged some jails might try to reduce assaults simply by moving dangerous offenders to other establishments. ""That's definitely a risk.  I'm very, very clear, though, we need to play this fair. The idea is that I can look other governors in the face and say: 'We turned around these ten prisons without cheating. '"" Police believe the drugs trade in jails is co-ordinated by organised crime groups. Assistant Chief Constable Jason Hogg, who leads on prison intelligence for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said he ""strongly suspects"" gangs are getting their associates or family members jobs in the prison service with the intention of smuggling contraband in, although it was difficult to prove. ACC Hogg said he was unaware of any cases where people caught with contraband in prison had been ""forthcoming"" about their links to organised crime - but added there were examples of people getting jobs within the prison staff and then being recruited by criminals. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mark Fairhurst, of the Prison Officers Association, said there was evidence both prison officers and civilian staff were employed by criminal gangs around the UK, but that those people accounted for ""less than 1%"" of prison staff. He added the use of X-ray body scanners was ""vital"" in the battle against drugs in prisons. However, a former prison inmate, who identified himself only as David, told Today that drugs were a ""reality of prison life"". He added: ""No matter what kind of security, if somebody wants a drug they will get a drug."" In the year ending March 2018, there were 51,993 incidents of contraband being found in prisons in England and Wales. The largest group was drugs, with 13,119 seizures in the year - this has tripled since 2010. In a third of cases the drug was a psychoactive substance, such as spice. Very few cases (408) involved the most serious Class A drugs, which include cocaine and heroin. Nearly 11,000 illicit mobile phones and 5,000 SIM cards were also found. There were almost 19,000 cases of seizures classed as 'other', a category which includes tobacco, alcohol, distilling equipment, weapons and ""other reportable items"". Source: Ministry of Justice Mr Stewart said searching was the ""answer"" to the problem of corruption. ""Searching, not just in terms of finding a bad apple, but also if you have very good search procedures in place, it's much more difficult for a prisoner to put pressure on a prison officer,"" he said. HMP Leeds is the first of the 10 prisons to have installed an X-ray scanner to detect packages hidden inside a prisoner's body.  The scanner, which costs about Â£120,000, operates in a similar way to a standard hospital X-ray machine - but the level of radiation is 400 times lower. A prisoner will be scanned only when intelligence indicates they may be carrying drugs - up to a maximum of 50 times a year. At Leeds jail, the scanner has already helped staff spot this prisoner returning with a packet of drugs inside him Prison staff at Leeds believe the X-ray scanner will act as a ""game changer"" in the battle to stop drugs getting in but the governor, Steve Robson, warned that offenders were adept at finding other methods, even smuggling new psychoactive substances (PS), such as Spice into their clothes or clothes worn by prison visitors. ""They have been soaking clothes in drugs and then either smoking bits of cut up clothing or then using the kettles boiling the drugs out and impregnating them back into the paper,"" said Mr Robson. ""We found lots of bits of dressing gown that we tested that came back very high for PS and fitted in with the intelligence that had happened so we started swabbing all the clothes."" He said it was a game of ""cat and mouse"". ""You close one avenue and the more ingenious will think of other ways of doing things,"" he said.

Parents can 'worry less' about screen time,"There is little evidence screen use for children is harmful in itself, guidance from leading paediatricians says. Parents should worry less as long as they have gone through a checklist on the effect of screen time on their child, it says. While the guidance avoids setting screen time limits, it recommends not using them in the hour before bedtime. Experts say it is important that the use of devices does not replace sleep, exercising and time with family. It was informed by a review of evidence published at the same time in theBMJ Open medical journal,external, and follows a debate around whether youngsters should have time on devices restricted. Most of the evidence in the review was based on television screen time, but also included other screen use, such as phones and computers. Meanwhile, a separate study has found that girls are twice as likely to show signs of depressive symptoms linked to social media use at age 14 compared with boys. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which oversees the training of specialists in child medicine, has produced the guidance for under-18s. Tips on how to limit excessive screen time Reality Check: Why did child screen advice not go further? It said there was no good evidence that time in front of a screen is ""toxic"" to health, as is sometimes claimed. The review of evidence found associations between higher screen use and obesity and depression. But the college looked at this and said it was not clear from the evidence if higher screen use was causing these problems or if people with these issues were more likely to spend more time on screens. The review was carried out by experts at University College London, including RCPCH president Prof Russell Viner. This video can not be played Parent and blogger Leyla Preston speaking on BBC Breakfast The college said it was not setting time limits for children because there was not enough evidence that screen time was harmful to child health at any age. Instead, it has published a series of questions to help families make decisions about their screen time use: Is your family's screen time under control? Does screen use interfere with what your family want to do? Does screen use interfere with sleep? Are you able to control snacking during screen time? Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the RCPCH, said phones, computers and tablets were a ""great way to explore the world"", but parents were often made to feel that there was something ""indefinably wrong"" about them. He said: ""We want to cut through that and say 'actually if you're doing OK and you've answered these questions of yourselves and you're happy, get on and live your life and stop worrying'. ""But if there are problems and you're having difficulties, screen time can be a contributing factor."" How much screen time is 'too much'? Facebook 'no place' for young children Screen use linked to children's cognition Dr Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""screens are part of modern life"", adding: ""The genie is out of the bottle - we cannot put it back."" He said: ""We need to stick to advising parents to do what they do well, which is to balance the risks and benefits. ""One size doesn't fit all, parents need to think about what's useful and helpful for their child."" Parents should consider their own use of screens, if screen time is controlled in their family, and if excessive use is affecting their child's development and everyday life, he added. A number of parents have been in touch with the BBC to say they disagree with the guidance and feel it does not go far enough. ""There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that screen time is damaging school performance and sports performance and dangerously addictive,"" says Andy, whose son is 14. Andy said he had restricted his son's screen time to Friday after school and Saturday, and, despite some ""grumbling"", there had been an improvement in school performance. For tips on how to limit excessive screen time,click here. The recommendation that children should not use the devices in the hour before bedtime comes because of evidence that they can harm sleep. The devices stimulate the brain, and the blue light produced by them can disrupt the body's secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin. While there are night modes on many phones, computers and tablets, there is no evidence these are effective, the college said. Overall, it found the effect of screen time on children's health was small when considered next to other factors like sleep, physical activity, eating, bullying and poverty. It said there was a lack of evidence that screen time is beneficial for health or wellbeing. Its guidance recommends that families negotiate screen time limits with their children based on individual needs and how much it impacts on sleep, as well as physical and social activities. For infants and younger children, this will involve parents deciding what content they watch and for how long they use the devices. As children get older, there should be a move towards them having autonomy over screen use, but this should be gradual and under the guidance of an adult, the college said. Dr Davie added: ""When it comes to screen time I think it is important to encourage parents to do what is right by their family. ""However, we know this is a grey area and parents want support, and that's why we have produced this guide. ""We suggest that age-appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child, that everyone in the family understands."" The college called for better quality research to understand more about how the content on devices, and the context in which they are used, affects health outcomes. Mealtimes can be good for screen-free zones Mealtimes can be good opportunities for screen-free zones If children's screen time use seems out of control, parents should consider intervening Parents should think about their own screen use, including whether they use devices unconsciously too often Younger children need face to face social interaction and screens are no substitute for this Source:RCPCH,external The study on social media use and young people was carried out by experts at University College London andpublished in EClinicalMedicine,external. It involved nearly 11,000 young people answering questionnaires on their social media use, online harassment, sleep patterns, self-esteem and body image. It is separate to the RCPCH guidance on screen use and the review that informed it, neither of which looked at social media use. Experts not involved in the social media study said it added to existing evidence that heavy social media use may be harmful for mental health. But they called for more research to better understand if it causes depression, or if depressive people are more likely to use social media excessively.

Thailand hit by severe storm in peak season,"This video can not be played Pabuk is thought to be the worst storm in decades to hit during the peak holiday season Tropical storm Pabuk has lashed southern Thailand with wind and rain, in what is expected to be the worst storm to hit the region in 30 years. The storm made landfall at 12:45 local time (05:45 GMT), sending trees crashing down into houses in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat. It is moving across southern Thailand, affecting popular tourist spots. Thousands of people have left Koh Samui, Koh Tao and Koh Phangan islands but many are riding out the storm. At least two nearby airports on the mainland have been shut and ferry services have been suspended. Tourists stranded on Koh Samui have told the BBC that the island is seeing heavy rain, wind and waves and there have been short power cuts. People also say they have been advised to stay indoors after 16:00 local time until Saturday morning. ""I talked to foreigners last night and they are not scared, they understand the situation,"" Krikkrai Songthanee, the district chief of neighbouring Koh Phangan, known for its raucous parties, told the AFP news agency. He said 10,000 tourists were still on the island. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The eye of the tropical storm is passing over Nakhon Si Thammarat, to the south, and is expected to weaken into a tropical depression over Surat Thani province. ""But all tourist islands in the Gulf of Thailand including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao will be affected because Pabuk is huge,"" meteorological department chief Phuwieng Prakhammintara said. One fisherman is reported to have died early on Friday in Pattani province, near the Malaysian border, as waves engulfed his boat. The UK Foreign Office is advising Britons to avoid all but essential travel to provinces near the Thai-Malaysia border. Daniel Moroz, from Bristol, said the situation on Koh Phangan was ""fairly calm"". ""It's just persistent rain at the moment but I've been told the worst is coming later. We've been reassured our place is safe and I think by tomorrow afternoon it should have cleared,"" he said. ""What's weird is that the locals aren't too bothered at all as I think the other islands will be hit more than here."" While storms are common in the Gulf of Thailand at this time of year, Pabuk is thought to be the worst in decades to hit during the peak holiday season. Power lines were brought down as the storm approached In the past, tropical storms have killed hundreds of people but authorities say they are well prepared and able to cope with the expected storm surges of up to five metres. The last big storm, Typhoon Gay, struck in 1989 and killed hundreds of people. Authorities say they are well prepared for the tropical storm Thailand's meteorological department said the storm would affect the south of the country for the next few days and that ""widespread rainfall, and torrential downpours are possible [in] much of the area"". ""People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods,"" the authority warned. The storm will weaken as it crosses over from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea, but tourists there are also being warned to be prepared for heavy rain, rough seas and landslides. In Thasala district of Nakhon Si Thammarat, a thousand evacuees had to be relocated to a university gymnasium after the government shelter they were in was damaged by the storm. In the nearby district of Kanom, a businessman told BBC Thai his 1,000-room hotel had to be closed temporarily. He was optimistic that tourists would return after the storm was over.

New US House challenges Trump on shutdown,"This video can not be played Pelosi said she was privileged to serve with more than 100 women in Congress The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives has voted to end a partial government shutdown, but the move looks certain to be vetoed by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has said he will reject any measure that does not provide funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. New House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will resume negotiations with Mr Trump on Friday, branded the wall immoral. The new Congress is considered the most diverse in history. The bills passed by the House of Representatives would fund homeland security operations, including $1.3bn in border security, until 8 February, and fund several other agencies until September. However, it requires Senate approval, and sign off from the president, in order to become law. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate, and majority leader Mitch McConnell has said Republicans there would not back measures that Mr Trump did not support. Mr McConnell called the Democrats' move a ""total nonstarter"" and a ""political sideshow"". However, Democrats argue that the bills are nearly identical to ones passed by the Senate last month, before Mr Trump insisted wall funding must be included. The 116th Congress is considered the most diverse in history Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, was elected as Speaker of the House for a second time - becoming the third most powerful politician in the US. She previously led the House from 2007-11 - and remains the only female to hold the position. She invited the children and grandchildren of House Representatives to join her as she was sworn in, saying: ""I'm particularly proud to be a woman Speaker of the House of this Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote."" Later, she told reporters: ""We're not doing a wall... a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective."" She added that spending money on ""more infrastructure at the ports of entry"" and better technology would be more efficient. As of Thursday, 102 women serve in the 435-seat House, an all-time high, including 36 newly elected members and a record 43 women of colour. Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim congresswomen, hugs her son after being sworn in While Republican women marked some firsts this past election season, like Marsha Blackburn becoming the first female Tennessee senator, the vast majority of these new lawmakers are Democrats. They include: The first Muslim congresswomen - Michigan's Rashida Tlaib, who took her oath on the Koran, and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, who became the first person to wear a hijab in Congress The first Native American congresswomen - New Mexico's Debra Haaland and Kansas' Sharice Davids New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest woman to be elected to Congress Carol Miller of West Virginia is the only new female Republican representative, bringing the total number of conservative women in the House to 13 - a decrease from 23 before the mid-term elections. Bid to criticise US congresswoman for dancing backfires The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman Lawmaker swears in on Koran This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The partial US government shutdown began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats won the majority of the House in the November mid-term elections, and the new representatives were sworn in on Thursday. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Ms Pelosi told the Today show before the first session of the new House.  ""We have given the Republicans a chance,externalto take yes for an answer."" The president is due to resume budget talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Friday morning. The White House says it is again floating the idea of a deal for 'Dreamers' - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. What is this Dreamer debate all about? Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"". Meanwhile, some vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 have spoken out in favour of approving the budget bills to end the government shutdown. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado was the first to do so, tellingThe Hill,externalon Thursday that Congress should reopen the government and let wall negotiations continue afterwards. Maine Senator Susan Collins echoed this view, suggesting the president should sign the agreed upon spending bills first so federal employees could get back to work,Politico reported,external. Mr Trump pushed back on Friday against Democrats who are calling for him to be removed from office. The Republican president tweeted that his political enemies only want to impeach him because he is ""the most successful"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After being sworn in on Thursday, Ms Tlaib used an expletive to describe the president while vowing to impeach him. But fellow Democratic representative and civil rights icon John Lewis criticised her ""inappropriate"" remark, telling reporters impeachment talk ""is a little premature"". The new House speaker also squelched calls for impeachment. Ms Pelosi said they must ""wait and see"" what happens with special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election. About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Around 800,000 federal workers are now furloughed - that is, temporarily laid off due to a lack of funding - or working without pay Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling National Parks have become hazardous without staff #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.

Rescuers search loch for 'distressed whale',"This video can not be played Sperm whale trapped in Loch Eriboll in Highlands A search of a Highlands loch has found no sign of a sperm whale believed to be in difficulty earlier this week. The animal, which has been estimated to be up to 9m (30ft) long, was reported to have been tangled in rope in Loch Eriboll, near Durness, Sutherland. Coastguard and British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) volunteers and Scottish SPCA officers have been monitoring the whale. The whale was reported to the coastguard on Wednesday. BDMLR said it had been unable to confirm if the animal was caught in rope, adding that the it might have been ill or injured. A team from the organisation had hoped to get to Loch Eriboll on Thursday with specialist equipment, but it was delayed. A search of the loch for the whale began at first light on Friday and continued until late afternoon. The BDMLR team will remain on standby over the weekend. A rescue of the whale is expected to begin later on Thursday SSPCA inspector Maria Bain said sperm whales were not common in the North Sea. She said: ""After consulting with marine experts we believe it may be a juvenile that has lost its course. ""We hope it has found the way back out to sea and will continue to monitor the situation."" A humpback whale was rescued from the same loch in January 2016 Sperm whales are some of the world's deepest diving mammals. Males can grow to more than 18m (59ft) in length and females to more than 12m (40ft). In January 2016,a humpback whale was freed from fishing gear used to catch prawns in Loch Eriboll. The 12m-long had become entangled in creels. Members of BDMLR managed to free the mammal from the ropes and guided it to safety.

Hunt 'worried' about detained spy suspect,"Russia must not use UK citizens as ""pawns in diplomatic chess"", Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said, after the arrest of a former US Marine with British and American nationality. Mr Hunt said he was ""extremely worried"" about Paul Whelan, who has been detained on suspicion of spying. He added that ""every support"" is being given to the 48-year-old. Mr Whelan's family said he was attending a wedding, while Russia said he was ""caught spying"" in Moscow. It has been reported that Mr Whelan also holds an Irish passport. Who is Paul Whelan? Mr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. He now lives in Michigan and is director of global security for automotive components supplier BorgWarner. He has been visiting Russia for business and pleasure for more than a decade, his brother said. His twin David said he had been told his brother was fine and looking healthy, after US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman visited him this week. In a statement, David said: ""Our focus remains on ensuring that Paul is safe, well treated, has a good lawyer, and is coming home. ""We urge the US Congress and the state department to help on Paul's behalf to secure his release and return him home soon."" Mr Hunt said: ""Individuals should not be used as pawns of diplomatic leverage. We need to see what these charges are against him and understand whether there is a case or not. ""We are giving every support we can, but we don't agree with individuals being used in diplomatic chess games. ""Because it is desperately worrying, not just for the individual but their families, and we are all extremely worried about him and his family as we hear this news."" He added that the UK had not yet had access to Mr Whelan and that the US was leading on this case. Asked about reports he is also Irish, the Irish embassy in Moscow said: ""The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow has requested consular access to an Irish citizen currently detained in Russia after receiving a request for assistance. ""The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will provide all possible and appropriate assistance in relation to this case."" Russia and America have traded spying allegations at regular intervals since the Cold War. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities Mr Whelan travelled to Russia on 22 December and planned to fly home on 6 January, but was arrested in Moscow on 28 December. Under the charge of espionage, he could face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent There is much we still don't know about the detention of Paul Whelan. What are the precise charges against him? Did he really have a memory stick containing a list of Russian intelligence officials when he was arrested, as claimed by one Russian news agency but not thus far corroborated? What lies behind his long-standing interest in Russia and engagement with Russian social media? And how many nationalities does he actually have - American and British, yes, but does he also have Irish and Canadian passports? This lack of certainty about the facts makes Jeremy Hunt's decision to accuse Russia of playing diplomatic chess games all the more interesting. The foreign secretary's remarks support the premise of speculation in the US that Mr Whelan's arrest is a strategic move by Moscow. The suggestion - and it is no more than that - is that the former US marine could be exchanged for a Russian woman who was jailed in the United States last month.Maria Butina, a pro-gun activist, pleaded guilty to trying to influence US conservative groups on behalf of the Russian government. Moscow certainly has a track record of using individuals for unpredictable and aggressive diplomacy. But Mr Hunt has shown that he, for now at least, is ready to respond robustly at a time when Anglo-Russian relations are still struggling to recover from last year's poisoning incident in Salisbury. Mr Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said he had appealed to the court against the detention of his client and requested he was released on bail. He added that Mr Whelan remained in good spirits.

Should you and your phone break up?,"There is a growing sense of unease among many smartphone owners about the amount of time we're spending on our devices. Google told me that around 70% of the Android users it spoke to wanted to ""find a better balance"" in their tech use. But this puts the tech sector in an awkward spot. How can it help its customers detach from their phones when, for many firms, their business model relies on them doing the opposite? Both Apple and Google have this year released digital tools - called Screen Time and Digital Wellbeing respectively - which let iPhone and  Android users see how much time they are spending on various apps and how often they pick up their devices. This video can not be played WATCH: Are Rory and Lily addicted to their phones? Many Android users will not have it yet as it is part of the Android Pie operating system, which has only been released by a handful of phone brands so far. For those who have seen it, the results can come as a bit of a shock. On my first day with Android's Digital Wellbeing tracker, I unlocked my phone 200 times and spent more than three hours on it. This was alongside working a long shift in the BBC newsroom and being a mum. I'm sure it wasn't all WhatsApp banter and Cats of Instagram but I was still horrified, to put it politely. How much screen time is 'too much'? Confessions of a smartphone addict Rose La Prairie is a London-based Google engineer who was on the team which developed the tool. She told me that the tech giant was well aware people might feel ""guilt or shame"" when confronted with the data for the first time, so designing the interface to be non-judgemental was crucial. Rose La Prairie developed the Android Digital Wellbeing dashboard ""Part of it was making sure we didn't do things like big red arrows or big green arrows, or trying to make a judgement, or an assessment, of what is good or bad,"" she said. ""When it comes down to it, when we talk to people, it very much depends on the individual, so what's good for me might not be good for someone else."" Ms La Prairie thinks that most people should be able to self-regulate by using the product. ""For some people seeing the data will be enough, it's that reminder of how you spend your time and what you do on your phone."" she said. ""There will be some people who will need a little extra reminder, and I put myself in that camp."" For those people, the dashboard can be set to mute notifications, make the phone display go black and white at a certain time (such as bedtime) and set an alert after a certain amount of screen time on an app. But it is not really in Google's interests for you to not be on your phone, is it? Unlike Apple's hardware-focused business model, Google is advertising-driven and that very much requires eyeballs on screens. ""I think what we really care about is making sure users have a good experience,"" Ms La Prairie says. ""People want to figure out how they use their devices in a different way and we really want to make sure we can help users with that."" It's worth noting that what she doesn't say is: ""Turn the phone off."" The mobile phone industry's response to the issue is, well, interesting. Some firms believe that they can wean us off our big screen smartphones with the help ofâ¦ smaller screen smartphones. Is a tiny phone the answer? Devices like the Nokia phone from HMD Global and the tiny Palm phone are marketed as companion devices - in Nokia's case with less functionality, in Palm's case just smaller - to give us a break from our main device. ""It's quite apparent that the industry still wants to keep selling phones,"" said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood. ""It is a little bit ironic that they are trying to sell you a little phone to do the same thing [as your big phone]."" Ultimately, Mr Wood believes it really comes down to willpower. ""You can have all the different types of gadgets but it's down to you as an individual how much you want to spend time on your phone,"" he said. Catherine Price wrote the book How To Break Up With Your Phone after having a baby and realising one day that the baby was watching her and she was watching her mobile. Catherine Price says she is happier using her phone less ""I realised I didn't want that to be her impression of a human relationship, but I also didn't want it to be the way that I was living my own life,"" she said. ""Breaking up with your phone does not mean dumping your phone or throwing it under a bus, it just means taking a step back to create a relationship that is actually good for you. It's becoming friends with your phone."" In her book, Ms Price lists a 30-day plan to reclaim this ""friendship"". Her top tips include: Turn off all the notifications you can bear to. Just leave the ones you actually want; for me that is phone calls and text messages because they are real people trying to contact me, in particular, in real time - plus my calendar and maps rearrange your home screen so that it only contains apps that have a practical purpose that are not tempting. Your home screen should not have email, or social media, or the news or a dating app, or games. Put them into a folder on an interior page so you can't see their icons, you have to actively open them Get your phone out of your bedroom. You will need to have something on your bedside table that takes the place of the phoneâ¦ like a book. When you go to reach for that phone you will encounter the book instead Get a standalone alarm clock. If your phone is your alarm clock you are guaranteeing that your phone will be the first thing you interact with in the morning There is a plug-in called Facebook Demetricator, which stops you seeing you how many times your post has been ""liked"". You still may go back to see that people have liked your post, but you're not going to be checking compulsively to see when 17 gets to 20 and 25 gets to 30 - it can help break that habit. As for me - well, I've got over the shock of seeing how often I reach for my phone. But have I changed? I still find myself on my device, having picked it up to, say, check the weather forecast, only to suddenly find myself on social media 10 minutes later, still with no idea about whether or not I need an umbrella. That said, I do genuinely use my handset a lot for work, to navigate my way around, and to keep up with the endless communications from my children's school. I tell Ms La Prairie I'd like to be able to differentiate between time well-spent on my smartphone and time wasted. Apparently I'm not the only one.

Paul Whelan - innocent wedding guest or spy?,"Former US Marine Paul Whelan has been released from a Russian prison after more than five years in custody. Mr Whelan, 54, was given a 16-year jail sentence in 2020 after being detained in Moscow two years earlier on suspicion of spying. The Michigan native had been left out of two previous prisoner swaps, including the one that freed US women's basketball star Brittney Griner. President Joe Biden, who pledged to ""never give up"" on securing his freedom, hailed the release of Mr Whelan and 15 other Westerners on Thursday as ""a feat of diplomacy"". The US had previously designated Mr Whelan as ""wrongfully detained"" - a classification that committed the government to work on his release. Grim life of American 'spy' in Russian labour camp I'm more Mr Bean than James Bond, says spy suspect Mr Whelan is a citizen of four countries - the US, Canada, the UK and the Republic of Ireland. From Novi, Michigan - a suburb of Detroit - he was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. Military records show he joined the US Marine Corps Reserves in 1994, about six years after reportedly working in law enforcement as a police officer and sheriff's deputy in Michigan. He started as an IT project manager for a company called Kelly Services in the early 2000s, but deployed with the Marines within a couple of years on the first of two tours to Iraq, in 2004 and then 2006. It was while serving in the Marines that he made his first trip to Russia, a visit he detailed on his website, which was shut down several years ago. Sharing pictures of the visit, he described having a ""quite enjoyable time"" exploring the cities of Moscow and St Petersburg. But in 2008, Mr Whelan - who had by then achieved the rank of staff sergeant - was discharged from the Marines for bad conduct. The Pentagon, which released his records, said the charges related to larceny.CNN reports he was accused of using someone else's social security number,external, and ""writing bad cheques"". His family was reportedly unaware of these events. Mr Whelan continued to work for Kelly Services, and was promoted to senior manager of global security and investigations in 2010. According to court documents, he was in charge of the company's campus security group, and his duties included managing and conducting investigations, as well as handling some purchasing. He left the company in 2016, moving to become director of global security for US-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner. Mr Whelan was ""responsible for overseeing security"" at facilities in Michigan and around the world, a company statement said. The company does not have any facilities in Russia, but the former Marine often travelled there. Since his first visit in 2006, Mr Whelan made a number of other trips to Russia and developed an in-depth knowledge of the country. It was due to his knowledge of Russia that he had been asked to attend the wedding of a fellow former Marine in Moscow in December 2018, his brother David told the BBC's Newshour after his arrest. ""His experience of having already been to the Kremlin and walked around Red Square and navigating the metro, his friend felt Paul could assist a bunch of Americans who hadn't otherwise ever been to Moscow,"" David Whelan said. On 28 December, however, he was arrested by Russia's FSB state security agency, which claimed he had been ""caught spying"" in Moscow. At the time, there were uncorroborated reports he had been caught receiving a digital storage device containing a list of intelligence officials. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities There was also speculation over other possible motives for the arrest, which included a suggestion Mr Whelan was detained so he could be exchanged for Maria Butina - a Russian gun rights activist, who was jailed in the US in December 2018. She was deported back to Russia in October 2019. David Whelan, meanwhile, has dismissed the allegations as nonsense. ""I can't imagine how someone with a law enforcement background who is also a former US Marine, and who is now working in corporate security and is also aware of the risks of travel, would have broken any law let alone the law related to espionage,"" he said. Mr Whelan's friends in Russia, some with military connections like him, have also rebutted the charges of spying, all telling the BBC the idea was laughable. In court in Moscow, he was nervous at first - but soon began speaking out to call himself a political hostage and denounce a 'kangaroo court'. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford has followed Mr Whelan's case from the very start and interviewed him multiple times. The last time they spoke by phone from prison, he told her he felt ""abandoned"" and ""seriously betrayed"" by the US government. Left behind in previous prisoner swaps, he had grown despondent. Life in prison was tough, with guards waking him up multiple times to check he hadn't escaped. Stuck serving a 16-year sentence, Mr Whelan said his parents were elderly, his beloved dog had died and his life was ""slipping away"" while the US government looked for a deal. ""Now that's finally happened,"" Rainsford writes. ""Paul Whelan is going home and I suspect he himself can barely believe it.""

New US House challenges Trump on shutdownThe move looks certain to be vetoed by President Trump in a row over funding for his border wall.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Pelosi said she was privileged to serve with more than 100 women in Congress The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives has voted to end a partial government shutdown, but the move looks certain to be vetoed by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has said he will reject any measure that does not provide funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. New House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will resume negotiations with Mr Trump on Friday, branded the wall immoral. The new Congress is considered the most diverse in history. The bills passed by the House of Representatives would fund homeland security operations, including $1.3bn in border security, until 8 February, and fund several other agencies until September. However, it requires Senate approval, and sign off from the president, in order to become law. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate, and majority leader Mitch McConnell has said Republicans there would not back measures that Mr Trump did not support. Mr McConnell called the Democrats' move a ""total nonstarter"" and a ""political sideshow"". However, Democrats argue that the bills are nearly identical to ones passed by the Senate last month, before Mr Trump insisted wall funding must be included. The 116th Congress is considered the most diverse in history Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, was elected as Speaker of the House for a second time - becoming the third most powerful politician in the US. She previously led the House from 2007-11 - and remains the only female to hold the position. She invited the children and grandchildren of House Representatives to join her as she was sworn in, saying: ""I'm particularly proud to be a woman Speaker of the House of this Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote."" Later, she told reporters: ""We're not doing a wall... a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective."" She added that spending money on ""more infrastructure at the ports of entry"" and better technology would be more efficient. As of Thursday, 102 women serve in the 435-seat House, an all-time high, including 36 newly elected members and a record 43 women of colour. Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim congresswomen, hugs her son after being sworn in While Republican women marked some firsts this past election season, like Marsha Blackburn becoming the first female Tennessee senator, the vast majority of these new lawmakers are Democrats. They include: The first Muslim congresswomen - Michigan's Rashida Tlaib, who took her oath on the Koran, and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, who became the first person to wear a hijab in Congress The first Native American congresswomen - New Mexico's Debra Haaland and Kansas' Sharice Davids New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest woman to be elected to Congress Carol Miller of West Virginia is the only new female Republican representative, bringing the total number of conservative women in the House to 13 - a decrease from 23 before the mid-term elections. Bid to criticise US congresswoman for dancing backfires The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman Lawmaker swears in on Koran This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The partial US government shutdown began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats won the majority of the House in the November mid-term elections, and the new representatives were sworn in on Thursday. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Ms Pelosi told the Today show before the first session of the new House.  ""We have given the Republicans a chance,externalto take yes for an answer."" The president is due to resume budget talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Friday morning. The White House says it is again floating the idea of a deal for 'Dreamers' - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. What is this Dreamer debate all about? Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"". Meanwhile, some vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 have spoken out in favour of approving the budget bills to end the government shutdown. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado was the first to do so, tellingThe Hill,externalon Thursday that Congress should reopen the government and let wall negotiations continue afterwards. Maine Senator Susan Collins echoed this view, suggesting the president should sign the agreed upon spending bills first so federal employees could get back to work,Politico reported,external. Mr Trump pushed back on Friday against Democrats who are calling for him to be removed from office. The Republican president tweeted that his political enemies only want to impeach him because he is ""the most successful"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After being sworn in on Thursday, Ms Tlaib used an expletive to describe the president while vowing to impeach him. But fellow Democratic representative and civil rights icon John Lewis criticised her ""inappropriate"" remark, telling reporters impeachment talk ""is a little premature"". The new House speaker also squelched calls for impeachment. Ms Pelosi said they must ""wait and see"" what happens with special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election. About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Around 800,000 federal workers are now furloughed - that is, temporarily laid off due to a lack of funding - or working without pay Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling National Parks have become hazardous without staff #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.

House price growth at near six-year low,"UK house prices grew at an annual pace of 0.5% in December, the Nationwide building society has said, the slowest annual rate since February 2013. The lender says uncertainty over the economic outlook appears to be undermining confidence in the market. London and surrounding areas saw a small fall in house prices in 2018. Northern Ireland saw the biggest house price rises, up 5.8%. Prices in Wales climbed 4%, in Scotland they were up 0.9% and in England they rose 0.7%. December's growth rate, based on its own mortgage data, was a marked slowdown from the annual pace of 1.9% recorded by the Nationwide in November. The Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, told the BBC the severity of the slowdown was unexpected: ""It is a little bit surprising that house price growth has slowed as much as it has in the last month or so. ""It seems to be the uncertain economic outlook that is really weighing on buyer sentiment. I think once that lifts then things should start to pick up to normal levels of about 2%."" He said a lot of it ""depends on how we get through this Brexit uncertainty"". Will the value of your home change in 2019? Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? Chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, Samuel Tombs, said the slowdown was striking, but the overall outlook for the market was relatively benign: ""The hefty month-to-month fall in house prices in December [of 0.7%] - the biggest Nationwide has reported since August 2011 - brings an end to a weak year for the housing market. ""While the supply of homes for sale also has dwindled, the balance of demand and supply has shifted in buyers' favour. That said, we continue to doubt that a sustained period of falling house prices is likely."" He said that assuming MPs back some form of Brexit deal, with a subsequent recovery in consumers' confidence, prices were likely to pick up to grow by 2% this year. Nicholas Finn, executive director of Garrington Property Finders, said: ""At one extreme we are seeing a surge in the numbers of opportunistic, frequently cash, buyers emerging to snap up homes at large discounts."" ""Meanwhile thousands of would-be sellers are instead hunkering down and waiting until things improve before putting their home on the market."" Separatefigures from the Bank of England,externalshowed that mortgage approvals for house purchases fell in November, and are now at half the level of 15 years ago. The Nationwide said that house prices in London and the surrounding areas, such as Berkshire, had fallen by 0.8% and 1.4% in the past year. However, outside these areas, each nation and English region - based on Nationwide's local mortgage data - recorded annual house price growth. In addition to steady price growth in Northern Ireland and Wales, the East Midlands also saw prices increase by 4%. ""With prices in both inner and outer London falling, the capital bears a share of responsibility for dragging down the national pace of growth,"" Mr Finn said.

"'The Voice won't make you a star, Instagram will'","The Voice returns to UK television this weekend, but after seven series on British TV it has yet to produce a successful winner. That's not to say it hasn't been popular - ratings for The Voice rivalled X Factor's in 2018. But judge Will.i.am says stars are more likely to be made on social media than on reality TV. ""Look at The Voice as Glastonbury. Everyone gets the chance to be on the UK's biggest stage,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""If you look at it from that perspective it's awesome. ""If you're looking at it from the perspective that it's going to turn you into a star - Instagram is. ""That has a better chance of turning you into a star than a reality show."" Will says Instagram - ""the feed"" as he terms it - is what every TV show, record company or streaming service is trying to compete with in 2019. ""That's what's turned the world upside down, inside out,"" he says. ""It's not this show versus that show, BBC versus ITV, reality show versus the record companies. ""The feed.

The Voice UK offers its winner a record deal with a major UK label - with singers such as Ruti Olajugbagbe, Mo Adeniran and Kevin Simms among previous champions of the talent show. But making it in the music business is a very different proposition now than it was when The Voice first aired. Earlier this week, figures revealed thatCD sales had fallen by 32 million in 2018and that only one new artist - Anne Marie - had sold more than 100,000 copies of a debut album. And the UK's largest physical retailer, HMV,recently went into administration- with many pointing to streaming as one of the factors to blame for its decline. ""When my first album came out in 2010, I went into HMV on a day off and bought it,"" says Olly Murs, who also returns to judge the new series of The Voice. ""A lot of artists now coming through won't have the luxury of doing that. ""It is a different world. I'm trying to adapt to it like everyone else."" But while TV talent shows and the music industry may have lost some of their sparkle, these changes do offer opportunities for musicians to launch a career on their own terms. ""You can get your music out there more, more people hear you than when I started,"" says Tom Jones, who started his career more than 50 years ago. ""When I started in the 60s, you had to get a record contract before you went on television, before anybody heard you. ""Now, you can be heard and seen before you get the record contract and there's other ways now of getting music to the public."" The Voice UK will return for its second year on ITV with the same judges and presenter Emma Willis While modern methods make it easy to get exposure, Will.i.am admits a high profile doesn't almost equate to high sales. ""It's actually really easy to break into music. It's just hard to make money,"" he says - admitting that this is why he returns to The Voice to coach aspiring artists. ""There's a bunch of knowledge, perspective and experience that I have that I want to share with the kids on my team.

"Hunt 'worried' about detained spy suspectThe foreign secretary warns Russia not to use British citizens as ""chess pawns"" after Moscow arrest.UK","Russia must not use UK citizens as ""pawns in diplomatic chess"", Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said, after the arrest of a former US Marine with British and American nationality. Mr Hunt said he was ""extremely worried"" about Paul Whelan, who has been detained on suspicion of spying. He added that ""every support"" is being given to the 48-year-old. Mr Whelan's family said he was attending a wedding, while Russia said he was ""caught spying"" in Moscow. It has been reported that Mr Whelan also holds an Irish passport. Who is Paul Whelan? Mr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. He now lives in Michigan and is director of global security for automotive components supplier BorgWarner. He has been visiting Russia for business and pleasure for more than a decade, his brother said. His twin David said he had been told his brother was fine and looking healthy, after US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman visited him this week. In a statement, David said: ""Our focus remains on ensuring that Paul is safe, well treated, has a good lawyer, and is coming home. ""We urge the US Congress and the state department to help on Paul's behalf to secure his release and return him home soon."" Mr Hunt said: ""Individuals should not be used as pawns of diplomatic leverage. We need to see what these charges are against him and understand whether there is a case or not. ""We are giving every support we can, but we don't agree with individuals being used in diplomatic chess games. ""Because it is desperately worrying, not just for the individual but their families, and we are all extremely worried about him and his family as we hear this news."" He added that the UK had not yet had access to Mr Whelan and that the US was leading on this case. Asked about reports he is also Irish, the Irish embassy in Moscow said: ""The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow has requested consular access to an Irish citizen currently detained in Russia after receiving a request for assistance. ""The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will provide all possible and appropriate assistance in relation to this case."" Russia and America have traded spying allegations at regular intervals since the Cold War. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities Mr Whelan travelled to Russia on 22 December and planned to fly home on 6 January, but was arrested in Moscow on 28 December. Under the charge of espionage, he could face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent There is much we still don't know about the detention of Paul Whelan. What are the precise charges against him? Did he really have a memory stick containing a list of Russian intelligence officials when he was arrested, as claimed by one Russian news agency but not thus far corroborated? What lies behind his long-standing interest in Russia and engagement with Russian social media? And how many nationalities does he actually have - American and British, yes, but does he also have Irish and Canadian passports? This lack of certainty about the facts makes Jeremy Hunt's decision to accuse Russia of playing diplomatic chess games all the more interesting. The foreign secretary's remarks support the premise of speculation in the US that Mr Whelan's arrest is a strategic move by Moscow. The suggestion - and it is no more than that - is that the former US marine could be exchanged for a Russian woman who was jailed in the United States last month.Maria Butina, a pro-gun activist, pleaded guilty to trying to influence US conservative groups on behalf of the Russian government. Moscow certainly has a track record of using individuals for unpredictable and aggressive diplomacy. But Mr Hunt has shown that he, for now at least, is ready to respond robustly at a time when Anglo-Russian relations are still struggling to recover from last year's poisoning incident in Salisbury. Mr Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said he had appealed to the court against the detention of his client and requested he was released on bail. He added that Mr Whelan remained in good spirits.

Inquiry after patients' voicemails leakA hospital trust apologises after a man heard other patients' voicemails when he rang up.Manchester,"Brian Newton said he was shocked to hear the voicemail A man who tried to change a hospital appointment over the phone instead heard a stream of voicemail messages left by other patients. Brian Newton, 58, from Manchester was ""shocked"" to hear recordings of people giving personal data to Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. A BBC Radio Manchester journalist also heard the voicemails after calling the number Mr Newton used. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said it was investigating. A spokesman, who ""apologised unreservedly"", said the ""small number"" of affected patients would be contacted. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Mr Newton, a taxi-driver from Blackley. ""I started thinking 'Is somebody hearing my message?'."" ""I pressed 'zero' to speak to an operator and started hearing the messages,"" he told the BBC. ""One lady was very distressed - she was cancelling an appointment because her husband had died. ""I was thinking anybody could exploit this personal information."" Mr Newton contacted the hospital the following day to report the problem, only to later find it had still not been fixed. The hospital has apologised unreservedly for the error Mr Newton, who had already left a message on Tuesday to cancel an appointment at the Macular and Diabetic unit, called the unit again because he wanted to speak to someone from the department.

'Mass hack attack' on German politicians,"Angela Merkel, Greens leader Robert Habeck and TV satirist Jan BÃ¶hmermann have all been targeted by the attack Hundreds of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, have had personal details stolen and published online. Contacts, private chats and financial details were put out on Twitter that belong to figures from every political party except the far-right AfD. Data from celebrities and journalists were also leaked. It is unclear who was behind the attack, which emerged on Twitter in the style of an advent calendar last month. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the authorities were working hard to find the perpetrator. There was, he said in a statement, as yet no evidence that German parliamentary or government systems had been compromised. The leak appears to have originated on a Twitter account operated from Hamburg and the authorities in the north German city say they are now working with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to stop the spread of German politicians' data. AsTwitter's European headquarters are located in Dublin,external, the leak falls under the remit of the Irish data protection authority, national broadcaster RTE reports. The true extent of damage caused by the leak is not yet known although Justice Minister Katarina Barley said it was a ""serious attack"". ""The people behind this want to damage confidence in our democracy and institutions,"" she said. A government spokeswoman said no sensitive data from the chancellor's office had been published. MPs, Euro MPs and MPs from state parliaments were affected, said Martina Fietz. She said the government was not yet certain that the data had been stolen by cyber-hackers. Some reports suggested a lone leaker might have had access to sensitive data through their work. Although nothing politically explosive is known to have been leaked, the sheer volume of personal data involved suggests the consequences could be considerable, says Michael GÃ¶tschenberg, a reporter for German broadcaster RBB, who researched the attack. Many of those targeted are MPs in Germany's Bundestag The now-suspended Twitter account, identified by German media as @_0rbit, was followed by more than 17,000 people. Although documents had been posted on the account from 1 December to 28 December, it was not until Thursday evening that officials became aware of the theft. Bild newspaper said all the data stolen in the attack dated back to before October 2018 but it was not clear when it began. Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Hacking of German ministries 'ongoing' Interior Minister Seehofer said preliminary analysis showed the data had been obtained through ""wrongful use of log-in information for cloud services, email accounts or social networks"". A cyber analyst told the BBC there was speculation that hackers might have exploited weaknesses in email software to get hold of passwords that those targeted had also used on social media accounts. Data was published in Advent calendar-style daily releases on Twitter. The first ""doors"" at the start of December featured TV presenters, then rappers, and from 20 December it focused on politicians. National and local political figures as well as some TV personalities had their details stolen: Chancellor Angela Merkel: her email address and several letters to and from the chancellor appear to have been published The main parliamentary groups including the ruling centre-right and centre-left parties, as well asThe Greens, left-wingDie LinkeandFDP. Only AfD appears to have escaped Greens leader Robert Habeck, who had private chats with family members and credit card details posted online Journalists from public broadcastersARDandZDFas well as TV satiristJan BÃ¶hmermann, rapperMarteriaand rap groupK.I.Z,reports say Another TV satirist,Christian Ehring,is said to have had 3.4 gigabytes of data stolen and posted online, including holiday photos. Last year he won a court case brought by AfD leader Alice Weidel, who complained when he called her a ""slut"" on his TV show. Centre-left SPD MP Florian Postsaid he felt ""quite shocked"" by the leak of account statements and other details online, but he added that at least one file that had been posted was fake. Immediate suspicion fell on right-wing groups in Germany as well as Russia. German cyber-security analyst Sven Herpig said Russia was a suspect, first because of the method used but also because Germany was facing four state elections in 2019 as well as elections to the European Parliament. However, the fact that no right-wing politicians were targeted while prominent figures who had criticised them had been, suggested domestic right-wingers may also have been responsible, he told the BBC. Russia has been accused of cyber-attacks in Germany before. In 2015, data was stolen from computers in the Bundestag. And last year the government's IT network came under attack amid reports that Russian hackers were also to blame. UK-based expert Graham Cluley said the breadth of the latest attack suggested it was a co-ordinated effort involving a determined group over many months. ""This hack clearly isn't about extortion or financially motivated.  This is about attempting to destabilise Germany society,"" he told the BBC.

Hotel to operate on battery power,"An Edinburgh hotel is claimed to be the first in the UK to be powered by battery. The Gyle Premier Inn at Edinburgh Park has installed a five-tonne battery. It will charge from the national grid in off-peak periods and power the 200-room site for several hours each day. The 3m cubed lithium ion battery will save the hotel Â£20,000 a year on its energy bill. It is able to power the hotel, including the restaurant, for up to three hours after a two-hour charge. Premier Inn's parent company Whitbread said the trial of the battery storage technology would help its commitment to halve its carbon emissions by 2025. Cian Hatton, Whitbread's head of energy and environment, said: ""Batteries are of course everyday items, more commonly associated with powering small household goods like the TV remote control, so it's incredibly exciting to launch the UK's first battery-powered hotel - an innovation which will save money, ensure security of supply and support the transition to a more flexible grid."" The hotel chain joins companies including B&Q and Veolia, which both installed lithium ion battery power systems in 2018. Electricity company E.ON has supplied and installed the technology at the hotel and will be remotely managing the battery's workload and efficiency from its energy management centre in Glasgow. Richard Oakley, customer accounts director at E.ON, said: ""The Gyle at Edinburgh Park is already an energy efficient hotel thanks to the remote monitoring and management of its systems from our control centre in Glasgow. ""By adding the flexibility of battery storage we can also help Whitbread to upgrade to the full-board option of drawing electricity from the grid when prices are low, storing that energy for use at peak times and having the ability to sell it back to the grid to help balance supply and demand on the network. ""Premier Inn is showing how hotel chains and large power users can further save money, reduce their carbon footprint and support the development of a lower-carbon, smarter energy grid in the UK.""

Thousands complain about TV licence scam,"A TV licence email scam has led to more than 5,000 complaints over the past three months. Cyber crime monitor Action Fraud said fake TV licence emails regarding payment issues had been sent out to try to collect bank details. The number of reports has increased in each of the past three months, with 1,983 complaints in December alone. Action Fraud told the BBC the scam was ""particularly nasty as it looks so convincing"". The emails use headlines such as ""correct your licensing information"" and ""your TV licence expires today"" in an attempt to convince people to click on the link in the email. Action Fraud said it received 5,247 complaints about such emails between 1 October and the end of December. By comparison, there were only 1,614 complaints in the preceding nine months of the year, with the majority of those coming in September. Would you fall for a scam email? Students hit by wave of fake refund emails Elderly 'under siege' from scammers While the emails themselves might vary slightly in their wording, all of the links direct through to the same website. The fake TV Licensing website asks victims to provide their payment details, including their account number, sort code, and card verification value (CVV) code on the back of their card. The website may also ask for a victim's name, date of birth, address, phone number, email and possibly even their mother's maiden name. Action Fraud said it was working to ""stop fraudsters in their tracks"". Leesa Hellings-Lamb, from Bolton, told the BBC she received an ""incredibly realistic"" email from what she thought was TV Licensing claiming her licence was due to expire in two days. She followed the link in the email and began entering her bank details but became ""suspicious"" when she was asked for ""too much information"". ""Eventually I realised it was a scam,"" said Ms Hellings-Lamb, who managed to avoid confirming her details to the fraudsters. She added: ""I have learnt my lesson and told everyone I know to spread the word and remind everyone to be more cautious."" A TV Licensing spokeswoman said: ""TV Licensing will never email customers, unprompted, to ask for bank details, personal information or tell you that you may be entitled to a refund."" There are a number of ways to check whether or not an email you have received might be from fraudsters. Action Fraud says should check: The sender's email address- does it look like one TV Licensing would use? The subject line- anything such as ""action required"" or ""security alert"" should be treated with suspicion Spelling and grammar- grammatical errors suggest it is likely to be a scam The style -scammers often take real emails and amend them, so be wary of emails that seem too familiar or casual The link- does it go through to theofficial TV Licensing website,external? If you think you have received an email from fraudsters, you should report it toAction Fraud,external.

New roads 'should boost cycling and walking',"Pedestrians, cyclists and public transport should be given priority over cars when roads are built or upgraded, to encourage more physical activity, the UK's health watchdog has said. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says roads should be ""safe, attractive and designed"" to help people use their cars less. It has issued a set ofdraft guidelines,externalfor planners and local authorities. The Department for Transport said it supported such policies. NICE cited concerns over obesity levels as well as research suggesting physical activity can prevent and manage chronic conditions and diseases - including some cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and depression. It said: ""Transport systems and the wider built environment can influence people's ability to be active."" NICE deputy chief executive Gillian Leng added: ""Getting people to be more physically active by increasing the amount they walk or cycle has the potential to benefit both the individual and the health system. ""People can feel less safe when they walk or cycle compared with when they drive. We've got to change this."" NICE said it was important for planners to consider older people and those with limited mobility. This video can not be played This is how the Italian city of Bologna is getting people to leave their cars behind Pavements should feature bumps, grooves and anti-glare surfaces to help those with visual impairments, it said. The health body also recommended: Ensuring new and refurbished footways, footpaths and cycle routes link to existing routes Widening footways and introducing cycle lanes Introducing traffic-calming schemes to restrict vehicle speeds Paying more attention to public transport in rural areas where services may be limited Improving public transport to parks and other green spaces The Department for Transport said its own guidance ""is crystal clear that street design should explicitly consider pedestrians and cyclists first"". Steve Gooding from the RAC Foundation said new road building was rare and only usually took place on housing estates. He said: ""It's all very well making provision for walking and cycling... but if the shops, schools and doctors' surgeries that people need to get to are still miles away, then for many the car will remain the most practical method of travel."" Apublic consultation,externalon the draft guidelines from NICE runs until 1 February.

No-deal Brexit 'biggest threat' to unis,"Universities say that UK research in science and medicine will be harmed by a no-deal Brexit University heads are warning a no-deal Brexit is ""one of the biggest threats"" the institutions have ever faced. Higher education leaders have written to MPs to say it is ""no exaggeration"" to warn that it would take universities ""decades to recover"". They say it would undermine scientific research and threaten universities' Â£21bn contribution to the UK economy. The government has said its immigration plans will keep universities ""open to the talent we need from Europe"". A joint letter sent to all MPs on behalf of the heads of 150 UK universities says: ""Vital research links will be compromised, from new cancer treatments to technologies combating climate change. ""The valuable exchange of students, staff and knowledge would be seriously damaged,"" adds the letter from university groups including Universities UK, the Russell Group, Guild HE, Million Plus and University Alliance. Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, warned ""time is running out"". She says that without ""cast-iron assurances"" about the UK's access to European research networks, world-leading researchers will be lost to other countries where ""funding is not at risk"". EU staff in UK universities decide whether to stay or leave University's 'dual nationality' plan for Brexit EU students get post-Brexit fees promise University needs Â£1m bailout from watchdog But the journalist and educationalist Toby Young, who says he backs a ""clean Brexit"", dismissed the warning as ""the usual ultra-Remainer hysteria"", accusing vice-chancellors of ""fear-mongering"". ""In the event of a no-deal Brexit, I'm sure the government will use some of that Â£49bn windfall to compensate British universities for any short-term losses,"" said Mr Young, associate editor of the Spectator magazine. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The Russell Group of leading research universities says there has already been a downturn in EU students wanting to study in the UK. Data from its 24 universities shows a 3% fall in EU students in the current intake - which they believe is because of uncertainty over Brexit. The letter warns MPs of the dangers to the UK's universities if they lose their place in European research networks. It gives two examples of funding at risk - the European Research Council and Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions - which would be worth Â£1.2bn to UK institutions over the next two years. The UK has been among the biggest winners from EU research funding University leaders say that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK institutions would ""immediately become ineligible"" for this funding. After next year, there is a wider pot of European research funding at stake, worth more than Â£90bn. Universities want assurances that any lost research funding will be replaced by the UK government. But they are also worried by proposals for new restrictions on EU students after Brexit in the government's White Paper on migration, published before Christmas. These 130,000 EU students will need to have visas and be sponsored by universities - and the Russell Group has warned that it is ""unrealistic and unsustainable"" to expect universities to take on the administrative burden. If there is a no-deal Brexit, the Russell Group says the uncertainty behind the fall in EU students coming to the UK ""will only get worse"". This adds to fears about the financial sustainability of some universities in England - with warnings that those unable to attract enough students and their tuition fees could become unviable. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says the negative impact of Brexit could add to the risk of some universities getting ""close to the wire this year"". This could mean takeovers, mergers or bailouts, rather than closure, he says. The government has promised to continue to welcome overseas students after Brexit, with a streamlined, ""light-touch"" visa system, with no limit on numbers. There will be incentives for overseas students, such as making it easier for them to stay and work in the UK after graduation. There is also a commitment to underwrite funding from existing EU research projects. A government spokeswoman said: ""Science recognises no borders and the UK has a proud record of welcoming the world's leading scientists and researchers to work and study here. This will not change when we leave the EU. ""Through our modern industrial strategy we are investing the highest ever level in research and development in UK history and we are committed to seeking an ambitious future relationship on science and innovation with our EU partners.""

Anti-drone equipment for airports,"Anti-drone equipment was deployed by the RAF at Gatwick until this week Gatwick and Heathrow are to spend millions of pounds on anti-drone technology following the disruption at the Sussex airport before Christmas. The equipment, which can detect and jam communications between a drone and its operator, was deployed by the RAF on a roof at Gatwick last month. About 1,000 flights were cancelled over three days due to drone sightings. Gatwick said it had spent Â£5m to prevent future attacks, and Heathrow confirmed it would be buying systems. More than 140,000 passengers at Gatwick were affected during 36 hours of chaos between 19 and 21 December. Military leaves Gatwick after drone chaos How can a drone cause so much chaos? The military was brought in by the government and was only stood down on Wednesday this week. The Ministry of Defence said personnel from the Royal Air Force Regiment were involved in the deployment. Last year it wasreported that the MoD had ordered the Drone Dome system,externaldeveloped by Israeli company Rafael. The system has a range of several miles and uses four radars to give 360-degree detection to identify and track drones. However, it is understood the MoD is still waiting to receive the system and alternative technology was in use at Gatwick. Thousands of passengers were disrupted by the drone incidents at Gatwick before Christmas Gatwick and Heathrow have not disclosed the equipment they plan to use in future. A Gatwick spokeswoman confirmed the airport had invested in new anti-drone defences after the disruption. A spokesman for Heathrow said: ""The safety of our passengers and colleagues remains our top priority. ""Working closely with relevant authorities including the Met Police, we are constantly looking at the best technologies that help remove the threat of drones."" Sussex Police, which is still investigating the disruption, says it was caused by ""numerous instances of illegal drone activity"". The force said it has ""relevant sightings"" from 115 witnesses - 93 of whom it described as ""credible"" - including airport staff, police officers and a pilot.

NI EuroMillions jackpot winners revealedFrances and Patrick Connolly from County Armagh say they are overwhelmed after winning the Â£115m Lotto jackpot.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Frances and Patrick Connolly recount how they realised they had picked the winning numbers A couple from Northern Ireland have made a list of 50 people with whom they intend to share their Â£115m EuroMillions win. Frances and Patrick Connolly, who live in Moira, County Down, matched the winning numbers in the New Year's Day draw. It is the fourth biggest UK EuroMillions win and the biggest in NI. The lucky pair's identities were revealed at a press conference just outside Belfast on Friday. Speaking to the media, Frances Connolly said the money will be shared between family, friends and charitable causes. The couple have made a list of people they want to share their win with ""This is a massive sum of money and we want it to have a huge impact on the lives of other people we know and love, as well as on our future too."" The 52-year-old said the most important thing they have done since their win was to have made a list of people they want to give the money to. ""At the minute there are about 50 people,"" she said, adding that most of those on the list do not yet know they are on it. ""It's going to be so much fun giving it away,"" she said. ""The pleasure for me is going to be seeing their faces."" Her husband Patrick Connolly, 54, said: ""I've got a wonderful wife, a wonderful family and wonderful friends, so this is the icing on the cake. Patrick Connolly said he was ""blessed with a great family"" before the win ""Money doesn't bring you happiness. We already had happiness and were very blessed in life."" Mr Connolly is a businessman who once ran his own firm. He predicted he would not be able to sit around long before he had to get back to doing something. He said his expertise was in manufacturing and he hoped to create more jobs using part of their fortune. They said they were hard-working people who did not carry a lot of debt and did not indulge in luxuries before their win. ""We are quite level-headed people, we're not overly extravagant - yet,"" said Mr Connolly. Asked by a reporter if they had thought about personal security, Mrs Connolly quipped: ""I've never met anyone I couldn't take down myself!"" The couple - who have three daughters and three grandchildren - are regular Lotto players but only normally buy tickets for EuroMillions when there is a big jackpot. The pair live in a rented home and were previously considering a move to Croydon in March as Mr Connolly had been offered a new job as an operations manager. Mrs Connolly, who had worked as an educational programme coordinator, is planning to do a PhD in clinical psychology. The couple laughed and joked with the assembled press The winning numbers - 01, 08, 11, 25, 28, with Lucky Stars 04 and 06 - were selected at random, they said. ""Totally random, sure how would you pick those numbers? They're weird,"" Mrs Connolly joked, before adding that a holiday to Mauritius is on the cards. She admitted that she will find it heartbreaking to read letters from people the couple cannot help, adding: ""It will keep me up at night."" After the press conference, the couple went outside the hotel and laughed and joked as they sprayed champagne and kissed for photographers. At one point, Mrs Connolly joked with the assembled media pack that she only wanted images that showed her with ""one chin"". The grandparents punched the air and waved their bumper cheque as the champagne flowed to toast their win. After spraying multiple bottles, Mrs Connolly asked lottery advisers: ""Who's going to clean all this up?"" Speaking to BBC News NI, Andy Carter of the National Lottery said its most important role is ""looking after someone as they're going through a really life-changing experience"". ""We make sure they have access to good legal advice and good financial advice, but it's primarily about supporting them through a period of both shock and excitement,"" he said. Mr Carter explained that the decision on whether or not to go public about a win can be a difficult one. ""The greatest advice is to take your time - do nothing quickly. Our advice is go away and have a holiday - take some time to really come to terms with it."" He added that past winners rarely make ostentatious purchases at an early stage. ""We often ask them what was your first purchase and they'll say the toilet seat was broken or the kettle wasn't working. Nothing surprises us!"" Northern Ireland has had a history of big wins. In December 2013,an unemployed woman from Strabane, County Tyrone, won almost Â£27m in the EuroMillions lottery.

Bosses pay beats staff 'in three days',"In the first three days of 2019 top bosses will have earned more than the typical worker will earn all year, according to a report. The average pay of a FTSE 100 chief executive is Â£1,020 an hour, research from the High Pay Centre and HR industry body the CIPD has found. By ""Fat Cat Friday"" bosses will have earned more than the typical annual UK salary of Â£29,574, the report said. However critics have questioned their calculations. According to the report, the median pay including bonuses for a FTSE 100 chief executive was Â£3.926m in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available. It assumed that bosses work 12 hours a day for 320 days a year, making their hourly pay rate Â£1,020. ""Excessive executive pay represents a massive corporate governance failure and is a barrier to a fairer economy,"" said Luke Hildyard, Director of the High Pay Centre. ""Corporate boards are too willing to spend millions on top executives without any real justification, while the wider workforce is treated as a cost to be minimised,"" he said. The Â£29,574 figure for median pay of full-time UK workers was taken fromOffice for National Statistics data,external. To match that salary, FTSE 100 bosses would have to work for 31 hours, or until 13:00 on Friday 4 January. However, free-market think tank the Adam Smith Institute described the research as ""cod statistics"". ""If these activist organisations actually cared about workers, and not just the politics of envy against our best and brightest, they would talk about ways to actually increase worker pay,"" said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Institute. ""Limits on executive pay would drive top British talent and companies offshore, ultimately leading to fewer jobs and lower pay for workers,"" he said. Last year shareholders in Royal Mail rebelled against the company's executive pay plan The CIPD report said typical pay for a FTSE 100 chief executive had risen 11% from last year. That means bosses had to work two hours less this year to match the average worker's annual salary, compared with 2018. ""Executive pay committees have to change. They should be required to include workforce representatives who can speak up for a fair balance of pay with ordinary workers. Too much wealth is being hoarded at the top,"" said TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady. Last year, the chief executive of Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, was forced out after a row over his Â£75m pay award. The bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house-buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance. In October he walked awayfrom a BBC interview when asked about his pay. In July, Royal Mail shareholders rebelled against the company's pay plans for top executives following a row over a salary rise for its new boss. The directors' remuneration report was rejected by about 70% of shareholders in a vote, which is non-binding. New chief executive Rico Back is set to be paid Â£640,000 - Â£100,000 more than his predecessor Moya Greene. The CIPD and High Pay Centre want long-term incentive plans, which reward top executives with shares, replaced with a less complicated system based on their basic salary. They also want executives to be given incentives to improve the training and well-being of their workforce.

Jury to rule on Ed Sheeran copying claim,"Sheeran denies copying Let's Get It On A US judge has rejected Ed Sheeran's call for a legal case accusing him of copying parts of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On to be dropped. In his decision released on Thursday, District Judge Louis Stanton said a jury should decide. He said he found ""substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements"". Sheeran denies ripping off sections of the 1973 classic for his number one hit Thinking Out Loud. The action has been brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote Let's Get It On with Gaye. Ed Sheeran sued over claims he's ripped off a Marvin Gaye song Judge Stanton is also overseeing a separate $100m case over the same tracklaunched last June by the company Structured Asset Sales, which owns part of the copyright in Gaye's song. Judge Stanton said the similarities between the two songs included their bass lines and percussion and said listeners might consider the songs' ""aesthetic appeal"" to be similar.

He said there was disagreement over whether the harmonic and rhythmic composition of Gaye's song was too common to merit copyright protection. Jurors ""may be impressed by footage of a Sheeran performance which shows him seamlessly transitioning"" between the songs, Mr Stanton added. Sheeran's defence team has argued that Thinking Out Loud is different because it has ""sombre, melancholic tones, addressing long lasting romantic love"" while Let's Get It On is characterised as a ""sexual anthem"". Sheeran and the record companies have not yet responded to Judge Stanton's ruling. Mr Townsend's family were looking forward to the case being heard in court, their lawyer Pat Frank told Reuters. They say that Sheeran and the record companies ""copied the heart of Let's and repeated it continuously throughout Thinking"", according to court papers filed in 2016. In 2017Sheeran settled a $20m copyright infringement claimagainst him in the US, over his hit song Photograph. Songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harrington had sued the singer in 2016, claiming his hit ballad had a similar structure to their song Amazing. Also in 2017,the team behind TLC's 1999 single No Scrubs were given writing credits on Ed Sheeran's Shape of You. It came after critics and fans made comparisons between elements of the songs.

US low-cost airline pioneer Kelleher dies,"Herb Kelleher, who co-founded low-cost US carrier Southwest Airlines, has died aged 87, the company says. The company described him as ""a pioneer, a maverick and an innovator"" who disrupted the airline industry ""by making flying both fun and affordable"". He is survived by his wife Joan and three of their four children. Founded in 1967, his airline initially aimed to provide cheap flights between the Texas cities of Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. However Mr Kelleher, who had trained as a lawyer, was forced to fight a legal battle after competitor airlines fought to prevent his planes from operating. Is stopping the boom the key to supersonic air travel? The Supreme Court of Texas eventually ruled in his favour and the airline began service in 1971. ""I knew nothing about airlines, which I think made me eminently qualified to start one,"" Kelleher told National Public Radio in 2016,  ""because what we tried to do at Southwest was get away from the traditional way that airlines had done business."" Southwest offered cheap tickets in single-class cabins without reserved seats - tactics that became common in the airline industry several decades later. The airline's business model, which also included shortened turnaround times at airports, cabin crew collecting rubbish, and high aircraft utilisation, has since been copied by other low-cost carriers including Ryanair of the Irish Republic and Easyjet of the UK. Since its early days, Southwest has expanded to become the world's largest low-cost airline,externalwith more than 700 Boeing 737 jets making 4,000 flights a day, Business Insider reported. ""Herb's passion, zest for life, and insatiable investment in relationships made lasting and immeasurable impressions on all who knew him,"" Southwest said. Allow Twitter content?

Royal Navy sent to deter Channel migrants,"HMS Mersey was seen leaving Portsmouth harbour on Thursday afternoon A Royal Navy patrol ship has been sent to the English Channel to deter migrant crossings, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said HMS Mersey would ""help prevent migrants from making the dangerous journey"". The UK Border Force and French authorities are already patrolling the water - now, following a Home Office request, the navy has been sent in. About 240 people have reached the UK in small boats since November. Mr Williamson said HMS Mersey had been diverted from ""routine operations"" to the Strait of Dover. HMS Mersey is normally used to carry out fishing patrolsin UK waters and the Atlantic,external, ensuring boats and trawlers stick to internationally-agreed quotas. Border Force currently has two coastal patrol vessels in the Channel, as well as two cutters, HMC Vigilant and HMC Searcher, which can rescue several boatloads of people at once. The navy's involvement was requested by Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who said it would be an interim measure until two more Border Force cutters, HMC Protector and Seeker, areredeployed from the Mediterranean to UK waters,external. Mr Javid said: ""My focus continues to be on protecting the UK border and preventing loss of life in the Channel. For these reasons, the government has decided to deploy a navy vessel, HMS Mersey, to support our existing efforts."" The home secretary sparked controversy on Wednesday by questioningwhether those making the risky crossing in small boats were ""genuine"" refugees. Mr Javid also defended his decision to escalate the UK's response, saying that the number of attempted crossings had increased rapidly since October. At least 239 people are known to have reached the UK in small boats since November, including12 who were found off the Kent coast last week. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map On Tuesday, French police said they stopped 14 migrants attempting to cross the Channel from Boulogne - the latest in a growing number of people intercepted by the French authorities in the past month.

House price growth at near six-year lowThe latest survey from the Nationwide says property values grew by just 0.5% last year.Business,"UK house prices grew at an annual pace of 0.5% in December, the Nationwide building society has said, the slowest annual rate since February 2013. The lender says uncertainty over the economic outlook appears to be undermining confidence in the market. London and surrounding areas saw a small fall in house prices in 2018. Northern Ireland saw the biggest house price rises, up 5.8%. Prices in Wales climbed 4%, in Scotland they were up 0.9% and in England they rose 0.7%. December's growth rate, based on its own mortgage data, was a marked slowdown from the annual pace of 1.9% recorded by the Nationwide in November. The Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, told the BBC the severity of the slowdown was unexpected: ""It is a little bit surprising that house price growth has slowed as much as it has in the last month or so. ""It seems to be the uncertain economic outlook that is really weighing on buyer sentiment. I think once that lifts then things should start to pick up to normal levels of about 2%."" He said a lot of it ""depends on how we get through this Brexit uncertainty"". Will the value of your home change in 2019? Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? Chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, Samuel Tombs, said the slowdown was striking, but the overall outlook for the market was relatively benign: ""The hefty month-to-month fall in house prices in December [of 0.7%] - the biggest Nationwide has reported since August 2011 - brings an end to a weak year for the housing market. ""While the supply of homes for sale also has dwindled, the balance of demand and supply has shifted in buyers' favour. That said, we continue to doubt that a sustained period of falling house prices is likely."" He said that assuming MPs back some form of Brexit deal, with a subsequent recovery in consumers' confidence, prices were likely to pick up to grow by 2% this year. Nicholas Finn, executive director of Garrington Property Finders, said: ""At one extreme we are seeing a surge in the numbers of opportunistic, frequently cash, buyers emerging to snap up homes at large discounts."" ""Meanwhile thousands of would-be sellers are instead hunkering down and waiting until things improve before putting their home on the market."" Separatefigures from the Bank of England,externalshowed that mortgage approvals for house purchases fell in November, and are now at half the level of 15 years ago. The Nationwide said that house prices in London and the surrounding areas, such as Berkshire, had fallen by 0.8% and 1.4% in the past year. However, outside these areas, each nation and English region - based on Nationwide's local mortgage data - recorded annual house price growth. In addition to steady price growth in Northern Ireland and Wales, the East Midlands also saw prices increase by 4%. ""With prices in both inner and outer London falling, the capital bears a share of responsibility for dragging down the national pace of growth,"" Mr Finn said.

US to visit China for key trade talksThe meeting will be closely watched for progress in resolving the bruising US-China trade war.Business,"A US delegation will visit China next week for talks aimed at defusing the trade war between the world's two largest economies. The closely watched meeting follows a dismal week for US markets, with losses fuelled partly by trade fears. Last year, China and the US imposed tariffs on more than $300bn (Â£237bn) worth of each other's goods. It will be the first face-to-face meeting since the two countries agreed not to impose new tariffs for 90 days. US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to the temporary truce on 1 December on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. On its website, China's commerce ministry said the goal of the upcoming talks, to be held in Beijing on 7 and 8 January, will be ""implementing the important consensus"" reached by the two leaders. The US team will be led by Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish, the ministry said. US-China trade war in 300 words Trump and Xi reach trade truce Apple blames China as cuts forecast President Trump initiated the trade war over complaints of unfair Chinese trading practices. He campaigned on a pledge to make trade fairer for the US and to help American manufacturers. The battle has disrupted businesses and stoked fears about the impact on the global economy. Data this week pointed to signs of strain in the US and China at the end of last year. Clouds gather over global economy US factory activity slowed more than expected in December, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Chinese data on Monday showed its manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in more than two years.

Gangs 'get prison jobs to smuggle drugs'Police suspect criminals are trying to get associates work in jails so they can bring in illicit items.UK,"This video can not be played The BBC's Danny Shaw tried out the new body scanner, which caught an inmate smuggling drugs on its first day in use Police say there is growing evidence that members of organised criminal gangs are getting prison service jobs to smuggle banned items. A senior officer has told the BBC he has ""strong suspicions"" this is happening, but links are hard to prove. Ministers admit it ""can happen"" but say better search techniques will help. An ""X-ray"" body scanner to detect drugs has been installed at Leeds jail, one of 10 where ministers aim to cut drug-fuelled violence by the summer. Prisons minister Rory Stewart says he's ""cautiously optimistic"". In August he said he would resign if the 10 prisons did not improve within a year under a Â£10m programme to improve their security and living conditions. The programme also includes building repairs, better perimeter security and the use of sniffer dogs at the jails which the Ministry of Justice has identified as having ""acute problems"" with high drug use, violence and poor buildings. ""I believe we can do it,"" Mr Stewart told the BBC in December. ""We've got early indications in some of these prisons we're beginning to get a grip on it."" Rory Stewart: 'I'll resign if drugs and violence in jails don't go down' Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling banned items Prison smuggler: 'I brought mobile phones in for criminals' The 10 prisons are Hull, Humber, Isis, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Nottingham, Ranby, Wealstun and Wormwood Scrubs. Official figures, analysed by BBC News, show that the number of assaults has increased steadily since 2014 and was projected to increase last year in all the jails except Nottingham and Wormwood Scrubs. However, Mr Stewart acknowledged some jails might try to reduce assaults simply by moving dangerous offenders to other establishments. ""That's definitely a risk.  I'm very, very clear, though, we need to play this fair. The idea is that I can look other governors in the face and say: 'We turned around these ten prisons without cheating. '"" Police believe the drugs trade in jails is co-ordinated by organised crime groups. Assistant Chief Constable Jason Hogg, who leads on prison intelligence for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said he ""strongly suspects"" gangs are getting their associates or family members jobs in the prison service with the intention of smuggling contraband in, although it was difficult to prove. ACC Hogg said he was unaware of any cases where people caught with contraband in prison had been ""forthcoming"" about their links to organised crime - but added there were examples of people getting jobs within the prison staff and then being recruited by criminals. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mark Fairhurst, of the Prison Officers Association, said there was evidence both prison officers and civilian staff were employed by criminal gangs around the UK, but that those people accounted for ""less than 1%"" of prison staff. He added the use of X-ray body scanners was ""vital"" in the battle against drugs in prisons. However, a former prison inmate, who identified himself only as David, told Today that drugs were a ""reality of prison life"". He added: ""No matter what kind of security, if somebody wants a drug they will get a drug."" In the year ending March 2018, there were 51,993 incidents of contraband being found in prisons in England and Wales. The largest group was drugs, with 13,119 seizures in the year - this has tripled since 2010. In a third of cases the drug was a psychoactive substance, such as spice. Very few cases (408) involved the most serious Class A drugs, which include cocaine and heroin. Nearly 11,000 illicit mobile phones and 5,000 SIM cards were also found. There were almost 19,000 cases of seizures classed as 'other', a category which includes tobacco, alcohol, distilling equipment, weapons and ""other reportable items"". Source: Ministry of Justice Mr Stewart said searching was the ""answer"" to the problem of corruption. ""Searching, not just in terms of finding a bad apple, but also if you have very good search procedures in place, it's much more difficult for a prisoner to put pressure on a prison officer,"" he said. HMP Leeds is the first of the 10 prisons to have installed an X-ray scanner to detect packages hidden inside a prisoner's body.  The scanner, which costs about Â£120,000, operates in a similar way to a standard hospital X-ray machine - but the level of radiation is 400 times lower. A prisoner will be scanned only when intelligence indicates they may be carrying drugs - up to a maximum of 50 times a year. At Leeds jail, the scanner has already helped staff spot this prisoner returning with a packet of drugs inside him Prison staff at Leeds believe the X-ray scanner will act as a ""game changer"" in the battle to stop drugs getting in but the governor, Steve Robson, warned that offenders were adept at finding other methods, even smuggling new psychoactive substances (PS), such as Spice into their clothes or clothes worn by prison visitors. ""They have been soaking clothes in drugs and then either smoking bits of cut up clothing or then using the kettles boiling the drugs out and impregnating them back into the paper,"" said Mr Robson. ""We found lots of bits of dressing gown that we tested that came back very high for PS and fitted in with the intelligence that had happened so we started swabbing all the clothes."" He said it was a game of ""cat and mouse"". ""You close one avenue and the more ingenious will think of other ways of doing things,"" he said.

GM 'shortcut' boosts plant growthScientists overcome a natural restriction in plants that could boost yields from important food crops.Science & Environment,"These genetically modified tobacco plants were found to be 40% more productive Scientists in the US have engineered tobacco plants that can grow up to 40% larger than normal in field trials. The researchers say they have found a way of overcoming natural restrictions in the process of photosynthesis that limit crop productivity. They believe the method could be used to significantly boost yields from important crops including rice and wheat. Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Science. US wildlife refuges end 'bee-killer' ban GM crops have benefits - Princess Anne Researchers are growing increasingly concerned about the ability of the world to feed a growing population in a time of serious climate change. It's expected that agricultural demand will increase globally by 60-120% by the middle of this century compared to 2005.  Increases in crop yields however are rising by less that 2% per annum, so there's likely to be a significant shortfall by 2050. While the use of fertilisers, pesticides and mechanisation have boosted yields over the past few decades, their potential for future growth is limited. Instead, scientists are increasingly looking to improving the process of photosynthesis as a way of increasing food productivity. Aerial view of the 2017 field trials. Researchers found that plants engineered with a synthetic shortcut are about 40% more productive. While plants use the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that fuel the plant's growth, the chemical steps involved produce some toxic compounds that actually limit the potential of the crop. These toxins are then recycled by the plant in a process called photorespiration - but this costs the plant precious energy that could have been used to increase yield. In this study, researchers set out to develop a way around the photosynthesis glitch. ""We've tried three different biochemical designs with the aim of shortcutting this very energy expensive process,"" said lead author Dr Paul South with the US Agricultural Research Service. ""It's been estimated that in plants like soybeans, rice and fruit and vegetables, it can be a significant drag on yield by as much as 36%. We've tried to engineer this shortcut to make them more energy efficient - and in field trials this translated into a 40% increase in plant biomass."" One important aspect of the problem is that it becomes more prevalent at higher temperatures and under drought conditions. ""Our goal is to build better plants that can take the heat today and in the future, to help equip farmers with the technology they need to feed the world,"" said co-author Amanda Cavanagh, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois. The researchers chose tobacco plants because they are easy and quick to modify. They also form a fully closed canopy in the field similar to many food crops. The team is now hoping to use these findings to boost the yields of soybean, rice, potato and tomato plants. The experiment is significant say researchers because it involved two years of of field trials ""This process is very similar among all the crops that we are looking to grow,"" said Dr South. ""We are are really hoping that this is a technology that provides a tool that further optimises agriculture so that we are not using outside inputs as much and we are growing more food on less land."" However, the authors recognise that using genetic modification is controversial in many parts of the world. They argue that a lengthy review process will ensure that if food crops are developed using this technology, they will be accepted by farmers and consumers alike. ""The research that's necessary to prove that it has low environmental impact and is safe for consumption takes a minimum of ten years and many more dollars in research funds to make sure that this is a good and safe food product,"" said Dr South. The technology is being developed for royalty-free distribution to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and in Southeast Asia. It is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the UK's Department for International Development.

US House Democrats vote to end shutdown,"This video can not be played Pelosi said she was privileged to serve with more than 100 women in Congress The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives has voted to end a partial government shutdown, but the move looks certain to be vetoed by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has said he will reject any measure that does not provide funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. New House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will resume negotiations with Mr Trump on Friday, branded the wall immoral. The new Congress is considered the most diverse in history. The bills passed by the House of Representatives would fund homeland security operations, including $1.3bn in border security, until 8 February, and fund several other agencies until September. However, it requires Senate approval, and sign off from the president, in order to become law. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate, and majority leader Mitch McConnell has said Republicans there would not back measures that Mr Trump did not support. Mr McConnell called the Democrats' move a ""total nonstarter"" and a ""political sideshow"". However, Democrats argue that the bills are nearly identical to ones passed by the Senate last month, before Mr Trump insisted wall funding must be included. The 116th Congress is considered the most diverse in history Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, was elected as Speaker of the House for a second time - becoming the third most powerful politician in the US. She previously led the House from 2007-11 - and remains the only female to hold the position. She invited the children and grandchildren of House Representatives to join her as she was sworn in, saying: ""I'm particularly proud to be a woman Speaker of the House of this Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote."" Later, she told reporters: ""We're not doing a wall... a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective."" She added that spending money on ""more infrastructure at the ports of entry"" and better technology would be more efficient. As of Thursday, 102 women serve in the 435-seat House, an all-time high, including 36 newly elected members and a record 43 women of colour. Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim congresswomen, hugs her son after being sworn in While Republican women marked some firsts this past election season, like Marsha Blackburn becoming the first female Tennessee senator, the vast majority of these new lawmakers are Democrats. They include: The first Muslim congresswomen - Michigan's Rashida Tlaib, who took her oath on the Koran, and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, who became the first person to wear a hijab in Congress The first Native American congresswomen - New Mexico's Debra Haaland and Kansas' Sharice Davids New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest woman to be elected to Congress Carol Miller of West Virginia is the only new female Republican representative, bringing the total number of conservative women in the House to 13 - a decrease from 23 before the mid-term elections. Bid to criticise US congresswoman for dancing backfires The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman Lawmaker swears in on Koran This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The partial US government shutdown began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats won the majority of the House in the November mid-term elections, and the new representatives were sworn in on Thursday. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Ms Pelosi told the Today show before the first session of the new House.  ""We have given the Republicans a chance,externalto take yes for an answer."" The president is due to resume budget talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Friday morning. The White House says it is again floating the idea of a deal for 'Dreamers' - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. What is this Dreamer debate all about? Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"". Meanwhile, some vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 have spoken out in favour of approving the budget bills to end the government shutdown. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado was the first to do so, tellingThe Hill,externalon Thursday that Congress should reopen the government and let wall negotiations continue afterwards. Maine Senator Susan Collins echoed this view, suggesting the president should sign the agreed upon spending bills first so federal employees could get back to work,Politico reported,external. Mr Trump pushed back on Friday against Democrats who are calling for him to be removed from office.

After being sworn in on Thursday, Ms Tlaib used an expletive to describe the president while vowing to impeach him. But fellow Democratic representative and civil rights icon John Lewis criticised her ""inappropriate"" remark, telling reporters impeachment talk ""is a little premature"".

Bankers arrested over '$2bn fraud scheme',"Three former Credit Suisse bankers have been arrested over their alleged role in a $2bn (Â£1.5bn) fraud scheme connected to firms in Mozambique, according to US authorities. The men have been released on bail in London while the US seeks their extradition. The scheme allegedly involved loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique. Two others, including the country's former finance minister, have also been arrested. The former employees of the Swiss investment bank were arrested in London on Thursday. The three - Andrew Pearse, Surjan Singh, and Detelina Subeva - were charged with conspiring to violate US anti-bribery law, money laundering and securities fraud in an indictment issued by a US District Court in New York. Prosecutors say that through a series of financial transactions between approximately 2013 and 2016, they created fraudulent maritime projects and used state-owned companies in Mozambique as fronts to raise $2bn. Some of the investors defrauded included US nationals, the indictment says. It added that they ""intentionally diverted portions of the loan proceeds to pay at least $200m in bribes and kickbacks to themselves, Mozambican government officials and others"". The state-owned companies missed more than $700m in loan payments after defaulting in 2016 and 2017, the indictment adds. In a statement, Credit Suisse made clear that no action had been taken against the bank itself. ""The indictment alleges that the former employees worked to defeat the bank's internal controls, acted out of a motive of personal profit, and sought to hide these activities from the bank,"" it said. The US has agreed extradition treaties with more than 100 countries. These treaties can require ""the surrender of persons who have committed crimes in foreign countries"".

Nancy Pelosi elected to lead diverse US House,"This video can not be played Pelosi said she was privileged to serve with more than 100 women in Congress California Democrat Nancy Pelosi has again been elected as Speaker - the third most powerful role in Washington - in the US House of Representatives. She reclaimed the gavel after the most diverse class of lawmakers were sworn in and as Democrats took control of the House after mid-term elections gains. Her victory came as the US government remained partly shut down in a row over funds for the president's border wall. Ms Pelosi has said she wants to end the shutdown but will not support the wall. ""I'm particularly proud to be a woman Speaker of the house of this Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote,"" she said. ""And, that we all have the ability and the privilege to serve with over 100 women members of Congress - the largest number in history. "" Ms Pelosi, 78, seized the gavel as the House welcomed more women than ever before in the 116th Congress. Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (second left), Barbara Lee, Jahana Hayes, Lauren Underwood, and Sheila Jackson-Lee As of Thursday, 102 women serve in the House, an all-time high, including 36 newly elected members and a record 43 women of colour. While Republican women marked some firsts this past election season - like Marsha Blackburn becoming the first female Tennessee senator - the vast majority of these new lawmakers are Democrats. Among them are the first Muslim congresswomen - Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar - and the first Native American women to serve - New Mexico's Debra Haaland and Kansas' Sharice Davids. The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman Lawmaker to take oath on Jefferson's Koran How women are changing the face of Congress Nancy Pelosi stops for a photograph with her fellow Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. While celebrating the Democratic diversity during the swearing-in ceremonies, some on social media highlighted the contrast to the Republican members, who are mostly white men. Allow Twitter content?

Carol Miller of West Virginia is the only new female Republican representative, bringing the total number of conservative women in the House to 13 - a decrease from 23 before the mid-term elections. The 116th Congress has become the most diverse in history The first day of a new Congress is usually like the first day of school. New arrivals wander the halls in a daze. It's all handshakes and smiles; ceremony and sunshine. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate There was a big cloud over the proceedings at the Capitol this day, however. For the first time in US history, a government shutdown - the fourth-longest on record already - has stretched from one Congress into the next. There were still receptions and flowery speeches to supporters who travelled to Washington for the occasion. But the champagne toasts will be abbreviated, as the real work in Congress begins almost immediately. The House Democrats scheduled votes for their legislation to reopen the government just hours after the swearing-in ceremonies wrapped up. This is the opening move, however. Republicans in the Senate have pledged to only vote on measures that have Donald Trump's support - and the president continues to demand his border wall funding. As Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, told me earlier today, there's ""no end in sight"" for the shutdown. ""I'm realistic, not optimistic,"" he added. It may be a new day and a new Congress, but hope is already a scarce commodity. The partial US government shutdown began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. Ms Pelosi and her fellow House Democrats have vowed to pass spending bills to end the shutdown, but have insisted the bills will not include any funding for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico. In her remarks on Thursday, Ms Pelosi promised to re-open the government ""to meet the needs of the American people"". ""I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unified,"" she added. ""Let us respect each other and respect the truth."" However, Senate Republicans, who must also agree on the legislation, have said they will not pass any bills without the president's approval, which means the gridlock will probably continue. Mr Trump's Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats won the majority of the House in the November mid-term elections. Speaking from the White House briefing room for his first time ever on Thursday, Mr Trump congratulated Ms Pelosi, saying: ""It's a very, very great achievement and hopefully we're going to work together."" The impact of the government shutdown Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats would quickly pass budget legislation providing sufficient funds to end the shutdown, but has not offered specifics. Speaking onthe Today show,externalon Thursday, she reiterated: ""Nothing for the wall."" ""There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, 'We want you to do something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars,'"" she said. ""That sends the wrong message about who we are as a country."" Ms Pelosi also said she believed a sitting president could be indicted - althoughJustice Department guidelines disagree,external. How US mid-terms just got worse for Trump The Democrats will also try to pass the blame for the shutdown on to the president, pointing out that the bills they will pass would be similar to legislation that had won bipartisan support in the Senate in December before Mr Trump signalled he would not back it. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Ms Pelosi said. ""We have given the Republicans a chance to take yes for an answer."" Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence met with Republican and Democratic leaders on Wednesday One Democrat bill would temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security until 8 February, while another measure would fund other departments closed by the partial shutdown until 30 September. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said Republicans there will not back measures that Mr Trump does not support. He called the Democrats' move a ""total nonstarter"" and a ""political sideshow"". The president is due to resume budget talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Friday. About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Around 800,000 federal workers are now furloughed - that is, temporarily laid off due to a lack of funding - or working without pay Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling National Parks have become hazardous without staff #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown Fashion consultant Tim Gunn, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, and singer Tony Bennett were guests of Pelosi Before taking the oath Ms Pelosi' invited her grandchildren, as well as any other children present in the chamber, to join her at the dais. Looking on was ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"" singer Tony Bennett, 92, who was a guest of Ms Pelosi andreportedly serenaded her at a dinner at the Italian embassy,externalthe night before. She also invited friends Tim Gunn from TV programme Project Runway, and Mickey Hart, the drummer of the San Francisco-based rock group the Grateful Dead. Ms Pelosi has previously spoken of her family's love for the Grateful Dead. When she was first sworn in as Speaker in 2007, she was joined by Mr Hart and other members of the psychedelic rock band who later celebrated by performing a concert in her honour.

US to visit China for key trade talks,"A US delegation will visit China next week for talks aimed at defusing the trade war between the world's two largest economies. The closely watched meeting follows a dismal week for US markets, with losses fuelled partly by trade fears. Last year, China and the US imposed tariffs on more than $300bn (Â£237bn) worth of each other's goods. It will be the first face-to-face meeting since the two countries agreed not to impose new tariffs for 90 days. US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to the temporary truce on 1 December on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. On its website, China's commerce ministry said the goal of the upcoming talks, to be held in Beijing on 7 and 8 January, will be ""implementing the important consensus"" reached by the two leaders. The US team will be led by Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish, the ministry said. US-China trade war in 300 words Trump and Xi reach trade truce Apple blames China as cuts forecast President Trump initiated the trade war over complaints of unfair Chinese trading practices. He campaigned on a pledge to make trade fairer for the US and to help American manufacturers. The battle has disrupted businesses and stoked fears about the impact on the global economy. Data this week pointed to signs of strain in the US and China at the end of last year. Clouds gather over global economy US factory activity slowed more than expected in December, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Chinese data on Monday showed its manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in more than two years.

GM 'shortcut' boosts plant growth,"These genetically modified tobacco plants were found to be 40% more productive Scientists in the US have engineered tobacco plants that can grow up to 40% larger than normal in field trials. The researchers say they have found a way of overcoming natural restrictions in the process of photosynthesis that limit crop productivity. They believe the method could be used to significantly boost yields from important crops including rice and wheat. Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Science. US wildlife refuges end 'bee-killer' ban GM crops have benefits - Princess Anne Researchers are growing increasingly concerned about the ability of the world to feed a growing population in a time of serious climate change. It's expected that agricultural demand will increase globally by 60-120% by the middle of this century compared to 2005.  Increases in crop yields however are rising by less that 2% per annum, so there's likely to be a significant shortfall by 2050. While the use of fertilisers, pesticides and mechanisation have boosted yields over the past few decades, their potential for future growth is limited. Instead, scientists are increasingly looking to improving the process of photosynthesis as a way of increasing food productivity. Aerial view of the 2017 field trials. Researchers found that plants engineered with a synthetic shortcut are about 40% more productive. While plants use the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that fuel the plant's growth, the chemical steps involved produce some toxic compounds that actually limit the potential of the crop. These toxins are then recycled by the plant in a process called photorespiration - but this costs the plant precious energy that could have been used to increase yield. In this study, researchers set out to develop a way around the photosynthesis glitch. ""We've tried three different biochemical designs with the aim of shortcutting this very energy expensive process,"" said lead author Dr Paul South with the US Agricultural Research Service. ""It's been estimated that in plants like soybeans, rice and fruit and vegetables, it can be a significant drag on yield by as much as 36%. We've tried to engineer this shortcut to make them more energy efficient - and in field trials this translated into a 40% increase in plant biomass."" One important aspect of the problem is that it becomes more prevalent at higher temperatures and under drought conditions. ""Our goal is to build better plants that can take the heat today and in the future, to help equip farmers with the technology they need to feed the world,"" said co-author Amanda Cavanagh, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois. The researchers chose tobacco plants because they are easy and quick to modify. They also form a fully closed canopy in the field similar to many food crops. The team is now hoping to use these findings to boost the yields of soybean, rice, potato and tomato plants. The experiment is significant say researchers because it involved two years of of field trials ""This process is very similar among all the crops that we are looking to grow,"" said Dr South. ""We are are really hoping that this is a technology that provides a tool that further optimises agriculture so that we are not using outside inputs as much and we are growing more food on less land."" However, the authors recognise that using genetic modification is controversial in many parts of the world. They argue that a lengthy review process will ensure that if food crops are developed using this technology, they will be accepted by farmers and consumers alike. ""The research that's necessary to prove that it has low environmental impact and is safe for consumption takes a minimum of ten years and many more dollars in research funds to make sure that this is a good and safe food product,"" said Dr South. The technology is being developed for royalty-free distribution to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and in Southeast Asia. It is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the UK's Department for International Development.

New roads 'should help bikes and walkers',"Pedestrians, cyclists and public transport should be given priority over cars when roads are built or upgraded, to encourage more physical activity, the UK's health watchdog has said. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says roads should be ""safe, attractive and designed"" to help people use their cars less. It has issued a set ofdraft guidelines,externalfor planners and local authorities. The Department for Transport said it supported such policies. NICE cited concerns over obesity levels as well as research suggesting physical activity can prevent and manage chronic conditions and diseases - including some cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and depression. It said: ""Transport systems and the wider built environment can influence people's ability to be active."" NICE deputy chief executive Gillian Leng added: ""Getting people to be more physically active by increasing the amount they walk or cycle has the potential to benefit both the individual and the health system. ""People can feel less safe when they walk or cycle compared with when they drive. We've got to change this."" NICE said it was important for planners to consider older people and those with limited mobility. This video can not be played This is how the Italian city of Bologna is getting people to leave their cars behind Pavements should feature bumps, grooves and anti-glare surfaces to help those with visual impairments, it said. The health body also recommended: Ensuring new and refurbished footways, footpaths and cycle routes link to existing routes Widening footways and introducing cycle lanes Introducing traffic-calming schemes to restrict vehicle speeds Paying more attention to public transport in rural areas where services may be limited Improving public transport to parks and other green spaces The Department for Transport said its own guidance ""is crystal clear that street design should explicitly consider pedestrians and cyclists first"". Steve Gooding from the RAC Foundation said new road building was rare and only usually took place on housing estates. He said: ""It's all very well making provision for walking and cycling... but if the shops, schools and doctors' surgeries that people need to get to are still miles away, then for many the car will remain the most practical method of travel."" Apublic consultation,externalon the draft guidelines from NICE runs until 1 February.

Islands hit as 270 containers fall off shipA big clean-up starts on five Dutch islands after a storm sweeps cargo into the sea.,"This video can not be played Footage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe. Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm. As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers. The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west. Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches. But officials said three containers carried toxic substances, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them. One of those containers had a cargo of peroxide powder, and a 25kg bag of the chemical was found on the island of Schiermonnikoog on Thursday, along with several containers and their contents. The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. The Dutch coastguard searched for containers near the islands on Thursday As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship as it made its way through the Wadden Sea from the Belgian port of Antwerp. Waves of up to 10m (33ft) in height were reported on the night and images from the Dutch coastguard showed dozens of containers balanced precariously like dominoes on the deck, about to fall into the sea. By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and Dutch and German coastguard planes scoured the sea for the others. There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-basedMSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment,externalto help retrieve the missing containers. Overnight into Thursday, the MSC Zoe docked at Bremerhaven. Several containers were spotted in German waters and a further 11 were seen by the Dutch coastguard floating between the islands of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. Funeral urns wash up on Dutch beaches Cigarettes removed from container on English coast MSC Napoli hero recalls dramatic rescue By Thursday five Dutch islands in the Wadden Sea had seen debris from the MSC Zoe wash up on its beaches. On Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog volunteers were helping on Thursday to clear up the mess spilt the previous day. Around 100 soldiers were being sent to the islands part of the clean-up operation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In an interview with the Detroit Free Press,external, Ms Tlaib, 42, said she would be using the Koran owned by America's third president, but she later told the paper that she had instead decided to use a family Koran.

Ms Tlaib laughs as one of her children breaks into dabbing, a type of dance move, after she casts a vote for Speaker Pelosi ""It's important to me because a lot of Americans have this kind of feeling that Islam is somehow foreign to American history,"" she said.

Can you break up with your phone?,"There is a growing sense of unease among many smartphone owners about the amount of time we're spending on our devices. Google told me that around 70% of the Android users it spoke to wanted to ""find a better balance"" in their tech use. But this puts the tech sector in an awkward spot. How can it help its customers detach from their phones when, for many firms, their business model relies on them doing the opposite? Both Apple and Google have this year released digital tools - called Screen Time and Digital Wellbeing respectively - which let iPhone and  Android users see how much time they are spending on various apps and how often they pick up their devices. This video can not be played WATCH: Are Rory and Lily addicted to their phones? Many Android users will not have it yet as it is part of the Android Pie operating system, which has only been released by a handful of phone brands so far. For those who have seen it, the results can come as a bit of a shock. On my first day with Android's Digital Wellbeing tracker, I unlocked my phone 200 times and spent more than three hours on it. This was alongside working a long shift in the BBC newsroom and being a mum. I'm sure it wasn't all WhatsApp banter and Cats of Instagram but I was still horrified, to put it politely. How much screen time is 'too much'? Confessions of a smartphone addict Rose La Prairie is a London-based Google engineer who was on the team which developed the tool. She told me that the tech giant was well aware people might feel ""guilt or shame"" when confronted with the data for the first time, so designing the interface to be non-judgemental was crucial. Rose La Prairie developed the Android Digital Wellbeing dashboard ""Part of it was making sure we didn't do things like big red arrows or big green arrows, or trying to make a judgement, or an assessment, of what is good or bad,"" she said. ""When it comes down to it, when we talk to people, it very much depends on the individual, so what's good for me might not be good for someone else."" Ms La Prairie thinks that most people should be able to self-regulate by using the product. ""For some people seeing the data will be enough, it's that reminder of how you spend your time and what you do on your phone."" she said. ""There will be some people who will need a little extra reminder, and I put myself in that camp."" For those people, the dashboard can be set to mute notifications, make the phone display go black and white at a certain time (such as bedtime) and set an alert after a certain amount of screen time on an app. But it is not really in Google's interests for you to not be on your phone, is it? Unlike Apple's hardware-focused business model, Google is advertising-driven and that very much requires eyeballs on screens. ""I think what we really care about is making sure users have a good experience,"" Ms La Prairie says. ""People want to figure out how they use their devices in a different way and we really want to make sure we can help users with that."" It's worth noting that what she doesn't say is: ""Turn the phone off."" The mobile phone industry's response to the issue is, well, interesting. Some firms believe that they can wean us off our big screen smartphones with the help ofâ¦ smaller screen smartphones. Is a tiny phone the answer? Devices like the Nokia phone from HMD Global and the tiny Palm phone are marketed as companion devices - in Nokia's case with less functionality, in Palm's case just smaller - to give us a break from our main device. ""It's quite apparent that the industry still wants to keep selling phones,"" said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood. ""It is a little bit ironic that they are trying to sell you a little phone to do the same thing [as your big phone]."" Ultimately, Mr Wood believes it really comes down to willpower. ""You can have all the different types of gadgets but it's down to you as an individual how much you want to spend time on your phone,"" he said. Catherine Price wrote the book How To Break Up With Your Phone after having a baby and realising one day that the baby was watching her and she was watching her mobile. Catherine Price says she is happier using her phone less ""I realised I didn't want that to be her impression of a human relationship, but I also didn't want it to be the way that I was living my own life,"" she said. ""Breaking up with your phone does not mean dumping your phone or throwing it under a bus, it just means taking a step back to create a relationship that is actually good for you. It's becoming friends with your phone."" In her book, Ms Price lists a 30-day plan to reclaim this ""friendship"". Her top tips include: Turn off all the notifications you can bear to. Just leave the ones you actually want; for me that is phone calls and text messages because they are real people trying to contact me, in particular, in real time - plus my calendar and maps rearrange your home screen so that it only contains apps that have a practical purpose that are not tempting. Your home screen should not have email, or social media, or the news or a dating app, or games. Put them into a folder on an interior page so you can't see their icons, you have to actively open them Get your phone out of your bedroom. You will need to have something on your bedside table that takes the place of the phoneâ¦ like a book. When you go to reach for that phone you will encounter the book instead Get a standalone alarm clock. If your phone is your alarm clock you are guaranteeing that your phone will be the first thing you interact with in the morning There is a plug-in called Facebook Demetricator, which stops you seeing you how many times your post has been ""liked"". You still may go back to see that people have liked your post, but you're not going to be checking compulsively to see when 17 gets to 20 and 25 gets to 30 - it can help break that habit. As for me - well, I've got over the shock of seeing how often I reach for my phone. But have I changed? I still find myself on my device, having picked it up to, say, check the weather forecast, only to suddenly find myself on social media 10 minutes later, still with no idea about whether or not I need an umbrella. That said, I do genuinely use my handset a lot for work, to navigate my way around, and to keep up with the endless communications from my children's school. I tell Ms La Prairie I'd like to be able to differentiate between time well-spent on my smartphone and time wasted. Apparently I'm not the only one. ""The way we think about use is intentional and unintentional, and people really care about the unintentional because it makes you feel guilty,"" she tells me. ""A great version would be how to we crack that nut, and distinguish between intentional and unintentional."" So is 2019 going to be the year we break up with our phones? Analyst Mr Wood isn't convinced. ""For me, 2019 is the year when people are going to be more aware of the amount of time they are spending on their phones,"" he said. ""But breaking up with their phones? That's a very big ask."" Confessions of a smartphone addict Android Pie launches with greyscale mode How much screen time is 'too much'?
