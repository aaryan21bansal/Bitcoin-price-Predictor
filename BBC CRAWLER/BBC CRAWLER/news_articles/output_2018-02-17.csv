Emergency services were called to the Barns Green crossing in Emms Lane, Horsham, West Sussex, at 08:47 GMT. The 72-year-old man was driving the car and his 15-year-old grandson was the passenger. No-one on the train was injured. British Transport Police (BTP) said their family was being supported by specialist officers. Det Insp Brett Walker said: ""This is an extremely tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. ""Our officers have been working at the scene, and will continue to do so for the rest of the day, to ensure we gain as much information about how the collision happened."" Passengers said the train ""stopped suddenly"" and ""people started screaming"" Southern said rail services would be affected for the rest of the day, with buses replacing trains between Horsham and Pulborough. BTP officers, who worked alongside Sussex Police, said the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Paramedics said they walked through the train after the collision to check on passengers and ensure no-one was injured. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed. Emergency services will be at the scene for the rest of the day Many of the train passengers were taken to the nearby Sumners Ponds campsite, where they were given hot drinks. Two of them, Sinitta and Beverley, told BBC Sussex there had been a fire after the crash. ""The train stopped suddenly and then people started screaming,"" they said. ""Then we saw the fire so we moved up the train, and they evacuated the train."" Sumners Ponds staff put a message on the local village Facebook page, appealing for people to give the passengers lifts to Horsham station.

Florida survivors demand gun control,"This video can not be played Student Emma Gonzalez to lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" Young survivors of Wednesday's school shooting in Florida have taken part in an emotionally charged rally demanding tighter gun controls. Protesters in Fort Lauderdale chanted ""shame on you"", referring to US lawmakers and President Donald Trump. He said last year he would ""never"" infringe on the right to keep arms. Suspect Nikolas Cruz has admitted carrying out the attack at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, in which 17 people died. It was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 and has re-ignited long-running debates about tougher firearm restrictions. In his first public comments on the gun control issue since the attack, Mr Trump blamed the Democrats for not passing legislation when they controlled Congress during the early years of Barack Obama's administration. Who are the victims? A school shooting comes to 'paradise' Students and their parents - as well as politicians - took part in the event in Fort Lauderdale, close to Parkland. Thousands of people attended, according to the Associated Press. Arguably the most memorable moment came when high school student Emma Gonzalez took to the podium and attacked the US president and other politicians for accepting political donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), a powerful gun rights lobby group. Some young protesters cried as they demanded more restrictions on gun ownership ""If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,"" said Ms Gonzalez. ""It doesn't matter because I already know. Thirty million dollars,"" the 18-year-old said, referring to donations during Mr Trump's presidential campaign. ""To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA - shame on you!"" said Ms Gonzalez, who took cover on the floor of her secondary school's auditorium during the attack. Responding to her passionate speech, the crowds started chanting ""Shame on you!"" According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA spent $11.4m (Â£8.1m) supporting Mr Trump in the 2016 campaign, and $19.7m opposing Hillary Clinton. Wednesday's attack was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 Ryan Deitsch, who was among those hiding in a school toilet during the attack, urged lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures on gun ownership. ""The least lawmakers can do is vote on something. What's the worst that can happen?"" the 18-year-old said. Protesters also held placards that read ""No more guns!"" and ""Enough!"" ""Because of these gun laws, people I love have died,"" said Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old student. ""Where's the common sense in that? People are dying every day."" Florida shooting: A survivor's story Trump reassures US gun owners In a tweet late on Saturday, the Republican president accused the Democrats,externalof not acting on gun legislation ""when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. ""Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!"" he wrote, referring to criticism from Democrats following Wednesday's shooting. Mr Trump - who on Friday met survivors of the attack - earlier blamed the shooter's mental health. The president's views on gun control have shifted over time.In recent years, he has pledged to fiercely defend the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects people's right to keep and bear arms. Last year, he told an NRA convention he would ""never, ever infringe"" on that right.""The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,"" he said. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said in the past about guns and gun control? Saturday's rally coincided with a gun show in Florida. Hundreds of people attended the event at the Dade County fairgrounds, despite calls to cancel it. ""I don't believe that any law that they would have added would have deterred what happened,"" former law enforcement officer Joe Arrington was quoted as saying by Reuters. How Trump turned against gun control Five reasons US gun control won't happen ""I think a lot of agencies didn't do their job necessarily like they were supposed to."" Mr Cruz, 19, is a former student at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was reportedly investigated by local police and the Department of Children and Family Services in 2016 after posting evidence of self-harm on the Snapchat app, according to the latest US media reports. A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' Tales of heroism from Florida attack Child services said he had planned to buy a gun, but authorities determined he was already receiving adequate support, the reports say. The reports come afterthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) admitted it did not properly follow up on a tip-off about Mr Cruz last month. The 5 January tip was not the only information the FBI received. In September, a Mississippi man reported to the law enforcement agency a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video under Mr Cruz's name. Florida Governor Rick Scott called for FBI director Christopher Wray to resign over the failures to act. 'Shame on you' - Florida students chant.

Rare cello returned after knifepoint theft,"OphÃ©lie Gaillard, who is an award-winning cellist, had the valuable instrument on loan An 18th-Century cello has been returned to a French musician after an appeal following her knifepoint robbery. OphÃ©lie Gaillard was robbed of the instrument and her mobile phone outside her home in Paris on Thursday. After putting an appeal on Facebook, she received an anonymous call saying it was in a car outside her home. She found a window smashed but the instrument in ""good condition"". The rare instrument is worth about â¬1.3m ($1.6m; Â£1.2m) Made in 1737 by Italian instrument-maker Francesco Goffriller, it was loaned to Ms Gaillard from CrÃ©dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC) bank. The instrument was stolen in its case, along with a bow that was itself almost 200 years old. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Her original post was shared almost 10,000 times in just two days. Confirming the instrument's return on Facebook, Ms Gaillard thanked everyone who helped with the appeal, and called its return an ""incredible dream"".

Murdered MP's widower quits charitiesBrendan Cox leaves two charities he founded in his wife's memory following sexual assault claims.2m3 minutes agoUK,"The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, Brendan Cox, has quit two charities he set up in her memory after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. He has left posts at More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation a week after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished the claims. Mr Cox apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" caused by his past behaviour. In a statement issued on Saturday, he said: ""While I do not accept the allegations contained in the 2015 complaint to the police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I do acknowledge and understand that during my time at Save the Children I made mistakes."" Save the Children have said the complaints against Mr Cox were investigated in accordance with its procedures. The charity confirmed that Brendan Cox was suspended and a disciplinary process begun but that he resigned before it was completed. The charity also announced that its chief executive Kevin Watkins has ordered a review to establish ""whether the system for dealing with complaints about behaviour in the workplace can be further improved"". Jo Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater said the family would ""support Brendan as he endeavours to do the right thing by admitting mistakes he may have made in the past"". She added that ""Brendan is a wonderful father and I have no doubt about the happiness he brought to Jo."" Mr Cox, who married Jo Cox in 2009, was reported to police in Massachusetts in the US in 2015 for ""inappropriate touching"" while on a trip to Harvard - a claim which he denies. The father-of-two said some of the allegations against him were a ""massive exaggeration"", but conceded that he had at times ""overstepped the line"". In 2015 the Mail on Sunday,externalreported that Brendan Cox had stepped down from his position as chief strategist at Save the Children over allegations of ""inappropriate behaviour"" which he at the time denied. More details of Mr Cox's alleged behaviour emerged after Oxfam issued its own apologyover a sex scandal involving aid workers in Haiti. Labour MP Mrs Cox wasfatally shot and stabbed outside her constituency officein West Yorkshire by a far-right extremist during the EU Referendum campaign in 2016. Mr Cox said it had become ""much more difficult"" to focus on the two charities he set up after his wife's death, the community group More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation. ""For that reason, while away over half term, I decided to step down from my current public roles for the time being,"" he said. Labour MP Jo Cox died after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency He added: ""In the past I have focused on disputing what I felt was untrue in the allegations, but I realise now that it's more important to take full responsibility for what I have done."" A spokesperson for the Jo Cox Foundation said the charity ""admired"" Mr Cox's contribution as a trustee. ""The trustees and staff have admired the integrity, commitment and dedication that Brendan has shown in our work to create a positive legacy for Jo,"" they said. Speaking on the Peston on Sunday programme Labour MP and friend of Mr Cox, Jess Phillips, said he was right to step down from his positions at the charities. She said that men were ""going to have to address their behaviour"" but added she didn't like the idea that ""we switch off our feelings about people."" ""I love Brendan. He is my friend. His family are friends with my family. ""It's not enough to just say you're sorry, you have to show the way you are going to change in the future. ""And I think Brendan, more so than many I've seen in this area, is actually trying to do that.""

Arrest made over Grace Mugabe PhD award,"Authorities did not say whether Mrs Mugabe herself will face charges The vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe has been arrested in connection with an investigation into the awarding of a doctorate to former first lady Grace Mugabe. Levi Nyagura was detained by the country's anti-corruption agency, to be charged with abuse of office. Mrs Mugabe was awarded a PhD just months after enrolling in 2014, despite it usually taking years to complete. An investigation was launched after a petition was made by university staff. Members of the sociology department said they had not seen supporting evidence, and called for the nullification of her qualification and a full investigation. The polarising Grace Mugabe The PhD's authenticity was questioned because her thesis was not published alongside others at the time. The document was only published online in January this year, four years after she graduated, and has been the subject of intense speculation since. She was awarded the qualification by her husband and then-President Robert Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the university at the time. The doctorate title was used on campaign material for Mrs Mugabe as she became increasingly involved in politics. In November Robert Mugabe was ousted from office after 37 years of rule amid growing speculation his wife was lining herself up to replace her aging husband in power.

Russia FBI charges 'blather' - Lavrov,"This video can not be played The Russian foreign minister called for ""facts"" before commenting further Russia's foreign minister has dismissed as ""blather"" the charges levelled by the FBI special counsel against 13 Russians for election meddling. Sergei Lavrov said at a major security conference in Germany he would not comment further until he saw ""facts"". The charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller are seen as a major development in his continuing probe into the US 2016 election. President Trump has said the indictment shows his campaign did ""nothing wrong"". The Russian foreign minister was being questioned by participants at the Munich Security Conference. Asked about the charges, he said that even Vice-President Mike Pence had called the investigation into question. ""So until we see the facts, everything else is just blather."" But Mr Trump's National Security Adviser, H R McMaster, said evidence of Russian meddling was ""now incontrovertible"". It would become harder to conceal attempts to ""interfere in our democratic process"", he added. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump has repeated his assertion that there was ""no collusion"" between his campaign and Russia. On Saturday, he quoted remarks by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who said that no American had knowingly participated in the Russians' activities. Allow Twitter content?

However, Mr Rosenstein's comments only refer to the indictment which was published on Friday. Seven key takeaways from the indictments The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Full text of the Russia indictment The 37-page indictment says a group of Russians: Posed as Americans, and opened financial accounts in their name; some visited the US Spent thousands of dollars a month buying political advertising Purchased US server space in an effort to hide their Russian affiliation Organised and promoted political rallies within the United States Posted political messages on social media accounts that impersonated real US citizens Promoted information that disparaged Hillary Clinton Received money from clients to post on US social media sites Created themed groups on social media on hot-button issues, particularly on Facebook and Instagram Operated with a monthly budget of as much as $1.25m (Â£890,000) Financed the building of a cage large enough to hold an actress portraying Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform The indictment says those involved systematically monitored the success of their internet posts. All of the 13 people named were charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Three have also been accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five have been accused of aggravated identity theft. Three companies have also been charged. The tactics of the Russian 'troll farm' Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? This video can not be played Russians recruited 'real Americans' as part of 'information warfare' ""By 2016, defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online persons to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election,""the indictment says,external. ""They engaged in operations primarily to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump."" One of the companies targeted is the Internet Research Agency, based in St Petersburg, which the indictment said ""had a strategic goal to sow discord in the US political system, including the 2016 US presidential election"". One of the people named in the indictment -Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is known as ""Putin's chef"", denied election tampering. Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef"", has denied election tampering ""The Americans are very impressionable people, they see what they want to see...,"" he was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti on Friday. ""I'm not at all upset that I'm on this list. If they want to see the devil, let them see him."" Mr Prigozhin has been a friend of Mr Putin since the 1990s. He has built up a business empire and has been accused of using companies to diffuse pro-Kremlin opinions via fake internet identities. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Friday, Robert Mueller's team released a slate of indictments that lays bare what it asserts is the full shape of the Russian meddling apparatus. And what an apparatus it was. In the run-up to the US presidential election ""Project Lakhta"", as it was called, had an operating budget of more than $1m a month. The indictment does not suggest collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, however, and the White House may breathe a sigh of relief at this. But the heat is increasing, and the investigation isn't over yet. At the very least, if Mr Mueller's allegations hold up in court, it will become increasingly difficult for the president to argue that Russian meddling on his behalf is an unsubstantiated hoax. Read Anthony's key takeaways Politicians from both major parties have responded with calls for social media to do more to prevent political interference via their platforms. Facebook said in a statement that it had worked ""proactively"" with Mr Mueller's investigation,external, but had ""more to do to prevent further attacks"". Twitter said the activities were ""intolerable"" and that it was working with investigators, but that tech companies could not defeat the new threat alone. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the 2016 presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. In May last year, Mr Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation As part of the inquiry, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort has been charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine, conspiracy to launder money and more recently with submitting false information to obtain a mortgage. A business associate of Mr Manafort's, Rick Gates, was also charged with conspiracy to launder money. A third adviser to the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. In December, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to making false statements about a meeting he had with the Russian ambassador in 2016. This week President Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was interviewed by Mr Mueller. Mr Trump has been accused by opponents of trying to interfere with the investigation, which he denies.

Oxfam chief: 'Attacks out of proportion',"The Oxfam Charity""s CEO Mark Goldring (l) and Chair Caroline Thomson (r) leave the Department for International Development Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, has said the scale and intensity of the criticism against his organisation in the wake of claims its workers used prostitutes in Haiti is out of proportion to its level of culpability. He told the Guardian newspaper,external: ""The intensity and the ferocity of the attack makes you wonder, what did we do? ""We murdered babies in their cots?"" Mr Goldring also suggested that critics are motivated by an anti-aid agenda. The charity boss said that ""anything we say is being manipulated... even apologies only make matters worse."" Oxfam aid worker tells of sex assault Oxfam chief promises justice for victims How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? He acknowledged Oxfam could have acted faster but said ""what I felt really clearly is many people haven't wanted to listen to explanations"". Earlier this month, news reports said that during a humanitarian mission in Haiti in 2011, the charity's country director hired prostitutes at a villa paid for by Oxfam. The charity faced more criticism when it emerged that it had not shared details of the allegations with the Haitian government. Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in today's Guardian in which it says sorry to the people of Haiti and the charity's supporters. The ad, paid for by supporters rather than the charity, also sets out the actions the organisation plans to take, including tripling Oxfam's safeguarding capacity and establishing a review into improving its culture. The charity apologises in a full-page advertisement in the Guardian newspaper Another charity - MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) - has now come under question as the president of Haiti called for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country. Jovenel Moise, asked why the medical charity MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members. He told the Reuters news agency:  ""The Oxfam case is the visible part of the iceberg, ""It is not only Oxfam, there are other NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the same situation, but they hide the information internally."" MSF said it took reports of staff misconduct seriously and was seeking to clarify questions raised by the president. Oxfam has agreed to stop bidding for UK government funding until it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the charity had ""a long way to go"" before regaining the trust of the public, its staff and the people it aims to help. The charity, which had a total income of Â£409m last year, received Â£31.7m from the government in 2016, accounting for about 8% of the charity's income. The amount also represents about a quarter of a percent of the government's annual foreign aid spending. Oxfam is setting up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff. Other planned reforms include new funding for safeguarding measures and a crackdown on references issued to former staff. Do you have any information related to this story that you wish to share?

Zainab's killer gets four death sentences,"Zainab's rape and murder sparked outrage in Pakistan A court in Pakistan has given a 24-year-old man, Imran Ali, four death sentences for raping and murdering a six-year old girl last month. Zainab Ansari's body was found in a rubbish dump in the city of Kasur, south of Lahore, on 9 January. Her murder triggered outrage across the country, includingriots against alleged police incompetence in which two protesters died. The victim's father was in court to hear the verdict, amid heavy security. Zainab's killer has also been linked by police and the chief minister of Punjab province to the murders and assaults of other girls in the area. Ali's alleged crimes stretch back at least a year and angry residents say authorities should have been quicker to identify him as the perpetrator. Ali will be tried over the rest of the cases later, government prosecutor Ehtisham Qadir Shah told Reuters news agency. The city haunted by a spate of child killings Murdered girl's father 'has no words' Social media calls for #JusticeForZainab Dozens of witnesses testified against Ali in the trial, where forensic evidence including DNA and polygraph tests was also presented. Imran Ali, shown in a police handout image, confessed to killing Zainab Ansari It was family members - not police - who recovered CCTV footage showing Zainab being led away Ali has also been linked to other crimes against young girls His lawyer had withdrawn from the case after Ali confessed, reports say. Ali was handed death sentences for kidnapping, rape, murder and an act of terrorism, a life sentence for sodomy and a large fine. He now has a 15-day window in which he may appeal against the verdict. The news of his sentencing sparked strong reactions on social media, including by Hamza Ali Abbasi, a Pakistani actor, model and director. Allow Twitter content?

Other Twitter users suggested there could be a wider network of criminals behind the spate of child killings, and have called for investigations to continue before Ali is executed. Police have been under huge pressure to find who killed Zainab and the other children. Zainab's family say the police did not take action during the five days from when she was reported missing and her body was found. Relatives recovered CCTV footage of her last movements. The video, which showed a girl being led away by a man, was circulated widely on social media. Ali, who lived near Zainab, was arrested by police on 23 January.

Hidden painting behind Picasso masterpiece,"The new x-ray fluorescence instrument could lead to a big increase in the number of paintings investigated Researchers in the US have used a new scanning technique to discover a painting underneath one of Pablo Picasso's great works of art, the Crouching Woman (La Misereuse Accroupie). Underneath the oil painting is a landscape of Barcelona which, it turns out, Picasso used as the basis of his masterpiece. The new x-ray fluorescence system is cheaper than alternative art scanning systems - and it is portable, making it available to any gallery that wants it. Details were revealed at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement for Science in Austin, Texas. The Crouching Woman is a painting from Picasso's blue period. This video can not be played How the figure of the crouching woman takes on the landscape painting beneath. What is remarkable is that the landscape painting beneath - probably by a student artist - is turned 90 degrees. The outline of the hills in the background becomes the crouching woman's back. She takes on the shape and form of the Catalan countryside. Kenneth Brummel, a curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, said that he was ""excited"" when he first learned what lay underneath the Crouching Woman. ""It helps to date the painting and it also helps to determine where the painting was made,"" he told BBC News. ""But it also gives a sense of the artists with whom the painter was engaging. And these insights help us ask new, more interesting and scientifically more accurate questions regarding an artist, their process and how they arrived at the forms that we see on the surface of a painting."" Hidden portrait 'found under Mona Lisa' Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed at hi-tech laboratory X-ray reveals hidden Goya painting Picasso is known to have painted over a number of his blue period paintings and Mr Brummel said he was pleased to see that the Crouching Woman was like these other works. Francesca Casadio, from the Centre for Scientific Studies in the Arts in Chicago, who is among those leading the project, hopes that the widespread use of the scanners will increase our understanding of artists, their thought processes and the way they worked. ""Many more paintings are waiting to tell their secrets and with our scanning system we can help them talk to us more,"" she told BBC News. Until now scanning was only for the greatest of great works of art - and for the wealthiest galleries. This new system can be used by anyone to find the story behind any painting they are interested in.

"Man completes 20,000-mile pub adventure","Ben Coombs drove across three continents to complete the challenge A man has driven a sports car across 21 countries, starting at the most northerly pub in the world and finishing at the most southerly. Ben Coombs, 38, from Plymouth in Devon, drove 20,000 miles across three continents from the Arctic Circle to the southernmost tip of Chile. It took him seven months to complete the challenge. Mr Coombs described the final pub as ""a dive"", but said ""it's the journey that matters, not the destination"". The idea for the adventure,externalcame while he was having a pint in a pub on Dartmoor. The trip was completed in a green TVR sports car called Kermit The journey started on the Norwegian island of Svalbard in an abandoned mining settlement called Pyramiden, which has a population of four. Mr Coombs said finding the northernmost bar ""was an easy investigative process"". ""Pyramiden is less than 700 miles from the North Pole, is the northernmost settlement on earth with a permanent civilian population, and has only one bar,"" he added. ""The residents all live in the only building still functioning - the town's old hotel - which happens to have a still-functioning bar."" The most northerly pub in the world in Pyramiden To find the most northerly and southerly pub, Mr Coombs looked for licensed premises where anybody could walk in off the street and buy a beer. Although there are bars in Antarctica they are located on bases and are not accessible to members of the public or are not licensed, he said. So Mr Coombs looked for the southernmost settlement outside Antarctica, and came across Puerto Williams in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. In Arizona, Ben Coombs' car Kermit came face-to-face with a replica Herbie, a 1963 VW Beetle The journey involved 20,000 miles of driving and a range of road surfaces From Pyramiden, Mr Coombs drove his green 20-year-old TVR Chimaera, called Kermit, across Europe to Southampton from where the car was shipped to New York in August. He then travelled across the United States to California, before heading south to Mexico. The car had a new clutch fitted in a garage in Nicaragua, the only major repair of the trip A number of friends joined him for various stages of the journey in the two-seater convertible car. ""Central America quickly passed beneath our wheels, before we shipped the car around the Darien gap from Panama to Colombia,"" Mr Coombs said. ""Then it was just the small matter of an 8,000-mile drive across Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina to get to the last bar on earth."" Some of the main challenges were getting across borders and avoiding rock falls in Colombia The hand-built car dealt well with the journey and will now be shipped back to Devon The final destination was Puerto Williams, where Mr Coombs arrived on 12 February and found the southernmost bar. ""It's a bit of a dive actually,"" he said. ""We're talking plastic patio furniture inside, Chilean line dancing on the TV, and a menu which consists only of lager and cheap whisky. ""There are probably more appealing places to travel 20,000 miles to get to, but that's not really the point. It's the journey that matters, not the destination.""

A gold and two bronze medals for Great Britain on day eight in Pyeongchang. We'll be back tomorrow to see if there's more - keep an eye on theWinter Olympics homepagefor all the reaction from today, and highlights will keep on playing at the top of this page. Until tomorrow. More from skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I love pressure, I enjoy it. It is a privilege. The second run yesterday I was just trying to get down so I could come out today. ""I'm just so relieved that me and Laura are on the podium together. If women in sport are pushing the platform for success then it's a good thing for everybody."" When asked what else there was to do in the sport? She replied:""I don't know. Now, I just want to take a nap!"" Skeleton Skeleton bronze medallist Laura Deas speaking to BBC Sport:""I just can't believe it's happening. It's like a dream. I thought it would be snatched away at the last minute. I'm so pleased for Lizzy [Yarnold] too. ""It was a nice position to be in - chasing the pack going into today. I always knew consistency would win. ""I almost couldn't feel my legs because I was so nervous. I didn't think I'd done enough. The further Janine Flock came down the track, I thought 'oh, maybe'. ""I think I have done myself proud. I always knew four consistent runs would put me in a strong position so I just wanted to do that from the start."" Great Britain's women curlers are currently joint-fourth in their round-robin group. The top four advance to the semi-finals. There's still four matches remaining for the Brits. Skeleton: Women's final - reaction Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV No other female has tried to retain this title and one of the reasons is because it is so hard! To have the mental grit to come back and say, 'I don't care about all that, I am going to come back and show you what I can do.' Skeleton Skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I'm overwhelmed and exhausted. I don't really
know how it happened. ""After the first run I wasn't sure whether I was going to be able to finish
the race because my chest infection was so bad I was struggling to breathe and I
got here only with the help of my team. ""My physio just gave me a talking to before run two (on Saturday) and
reminded me that I can do it and we can do it together. ""I guess four years ago, three years ago, the whole team all dared to dream
that this was possible and I just went with all them and we managed it."" Skeleton: Women's final Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV What does she do? I'm sure if Lizzy Yarnold decides she's achieved everything she can, she will find something else to do and succeed at that. Of all the runs, that last one was her best. She just went out and did her stuff. Yarnold and Deas win skeleton medals Nick HopeBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It
is near unbelievable what has been achieved by the British sliders today! Yarnold
has been so far off her best for the last two years that it looked as though we
would never see her dominate a World Cup event, let alone an Olympics. Her
turnaround in form has been STUNNING! Deas
too worked so hard for this medal. The look on her face before the final Janine
Flock set off said it all - she thought she had lost it and was resigned to
fourth. What
a moment for the sport and Great Britain. The nationâs best-ever day at a Winter Olympics with three
medals and the first time GB have ever had two athletes share a podium at a
Winter Olympics. Love this. Ski jumping There's been a gold for Poland -Kamil Stoch'sfinal jump of 136.5 meters was enough to see him retain his Olympic title. Germany'sAndreas Wellinger, who won normal hill gold last week, settled for silver, while Norway'sRobert Johanssonclaimed bronze. OAR 4-0 USA Caroline ChapmanBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It's all over at the Gangneung ice hockey arena. The OAR earn a 4-0 win over the USA. The non-Russian Russians top their group going into the play-off qualifications with two wins from three matches. Gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, speaking to BBC Sport:âIt means so much to me. âAt times over the last four years itâs been so hard and
Iâve doubted myself and wondered whether I could get back to where I wanted to
be but the team never lost faith and thatâs why Iâm back here today on the
podium. âHonestly after the last few
years the aim was to get here to the Olympics, I wasnât thinking about the
medals - but to achieve that is the stuff of dreams, as is sharing the podium with
Laura whoâs been amazing.â Here's how GB's total Winter Olympics tally looks at the minute. ... and finally the Brits claimed two medals at the same time, as Lizzy Yarnold won gold and Laura Deas took skeleton bronze. ... then along came Izzy Atkin in the women's slopestyle... British medal number one came on Friday, thanks to Dom Parsons in the skeleton... Winners are grinners. #bbcolympics Lee Fergusson:What a fantastic day for Team GB! Three medals! It really is a Super Saturday. Noname: A fantastic medal haul for our skeleton team. 
Gold for Lizzie and Bronze for Laura.

Breaking|Breaking newsUKIP members vote to sack leader BoltonUKIP members vote to sack party leader Henry Bolton after controversy over racist messages sent by his partner3m3 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Outgoing chairman Paul Oakden reads the result of the vote UKIP members have voted to sack leader Henry Bolton after controversy over racist messages sent by his partner. The former army officer's fate was decided after 63% voted to back a no confidence motion at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in Birmingham. He had faced calls to quit after it emerged his partner Jo Marney sent racist messages about Meghan Markle. Gerard Batten will take over as interim leader and there will be a leadership election within 90 days. UKIP delayed MPs libel case settlement Bolton defends Jo Marney relationship UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Profile: Henry Bolton Following the vote, Mr Bolton, who had been in the job for less than five months, said he feared the result would see UKIP ""taken off the battlefield"" of British politics for months. He said: ""I think it's going to be difficult to unite the party, what we have effectively had is a rejection of a new draft constitution, a reorganisation and indeed a new way of doing politics."" Mr Bolton again said he had ""strong affections"" for his former girlfriend, who he said sent him a good luck text message before the meeting. Asked if he was going to get back together with Ms Marney, he said: ""I have said all along that once we got the EGM out of the way I would spend time sorting out my private life."" Henry Bolton was leader less than five months He was elected in September in the wake of UKIP's disastrous performance in last year's general election. The party's national executive committee expressed no confidence in him last month, triggering the ballot. He lost the no confidence motion by 867 votes to 500. Outgoing chairman Paul Oakden said: ""Henry Bolton has been removed by the democratic decision of the membership."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Bolton was the party's fourth leader in 18 months. He had replaced Paul Nuttall, who quit after the general election - which saw UKIP's vote share shrink to 1.8% from 12.6% in 2015. When Henry Bolton was elected just five months ago, many in UKIP had hoped he'd be the unifying force the party needed, bringing its focus back to Brexit. But like his two predecessors, his tenure was short lived, and now UKIP is once again seeking leadership and direction. The party's most senior figures are optimistic that they can find a strong leader who will rally the members and give UKIP a voice in the Brexit debate. But among some activists who attended the emergency meeting there was frustration, even anger, at the continued turmoil at the top. Some fear another divisive contest - not least because of the financial implications for the cash-strapped party. UKIP might survive - most think it will - but for now some don't see how it can regain its place on the political playing field as the influential force it once was. Mr Batten, London MEP, said UKIP's membership had made the right decision to sack Mr Bolton. The interim leader said: ""I believe that you have made the best decision that you could in the circumstances."" Mr Bolton said he was considering legal action as a result of the way the process to get rid of him was handled, but Mr Batten responded by saying: ""Get on with the rest of your life."" Prior to the vote ex-leader Nigel Farage had backed Mr Bolton, saying  ""for all his faults"", removing him would hasten UKIP's path to ""irrelevance"". Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September.

Review: The Shape of Water âââââ,"Broadly speaking, humanity can be divided into two types: those who like the fantasy genre and those that do not. Your pulse either races when someone starts discussing the finer details of Game of Thrones / Lord of the Rings / The Dark Crystal - or you feel the blood draining from your body. Of course, there are exceptions that prove every rule. Which, in this case, comes in the teddy bear-like form of Guillermo del Toro. The Mexican director bridged the divide for millions of moviegoers in 2006 with Pan's Labyrinth, his exotic, fantastical take on the Spanish Civil War. Now, a little over a decade later, he is back to scoop up the stragglers (me included), the die-hard realists who head for the hills at the first sight of a pointy blue ear. Admittedly, the elevator pitch for his multi-Oscar nominated The Shape of Water is unlikely to grab those of us who can live without magical realism. The Shape of Water leads Oscars nominations The director who wouldn't be silenced Doug Jones as Amphibian Man with Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito It is a fantasy drama about a mute cleaner called Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who strikes up an improbable relationship with a mysterious amphibious creature (Doug Jones), which is being kept in a huge water tank at a top-secret government research facility in Baltimore, USA, where Elisa works. It is, del Toro says, an ""other-worldly fairy tale"" - words to strike dread into the soul of any anti-fantasist. I'll admit that when I sat down and watched the opening title sequence in which we see Elisa lying on a sofa being ethereally submerged by water, my heart sank faster than the furniture in her room. Guillermo del Torro directs Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones on the set of The Shape of Water But when I left the cinema 123 minutes later, I was elated. Not because the film was thankfully over, but because I had just been treated to an intelligent, tender, beautifully shot, meticulously crafted work of art. It's not really a fantasy at all. Michael Shannon plays Richard Strickland, while Michael Stuhlbarg stars as scientist Dr Robert Hoffstetler The incarcerated creature from the deep - which has been taken from its natural habitat as a specimen to be exploited by scientists with blood twice as cold as its own - is perfectly believable. As is the relationship Elisa strikes up with it. They have so much in common. Neither speaks, both have been persecuted; they are misunderstood fish out of water suffering at the hands of an arrogant, unsympathetic society that only respects ""winners"" who reflect its own hard-bitten, narrow-minded values. The film is set in early 1960s America, but speaks directly, and critically, to our own times. Giles (Richard Jenkins) enjoys a moment with his neighbour Elisa (Sally Hawkins) Sally Hawkins is very good as a traumatised, aphasic, single woman whose every action speaks volumes. She has created her own society of fellow misfits, which includes her musicals loving neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) whose homosexuality is despised by others and traditional skills as commercial artist, redundant in a world obsessed with shiny new ideas. Elisa's bete noir is the emotionally retarded, short-tempered government agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) who works at the high-security government laboratory she cleans every night with her pal Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) with Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) Strickland is the sort of man who'd pick a fight with a bowl of soup. He loathes just about everybody and everything, except violence, which he really likes. As the incarcerated amphibious creature- or the ""asset"" as it is officially known - discovers when the pent-up macho-man impales an electric cattle prod into its scaly abdomen. What unfolds is part love story, part monster movie, part heist-thriller, part film noir. Think Terry Gilliam meets the 1954 classic monster-horror flick Creature from the Black Lagoon (with a bit of French arthouse thrown in for good measure) and you won't be far off. Doug Jones as Amphibian Man with Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito It is an affecting and affectionate film, which cracks along at a decent pace. All the characters, apart from Strickland - who never gets beyond being a two-dimensional caricature representing intolerance and evil - develop into well drawn out individuals about whom you care, even old fish-face the mythical creature. The Shape of Water is well worth its 13 Oscar nominations. It won't win all 13 categories - that really would be a fantasy - but it has a very good chance of being best picture. Not quite for me though, as I'd give the Oscar to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and best director to del Toro.

"Review: The Shape of Water âââââAn ""other-worldly fairy tale"" - but will it have an Oscar-rich happy ending?16h16 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","Broadly speaking, humanity can be divided into two types: those who like the fantasy genre and those that do not. Your pulse either races when someone starts discussing the finer details of Game of Thrones / Lord of the Rings / The Dark Crystal - or you feel the blood draining from your body. Of course, there are exceptions that prove every rule. Which, in this case, comes in the teddy bear-like form of Guillermo del Toro. The Mexican director bridged the divide for millions of moviegoers in 2006 with Pan's Labyrinth, his exotic, fantastical take on the Spanish Civil War. Now, a little over a decade later, he is back to scoop up the stragglers (me included), the die-hard realists who head for the hills at the first sight of a pointy blue ear. Admittedly, the elevator pitch for his multi-Oscar nominated The Shape of Water is unlikely to grab those of us who can live without magical realism. The Shape of Water leads Oscars nominations The director who wouldn't be silenced Doug Jones as Amphibian Man with Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito It is a fantasy drama about a mute cleaner called Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who strikes up an improbable relationship with a mysterious amphibious creature (Doug Jones), which is being kept in a huge water tank at a top-secret government research facility in Baltimore, USA, where Elisa works. It is, del Toro says, an ""other-worldly fairy tale"" - words to strike dread into the soul of any anti-fantasist. I'll admit that when I sat down and watched the opening title sequence in which we see Elisa lying on a sofa being ethereally submerged by water, my heart sank faster than the furniture in her room. Guillermo del Torro directs Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones on the set of The Shape of Water But when I left the cinema 123 minutes later, I was elated. Not because the film was thankfully over, but because I had just been treated to an intelligent, tender, beautifully shot, meticulously crafted work of art. It's not really a fantasy at all. Michael Shannon plays Richard Strickland, while Michael Stuhlbarg stars as scientist Dr Robert Hoffstetler The incarcerated creature from the deep - which has been taken from its natural habitat as a specimen to be exploited by scientists with blood twice as cold as its own - is perfectly believable. As is the relationship Elisa strikes up with it. They have so much in common. Neither speaks, both have been persecuted; they are misunderstood fish out of water suffering at the hands of an arrogant, unsympathetic society that only respects ""winners"" who reflect its own hard-bitten, narrow-minded values. The film is set in early 1960s America, but speaks directly, and critically, to our own times. Giles (Richard Jenkins) enjoys a moment with his neighbour Elisa (Sally Hawkins) Sally Hawkins is very good as a traumatised, aphasic, single woman whose every action speaks volumes. She has created her own society of fellow misfits, which includes her musicals loving neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) whose homosexuality is despised by others and traditional skills as commercial artist, redundant in a world obsessed with shiny new ideas. Elisa's bete noir is the emotionally retarded, short-tempered government agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) who works at the high-security government laboratory she cleans every night with her pal Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) with Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) Strickland is the sort of man who'd pick a fight with a bowl of soup. He loathes just about everybody and everything, except violence, which he really likes. As the incarcerated amphibious creature- or the ""asset"" as it is officially known - discovers when the pent-up macho-man impales an electric cattle prod into its scaly abdomen. What unfolds is part love story, part monster movie, part heist-thriller, part film noir. Think Terry Gilliam meets the 1954 classic monster-horror flick Creature from the Black Lagoon (with a bit of French arthouse thrown in for good measure) and you won't be far off. Doug Jones as Amphibian Man with Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito It is an affecting and affectionate film, which cracks along at a decent pace. All the characters, apart from Strickland - who never gets beyond being a two-dimensional caricature representing intolerance and evil - develop into well drawn out individuals about whom you care, even old fish-face the mythical creature. The Shape of Water is well worth its 13 Oscar nominations. It won't win all 13 categories - that really would be a fantasy - but it has a very good chance of being best picture. Not quite for me though, as I'd give the Oscar to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and best director to del Toro.

UKIP leader faces make-or-break voteActivists will choose whether to back or sack Henry Bolton following criticism of his private life.2h2 hours agoUK Politics,"Henry Bolton (centre) arrives for the meeting which will decide his future Around 2,000 UKIP members are in Birmingham to vote on whether to back or sack party leader Henry Bolton. The meeting will decide the fate of the former army officer, who has been in the job for less than six months. He has faced calls to quit since it emerged his partner Jo Marney sent racist messages about Meghan Markle. But ex-leader Nigel Farage backed Mr Bolton, saying  ""for all his faults"", removing him would hasten UKIP's path to ""irrelevance"". Mr Farage has warned the party - which won 12.6% of the vote in the 2015 general election but has been in a tailspin ever since - was in danger of ""collapsing"" and it might be ""too late to save it"". Mr Bolton has come out fighting on the eve of the vote, saying he is the man to ""reform, professionalise and unite"" UKIP. UKIP delayed MPs libel case settlement Henry Bolton defends Jo Marney relationship UKIP leader Bolton: It's not all over But Paul Oakley, general secretary of UKIP, told the Today programme Mr Bolton had let the party down. ""I have no interest whatsoever in his personal life,"" he said. ""For me, it's the fact that he's done nothing as leader, he's not making the case for Brexit."" Mr Oakley said he was also concerned by the lack of campaigning ahead of May's local elections. ""We've done nothing. Henry will be out after the local elections if he isn't out today,"" he added.

Several senior figures, including former leader Lord Pearson, have called on party officials to prepare for the future by uniting behind MEP Gerard Batten as interim leader, should Mr Bolton lose the vote. UKIP members arriving in Birmingham The vote, to take place behind closed doors, will be preceded by speeches by Mr Bolton and a member of the party's national executive committee, which expressed no confidence in him last month, triggering the ballot. The chairman of the party,Paul Oakden, is to step down from his post after overseeing the vote.

A gold and two bronze medals for Great Britain on day eight in Pyeongchang. We'll be back tomorrow to see if there's more - keep an eye on theWinter Olympics homepagefor all the reaction from today, and highlights will keep on playing at the top of this page. Until tomorrow. More from skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I love pressure, I enjoy it. It is a privilege. The second run yesterday I was just trying to get down so I could come out today. ""I'm just so relieved that me and Laura are on the podium together. If women in sport are pushing the platform for success then it's a good thing for everybody."" When asked what else there was to do in the sport? She replied:""I don't know. Now, I just want to take a nap!"" Skeleton Skeleton bronze medallist Laura Deas speaking to BBC Sport:""I just can't believe it's happening. It's like a dream. I thought it would be snatched away at the last minute. I'm so pleased for Lizzy [Yarnold] too. ""It was a nice position to be in - chasing the pack going into today. I always knew consistency would win. ""I almost couldn't feel my legs because I was so nervous. I didn't think I'd done enough. The further Janine Flock came down the track, I thought 'oh, maybe'. ""I think I have done myself proud. I always knew four consistent runs would put me in a strong position so I just wanted to do that from the start."" Great Britain's women curlers are currently joint-fourth in their round-robin group. The top four advance to the semi-finals. There's still four matches remaining for the Brits. Skeleton: Women's final - reaction Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV No other female has tried to retain this title and one of the reasons is because it is so hard! To have the mental grit to come back and say, 'I don't care about all that, I am going to come back and show you what I can do.' Skeleton Skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I'm overwhelmed and exhausted. I don't really
know how it happened. ""After the first run I wasn't sure whether I was going to be able to finish
the race because my chest infection was so bad I was struggling to breathe and I
got here only with the help of my team. ""My physio just gave me a talking to before run two (on Saturday) and
reminded me that I can do it and we can do it together. ""I guess four years ago, three years ago, the whole team all dared to dream
that this was possible and I just went with all them and we managed it."" Skeleton: Women's final Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV What does she do? I'm sure if Lizzy Yarnold decides she's achieved everything she can, she will find something else to do and succeed at that. Of all the runs, that last one was her best. She just went out and did her stuff. Yarnold and Deas win skeleton medals Nick HopeBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It
is near unbelievable what has been achieved by the British sliders today! Yarnold
has been so far off her best for the last two years that it looked as though we
would never see her dominate a World Cup event, let alone an Olympics. Her
turnaround in form has been STUNNING! Deas
too worked so hard for this medal. The look on her face before the final Janine
Flock set off said it all - she thought she had lost it and was resigned to
fourth. What
a moment for the sport and Great Britain. The nationâs best-ever day at a Winter Olympics with three
medals and the first time GB have ever had two athletes share a podium at a
Winter Olympics. Love this. Ski jumping There's been a gold for Poland -Kamil Stoch'sfinal jump of 136.5 meters was enough to see him retain his Olympic title. Germany'sAndreas Wellinger, who won normal hill gold last week, settled for silver, while Norway'sRobert Johanssonclaimed bronze. OAR 4-0 USA Caroline ChapmanBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It's all over at the Gangneung ice hockey arena. The OAR earn a 4-0 win over the USA. The non-Russian Russians top their group going into the play-off qualifications with two wins from three matches. Gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, speaking to BBC Sport:âIt means so much to me. âAt times over the last four years itâs been so hard and
Iâve doubted myself and wondered whether I could get back to where I wanted to
be but the team never lost faith and thatâs why Iâm back here today on the
podium. âHonestly after the last few
years the aim was to get here to the Olympics, I wasnât thinking about the
medals - but to achieve that is the stuff of dreams, as is sharing the podium with
Laura whoâs been amazing.â Here's how GB's total Winter Olympics tally looks at the minute. ... and finally the Brits claimed two medals at the same time, as Lizzy Yarnold won gold and Laura Deas took skeleton bronze. ... then along came Izzy Atkin in the women's slopestyle... British medal number one came on Friday, thanks to Dom Parsons in the skeleton... Winners are grinners. #bbcolympics Lee Fergusson:What a fantastic day for Team GB! Three medals! It really is a Super Saturday. Noname: A fantastic medal haul for our skeleton team. 
Gold for Lizzie and Bronze for Laura.

Hidden painting behind Picasso masterpieceAn innovative scanning system is making it easier to find the hidden stories behind artworks.5h5 hours agoScience & Environment,"The new x-ray fluorescence instrument could lead to a big increase in the number of paintings investigated Researchers in the US have used a new scanning technique to discover a painting underneath one of Pablo Picasso's great works of art, the Crouching Woman (La Misereuse Accroupie). Underneath the oil painting is a landscape of Barcelona which, it turns out, Picasso used as the basis of his masterpiece. The new x-ray fluorescence system is cheaper than alternative art scanning systems - and it is portable, making it available to any gallery that wants it. Details were revealed at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement for Science in Austin, Texas. The Crouching Woman is a painting from Picasso's blue period. This video can not be played How the figure of the crouching woman takes on the landscape painting beneath. What is remarkable is that the landscape painting beneath - probably by a student artist - is turned 90 degrees. The outline of the hills in the background becomes the crouching woman's back. She takes on the shape and form of the Catalan countryside. Kenneth Brummel, a curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, said that he was ""excited"" when he first learned what lay underneath the Crouching Woman. ""It helps to date the painting and it also helps to determine where the painting was made,"" he told BBC News. ""But it also gives a sense of the artists with whom the painter was engaging. And these insights help us ask new, more interesting and scientifically more accurate questions regarding an artist, their process and how they arrived at the forms that we see on the surface of a painting."" Hidden portrait 'found under Mona Lisa' Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed at hi-tech laboratory X-ray reveals hidden Goya painting Picasso is known to have painted over a number of his blue period paintings and Mr Brummel said he was pleased to see that the Crouching Woman was like these other works. Francesca Casadio, from the Centre for Scientific Studies in the Arts in Chicago, who is among those leading the project, hopes that the widespread use of the scanners will increase our understanding of artists, their thought processes and the way they worked. ""Many more paintings are waiting to tell their secrets and with our scanning system we can help them talk to us more,"" she told BBC News. Until now scanning was only for the greatest of great works of art - and for the wealthiest galleries. This new system can be used by anyone to find the story behind any painting they are interested in.

Man and boy dead after car hit by train,"Emergency services were called to the scene just before 09:00 GMT A teenage boy and his grandfather have died after a car was struck by a train at a level crossing. Emergency services were called to the Barns Green crossing in Emms Lane, Horsham, West Sussex, at 08:47 GMT. The 72-year-old man was driving the car and his 15-year-old grandson was the passenger. No-one on the train was injured. British Transport Police (BTP) said their family was being supported by specialist officers. Det Insp Brett Walker said: ""This is an extremely tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. ""Our officers have been working at the scene, and will continue to do so for the rest of the day, to ensure we gain as much information about how the collision happened."" Passengers said the train ""stopped suddenly"" and ""people started screaming"" Southern said rail services would be affected for the rest of the day, with buses replacing trains between Horsham and Pulborough. BTP officers, who worked alongside Sussex Police, said the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Paramedics said they walked through the train after the collision to check on passengers and ensure no-one was injured. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed. Emergency services will be at the scene for the rest of the day Many of the train passengers were taken to the nearby Sumners Ponds campsite, where they were given hot drinks. Two of them, Sinitta and Beverley, told BBC Sussex there had been a fire after the crash. ""The train stopped suddenly and then people started screaming,"" they said. ""Then we saw the fire so we moved up the train, and they evacuated the train."" Sumners Ponds staff put a message on the local village Facebook page, appealing for people to give the passengers lifts to Horsham station. Campsite manager Matt Gale described seeing two trains at the level crossing as he arrived for work and a huge plume of smoke. He said the last of the train passengers left on coaches just after 11:00. He estimated they had looked after about 100 people.

May urges new EU security deal by 2019,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Those who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured"" Theresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU. New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit. Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly. This video can not be played Theresa May's response to Brexit 'extremely regrettable' remark. To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space. The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added. She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"". President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues."" Secure exit? How will Brexit affect UK security? Europol head fears loss of UK influence Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations. The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"". EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Merkel 'curious' about UK's Brexit aims UK reveals proposed EU security deal European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects. The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"". Mrs Merkel said she was ""curious not frustrated"" about the UK's approach In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders. The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed."" The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on."" Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security. Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work. ""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said. Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like.

Max Mosley accused of 'muzzling press'Lawyers of the former F1 boss have written to a number of newspapers demanding they erase stories about him.4h4 hours agoUK,"The former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley has been accused of trying to use data protection laws to ""gag the press for his own advantage"". Mr Mosley's lawyers have written to several newspapers, demanding they stop publishing details he considers not to be in the public interest. But Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun's associate editor, said Mr Mosley was ""using his considerable fortune to muzzle the press"". Mr Mosley called this ""nonsense"". A letter was sent to the Sun, the Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, warning them against publishing details of two subjects. They include Mr Mosley's relationship to the press regulator, Impress and the 2008 party that was at the heart ofhis privacy action,externalagainst the News of the World. ""People need to know that he is doing this because of a story about a sadomasochistic sex orgy in which he was personally involved,""  Mr Kavanagh told Radio 4's Today programme. ""He wants this erased from the record."" Max Mosley: I have no vendetta against press Center Parcs pulls Daily Mail ads over Tom Daley article In 2008, the High Court ruled the News of the World did breach Mr Mosley's privacy, awarding him Â£60,000 in damages. Mr Mosley admitted he had taken part in a sado-masochistic sex session with five prostitutes, but denied that it had a Nazi theme. He has since become a prominent privacy campaigner, funding the independent press regulator Impress through a family charity. Though officially-recognised, no UK national newspapers have signed up to it. Impress ""would not survive and could not operate without (Mr Mosley's) money"", Mr Kavanagh said. This was true - Mr Mosley said - but added: ""What I object to is them pretending that I control or influence Impress, which I don't"". Mr Mosley told the BBC that he believed it was due to his ties to Impress that he had been attacked by some newspapers  ""constantly referring to the News of the World story"" and by ""falsely saying that I'm paying for Impress whereas in fact, it's independent"". Writing for Press Gazette, he said newspapers were doing this""in an attempt to smear me and Impress by association,external"". ""The lawyers wrote a letter and you would expect the lawyers for the newspapers to write a letter back saying 'you're wrong, this is not the law',"" he told Today. ""In fact what happens is two full pages in the Daily Mail attacking me."" Responding to the letter, the Mail called it a ""chilling new attack on press freedom,external"". Impress have lobbied for Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act to be enacted. If implemented, it could see newspapers forced to pay legal costs in libel and privacy cases, even if they won, if they don't sign up to an officially-approved regulator. Mr Kavanagh said this would ""cripple the newspaper industry"".

UKIP leader faces make-or-break vote,"Henry Bolton (centre) arrives for the meeting which will decide his future Around 2,000 UKIP members are in Birmingham to vote on whether to back or sack party leader Henry Bolton. The meeting will decide the fate of the former army officer, who has been in the job for less than six months. He has faced calls to quit since it emerged his partner Jo Marney sent racist messages about Meghan Markle. But ex-leader Nigel Farage backed Mr Bolton, saying  ""for all his faults"", removing him would hasten UKIP's path to ""irrelevance"". Mr Farage has warned the party - which won 12.6% of the vote in the 2015 general election but has been in a tailspin ever since - was in danger of ""collapsing"" and it might be ""too late to save it"". Mr Bolton has come out fighting on the eve of the vote, saying he is the man to ""reform, professionalise and unite"" UKIP. UKIP delayed MPs libel case settlement Henry Bolton defends Jo Marney relationship UKIP leader Bolton: It's not all over But Paul Oakley, general secretary of UKIP, told the Today programme Mr Bolton had let the party down. ""I have no interest whatsoever in his personal life,"" he said. ""For me, it's the fact that he's done nothing as leader, he's not making the case for Brexit."" Mr Oakley said he was also concerned by the lack of campaigning ahead of May's local elections. ""We've done nothing. Henry will be out after the local elections if he isn't out today,"" he added.

More from skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I love pressure, I enjoy it. It is a privilege. The second run yesterday I was just trying to get down so I could come out today. ""I'm just so relieved that me and Laura are on the podium together.

Now, I just want to take a nap!"" Skeleton Skeleton bronze medallist Laura Deas speaking to BBC Sport:""I just can't believe it's happening. It's like a dream. I thought it would be snatched away at the last minute. I'm so pleased for Lizzy [Yarnold] too. ""It was a nice position to be in - chasing the pack going into today. I always knew consistency would win. ""I almost couldn't feel my legs because I was so nervous. I didn't think I'd done enough. The further Janine Flock came down the track, I thought 'oh, maybe'.

Skeleton: Women's final - reaction Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV No other female has tried to retain this title and one of the reasons is because it is so hard! To have the mental grit to come back and say, 'I don't care about all that, I am going to come back and show you what I can do.' Skeleton Skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I'm overwhelmed and exhausted. I don't really
know how it happened. ""After the first run I wasn't sure whether I was going to be able to finish
the race because my chest infection was so bad I was struggling to breathe and I
got here only with the help of my team. ""My physio just gave me a talking to before run two (on Saturday) and
reminded me that I can do it and we can do it together. ""I guess four years ago, three years ago, the whole team all dared to dream
that this was possible and I just went with all them and we managed it."" Skeleton: Women's final Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV What does she do? I'm sure if Lizzy Yarnold decides she's achieved everything she can, she will find something else to do and succeed at that. Of all the runs, that last one was her best. She just went out and did her stuff. Yarnold and Deas win skeleton medals Nick HopeBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It
is near unbelievable what has been achieved by the British sliders today! Yarnold
has been so far off her best for the last two years that it looked as though we
would never see her dominate a World Cup event, let alone an Olympics. Her
turnaround in form has been STUNNING! Deas
too worked so hard for this medal. The look on her face before the final Janine
Flock set off said it all - she thought she had lost it and was resigned to
fourth. What
a moment for the sport and Great Britain. The nationâs best-ever day at a Winter Olympics with three
medals and the first time GB have ever had two athletes share a podium at a
Winter Olympics. Love this. Ski jumping There's been a gold for Poland -Kamil Stoch'sfinal jump of 136.5 meters was enough to see him retain his Olympic title. Germany'sAndreas Wellinger, who won normal hill gold last week, settled for silver, while Norway'sRobert Johanssonclaimed bronze. OAR 4-0 USA Caroline ChapmanBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It's all over at the Gangneung ice hockey arena. The OAR earn a 4-0 win over the USA. The non-Russian Russians top their group going into the play-off qualifications with two wins from three matches. Gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, speaking to BBC Sport:âIt means so much to me. âAt times over the last four years itâs been so hard and
Iâve doubted myself and wondered whether I could get back to where I wanted to
be but the team never lost faith and thatâs why Iâm back here today on the
podium. âHonestly after the last few
years the aim was to get here to the Olympics, I wasnât thinking about the
medals - but to achieve that is the stuff of dreams, as is sharing the podium with
Laura whoâs been amazing.â Here's how GB's total Winter Olympics tally looks at the minute. ... and finally the Brits claimed two medals at the same time, as Lizzy Yarnold won gold and Laura Deas took skeleton bronze. ... then along came Izzy Atkin in the women's slopestyle... British medal number one came on Friday, thanks to Dom Parsons in the skeleton... Winners are grinners. #bbcolympics Lee Fergusson:What a fantastic day for Team GB! Three medals! It really is a Super Saturday. Noname: A fantastic medal haul for our skeleton team.

Seven key takeaways,"The indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigations were unexpected Special Counsel Robert Mueller has dropped another Friday blockbuster with his sweeping indictment of three organisations and 13 Russian nationals for meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. For the first time the special counsel's team has taken dead aim at its central mandate in the investigation and laid bare the scope of what it alleges was a multi-million-dollar Russian operation to sow discord in American politics as far back as 2014. Here's a look at some of the key passages of the 37-page indictment and what they mean. This video can not be played Russians recruited 'real Americans' as part of 'information warfare' ""Some defendants, posing as US persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to co-ordinate political activities."" This is the key passage for the White House's effort to downplay the threat this indictment poses to Donald Trump and his presidency. A congressional committee earlier questioned Facebook and Twitter about attempts by Russian operatives to spread disinformation Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in announcing the indictments, added that there was ""no allegation in this indictment that any American had knowledge"" of Russian activity. Critics will highlight the ""in this indictment"" portion of that statement. While Mr Mueller's document asserts no Trump-connected individuals knew they were dealing with Russians, this isn't the end of the investigation. The president, via Twitter and in a White House statement, insists this is proof that there was no collusion. It's better to say that there's no collusion alleged here. That certainly bolsters the White House's principal argument, but it doesn't cover any possible indictments to come. What this indictment, if it is substantiated, does do is devastate Mr Trump's past insistence that allegations of Russian meddling were a hoax. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Full text of the Russia indictment ""They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump."" The indictment paints a picture of a multi-year, multi-prong effort to ""sow discord"" in the US political process dating back to 2014, before Mr Trump entered the presidential race. The Russians, according to Mr Mueller's team, familiarised themselves with the US political process and then took action to support - or undermine - a variety of political candidates. They allegedly attacked several of Mr Trump's rivals in the Republican primary and backed Bernie Sanders, who mounted a populist challenge to Mrs Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Ted Cruz was one of the candidates Russians allegedly tried to disparage They also used social media, investigators say, to rally support for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the general election, including an Instagram account that told black liberal activists to ""choose peace and vote for Jill Stein"" and that it wasn't ""a wasted vote"". In several key Mid-western states, the number of Stein votes was greater than Mr Trump's margin of victory over Mrs Clinton. ""Krylova and Bogacheva, together with other Defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchased equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards and drop phones) and discussed security measures (including ""evacuation scenarios"") for Defendants who travelled to the United States."" One of the more breathtaking revelations of the indictment was that Russian attempts to influence the US presidential election went well beyond ""virtual"" efforts on social media. It included actual Russian nationals entering the US under false pretences and posing as Americans to conduct clandestine activities, according to the document. It's the kind of espionage activity that harkens back to the Cold War and an indication of the seriousness and sophistication behind the Russian efforts. ""Defendants, together with others known and unknown to the grand jury, knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the US Department of Justice and the US Department of State in administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities."" There had been a line of argument from some Donald Trump supporters that Russian meddling efforts, even if proven, wouldn't constitute a criminal offence and a connection between Russia and the Trump campaign, if established, wouldn't be a fatal blow. The tactics of a Russian troll farm Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? Mr Mueller's indictment lays out a number of ways in which what Russia is alleged to have done constitutes actual violations of criminal statutes - including wire fraud, identity theft and violations of election law. It seems unlikely in the extreme that any of the individuals named in this indictment will end up facing any trial in the US. The Russian government has already said that the allegations are ""absurd"". That is probably not the point. This all matters because it establishes that any Americans who had knowledge of the Russian activity participated in a criminal endeavour and consequently could be vulnerable to prosecution. No Americans have been named, of course, the investigation isn't over yet. ""Defendants and their co-conspirators, posing as US persons, communicated with a real US person affiliated with a Texas-based grassroots organisation. Defendants and their co-conspirators learned from the real US person that they should focus their activities on ""purple states like Colorado, Virginia & Florida."" This is another of the more remarkable revelations of the extent to which Russian nationals tried to gather information about US electoral process and strategy as part of their alleged attempts to influence the US presidential race. They contacted actual US political experts, who directed them to target key states in the Electoral College - including Virginia, Colorado and Florida. It appears, from the indictment, that the Russians paid particular attention to Florida, which Mr Trump would eventually win by a 1.2% margin (Mrs Clinton carried the other two states mentioned). ""Defendants and their co-conspirators updated an internal organization list of over 100 real US persons contacted through organization-controlled false US persona accounts and tracked to monitor recruitment efforts and requests."" Up until now, much of the attention on Russian election meddling had been focused on their social media efforts - fake Twitter accounts, Facebook adverts and the like. The indictment, however, details much more. Among the things allegedly paid for by the Russian operatives: People dressing up as an imprisoned Hillary Clinton (not this one) Hundreds of Americans were allegedly contacted and recruited to support pro-Trump efforts. Individuals were paid to attend Trump events, including one who went to several dressed like Mrs Clinton in prison garb, investigators say. They even allegedly ordered the construction of a mock cage for the Clinton impersonator that could be transported on the back of a flatbed truck. Rallies themselves were organised and promoted. A Florida-based grassroots activist was allegedly wired money to purchase materials for a Miami event. All in all, Russian operatives were effectively engaging in - and funding - traditional on-the-ground campaign activities. Mr Trump has asserted that the ""results of the election were not impacted"". While it's impossible to tell whether Russia's alleged multi-million-dollar effort tipped the balance to the Republican, it's much more difficult to say it had no effect whatsoever. ""After the election of Donald Trump in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false US personas to organise and co-ordinate US political rallies in support of then president-elect Trump, while simultaneously using other false U.S. personas to organise and co-ordinate US political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 US presidential election."" If the real point of the alleged Russian meddling was to ""sow discord"" in the US political system, those efforts wouldn't conclude upon Mr Trump's election - and, according to the indictment, they didn't. After the election, protesters clashed over the Donald Trump's impending presidency In the days after the election, Russians were playing both sides against each other - encouraging rallies both for and against Mr Trump. The president's supporters have cited this as evidence that the Russians were as interested in undermining their man as much as helping him - although that's undermined by actual communications Mr Mueller cites in the indictment, in which ""specialists"" were told the organisation supported Mr Trump and Mr Sanders. What the post-election rallies demonstrate, however, is that the Russian efforts haven't ended. US intelligence officials, in testimony before Congress earlier this week said essentially the same thing - that the Russians, undeterred, will seek to continue to foment chaos in the days ahead, including during the 2018 US congressional midterm elections. The question, then, is what the US does - or does not do - to prepare and respond.

Two dead after car hit by train,"Emergency services were called to the scene just before 09:00 GMT A teenage boy and his grandfather have died after a car was struck by a train at a level crossing. Emergency services were called to the Barns Green crossing in Emms Lane, Horsham, West Sussex, at 08:47 GMT. The 72-year-old man was driving the car and his 15-year-old grandson was the passenger. No-one on the train was injured. British Transport Police (BTP) said their family was being supported by specialist officers. Det Insp Brett Walker said: ""This is an extremely tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. ""Our officers have been working at the scene, and will continue to do so for the rest of the day, to ensure we gain as much information about how the collision happened."" Passengers said the train ""stopped suddenly"" and ""people started screaming"" Southern said rail services would be affected for the rest of the day, with buses replacing trains between Horsham and Pulborough. BTP officers, who worked alongside Sussex Police, said the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Paramedics said they walked through the train after the collision to check on passengers and ensure no-one was injured. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed. Emergency services will be at the scene for the rest of the day Many of the train passengers were taken to the nearby Sumners Ponds campsite, where they were given hot drinks. Two of them, Sinitta and Beverley, told BBC Sussex there had been a fire after the crash. ""The train stopped suddenly and then people started screaming,"" they said. ""Then we saw the fire so we moved up the train, and they evacuated the train."" Sumners Ponds staff put a message on the local village Facebook page, appealing for people to give the passengers lifts to Horsham station. Campsite manager Matt Gale described seeing two trains at the level crossing as he arrived for work and a huge plume of smoke. He said the last of the train passengers left on coaches just after 11:00. He estimated they had looked after about 100 people.

May: Ideology shouldn't risk UK/EU security,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Those who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured"" Theresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU. New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit. Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly. This video can not be played Theresa May's response to Brexit 'extremely regrettable' remark. To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space. The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added. She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"". President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues."" Secure exit? How will Brexit affect UK security? Europol head fears loss of UK influence Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations. The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"". EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Merkel 'curious' about UK's Brexit aims UK reveals proposed EU security deal European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects. The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"". Mrs Merkel said she was ""curious not frustrated"" about the UK's approach In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders. The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed."" The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on."" Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security. Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work. ""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said. Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like.

Thousands call for Labour 'clarity' on Brexit,"Labour has received 17,000 emails over five days from people lobbying for a clearer party policy on Brexit. The emails, coordinated by Labour MPs and campaigners, call on Labour to give supporters ""their say"" by setting up a new policy commission on Brexit. They say there is a ""pressing need"" for the party to set out an alternative approach to government Brexit plans. Labour said its national policy forum, which meets in Leeds this weekend, plans to discuss the impact of Brexit. The shadow cabinet will attend, alongside MPs, grassroots members and trade unionists to formulate ideas which could ultimately be included in Labour's next manifesto. May: Don't block post-Brexit security deal Merkel 'curious not frustrated' after May meeting What does Brexit mean for Britain's spies? Currently the national policy forum is organised into eight policy commissions, but none focuses purely on Brexit. The emails, sent to Andy Kerr, chairman of Labour's governing body - the National Executive Committee - and national policy forum chairwoman Ann Cryer, call on the party to set up a dedicated policy commission on Brexit. ""The Labour Party is a democratic organisation and it is only right that its membership and supporter base can have their say,"" it says. The party said the impact of Brexit would be considered by the eight existing policy commissions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The emails are being coordinated by the campaign group Open Britain - which is calling for close ties with the EU after Brexit - as well as the Labour Campaign for the Single Market. MP Heidi Alexander, one of the campaign's supporters, said the Labour party was ""junking the views"" of its members on Brexit. Ms Alexander, co-chair of the Labour Campaign for the Single Market, said the party leadership was ""brushing the issue under the carpet"". Labour has committed to remaining in the single market and customs union during a transition period - but the policy for what happens next is less clear. The party leadership has said it would keep the option of a customs union on the table and would try to retain the benefits of the single market.

Max Mosley accused of 'muzzling press',"The former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley has been accused of trying to use data protection laws to ""gag the press for his own advantage"". Mr Mosley's lawyers have written to several newspapers, demanding they stop publishing details he considers not to be in the public interest. But Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun's associate editor, said Mr Mosley was ""using his considerable fortune to muzzle the press"". Mr Mosley called this ""nonsense"". A letter was sent to the Sun, the Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, warning them against publishing details of two subjects. They include Mr Mosley's relationship to the press regulator, Impress and the 2008 party that was at the heart ofhis privacy action,externalagainst the News of the World. ""People need to know that he is doing this because of a story about a sadomasochistic sex orgy in which he was personally involved,""  Mr Kavanagh told Radio 4's Today programme. ""He wants this erased from the record."" Max Mosley: I have no vendetta against press Center Parcs pulls Daily Mail ads over Tom Daley article In 2008, the High Court ruled the News of the World did breach Mr Mosley's privacy, awarding him Â£60,000 in damages. Mr Mosley admitted he had taken part in a sado-masochistic sex session with five prostitutes, but denied that it had a Nazi theme. He has since become a prominent privacy campaigner, funding the independent press regulator Impress through a family charity. Though officially-recognised, no UK national newspapers have signed up to it. Impress ""would not survive and could not operate without (Mr Mosley's) money"", Mr Kavanagh said. This was true - Mr Mosley said - but added: ""What I object to is them pretending that I control or influence Impress, which I don't"". Mr Mosley told the BBC that he believed it was due to his ties to Impress that he had been attacked by some newspapers  ""constantly referring to the News of the World story"" and by ""falsely saying that I'm paying for Impress whereas in fact, it's independent"". Writing for Press Gazette, he said newspapers were doing this""in an attempt to smear me and Impress by association,external"". ""The lawyers wrote a letter and you would expect the lawyers for the newspapers to write a letter back saying 'you're wrong, this is not the law',"" he told Today. ""In fact what happens is two full pages in the Daily Mail attacking me."" Responding to the letter, the Mail called it a ""chilling new attack on press freedom,external"". Impress have lobbied for Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act to be enacted. If implemented, it could see newspapers forced to pay legal costs in libel and privacy cases, even if they won, if they don't sign up to an officially-approved regulator.

Zainab's killer gets four death sentencesMan sentenced to death for raping and killing six-year-old girl whose murder sparked outrage in Pakistan.1m2 minutes agoAsia,"Zainab's rape and murder sparked outrage in Pakistan A court in Pakistan has given a 24-year-old man, Imran Ali, four death sentences for raping and murdering a six-year old girl last month. Zainab Ansari's body was found in a rubbish dump in the city of Kasur, south of Lahore, on 9 January. Her murder triggered outrage across the country, includingriots against alleged police incompetence in which two protesters died. The victim's father was in court to hear the verdict, amid heavy security. Zainab's killer has also been linked by police and the chief minister of Punjab province to the murders and assaults of other girls in the area. Ali's alleged crimes stretch back at least a year and angry residents say authorities should have been quicker to identify him as the perpetrator. Ali will be tried over the rest of the cases later, government prosecutor Ehtisham Qadir Shah told Reuters news agency. The city haunted by a spate of child killings Murdered girl's father 'has no words' Social media calls for #JusticeForZainab Dozens of witnesses testified against Ali in the trial, where forensic evidence including DNA and polygraph tests was also presented. Imran Ali, shown in a police handout image, confessed to killing Zainab Ansari It was family members - not police - who recovered CCTV footage showing Zainab being led away Ali has also been linked to other crimes against young girls His lawyer had withdrawn from the case after Ali confessed, reports say. Ali was handed death sentences for kidnapping, rape, murder and an act of terrorism, a life sentence for sodomy and a large fine. He now has a 15-day window in which he may appeal against the verdict. The news of his sentencing sparked strong reactions on social media, including by Hamza Ali Abbasi, a Pakistani actor, model and director. Allow Twitter content?

Other Twitter users suggested there could be a wider network of criminals behind the spate of child killings, and have called for investigations to continue before Ali is executed. Police have been under huge pressure to find who killed Zainab and the other children. Zainab's family say the police did not take action during the five days from when she was reported missing and her body was found. Relatives recovered CCTV footage of her last movements. The video, which showed a girl being led away by a man, was circulated widely on social media. Ali, who lived near Zainab, was arrested by police on 23 January.

May: Ideology should not risk UK securityThe prime minister calls for a new post-Brexit partnership on security in a speech in Munich.2m3 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Those who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured"" Theresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU. New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit. Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly. This video can not be played Theresa May's response to Brexit 'extremely regrettable' remark. To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space. The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added. She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"".

US election tampering charge for Russians,"This video can not be played Russians recruited 'real Americans' as part of 'information warfare' Thirteen Russians have been charged with interfering in the US 2016 election, in a major development in the FBI investigation. Three of those named have also been accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five have been accused of aggravated identity theft. The charges were made by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian meddling. Three Russian companies are also named in the indictment. One of them is the Internet Research Agency, based in St Petersburg, which the 37-page indictment said ""had a strategic goal to sow discord in the US political system, including the 2016 US presidential election"". Speaking at a news conference, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said there was no allegation that any American was ""a knowing participant in this illegal activity"" nor was it alleged that the meddling altered the election outcome. Seven key takeaways from the indictments The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Full text of the Russia indictment Mr Trump was briefed on the indictment earlier on Friday, the White House said. The president later tweeted that his campaign had done ""nothing wrong"" and again denied colluding with Russia. He also appeared to acknowledge Russian election meddling - something which he has in the past cast doubt on despite US intelligence agency assessments. Allow Twitter content?

Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef"", has denied election tampering One of the men named in the indictment -Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is known as ""Putin's chef"", denied election tampering.

I'm not at all upset that I'm on this list. If they want to see the devil, let them see him."" Mr Prigozhin has been a friend of Mr Putin since the 1990s. He has built up a business empire and has been accused of using companies to diffuse pro-Kremlin opinions via fake internet identities. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Friday, Robert Mueller's team released a slate of indictments that lays bare what it asserts is the full shape of the Russian meddling apparatus. And what an apparatus it was. In the run-up to the US presidential election ""Project Lakhta"", as it was called, had an operating budget of more than $1m a month. Russians associated with the organisation travelled to the US, posed as Americans and gathered information on where best to target its attempts to ""sow discord"" in the US political process. Swing states were identified and efforts, according to the indictment, were made to boost the prospects of Republican Donald Trump and undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton. Although the indictment does not suggest collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, it says the meddling effort may have been aided by ""unwitting individuals"" associated with the Republican nominee. The White House may breathe a sigh of relief with that particular revelation. But the heat is increasing, and the investigation isn't over yet. At the very least, if Mr Mueller's allegations hold up in court, it will become increasingly difficult for the president to argue that Russian meddling on his behalf is an unsubstantiated hoax.

Sergei Lavrov said at a major security conference in Germany he would not comment further until he saw ""facts"". The charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller are seen as a major development in his continuing probe into the US 2016 election. President Trump has said the indictment shows his campaign did ""nothing wrong"". The Russian foreign minister was being questioned by participants at the Munich Security Conference. Asked about the charges, he said that even Vice-President Mike Pence had called the investigation into question. ""So until we see the facts, everything else is just blather."" But Mr Trump's National Security Adviser, H R McMaster, said evidence of Russian meddling was ""now incontrovertible"". It would become harder to conceal attempts to ""interfere in our democratic process"", he added. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump has repeated his assertion that there was ""no collusion"" between his campaign and Russia. On Saturday, he quoted remarks by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who said that no American had knowingly participated in the Russians' activities. Allow Twitter content?

FBI criticised over Florida school attack,"This video can not be played Florida survivors on gun laws: 'Something has to change' Pressure is mounting on the FBI over the agency's failure to act on a tip that Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz might carry out an attack. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the agency's director must resign, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review, lamenting FBI ""failures"". Some of those close to the 17 victims of Wednesday's shooting also voiced dismay at the FBI's actions. President Donald Trump on Friday met survivors of the attack in Parkland. Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited a hospital and later the local sheriff's office, thanking them for their response to the tragedy. ""What a great job you've done,"" Mr Trump told law enforcement officials, adding: ""I hope you get credit for it because believe me, you deserve it."" This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' Nikolas Cruz, 19, has confessed to carrying out Wednesday's attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has been charged with 17 counts of murder. It was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 and has re-ignited debates about gun control, with many students from the school weighing in. Who are the victims? Florida shooting: A survivor's story Tales of heroism from Florida attack It comes after the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted it did not properly follow up on a warning about Mr Cruz. On 5 January a person close to the suspect contacted the FBI tipline to provide ""information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behaviour, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting"", an FBI statement said. The FBI said that information should have been assessed as a potential threat to life and passed on to the Miami field office but that ""we have determined these protocols were not followed"". This video can not be played Chicago Cubs' Anthony Rizzo speaks at Florida shooting vigil FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau was ""still investigating the facts"" and was committed to ""getting to the bottom of what happened"". ""We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy,"" he added. The 5 January tip was not the only information the FBI received about Nikolas Cruz. In September, a Mississippi man reported to the law enforcement agency a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video by a user called ""nikolas cruz"" which said: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" Ben Bennight said he spoke to FBI representatives for about 20 minutes and that they contacted him again following the Parkland shooting. The FBI on Thursday said they had conducted ""checks"" at the time, but were unable to identify the person behind the comment. Questions are also being asked about how local police responded to concern about Nikolas Cruz. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said his office had received 20 ""calls for service"" about him.

Governor Scott said in a statement that ""the FBI's failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable"".,external He said that an apology would never give families ""the answers they desperately need"" and said that Mr Wray had to resign. ""We constantly promote 'see something, say something,' and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act,"" he said.

Tell that to families,"" he told Reuters news agency. Analysis: One shooting, two Americas A depressed loner 'crazy about guns' Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that the FBI's ""failures"" had led to ""tragic consequences"", and announced a review at the justice department and FBI into how ""indications of potential violence"" are responded to. The FBI has been criticised before for having been aware of a possible threat and then failing to thwart an attack: The gunman of the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas was known to the FBI The bureau had information about one of the two brothers behind the deadly Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 The gunman who killed 49 people in a gay club in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 was on the FBI's radar In 2016, the FBI received about 1,300 tips a day through its website, which is staffed around the clock by two dozen people.

Breaking|Breaking newsZainab's killer gets four death sentencesMan sentenced to death for raping and killing six-year-old girl whose murder sparked outrage in Pakistan.3m3 minutes agoAsia,"Zainab's rape and murder sparked outrage in Pakistan A court in Pakistan has given a 24-year-old man, Imran Ali, four death sentences for raping and murdering a six-year old girl last month. Zainab Ansari's body was found in a rubbish dump in the city of Kasur, south of Lahore, on 9 January. Her murder triggered outrage across the country, includingriots against alleged police incompetence in which two protesters died. The victim's father was in court to hear the verdict, amid heavy security. Zainab's killer has also been linked by police and the chief minister of Punjab province to the murders and assaults of other girls in the area. Ali's alleged crimes stretch back at least a year and angry residents say authorities should have been quicker to identify him as the perpetrator. Ali will be tried over the rest of the cases later, government prosecutor Ehtisham Qadir Shah told Reuters news agency. The city haunted by a spate of child killings Murdered girl's father 'has no words' Social media calls for #JusticeForZainab Dozens of witnesses testified against Ali in the trial, where forensic evidence including DNA and polygraph tests was also presented. Imran Ali, shown in a police handout image, confessed to killing Zainab Ansari It was family members - not police - who recovered CCTV footage showing Zainab being led away Ali has also been linked to other crimes against young girls His lawyer had withdrawn from the case after Ali confessed, reports say. Ali was handed death sentences for kidnapping, rape, murder and an act of terrorism, a life sentence for sodomy and a large fine. He now has a 15-day window in which he may appeal against the verdict. The news of his sentencing sparked strong reactions on social media, including by Hamza Ali Abbasi, a Pakistani actor, model and director. Allow Twitter content?

Other Twitter users suggested there could be a wider network of criminals behind the spate of child killings, and have called for investigations to continue before Ali is executed. Police have been under huge pressure to find who killed Zainab and the other children. Zainab's family say the police did not take action during the five days from when she was reported missing and her body was found. Relatives recovered CCTV footage of her last movements. The video, which showed a girl being led away by a man, was circulated widely on social media. Ali, who lived near Zainab, was arrested by police on 23 January.

Brazil army takes control of Rio securityA general will oversee security under emergency measures to combat a wave of violent crime.13h13 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Rio de Janeiro has seen levels of violent crime soar amid a financial crisis The Brazilian government has appointed an army general to oversee security in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in response to growing gang violence. President Michel Temer compared the violence to ""a cancer"" and said organised criminals had all but seized control of the state. Rio's governor issued an appeal for help after the annual carnival celebrations were marred by violence. The army will oversee police and other security services. Overseeing the operation will be Gen Walter Souza Braga Netto, head of the Eastern Military Command. He was widely praised for his part in co-ordinating security for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Signing the decree, Mr Termer said he was taking ""extreme measures"" because circumstances demanded it. ""The government will give tough and firm answers, taking all necessary measures to eradicate organised crime,"" he said. There were chaotic scenes during the famous Rio carnival, with gun fights and looting. Three police officers died in violent clashes. Is Rio de Janeiro a city at war? Stray bullets: The girl shot in the play area An education disrupted by violence National TV news bulletins also broadcast footage of gangs surrounding and robbing tourists. With the security situation apparently spiralling out of control, state governor Luiz Fernando Pezao made a plea to the national government saying military intervention was the only way to tackle the heavily armed gangs. He apologised to those revellers affected, saying:  ""We were not ready. There were mistakes in the first days and we reinforced the patrols."" President Michel Temer (l) acted after a plea from Rio governor Luiz Fernando Pezao (r) Rio's police budget has been slashed in recent years because of a financial crisis. There have been criticisms that police do not even have the money to pay for the petrol in their patrol cars. Finances in Rio state have been badly hit by a national recession and a slump in oil prices, as well as high levels of corruption. The financial problems have only emboldened criminal gangs. Figures from the Rio state government show an 8% increase in killings last year over 2016 and a 26% jump since 2015. Samba school wins with anti-corruption message Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Rio de Janeiro Stunned, numb, in shock or in denial. Living in Rio brings such mixed feelings today. Life continues as usual in the city and residents go about trying to lead their lives normally. There's ""nothing happening"" - until something does. And more and more violence has been getting in the way, with stray bullets killing children in favelas, shoot-outs closing down major highways and mass robberies ruining the fun for several residents and tourists in the middle of the Carnival celebrations. The saying goes in Brazil that the year starts once Carnival ends, and the intervention announced by the federal government reinforces the feeling that there's no escaping reality. If Rio already felt misgoverned, the fact that the state governor willingly gave up his power for the president to call the shots in the security arena adds to the feeling of helplessness in the hands of unpopular politicians. For now, there will be hope that at least something is being done. But Brazilians are weary of big political gestures - especially in the months leading up to a presidential election. The army regularly patrols some of the most dangerous areas of Rio de Janeiro where drugs gangs hold sway, but now the military presence could be felt all over the city's metropolitan area of 12 million people and the wider state. Correspondents say it will be the first time the army has had such a high profile since Brazil's return to democracy in 1985, which followed 21 years of military rule. The move still needs to be approved by Brazil's National Congress. Rio's spectacular carnival celebrations were marred by escalating violence ""Organised crime has almost taken over the state of Rio de Janeiro, it is a cancer that spreads throughout the country and threatens the tranquillity of our people, so we have now enacted the federal intervention of the public security area of ââRio de Janeiro,"" Mr Temer said. Brazilian media, citing government sources, said the current head of public security, Roberto SÃ¡, would be removed from office. It is understood Gen Netto will be in charge of Rio state security at least until the end of the year. The UK woman leading the dance at the Rio Carnival Evil rat stars in political Rio parade.

"Oxfam chief: 'Attacks out of proportion'Criticism of charity over Haiti sex claims scandal are disproportionate, says Oxfam's chief executive4m4 minutes agoUK Politics","The Oxfam Charity""s CEO Mark Goldring (l) and Chair Caroline Thomson (r) leave the Department for International Development Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, has said the scale and intensity of the criticism against his organisation in the wake of claims its workers used prostitutes in Haiti is out of proportion to its level of culpability. He told the Guardian newspaper,external: ""The intensity and the ferocity of the attack makes you wonder, what did we do? ""We murdered babies in their cots?"" Mr Goldring also suggested that critics are motivated by an anti-aid agenda. The charity boss said that ""anything we say is being manipulated... even apologies only make matters worse."" Oxfam aid worker tells of sex assault Oxfam chief promises justice for victims How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? He acknowledged Oxfam could have acted faster but said ""what I felt really clearly is many people haven't wanted to listen to explanations"". Earlier this month, news reports said that during a humanitarian mission in Haiti in 2011, the charity's country director hired prostitutes at a villa paid for by Oxfam. The charity faced more criticism when it emerged that it had not shared details of the allegations with the Haitian government. Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in today's Guardian in which it says sorry to the people of Haiti and the charity's supporters. The ad, paid for by supporters rather than the charity, also sets out the actions the organisation plans to take, including tripling Oxfam's safeguarding capacity and establishing a review into improving its culture. The charity apologises in a full-page advertisement in the Guardian newspaper Another charity - MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) - has now come under question as the president of Haiti called for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country. Jovenel Moise, asked why the medical charity MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members. He told the Reuters news agency:  ""The Oxfam case is the visible part of the iceberg, ""It is not only Oxfam, there are other NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the same situation, but they hide the information internally."" MSF said it took reports of staff misconduct seriously and was seeking to clarify questions raised by the president. Oxfam has agreed to stop bidding for UK government funding until it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the charity had ""a long way to go"" before regaining the trust of the public, its staff and the people it aims to help. The charity, which had a total income of Â£409m last year, received Â£31.7m from the government in 2016, accounting for about 8% of the charity's income. The amount also represents about a quarter of a percent of the government's annual foreign aid spending. Oxfam is setting up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff. Other planned reforms include new funding for safeguarding measures and a crackdown on references issued to former staff. Do you have any information related to this story that you wish to share?

"May warns EU not to block security dealIdeology must not get in the way of public safety, the prime minister will say in a speech in Munich.9h9 hours agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Those who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured"" Theresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU. New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit. Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly. This video can not be played Theresa May's response to Brexit 'extremely regrettable' remark. To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space. The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added. She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"". President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues."" Secure exit? How will Brexit affect UK security? Europol head fears loss of UK influence Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations. The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"". EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Merkel 'curious' about UK's Brexit aims UK reveals proposed EU security deal European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects. The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"". Mrs Merkel said she was ""curious not frustrated"" about the UK's approach In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders. The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed."" The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on."" Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security. Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work. ""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said. Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like.

To have the mental grit to come back and say, 'I don't care about all that, I am going to come back and show you what I can do.' Skeleton Skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold speaking to BBC Sport:""I'm overwhelmed and exhausted. I don't really
know how it happened. ""After the first run I wasn't sure whether I was going to be able to finish
the race because my chest infection was so bad I was struggling to breathe and I
got here only with the help of my team. ""My physio just gave me a talking to before run two (on Saturday) and
reminded me that I can do it and we can do it together. ""I guess four years ago, three years ago, the whole team all dared to dream
that this was possible and I just went with all them and we managed it."" Skeleton: Women's final Alex CoomberOlympic bronze medalist skeleton racer on BBC TV What does she do? I'm sure if Lizzy Yarnold decides she's achieved everything she can, she will find something else to do and succeed at that. Of all the runs, that last one was her best. She just went out and did her stuff. Yarnold and Deas win skeleton medals Nick HopeBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It
is near unbelievable what has been achieved by the British sliders today! Yarnold
has been so far off her best for the last two years that it looked as though we
would never see her dominate a World Cup event, let alone an Olympics. Her
turnaround in form has been STUNNING! Deas
too worked so hard for this medal. The look on her face before the final Janine
Flock set off said it all - she thought she had lost it and was resigned to
fourth. What
a moment for the sport and Great Britain. The nationâs best-ever day at a Winter Olympics with three
medals and the first time GB have ever had two athletes share a podium at a
Winter Olympics. Love this. Ski jumping There's been a gold for Poland -Kamil Stoch'sfinal jump of 136.5 meters was enough to see him retain his Olympic title. Germany'sAndreas Wellinger, who won normal hill gold last week, settled for silver, while Norway'sRobert Johanssonclaimed bronze. OAR 4-0 USA Caroline ChapmanBBC Sport in Pyeongchang It's all over at the Gangneung ice hockey arena. The OAR earn a 4-0 win over the USA.

Iâve doubted myself and wondered whether I could get back to where I wanted to
be but the team never lost faith and thatâs why Iâm back here today on the
podium. âHonestly after the last few
years the aim was to get here to the Olympics, I wasnât thinking about the
medals - but to achieve that is the stuff of dreams, as is sharing the podium with
Laura whoâs been amazing.â Here's how GB's total Winter Olympics tally looks at the minute. ... and finally the Brits claimed two medals at the same time, as Lizzy Yarnold won gold and Laura Deas took skeleton bronze. ... then along came Izzy Atkin in the women's slopestyle... British medal number one came on Friday, thanks to Dom Parsons in the skeleton... Winners are grinners. #bbcolympics Lee Fergusson:What a fantastic day for Team GB! Three medals!

President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues."" Secure exit? How will Brexit affect UK security? Europol head fears loss of UK influence Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations. The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"". EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Merkel 'curious' about UK's Brexit aims UK reveals proposed EU security deal European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects. The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"". Mrs Merkel said she was ""curious not frustrated"" about the UK's approach In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders. The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed."" The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on."" Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security. Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work. ""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said. Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like.

"Boy 'marked 17th' with 'animalistic' rapeCharlie Pearce marked his 17th birthday by finding ""a woman to rape and violently attack,"" a judge says.13h13 hours agoLeicester","This video can not be played CCTV shows Charlie Pearce on the night of the attack with a slab under his arm A teenager who ""marked his 17th birthday"" by bludgeoning a woman with a paving slab before raping her has been given a life sentence. ""Animalistic"" Charlie John Pearce wasfound guilty of attempted murderat Leicester Crown Court last year. The court heard he had searched the internet for videos showing attacks on ""helpless"" women before the attack. Pearce, who had denied trying to kill the woman but admitted rape, was told he must serve a minimum of 11 years. Pearce was captured on CCTV on the night the attack happened Sentencing at the Old Bailey, Justice Charles Haddon-Cave described Pearce as ""exceptionally dangerous"" and said he attacked the woman with ""animalistic savagery"". ""The defendant set out that evening to mark his 17th birthday to find a woman to rape and violently attack,"" he said. ""[The victim] could remember nothing of her ordeal, her life had been hanging on a thread."" Charlie Pearce's defence said it is ""of significant concern"" someone of his age ""could commit such a serious crime"" The court heard the attack in Victoria Park in Leicester took place at about 23:35 on 3 July, after Pearce had celebrated his birthday in a pub. Youths nearby witnessed the initial struggle and called 999 but a police patrol could not identify the location, the court heard. The woman - who cannot be identified - was found with ""truly dreadful"" injuries about an hour later by a passing cyclist. Leicestershire Police released a ""remarkably clear"" CCTV image of Pearce running towards the woman holding the slab. He was recognised by his own family who then contacted police. Pearce - who could only be named when a court order was lifted - denied intending to kill the woman, but had admitted two counts of rape. He also admitted causing grievous bodily harm and stealing the woman's handbag which he later burned. The victim was dragged into bushes near an entrance to the park Pearce's victim said she has been ""mentally and physically scarred"" by the attack. In a victim impact statement read out in court she said she still has bald patches and suffers jaw pain and loss of hearing following the attack. ""I am reminded on a daily basis - and sometimes multiple times a day - of the extensive trauma my body has endured and my mind cannot remember,"" she said. ""I have had thoughts about hurting myself and ending my life because I feel that I cannot live with the knowledge I have that what happened to me has happened to me.""

FBI admits botching tip on Florida gunman,"This video can not be played Florida survivors on gun laws: 'Something has to change' The FBI has said it did not properly follow up on a warning that Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz might carry out an attack. Last month, a person close to the 19-year-old contacted the law enforcement agency to warn of ""the potential of him conducting a school shooting"". But protocols were not followed and the tipline did not pass along the complaint, the FBI said. It was not the first potential warning to the FBI regarding Mr Cruz. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' He has confessed to carrying out Wednesday's attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has been charged with 17 counts of murder. It was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. On Friday, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited a hospital in Florida where victims of the shooting were being treated. A White House spokeswoman said the couple came to the hospital to ""pay their respects"" and thank employees for their response to the shooting. The president and his wife later visited the Broward County sheriff's office to meet law enforcement officials who responded to the shooting. ""What a great job you've done,"" Mr Trump said, adding: ""I hope you get credit for it because believe me, you deserve it."" US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he is ordering a review of the justice department's processes in the wake of the FBI's mishandling of the tip. The review will look at what went wrong and broadly examine how the justice department responds to such cases. ""It is now clear that the warning signs were there and tips to the FBI were missed,"" he said in a statement. ""We see the tragic consequences of those failures."" Florida Governor Rick Scott said in a furious statement that the director of the FBI must resign. ""The FBI's failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable,"" he said. ""The families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them answers they desperately need."" The Republican governor said Americans must have confidence in the FBI to act on ""see something, say something"" tips. Florida shooting: A survivor's story White House won't release photo of Trump gun law repeal Analysis: One shooting, two Americas A group of Florida lawmakers who travelled from the state capitol to visit the school on Thursday agreed to tear down and replace Building 12, where the massacre occurred. ""It will still be very difficult for students to return,"" Republican Senator Bill Galvano told the Miami Herald newspaper. ""But that particular building should be razed, and the memory of the perpetrator erased and a memorial honoring the victims and their families be put in its place."" On 5 January a person close to the teenager contacted the FBI tipline to provide ""information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behaviour, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting"", said an FBI press release. The agency said that under established protocols, the caller's information to the Public Access Line should have been assessed as a potential threat to life and passed on to the Miami field office. ""We have determined these protocols were not followed,"" said the FBI. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is ""still investigating the facts"". ""I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public,"" he said. ""We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy,"" he added. In 2016, the FBI received about 1,300 tips a day through its website, which is staffed around the clock by two dozen people. In addition to online tips, FBI field offices receive dozens of calls. About 100 of the tips are considered ""actionable"".

A user called ""nikolas cruz"" said:  ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" Ben Bennight said he spoke to FBI representatives for about 20 minutes. The bail bondsman said they contacted him again following the school shooting in Parkland. The FBI confirmed on Thursday they had been made aware of the comment at the time. They said they had conducted ""checks"", but were unable to identify the person behind it.

Strong quake hits south-western Mexico,"This video can not be played The earthquake shook this newspaper office in Mexico City A 7.2-magnitude earthquake has hit south-western Mexico, causing buildings to shake in the capital Mexico City, about 350km (217 miles) away. The epicentre of the powerful tremor was near Pinotepa de Don Luis in Oaxaca state, the US Geological Survey said. Friday's quake was 24.6km underground. Some buildings were damaged in Oaxaca, but no deaths were reported. A helicopter carrying the interior minister and Oaxaca's governor crashed in the state, killing two people. Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete and Governor Alejandro Murat were not seriously injured, officials said. They were surveying the damage caused by the quake. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no tsunami threat. After the tremor, thousands of people were seen fleeing buildings in Mexico City as the ground shook. Some were crying, while others hugged each other on the streets of the capital. Traffic stopped for a few minutes. The authorities activated earthquake alert systems in four states, and Mexico City. They urged residents to stay outdoors. Clouds of dust rose near buildings already damaged by two quakes last September Last September, two devastating earthquakes in Mexico killed hundreds of people. ""Since 19 September we haven't been that scared,"" said shoemaker Luis RodrÃ­guez in Mexico City. But another woman said: ""It is very scary to think your house can fall over you any second."" There were clouds of dust near buildings already damaged by the September quakes. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates.
