Root a ready-made captain - Vaughan,"This video can not be played Driven determined Root ready for job - Vaughan New England Test captain Joe Root is ideally suited to the role, says former skipper Michael Vaughan. Root, 26,takes over from Alastair Cookdespite having led in only four first-class matches - three for Yorkshire and one for England Lions. ""People who say he's not quite ready are talking nonsense. He's driven and got the right attitude,"" ex-Yorkshire batsman Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 live. ""He's ready-made for the England captaincy."" Root, who has played 53 Tests, will not properly take over until the first Test against South Africa in July, with England only playing limited-over cricket for the first half of 2017. His four matches as captain in first-class cricket have produced mixed results. In April 2014,his Yorkshire side conceded 472 in the fourth innings to lose to Middlesex,but later that year he skippered them to a victory over Nottinghamshire that sealed the County Championship. This video can not be played Joe Root announced as England Test captain Former Yorkshire and England captain Geoffrey Boycott said fans will be looking for Root ""to take a risk now and again"" and the nature of Test cricket means the new captain will occasionally ""have to make things happen"". ""Everything that has ever been thrown at Joe, every time he's moved upwards in his career, he's handled it,"" Boycott told BBC Radio 5 live. ""If not straight away, then he's quickly got to it because he's got an acute cricket brain."" Boycott, who led England in four Tests in 1978, said he hoped to see Root move back down the order to bat at four, to give him more time to cope with the added interview demands of the captaincy. The 76-year-old added that being a Yorkshireman will stand Root in good stead as captain, because ""we're good at it"". Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon described Root as ""a born leader"". ""He has always studied the game and different tactics throughout his career,"" said Moxon. ""It's not something that he is going to have to learn before his first Test. I'm sure he will do a good job."" Root is a ""fantastic role model"" and vastly experienced for a player in his mid-20s, said Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale, who captained Root at the county. ""Whatever level he has stepped up to, it hasn't taken him long to adapt and he has learned very quickly. I would say that I have actually learned more from him,"" added Gale. ""You learn on the job. I think we will see a different style of cricket with Joe in charge. He's a bit of tinkerman and not afraid to think outside the box."" Root made his England debut in 2012 and since then has scored more Test runs than any other batsman in the world. The right-hander, a product of the Yorkshire youth set-up, was made England vice-captain in 2015 and steps up to lead after Cook resigned last week. ""I remember him as a 13-year-old, saying to the batting coach that he wanted to know what he needed to do to play for England,"" added Gale. ""That's a big statement for a 13-year-old. ""He made his one-day debut for Yorkshire against Essex in 2009. He was a little lad who looked like the Milky Bar Kid and couldn't hit the ball off the square. He's never been overawed and that will stand him in good stead."" Root's appointment sees him join Australia's Steve Smith, India's Virat Kohli and New Zealander Kane Williamson as captain of his country. The quartet, widely regarded as the four finest batsman in the world, occupy the top four spots in the International Cricket Council's batting rankings. ""It's exciting for cricket, for all of us who are supporters of the game, seeing four wonderful batsmen ply their trade and now lead their countries,"" said former Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie. The Australian told the BBC World Service:""It reminds me a little bit of when we had four wonderful all-rounders - Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev and Imran Khan. ""Now we have four high-class batsmen who are absolutely brilliant and happen to be captain of their country. It's very exciting."" Root's father Matt said he was ""incredibly proud"" and insisted his son would not get carried away with the appointment. ""He's taken it in his stride. He won't get ahead of himself. His feet are firmly on the ground,"" he said. ""People say his form might dip but I absolutely think he can do the job. He's got a great team to manage."" Is Root the right man for England?

'He was a mess',"Sarah, Josh and Jade all grew up with a parent who had an addiction Accepting a Bafta award for leading actor, Manchester by the Sea star Casey Affleck revealed to the audience he had grown up with an alcoholic parent. The personal tale came a week after Labour MP Jon Ashworth spoke in parliament about his experience of having an alcoholic father. The NSPCC says it receives a call every hour from an adult concerned about drug or alcohol use around children, and it believes up to a million young people could be living with an alcoholic or drug dependent parent. So how does it feel to grow up with an addicted parent? And what impact does it have beyond childhood? Three people shared their stories with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. This video can not be played Josh Connolly speaks about a typical day in the life of his alcoholic father Josh Connolly was nine when his father, an alcoholic, died. Now 29, he says the experience left him full of anger, which he would often direct at other people, feeling shame at his father's behaviour but guilt for not standing by him. ""I tend to only remember a lot of the bad things and also the feelings,"" he said. ""That is what stayed with me through my life and is still tangible today; the way that my dad's drinking and everything that comes with that made me feel."" Josh's experience led him to develop his own problems with drinking during his teenage years. ""I desperately wanted more than anything else in my life not to be an alcoholic, but when I was 12 or 13 and found alcohol, it just became the perfect escape route for me. ""I was never really able to look after my dad. At school I acted the clown, at home I am trying to be the best possible me that I could be, so alcohol gave me an escape from that."" This video can not be played Jade Bailey speaks of her heartbreak at how she was treated by her heroin addict father. Jade Bailey's father was a heroin addict who took drugs around her from as far back as she could remember. He began with cannabis and ecstasy, taking it with friends and telling his daughter it was ""medicine."" But as she got older, he moved onto harder drugs. ""I knew it was never right and never their medicine,"" said the 25-year-old. ""I remember them going into the bathroom, I can even picture it now, and doing it, coming out and all being off their faces. ""When he went on to heroin, I was about ten years old and he was a mess. Our fun time on the weekend was going to the skip and trying to find toys. ""At that age, I thought it was amazing as my dad was always my hero."" When Jade told her mother what had been happening when she went to visit, she stopped her from going and only let Jade contact her father by phone. ""I have never had that answer from him of why wasn't I enough to make [him] stop,"" she said. ""Why do you not love me enough to stop and be my dad? ""He knew how much I adored him and I knew he adored me, I knew I was the only thing he cared about, apart from the drug. ""It makes you feel very alone and abandoned by them, but you love them so much you can't ever leave them, no matter what they do."" This video can not be played Sarah says she used to wait up all night for her alcoholic father to come home from the pub. Sarah was brought up by her father, who is an alcoholic. She said the drinking changed her relationship with him so much she had to walk away. ""In my early years, it was happy,"" she said. ""It made it harder when he turned to alcohol because I couldn't understand and it made it harder to walk away. ""I missed the old dad he was and always wished I could have the old dad back."" Sarah never told anyone about his problem so had to deal with it alone. She thinks the experience made her ""stronger, braver and more resilient to life's challenges"", but it affected her attitude towards alcohol. ""I always feel anxious when I am around drunk people,"" she said. ""It reminds me of the time I was looking after my dad, the feelings I got from that and the embarrassment, shame and sadness.""

Whale graveyard,"The latest strandings are among the worst New Zealand has recorded Each year locals from Golden Bay at the top of New Zealand's South Island know to expect a whale beaching at a narrow strip of sand curving into the Cook Strait, known as Farewell Spit. Ben Collins looks at what makes the area so deadly. Each year, according to the conservation groupProject Jonah,external, around 300 dolphins and whales become stranded in New Zealand. Many of these incidents occur at Farewell Spit, a thin arc of sand at the top of the South Island which separates a shallow bay from the open ocean. Last week, more than 400 pilot whales became stranded on this 5km-long (three mile-long) stretch and, while some were saved by conservation officials and volunteers in a desperate rescue effort, most died. Farewell Spit curves around the top of New Zealand's South Island The beachings occur in the summer months, according to Gary Riordan, who is 62 and has lived in the area for most of his life. ""It pretty much happens every year,"" says Mr Riordan, who runs a beachside camp ground not far from where they often become stranded. Noise damage to whales' ears studied How many whales wash up on UK beaches? Are whales committing suicide when they strand themselves? ""There's a lot of theories out there as to why it happens, but at the end of the day I think there's four or five hotspots where they strand [in New Zealand], and the one thing they all have in common is shallow water."" ""As far as often goes: It's pretty much seasonal, always around January or February. It's something that the locals expect every year about this time."" Some of the stranded whales were saved, but most died Joanna Wheaton, who also lives in the area, said she was pleasantly surprised there wasn't a mass stranding in 2016. ""Farewell Spit is a unique natural trap for them,"" she says. In February 2015 about 200 pilot whales - which, despite their name, are actually members of the dolphin family - beached not far from the cafe where she works. At least half of them died. ""It's always the same species, pilot whales, and the same extreme tide situation on the inner beach,"" she says. Dr Rochelle Constantine, a marine biologist at the University of Auckland, also says the shallow water around Farewell Spit is what causes the whales to beach. ""Farewell Spit, geographically, is quite an interesting place,"" she says. ""It spans around in a broad arc. On either side is large bay and the open ocean. Volunteers and officials worked to help save as many whales as possible ""There's a series of really large sand banks all through there in the bay, and it just gradually becomes more and more shallow,"" Dr Constantine says. Because the water becomes shallower gradually, the whales may not be able to detect the change using echo-location, in the same way they would a sudden rise in gradient, she says. ""They can echo-locate, but it's [a problem with] the signal that they get bounced back. It's a combination of this gentle gradient and the soft sand. They probably aren't detecting that they are swimming into more and more shallow water."" By the time they do realise, it's often too late. The tide has already begun to run out. Farewell Spit is especially deadly as it sits, like a hook, right in the pilot whales' path. About 200 stranded whales were able to get back to sea with the help of a high tide ""They can swim straight into Golden Bay and the embrace of the Farewell Spit. It's just geographically a very tricky spot,"" Dr Constantine says. While the shallow water and its effect on echolocation is the most likely reason the animals become stranded at Farewell Spit, Dr Constantine says pilot whales also have strong social bonds, and this could explain why such large numbers become stuck, or return once rescuers re-float them. ""I have attended a fair few strandings and what is highlighted is how variable they all are,"" she says. ""We do know that because they are quite strongly socially-bonded, they will hang out with each other, but to be honest, every stranding is different. Sometimes they just muck up and don't get the right cues, and other times its because they are strongly bonded to [stranded] individuals in the group."" ""We think there's some confusion going on in each stranding, but finding a reason is often difficult,"" she says. The dead whales have been marked with an ""X"" Scientists don't know for sure why they regularly beach in January or February, though Dr Constantine said it could be because of feeding patterns and changes in ocean temperature which see more whales passing through the Cook Strait at that time of year. ""These are quite hard things to measure as scientists, because the reality is we don't often see pilot whales in this area until they are about to strand. They are not really coastal."" ""We really don't know much about the movements of pilot whales in New Zealand. It could be simply they are not around at other times of the year."" According to the New Zealand Department of Conservation, the largest recorded stranding was an estimated 1,000 pilot whales on the Chatham Islands, another stranding hotspot, in 1918.

Cheltenham drinkers face booze hurdle,"Organisers say they want people to come to the festival to enjoy the racing Cheltenham Festival racegoers will be restricted to buying four alcoholic drinks at a time in a bid to crack down on anti-social antics. Two footballers apologised after being photographedapparently urinating into a glassat last year's festival, where women were seen baring their breasts. Chief executive Ian Renton said: ""It's to ensure that drinking is not the rationale for people coming racing."" The measure is also to be imposed at the Jockey Club's other racecourses. It comes in first at Cheltenham, where the festival takes place next month, but will be in place at Epsom, which stages the Derby, and Aintree, where the Grand National is held. ""It's an improvement on things we are already doing,"" Mr Renton said. ""Aintree has already got the ball rolling, with their Ladies' Day, they've already taken steps to improve the way that is perceived. ""We want them to come to racing and enjoy the sport and not have those people coming who will be a nuisance to other racegoers,"" added Mr Renton.

North Korea's latest missile test explained,"The use of solid fuel reduces the time needed to launch the missile On the morning of 12 February, North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test launch from Banghyon air base near the west coast of the country. Like all such launches, the test took place in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Pyongyang's press release, issued a day later, indicated that the missile - the Pukguksong-2 - was of the same type as one test-fired from a submarine off the east coast in August 2016. Unlike North Korea's other long-range land-based missiles, the system tested on 12 February used solid fuel. Until now, the country's comparable land-based missile systems have been liquid-fuelled. Pyongyang also announced that the launch vehicle carrying the new missile is indigenously made and uses a continuous or ""caterpillar"" track, rather than wheels with tyres. Previously North Korea has imported and modified foreign-made trucks to transport and launch its missiles. A domestic manufacturing capability will negate the need to convince or fool foreign suppliers into selling these vehicles. Continuous track also suggests that North Korea's intention may be to take the missiles off-road, making it more difficult to detect imminent launches. Missiles using liquid fuel require greater preparation time than those using solid fuel. They also require a larger constellation of support vehicles to accompany each launch vehicle. Both of these considerations make it more likely that an enemy might detect the missile in time to conduct a pre-emptive strike. Solid fuel substantially reduces this vulnerability. North Korea will be able to roll these systems out of concealed storage and launch them with minimal preparation, drastically shrinking the time that an adversary would have to find and kill the missile. The capability thus represents a major step forward for North Korea. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korea's missile programme Stephen Evans: What will Trump do about North Korea? US warns N Korea against nuclear attack There are two ways to launch missiles from their supporting vehicle's canister. In ""hot"" launches, the missile's engines propel it upward out of the canister, while in ""cold"" launches, the missile is ejected from the canister using compressed gas before its engines ignite. A cold eject approach spares the launch vehicle from damage from the missile's ignition, making it possible to reload it and reuse. Kim Jong-un has hit the gas pedal on North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. In the past 13 months he has conducted two nuclear tests and launched over 20 ballistic missiles, including from a submarine. The demonstration of a long-range, solid-fuelled, land-based system is a continuation of this disturbing trend and one of the first significant foreign policy challenges that US President Donald Trump will be forced to grapple with.

New captain Root 'a born leader',"This video can not be played Driven determined Root ready for job - Vaughan New England Test captain Joe Root is ideally suited to the role, says former skipper Michael Vaughan. Root, 26,takes over from Alastair Cookdespite having led in only four first-class matches - three for Yorkshire and one for England Lions. ""People who say he's not quite ready are talking nonsense. He's driven and got the right attitude,"" ex-Yorkshire batsman Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 live. ""He's ready-made for the England captaincy."" Root, who has played 53 Tests, will not properly take over until the first Test against South Africa in July, with England only playing limited-over cricket for the first half of 2017. His four matches as captain in first-class cricket have produced mixed results. In April 2014,his Yorkshire side conceded 472 in the fourth innings to lose to Middlesex,but later that year he skippered them to a victory over Nottinghamshire that sealed the County Championship. This video can not be played Joe Root announced as England Test captain Former Yorkshire and England captain Geoffrey Boycott said fans will be looking for Root ""to take a risk now and again"" and the nature of Test cricket means the new captain will occasionally ""have to make things happen"". ""Everything that has ever been thrown at Joe, every time he's moved upwards in his career, he's handled it,"" Boycott told BBC Radio 5 live. ""If not straight away, then he's quickly got to it because he's got an acute cricket brain."" Boycott, who led England in four Tests in 1978, said he hoped to see Root move back down the order to bat at four, to give him more time to cope with the added interview demands of the captaincy. The 76-year-old added that being a Yorkshireman will stand Root in good stead as captain, because ""we're good at it"". Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon described Root as ""a born leader"". ""He has always studied the game and different tactics throughout his career,"" said Moxon. ""It's not something that he is going to have to learn before his first Test. I'm sure he will do a good job."" Root is a ""fantastic role model"" and vastly experienced for a player in his mid-20s, said Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale, who captained Root at the county. ""Whatever level he has stepped up to, it hasn't taken him long to adapt and he has learned very quickly. I would say that I have actually learned more from him,"" added Gale. ""You learn on the job. I think we will see a different style of cricket with Joe in charge. He's a bit of tinkerman and not afraid to think outside the box."" Root made his England debut in 2012 and since then has scored more Test runs than any other batsman in the world. The right-hander, a product of the Yorkshire youth set-up, was made England vice-captain in 2015 and steps up to lead after Cook resigned last week. ""I remember him as a 13-year-old, saying to the batting coach that he wanted to know what he needed to do to play for England,"" added Gale. ""That's a big statement for a 13-year-old. ""He made his one-day debut for Yorkshire against Essex in 2009. He was a little lad who looked like the Milky Bar Kid and couldn't hit the ball off the square. He's never been overawed and that will stand him in good stead."" Root's appointment sees him join Australia's Steve Smith, India's Virat Kohli and New Zealander Kane Williamson as captain of his country. The quartet, widely regarded as the four finest batsman in the world, occupy the top four spots in the International Cricket Council's batting rankings. ""It's exciting for cricket, for all of us who are supporters of the game, seeing four wonderful batsmen ply their trade and now lead their countries,"" said former Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie. The Australian told the BBC World Service:""It reminds me a little bit of when we had four wonderful all-rounders - Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev and Imran Khan. ""Now we have four high-class batsmen who are absolutely brilliant and happen to be captain of their country. It's very exciting."" Root's father Matt said he was ""incredibly proud"" and insisted his son would not get carried away with the appointment. ""He's taken it in his stride. He won't get ahead of himself. His feet are firmly on the ground,"" he said. ""People say his form might dip but I absolutely think he can do the job. He's got a great team to manage."" Is Root the right man for England?

Are pensioners better off than workers?,"The claim:Pensioners are on average Â£20 a week better off than working-age people. Reality Check verdict:The calculation made by the Resolution Foundation is for household income after housing costs. Before housing costs are taken into account, working-age households still have higher incomes than pensioner households. News thatpensioner households are now better off than working-age familieswas widely reported on Monday. There have been reports for some time that incomes for pensioners have been growing faster than those for working-age people, largely as a result of pensions being protected by the triple-lock, while many working-age benefits have been frozen. The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. But thereport from the Resolution Foundation,externalwas the first suggestion that the retired had actually overtaken the working-age group. The figures referred to the ""typical pensioner household"", by which it meant the median, which is the household for which half of pensioner households have higher income and half of them have lower incomes. In this case, a pensioner household is one in which at least one member is of pension age or older (65 for men, 64 for women) whether or not that person is working. There can also be working people in a pensioner household. But the important factor that has been mentioned little in the coverage is that the measure of income that the Resolution Foundation is using is one for income after housing costs have been paid. This chart from the Resolution Foundation gives income after housing costs for the median pensioner and working household as well as a richer one and a poorer one. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages. The report says, for example, that 70% of the silent generation (born 1926-45) own their homes outright, while just over 40% of the baby boomers (1946-65) own theirs, with another 30% still having mortgages to pay. The median income for both working-age and pensioner households is just over Â£20,000 a year, so housing costs would make a big difference. Also, the figures do not take account of people in care homes, which would be expected to increase housing costs for those of pension age. The Resolution Foundation confirms in the report that before housing costs are paid, the median working-age household still has a higher income than the median pensioner household.

Prison undercover: The reporterâs story,"This video can not be played Undercover footage shows prisoners incapacitated by drugs An undercover investigation by Panorama has revealed the reality of life behind bars in the crisis-hit prison system. From prisoner officers who say they've lost control to some inmates regularly taking drugs, undercover reporter Joe Fenton explains what it's like to work on the prison front line. Prison custody officer Joe Fenton, Her Majesty's Prison Northumberland - this was my life for two months as an undercover reporter for the BBC's Panorama programme. HMP Northumberland is a prison with a problem. Many problems in fact. And within hours of being in the job, I was to see astonishing examples of this. On my very first day, I was taken into a room with some of the other new recruits where we were shown a table covered in drugs. It was a massive find by prison staff - 2.5kg of a drug called spice - a much stronger, cheaper, synthetic alternative to cannabis. Spice is now one of the most popular illegal drugs used in prison. Prisoners told officers this find had barely scratched the surface. In my first week, I was responsible for escorting 70 prisoners but in reality, it felt like they were escorting me. I didn't really know where I was going and I just followed the prisoners, opening the gates for them. It didn't take too long to realise that the inmates were, in effect, running this prison. I saw prisoners stumbling around drunk, others who were high on drugs and some struggling to cope with addiction. On a standard 10-hour shift, the demands from prisoners were endless. The work didn't stop from the moment we got there to the moment we left. You just can't work five or six days solid there - it ruins you and you don't feel like a person any more, you just exist. The prison officers were all drained and with the constant demands from prisoners, I felt like I was working in a very busy hotel with a lot of angry guests. I've seen staff at their wits' ends and staff who are struggling to cope. Nurses attend to a prisoner who has taken the drug spice There were drugs everywhere in HMP Northumberland and I found myself walking through clouds of smoke, some of which were from prisoners smoking spice. Spice affected prisoners in different ways. Some would look a bit blurry-eyed. One reacted by moving his forearms around uncontrollably, his eyes completely vacant and his face expressionless. Officers called the nurses for this particular prisoner but they weren't called for every inmate who reacted badly to spice. It happens too often. The time officers had least control was during the couple of hours in the evening when prisoners were allowed to socialise - they could go into each other's rooms, close the door and even lock it from the inside, although we could then unlock it again. Often I would be alone on a landing and it wouldn't have been safe for me to challenge them by myself. I often felt that there was nothing I could really do if I suspected prisoners were about to deal or take drugs. Some officers told me they often don't confront prisoners because they are not confident backup will arrive if they are attacked. Prison officers have the power to challenge prisoners but the prisoners had lookouts and warning codes so they were often one step ahead. This enabled them to hide their drugs, put out their cigarettes or throw their mobile phone under the pillow. Those few extra seconds were all they needed. As in all walks of life you'll get people who can cope by themselves and those who need a little bit of help. It's the same in prison. I met one vulnerable prisoner who was being bullied - we're calling him John in order to disguise his identity. On one occasion, I witnessed him totally off his head while other prisoners watched, laughing - I suspect they had spiked his cigarettes with spice. He told me he'd previously had buckets of water thrown over him and had been burnt with cigarettes. It would be great if staff were there to look after these prisoners every step of the way but I felt there just weren't enough officers to protect people like John all the time. This video can not be played BBC Panorama spent two months inside one of the country's biggest prisons Prison officers repeatedly told me they had lost control of the prison. I saw officers worried about their safety and losing confidence. I witnessed one officer convulsing on the floor because he had inadvertently inhaled spice while patrolling a landing. It was hard to see this happening to a colleague, someone whose company I enjoyed. But this is what prison officers have to deal with and it wasn't an isolated incident. Sources have told us that at least three members of staff at this prison needed hospital treatment for inhaling spice smoke in the last seven months. And the drugs continue to flow in - prison officers told me that that's because of lapses in security. While working on one house block at HMP Northumberland, staff found black clothing, balaclavas and wire-cutting tools. I witnessed doors where the alarms weren't working and a hole in an internal security fence which would have allowed prisoners to collect drugs thrown in from the outside. I have a lot of sympathy for the prison officers I met while working at HMP Northumberland - there are many good people there trying to do a difficult job with limited resources. Prisoners are in prison for a reason and prisons must exist to both punish and rehabilitate. But from my experience, I didn't see much of either.

The Netherlands' populist moment?,"I ask the Dutch ruling party's Europe spokesman what the election next month is about. ""Identity,"" he replies without hesitation. I try to ask his leader, the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, about their strategy. Near the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, a small crowd gathers in the snow and begins a countdown for Mr Rutte. ""Tien, negen, acht"" - ten, nine, eight - they chant before he unveils the statue of Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, a 19th-Century statesman, hero to Rutte's Liberal party, the VVD. The rather delightful mixture of old-fashioned marble for the statesman himself and burnished steel, portraying his modern equivalent, complete with a woman in a short skirt perched on his desk, is the work of Tom Pucke, an English sculptor who's lived here for 20 years. He tells me his Thorbecke gazes into the future with worry. ""You see in his face a sort of concern, in his expression, maybe he's concerned about the way things are going."" The prime minister may well feel the same. Another countdown is well under way, to the election on 15 March, and Mr Rutte isbecoming decidedly less liberal,externalin reaction to the man leading the opinion polls. Long before there was Donald Trump, another populist politician with an exotic hairstyle was already making waves. Platinum blondeGeert Wilderswasonce banned from Britain,external. Now he's on course,according to most polls,external, to head the largest group of MPs in the Dutch Parliament. He wants to ban the Koran and close the country's Mosques. So one slogan you won't find Mr Rutte using is ""It's the economy, stupid."" Dutch PM Mark Rutte says immigrants who ""refuse to adapt"" should ""behave normally or leave"" He has devised a plan to ensure he isn't the first continental leader to drown in the new populist tide, joining Hillary Clinton and David Cameron bobbing in the waves. He has issued a very hard-line open letter. It begins ""there is something wrong with our country."" He continues to appeal to ""the silent majority,"" saying Dutch freedoms have been abused, women in short skirts and gay people have been abused. He tells those immigrants who he says ""refuse to adapt"" to ""behave normally or leave."" When I try to talk to him at the unveiling his spokeswoman butts in: ""This is not the moment."" If you don't like it, leave - Dutch PM Why Geert Wilders is scenting victory Netherlands country profile So I asked his party's Europe spokesman MP,Anne Mulder,external, what the election is about. ""Identity,"" he replies.  ""What makes the Netherlands the Netherlands. I think it is globalisation, people travelling all around the world, people losing their jobs, so that's why people need some security. ""People are looking for identity, our shared feelings, acting normal. It is not only Islam, but if people leave their wife at home, if there's not equality between men and women...."" I say some people might think this was dancing to Geert Wilders' tune. ""Some people might say so,"" he answers, expressionless. So has his party been pushed to the right ? He hesitates. ""We have been having discussions in the party. Ten years ago I start in this city council - telling people, ""Act normal."" Wilders will launch his campaign next week in Spijkenisse, a suburb on the end of the Rotterdam tube line. So I go to the community centre there. A group of women are executing a rather slow line dance to gently exercise the limbs. Keeping moving is on their minds, not the election. But when I mention politics, just one name is on all their lips. Geert Wilders' party has topped a number of recent opinion polls ""I am going to vote for Wilders. He's direct. Straight. We shouldn't take in so many people with the Islamic religion."" As they dance to a tune about a beautiful lady from South Texas, some of the views are very similar to those I've heard in the States recently. ""I think we have to close the borders and have less foreigners. People here are getting poorer, kids going without breakfast, no clothes."" There's a paradox too - Wilders is valued for speaking out - but not all supporters want him to lead their country. ""He dares to say things as they are, about the foreigners. They are not good to women, there's the crime, all the murders, they rob shops with guns. ""Even though I'm voting for him, he can't be prime minister. But we need him to show the truth about Holland."" Marianne Vorthoren from Spior, Rotterdam's Islamic umbrella organisation, says the atmosphere has changed. ""Many Muslims feel 'are we still part of this society?' It's not just that some people say these things, [like calling for a ban on the Koran] but that about 20% of the voters support this. That is shocking. We don't feel safe any more."" I ask her about the prime minister's comments that people should leave if they can't ""act normal."" Fair enough, surely ? ""Who do you define with 'we' and 'us' and 'our values'? There are lots of groups - some in Parliament, Christian orthodox groups - who don't agree with equal rights for homosexuals. Now we don't say to them 'get out!'"" Despite these concerns, Wilders' party seems likely to do very well in the election. The diffidence I found in the community centre could play either way. People seem to say that they want Wilders around to speak his mind, but not to become their country's leader. Both Germany and France will hold major elections in 2017 That might put people off voting for his party or, my guess, suggest that he's a safe protest vote. Unintentionally the political mainstream cements this appeal, by firmly rejecting him as a possible coalition partner. Wilders has zero chance of becoming prime minister - according to the current prime minister - because the other parties simply won't do a deal with him. I asked political editor of the right-wing Daily Standard blogTim Engelbart,externalhow that would go down. ""A government would have to be formed with four or five parties. It would be an extremely unstable, unpopular government, featuring all kinds of parties from left to right with very little in common beyond the desire to keep Wilders out. ""It would anger Wilders voters, who are worried about security, their country, and who will be told: 'We're going to ignore you, regardless of the results.' Their faith in the Dutch political system won't improve."" It could be a script from the populist playbook - the people's will rejected, the people's choice excluded by a colluding elite. It would suggest betrayal wasn't a myth but a reality. A lot hangs on several European elections this year. The vote next month in the Netherlands will be followed byeven more critical elections in France,externalandGermany,external. But the Netherlands suggests some choices have already been made. The 'politics of identity' mean many centrist politicians aren't hesitating at the crossroads, contemplatively chewing their fingers. Many who were once happy to occupy the centre lane have forked to the right and are zooming down the autobahn in emulation of their more popular opponents. The question is not the direction of travel - but how far it goes. In the Netherlands, the revolution of the far-right has been brewing for a long time. We'll find out if they are near to taking power on 16 March. But you needn't wait until then to find out how Wilders has done. In one sense he has already won.

150-year-old wedding dress returned,"The dress pictured safely back at the family home in East Lothian A 150-year-old antique wedding dress that was lost after a dry cleaners went bust has been given back to its family. Tess Newall, 29, of Morham, East Lothian, had worn the dress - belonging to her great-great grandmother - when she got married in June last year. However, after it was booked in to be cleaned by Kleen Cleaners in St Mary Street, Edinburgh, it went missing. Mrs Newall's father, Patrick Gammell, confirmed to the BBC that the dress had now been returned. It was handed back to the family on Monday by two officials from the sequestrators dealing with Kleen Cleaners financial affairs. Mr Gammell said he and his wife were ""petrified"" to let it out of their sight again. The 61-year-old, who is the Vice Lord-Lieutenant of East Lothian, told BBC Scotland's news website: ""We are thrilled finally to have my wife's family's wedding dress back safely in our hands. ""This has been in no small part due to the media interest in which the BBC helped considerably, for which we are very grateful."" He added: ""We are petrified to let it out of our sight now and I think my wife, Sally, is going to try to clean it herself instead of sending it somewhere again."" After theBBC highlighted the dress's disappearance, it was found ""in a crumpled heap"" at the closed shop. This video can not be played Heirloom dress found after bride's plea Mrs Newall, who married Alfred Newall, 30, in East Lothian, said she was ""absolutely over the moon"" at the discovery. The dress was sent to be dry cleaned in September and the shop shut in October. The business is now being dealt with under Scottish bankruptcy law in a process known as sequestration. An AiB spokeswoman said: ""Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) was appointed as trustee in this case. ""Wylie & Bisset were allocated the case in October 2016 to administer on AiB's behalf and handled the closure of the Kleen Cleaners dry cleaning business in Edinburgh. ""In a bankruptcy, the whole estate of the debtor vests with the trustee, with specific exceptions laid down in law. ""When business is involved in a bankruptcy, it is normal practice to immediately close down the trading premises and investigate and identify assets of the bankruptcy."" She said in these circumstances attempts are made to notify customers of the bankruptcy and return any items that belong to them. She added: ""At the commencement of a bankruptcy, a bankrupt individual will complete a questionnaire to disclose assets, income, creditors and other information. ""This will be used as a starting point for the trustee to establish the value of the estate and the extent of liabilities. The trustee will not seek to realise assets unless satisfied he is entitled to do so.

Crime and punishment divides press,"Several papers concern themselves with matters of crime and punishment, as Justice Secretary Liz Truss prepares to deliver a speech rejecting calls for cuts in the number of people in prison. The Daily Telegraph reports that Ms Truss will say it would be dangerous,externalto public safety if the number of inmates went down, simply to meet a target. The paper describes the forthcoming speech as a ""rebuke"" to Labour, which had called for the prison population to be reduced by half. The Daily Express praises the justice secretary's approach,external, calling it a ""forceful riposte"" to Labour's ""softly, softly"" attitude. While the Express acknowledges that rehabilitation is vital, it says Ms Truss's assertion that ""public protection is paramount"" cannot be said often enough. An editorial in the Times,external, though, cautions that prisons in England and Wales are ""full to bursting"" and will breed more violence and criminality if ministers fail to tackle overcrowding. The paper urges the justice secretary to revisit sentencing guidelines, which are ""keeping too many people inside for too long"", as the only way to repair what it calls a broken system. Writing in the i,external, commentator Ian Birrell challenges politicians to ""defy the media"" and adopt some radical new approaches. He argues that tougher sentencing is rarely the answer. When it comes to knife crime, for example, he says the threat of prison does not deter ""scared or silly people from carrying these weapons, just as prohibition of drugs fuels gangsterism"". ""What a waste!"" proclaims the front of theDaily Mail,external. The paper accuses government ministers and officials of a series of blunders that have cost the public Â£5.5bn in two years. The Mail has analysed the accounts of Whitehall's 20 departments. It says the biggest money waster was the Ministry of Defence, which wrote off almost Â£2bn - including Â£11m on two RAF drones that crashed during testing. Another Â£1m went on x-ray equipment which was intended to screen passengers for TB at two airports but was then scrapped after a change in policy. The paper laments a combination of ""blunder, muddle and incompetence"", and describes such ""arrant waste"" as an insult to taxpayers. The Sun reportshow a man it calls  an ""Albanian murderer"",externalwas deported from the UK but managed to sneak back in under the noses of the ""bungling"" Border Force. It says the ""violent criminal"" was kicked out of the UK in 2009 when he was found to have escaped from prison in Albania. He is pictured apparently running a car wash business in Leicestershire. The paper's leader column says the case ""beggars belief"", and exposes how vulnerable Britain's borders are. While variety may be the spice of life, theTimes reports that bland uniformity is more the order of the day,externalfor millions of us when it comes to lunch. A survey suggests that more than three-quarters of office workers have eaten the same midday meal for the past nine months. More than seven in ten of the unimaginative diners said eating the same thing was ""easy"". In the most extreme example, one respondent reported eating a ham sandwich and a piece of fruit every day since they started work 20 years ago.

NewsbeatAshley Biden launches fashion line,"Ashley Biden, former vice-president Joe Biden's daughter, has launched a new clothing line that should please President Trump. Livelihood is 100% made in the USA and proceeds will go to help underserved communities across the country. American manufacturing is abig thingfor the president so he's got to be pretty happy, right? In contrast, items from Trump's daughter Ivanka's fashion line were made in China and shipped in. And the range, which Ivanka lends her name to, has now beendropped by Nordstromafter falling sales. Some say that it was the result of a campaign which urged customers to boycott firms which have supported the Trumps. It comes as no real surprise that a social worker has launched a clothing line which financially supports struggling areas in society. Ashley grew up working in communities who are lacking resources and shetold Teen Vogue,externalthat local boards will be created to decide what initiatives need the funding the most: ""I want a janitor, a school teacher, the local pastor, whomever is involved in the community to sit at the table and to pick the projects for economic development."" The launch of the fashion line was the first time Joe Biden has made a public appearance since handing over the VP title to Mike Pence and he was understandably supportive of Ashley. ""My daughter's commitment to public service, her commitment to trying to change the world for the better, is more intense than even mine has been,"" he said. That's pretty high praise from a man who President Obama gave thePresidential Medal of Freedomto, for ""faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and a lifetime of service that will endure through the generations"".

Creating a new forehead,"Lucy had to have surgery at the craniofacial unit to have her skull shortened Every year, more than a thousand children with facial abnormalities are treated at the Oxford Children's Hospital's pioneering craniofacial unit. The work carried out by the world-class team is quite simply life-changing. ""When you've got an odd-shaped head, children are probably more ruthless and cruel,"" says Tom Bowran, whose baby daughter Lucy is being treated at the unit at John Radcliffe Hospital. ""The name-calling, the possibility you'll miss out on something, the bullying even to a late age... that was something I was so keen that Lucy avoided. I wanted her to have as good a quality of life as any parent would."" Tom is watching Lucy go through a similar experience to the one he had as a child. Lucy was seven weeks old when Tom and his wife Hanna, who are from Cambridge, were told she had sagittal synostosis. The top plates on her skull had fused, stopping it from growing properly, and she had to be referred to the specialist department. ""I was absolutely terrified,"" Hanna says. ""The fact that her dad had something similar and that was his worst fear, that Lucy would end up with anything like that. ""The hospital squeezed us in straight away and they've been absolutely brilliant... they've been holding her hands every step of the way."" Tom Bowran, pictured with wife Hanna, had a similar condition to his daughter as a child David Johnson is head of the unit and a consultant plastic surgeon. His department sees about 1,200 patients each year and carries out up to 100 complex procedures in that time, making it one of the busiest units of its kind in the world. ""Lucy's skull has not been able to grow very well from side to side, and has been forced to grow in a long and narrow fashion,"" he explains. ""The operation was to shorten her skull by taking the bone off the front and the bone off the back... reshaping that bone and fixing it back in position again."" Hanna says knowing the surgery had gone to plan ""was the best feeling in the world"". As a result Lucy lost the ""big forehead... the funny shape at the back, and she looks completely different"". ""More importantly it's given her brain the room to grow that it needs."" ""Yesterday was possibly the longest seven hours of my life waiting for her to come through the operation,"" Tom says. ""Just knowing what she was going through and the potential risks that had been spelt out. ""It was a big relief seeing the reassuring faces and Mr Johnson with his smiley face telling us he was delighted with the progress."" This video can not be played The surgeon who rebuilds children's skulls Staff are used to designing new operations from scratch to solve challenging cases More than 25 people work on Mr Johnson's team and they are used to solving challenging cases, some affecting only one child in tens of thousands. Their expertise is valued by the Department of Health, and the unit receives specific funding because of its designation as of one of the NHS's ""highly specialised services"". Anthony Carter, father of two-year-old Brianne, remembers when his family first met the elite team. ""There were 10 people including Mr Johnson in there and it was so scary,"" says Mr Carter, who is from Wiltshire. ""It then hit us how serious it was. Then we went through each individual person, and they each explained, and we were a bit more at ease."" Brianne has an extremely rare condition called cranio-fronto-nasal dysplasia The first task for doctors was to repair Brianne's cleft lip Then in June 2016 she had an operation to reconstruct her skull ""We have to look at doing unique and novel things for individuals,"" Mr Johnson explains. ""There are many examples where I've been doing things for the very first time, and a lot of conditions where we're having to think on our feet and almost design new operations from scratch. ""That in a way is one of the most challenging things of my job, but also one of the most rewarding."" Brianne has an extremely rare condition called cranio-fronto-nasal dysplasia. She was born with a flatness on one side of her forehead, a cleft lip and palate, and a complex craniofacial cleft, leaving her with a gap in the bones forming in her face. She's the only child in the UK with this set of issues. ""All the scans are quite strange to see... the work and detail that has gone into piecing the jigsaw puzzle of her head,"" Anthony says. Brianne, pictured with dad Anthony, enjoys playing during hospital visits Mr Johnson describes the complex eight-hour procedure as akin to ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"". ""I created a new forehead based on a piece of bone on the top of her skull, and her old forehead has been cut up into little pieces and placed back where the new forehead's come from."" It has bought Brianne time, but she will still require a serious procedure when she is about 10 years old, to move her eye sockets closer together. Unfortunately, the day after Brianne returned home she fell off a sofa on to her head. She had a seizure, and had to be flown to hospital by air ambulance. It is a reminder why so many families that use the unit - and who often stay there for extended periods - take things one day at a time. CT scans are used to solve the ""jigsaw puzzle"" of irregularly-shaped skulls But Stephanie says her daughter, who has since recovered from her fall, loves visiting the unit, which takes pride in its welcoming atmosphere. ""She gets so excited when we pull in, it's like we're taking her to a theme park.""

Who's the only English top-flight scorer this weekend?,"Crystal Palace have taken just four point from eight games since Sam Allardyce took charge An unlikely sole English goalscorer, Burnley find home comforts again and is this the end of the Big Sam bounce? BBC Sport takes a look at the quirkiest and more interesting statistics from the weekend. With Gareth Southgate set to name his squad for next month's friendly against Germany soon, the England manager may have been an alarmed observer this weekend, as one after another, English strikers failed to find the net. Harry Kane started but barely threatened.Marcus Rashford and Danny Welbeck were reduced to cameo appearances. Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge were unused substitutes. And wildcard possibilities like Andy Carroll or Jermain Defoe were injured and off-form respectively. Not even the likes of Dele Alli, Adam Lallana or Theo Walcott got on the scoresheet, meaning no English player had scored this weekend before Sunday's late game between Swansea and Leicester. But it wasn't Foxes striker Jamie Vardy who finally broke the duck, asSwans centre-back Alfie Mawson produced a stunning volleyto become the only English goalscorer in all nine of this weekend's fixtures. Swansea signed defender Alfie Mawson for Â£5.5m from Championship side Barnsley this season Though perhaps Mawson, 23, should not be considered an unlikely scorer, having struck three times in his past six Premier League games, of which Swansea have won four. Indeed, no defender has scored more Premier League goals in 2017 than Mawson, with Chelsea' Marcos Alonso also scoring three times. Mawson is not the only symbol of Swansea's improvement under boss Paul Clement, as they possess - by one measure - the best midfielder in the Premier League this season. After his pass set up Martin Olsson for Swansea's second against Leicester, Gylfi Sigurdsson has now been directly involved in 16 goals this season, more than any other midfielder, in an even split of eight goals and eight assists. The Iceland international has scored three goals and assisted three others in Swansea's six games since Clement's appointment on 2 January, putting him ahead of perhaps more lauded names on the list. Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Lallana are close behind with 15 and 14 respectively, while the talents of Spurs pair Alli and Christian Eriksen, Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne are all tied on 13. In victory over Watford at Old Trafford on Saturday,Manchester United became the first team to win 2,000 points in the Premier League. It's no surprise the Red Devils got there first, given they have won 13 out of the 24 total Premier League titles to date but here is how they did it... Pos Team P W D L GD Pts 1. Manchester United 949 599 203 147 1,001 2,000 2. Arsenal 949 517 246 186 780 1,797 3. Chelsea 949 505 241 203 702 1,756 4. Liverpool 949 470 240 239 603 1,650 5. Tottenham Hotspur 949 388 247 314 143 1,411 6. Everton 949 343 275 331 47 1,304 It is no shock either that the top six are the only six clubs to have played in every Premier League season so far but Arsenal, in second for many years, may want to be wary of Chelsea bearing down on them before long. Manchester United have a fairly lengthy wait until they try for win 600, with Jose Mourinho's side not back in Premier League action until 4 March against Bournemouth. Most sides tend to prefer their home comforts - a vocal crowd, a familiar pitch, that ideal spot in the dressing room - but Burnley are taking that preference to remarkable levels at Turf Moor this season. A battling draw with runaway leaders Chelsea on Sundayis the 29th point Sean Dyche's side have claimed at home this campaign, as many as Arsenal have taken at the Emirates, and putting them fourth in the Premier League home table. Their home form has seen 12th-placed Burnley punch above their weight and all but secure their Premier League status, 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Every yin must have its yang though and Burnley's away record is in startling contrast to their home form, having taken only one point in 11 games so far before a run of four consecutive matches on the road. Travel sickness is a large factor in Leicester's alarming decline too - Sunday's defeat to Swansea meaning they are still yet to win away this season, with only three draws in 13 away games. Indeed, at the moment the Foxes do not look like picking up another point anywhere in 2017 as they are now the first reigning top-flight champions to fail to score in six consecutive league matches, having gone over 10 hours without a goal. No side in the top four tiers has won fewer points than Claudio Ranieri's side this calendar year - a draw against Middlesbrough in January giving the Foxes a solitary point, level with Aston Villa, Coventry City and Leyton Orient. Yet if there is to be solace for Leicester it is probable that, like Burnley, it will come at home. Both Leicester and Burnley are currently two of only six sides in Premier League history to have won more than 80% of their total points at home in a single season. On current trend, with a remarkable 96.7% of points (29 out of 30) at Turf Moor this season, Burnley could be set to smash their 2009-10 record of 86.7% (26 out of 30). Fortunately for Dyche, his team have already equalled that 2009-10 side's final tally of 30 points. Despite arriving at the Riverside with a free-scoring Romelu Lukaku and on a fine run, Everton's match with Middlesbrough was perhaps destined to end ina goalless draw. Boro have easily the meanest defence of the current bottom six, having conceded only 27 goals in 25 games - the same amount as seventh-placed Everton - despite being only two points above the relegation zone. If Aitor Karanka's side keep conceding at the rate of 1.08 goals per game, they will end the season with 41 goals against their name - and should they fail to beat the drop that would be comfortably the fewest number of goals conceded by a relegated Premier League side. That is of course only half the story with Middlesbrough, as they are also the most miserly team in attack this season, with only 19 goals. At a rate of 0.76 goals per game, they are on course to finish the campaign with just 29 goals - but there is precedent for staying up with such a sterile strike force. In the 1996-97 season, Leeds United finished 11th, six points clear of relegation, despite scoring 28 goals in 38 games. An ageing Ian Rush failed to fire after signing from Liverpool, while Brian Deane and Lee Sharpe were top scorers with just five strikes. Yet manager George Graham's defensive nous saw them cough up just 38 goals (six fewer than champions Manchester United) as they eased to safety. Can Karanka do the same? In finance, the 'dead cat bounce' is a small, short-lived recovery as the price of a stock declines. Football has its own theory - the new manager bounce, where a team's form improves after hiring a new boss and Sam Allardyce was once one of its finest proponents. Though just as the dead cat bounce gives way to further decline, perhaps we've seen the peak of Big Sam's survival skills. Defeat to Stoke on Saturdaymeans Allardyce's side have taken just four points from eight Premier League games since he replaced the sacked Alan Pardew. Allardyce has previously always won more than a point per game in his first eight in charge when taking over a Premier League side mid-season, in spells with Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and Sunderland. Whether or not his typical dead cat bounce is simply delayed, 19th-placed Palace find themselves in a relegation dogfight.

"Thanks, mum!","This video can not be played The woman using blockchain technology to prove where food comes from Jessi Baker thanks her mother for the inspiration to start her company, Provenance. Set up just a few years ago, Provenance says it is lighting a fire under the retail world. The company is based on an app that allows retailers and customers to see where a product comes from, from its origins to its point of sale. ""Behind every product is a complex chain of people and places and that's a really important part of why people buy things,"" Ms Baker explains. ""Provenance is all about making that information transparent to shoppers but also to businesses all along the supply chain."" Jessi Baker with her mother Jenny who inspired her business But it began with her mother Jenny. ""She's a pioneer of conscious consumption,"" Ms Baker says. ""She raised me, my brother and sister, to care about what we eat and buy, but also helped us understand from an early age where things come from. ""For a long time, I think most of our meals came from under one mile from our home in Wiltshire, vegetables from the garden and animal products from our neighbour's farm."" While training to be a manufacturing engineer, Ms Baker visited dozens of supply chains to see how different products were sourced and created. But the breakthrough came in 2013, when she was studying for a PhD in computer science and started to look into the emerging blockchain technology. ""You can think of a blockchain,"" Ms Baker says, ""as a shared data system that everyone can use in order to be able to trust information. What it's allowed us to do is to have a shared system of record that nobody can tamper with and everybody can see."" Provenance uses this technology to log and store every stage of a supply chain in a way that anyone can access. Provenance has staff in four countries around the world Now the company, which started as a part-time interest while Ms Baker was studying, has become a full-time business. She has put her PhD on hold, as she's busy running a company with 10 staff based in four countries: the UK, the US, France and Germany. ""We have no physical things apart from our laptops,"" Ms Baker points out. ""So we can move the team wherever we want to around the world."" The company started out working with small brands and, in July 2016, signed its first commercial client, the UK's fifth largest food and grocery retailer, the Co-op. Provenance is now helping the Co-op track fresh products through its supply chains. Customers can check the supply chain of a product on their phones in a shop using Provenance ""We've attracted lots of pioneering food and drinks businesses,"" Ms Baker says. ""It's as much about reassuring businesses that they are selling things that are correct and trustworthy as it is about consumers being able to understand that as well."" Provenance is built to tackle fraudulent claims about the ethical sourcing of products such as fish Provenance's first victory for sourcing ethical products came with a humble fish. In early 2016 in Indonesia, Provenance tracked the first fish on the blockchain. Working with a non-governmental organisation to certify a socially sustainable catch of fish, the company in effect created a digital passport for the fish. Provenance has now set up partnerships with tagging, DNA scanning and digital imaging companies to strengthen the connections between physical products and their digitised claims. As well as fish, Provenance now tracks other foods, such as eggs and dairy. It says that lots of products, not just food, can be tracked and sourced in this way. Chris Haley of Nesta says that blockchain technology is still immature But Ms Baker admits that there are still some issues with the scaling up of the technology. ""We're on the bleeding edge of a new technology and occasionally having to wait for it to get developed a bit more in order to be able to develop on top of it,"" she says. Another problem is the reputation of blockchains. ""The main challenge for Provenance is that it's being built upon a technology that is relatively immature,"" says Chris Haley, an analyst from innovation specialist, Nesta. This video can not be played Karishma Vaswani takes a look at blockchain and explains how it works ""There are still some risks that are unclear, but we're beginning to see blockchains being used in really quite a wide variety of applications.  It is potentially a much simpler way of transacting."" he says. But Ms Baker has a long-term vision. ""We are disruptive and we're trying to disrupt the industry for good."" she says. ""The ultimate goal of Provenance is that one day it will be impossible to buy a product that compromises your health and morals. Businesses that have very opaque supply chains and are not taking active steps to make them transparent should really fear us.""

Work to be done,"Matt Barrie was trying to help his mother set up a website It was doing a favour for his mother that gave entrepreneur Matt Barrie the idea for setting up a business that is now worth  more than A$400m ($300m; Â£243m). His company and website Freelancer has a simple concept - it connects people who have work they need doing with others who compete to do the task by submitting the fee they would charge. Founded just eight years ago in Sydney, today the website has more than 22.5 million users around the world, both freelance workers and those seeking their services. Jobs advertised on Freelancer include everything from help with building a mobile phone app, to writing a company report, designing a tattoo, and help with gaining publicity for something. US space agency Nasa has even used the website since 2015, allowing people to bid to help design items for the International Space Station, including a new robotic arm. It is a pretty good success story for a 43-year-old who admits that when he came up with the idea for Freelancer he was ""a broken man"". In 2006 Mr Barrie had walked out of his first start-up - a Sydney-based firm called Sensory Networks that made computer chips for security equipment. He was not feeling good. Site users submit photos from around the world - this one is from Maccu Pichu in Peru ""People used the product but everything was wrong with how we sold it,"" he says. Despite a blaze of publicity and the support of venture capitalists (VCs), the marketing proved too tough, and the company was struggling. So Mr Barrie quit. ""You feel you have let your VCs down, the board, your friends that you hired, your family,"" he says. Sensory Networks went on to survive without Mr Barrie, and was eventually bought by chip giant Intel in 2013 for $20m, but he says that back in 2006 he ""really felt like a failure"". Freelancer had humble beginnings After a few months of ""decompressing"", Mr Barrie was beginning to think about his next move when the 2007 global financial crisis swept in. ""The whole world was collapsing. Businesses weren't getting funded anymore. I thought, 'what am I going to do with myself?'"" he recalls. He decided to take advantage of the enforced downtime to build a website for his mother, a wholesale art and craft supplier. He wanted to include a directory of the stores she supplied, thinking it might encourage others to want to be included. The first Excel spreadsheet had 1,000 rows. Faced with that, Mr Barrie decided to outsource the data entry side of things to local kids. But even offering A$2,000 overall, nobody came running. ""I looked around, asked a few people, and they'd say, 'oh it's boring.' I'd reply, 'I know it's boring! That's why I want you to do it.'"" Matt Barrie broke the bell when the company floated in 2013 After four months Mr Barrie started searching online in desperation for cheap data entry, and stumbled upon a site based in Sweden called Getafreelancer. ""It was the ugliest site you have ever seen in your life. I eventually figured out how to post a job,"" he says. ""I went to get lunch, and came back to 74 emails from people saying you're offering A$2,000, I'll do it for A$1,000, A$500 and so onâ¦ I thought it was a scam."" He eventually hired a team in India who did the job in three days for A$100. ""I thought was incredible, a whole army of people out there, many from emerging markets. I looked at all the projects on the website. It was like an ebay for jobs. I thought wow. Matt's colleagues had fun when he was on the cover of Australian business magazine BRW Mr Barrie was so impressed by the concept that he decided to set up his own version. The VCs who had flocked to his first start-up were far more cautious this time round, and banks were unwilling to loan to a web-based business with no physical, recoverable assets in the event of failure. In the end a friend who had sold his own firm stumped up the money, and Mr Barrie first secured workers via Getafreelancer, before then buying that business. Freelancer, whose entire operation is cloud-based using Amazon Web Services, has since gone on to buy up 18 other rival sites. Its directly employed workforce now totals 570 people. Sites like Freelancer have faced criticism for driving down prices for professionals trying to sell their services, but Mr Barrie counters that the company has had a huge, positive impact on millions of people in developing countries. ""You can be somewhere where your average wage is A$2 a day,"" he says. Matt Barrie says he is a workaholic ""The average project [on Freelancer] pays A$200. ""You can make your month's salary in a few days. It's the ultimate meritocracy. It's up to you to figure out what you want to do."" And it is also not necessarily the lowest bidder who wins the job - Freelancer says that 47% of the projects on its site are awarded to ""the median bidder or higher"". Entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, co-founder of human resources software business Enterprise Jungle, says firms are increasingly looking to hire non-staff to complete projects rather than carry out the work in-house. ""Nearly 35% of today's total workforce is comprised of non-employee workers and this is set to continue to grow,"" she says ""Sites like Freelancer are therefore very well-placed to service both the growing on-demand labour force looking for work, as well as the corporates who are hiring them. ""It is an invaluable marketplace for talent, with an all-important rating system to weed out the poor or unreliable performers."" On a day-to-day basis Mr Barrie is, by his own admission, a workaholic. ""I live this, I breathe it. I get up in the morning and start work. I'm often in the office until 10pm. ""I've had several offers to sell - one formal. I had a good think, and said I couldn't think of doing anything else.""

Music's big night,"This video can not be played Highlights from the 2017 Grammy Awards The big story at the 59th Grammy awards wasAdele's victory over Beyoncein the best album category. Most observers had expected Beyonce's Lemonade - a politically-charged opus that tackles themes of gender and black identity - to race home with the prize. But Adele swooped in and stole it from under her nose, making her very much the Donald Trump of pop. Grammys 2017: As it happened Did Adele give Beyonce a Grammy? In pictures: Red carpet and performances The rise of Chance the Rapper Read Beyonce's powerful speech Adele fluffs George Michael tribute All the winners and nominees But what were the other big (and small) themes from the night? Here's a rundown. She lost all eight of the awards she was nominated for, but this picture of Rihanna with a hip flask tells us she didn't care. British star James Corden took over as Grammys host from rapper LL Cool J, and the difference couldn't have been more apparent. While LL was always affable, he didn't do much beyond delivering his links. James, in contrast, began the night by pretending to fall down a staircase (""this is a disaster!"") before launching into a rap about the gathered celebrities: ""This room is insane, It's filled with 'Oh, Gods!'  / Some of the faces like Madame Tussauds. ""Beyonce performing, the queen is here, dummy! / Slay the whole stage with twins in her tummy."" Later on, he performed an impromptu carpool karaoke (from inside a cardboard cut-out) with Neil Diamond, Jennifer Lopez and Jason Derulo singing a version of Sweet Caroline. And he lived every child's worst nightmare when he found dad Malcolm canoodling with model Heidi Klum in the audience. ""Dad, what are you doing with Heidi Klum?"" he exclaimed. ""Well, your mom and I have an understanding and I used my free pass tonight,"" replied Corden Senior. Politics was always expected to play a role in the ceremony, but it wasn't until Busta Rhymes took to the stage that things got serious. ""I'm not feeling the political climate right now,"" he growled. ""I just want to thank President Agent Orange for perpetuating all of the evil that you've been perpetuating throughout the United States. ""I just want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban. We've come together. We, the people."" He then launched into We The People - a collaboration with A Tribe Called Quest that rejects the politics of division. Surrounded by dancers in headscarves, the musicians brought their thunderous performance to a close with a chant of ""resist, resist, resist"". It wasn't the only political moment in the ceremony, but it was the most incendiary. Earlier Katy Perry, an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter, danced in a white pant suit and wore a ""persist"" arm band. Presumably this alluded to Elizabeth Warren's persistence in Congress this week, where she attempted to read a 30-year-old letter by Martin Luther King Jr's widow, criticising President Trump's nominee for attorney general. The president of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, also called on the President not to cut arts funding, saying Americans are ""constantly reminded about the things that divide us"". ""What we need so desperately are more reminders of all that binds us together,"" he continued. US singer Joy Villa, however, bucked the trend by whipping off a white gown to reveal a pro-Trump dress. Rock band Twenty One Pilots went trouser-less for their first ever acceptance speech. After winning best group performance for their hit song Stressed Out, singer Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun stood up, dropped their trousers and walked to the podium in their underwear. ""This story, it starts in Columbus, Ohio, it was a few years ago and it was before Josh and I were able to make money playing music,"" explained Tyler. ""I called him up and I said, 'Hey Josh, want to come over to my rental house and watch the Grammys?' As we were watching, we noticed every single one of us was in our underwear. ""Seriously, Josh said to me... he turned to me and he said, 'If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this.'"" While a heavily pregnant Beyonce was on stage killing it in an epic, nine-minute performance celebrating motherhood, Jay Z was on the front row looking after their five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. The father-daughter duo were beaming with pride throughout and gave Queen Bey a standing ovation. Jay Z's next album - For God's Sake Will You Go to Sleep, Game of Thrones Starts in Five Minutes* - is due for release in October. (* not a real album.) Adelemight have needed a do-overon her tribute to George Michael, but her sombre rendition of Fastlove (arranged by Batman composer Hans Zimmer, we understand) was a mournful masterpiece. Bruno Mars went the other direction, vamping up a cover of Prince's Let's Go Crazy to such an extent he seemed possessed by the spirit of the Minneapolis marvel. And The Time - Prince's arch-rivals in Purple Rain - showed us how songs the star cast off, such as their hit Jungle Love, could bring a moderately-sized house down. Those weren't the only stars we lost in 2016 of course, and the memorial montage would have brought a lump to any music fan's throat. If that wasn't enough, John Legend and Cynthia Erivo's tender cover of The Beach Boys' God Only Knows  -which soundtracked the segment - would have finished you off. It's hard to believe it, but in his lifetime David Bowie only won two Grammys: best music video in 1985 for Jazzin' For Blue Jean and a lifetime achievement award in 2006. That historical anomaly was corrected last night when the star won all five of the categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album for Blackstar and best rock song for its title track. Recording engineer Kevin Killen, who worked with Bowie on the album, expressed his relief backstage. ""It's kind of startling it's taken that long for an artist who's been so magnificent throughout his whole career,"" he said. Musician Donny McCaslin, who played on Blackstar, said it was ""unfortunate"" Bowie had not been nominated for the main prize, album of the year. ""Speaking artistically, it was clear he should have been nominated in one if not more of the major categories,"" he said.

Custody battle,"This video can not be played 'False promises in my child court battle' Two parents fighting legal battles for custody of their children paid thousands of pounds to a company providing ""McKenzie friends"" - people with no legal training who assist in court. But they were badly let down. Rupinder Randhawa had been feeling ""very low"" after her solicitor told her it was hopeless to pursue a court battle for custody of her children. The mother-of-four had wanted to fight the adoption of her youngest two children, instigated by social services. ""I was not in a great space,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, ""but I was still willing to fight for my children."" Then, she came across David Bright, who ran The Parent's Voice London, a service that provided McKenzie friends. Bright told Ms Randhawa he had ""never lost a case"" and charged her Â£480 a month, plus additional one-off charges, to work on her case as a McKenzie friend. She subsequently lost her case and is no longer fighting the adoption of her children. McKenzie friends can help people representing themselves in court to understand the legal process They are often used by people who cannot afford or do not want to use a solicitor Anyone can be a McKenzie friend. It does not require any legal qualification Most often they help claimants fill out forms, or provide advice on the legal process Increasingly, McKenzie friends are charging fees for their work After this, Bright asked Ms Randhawa for an additional Â£6,000 to pay for a book to be published about her case, which he said would help her win her children back. She paid him, but no book was ever published. ""I felt like I'd been conned,"" she said. ""I felt my whole world came crashing around me, because there was no hope in getting my children back."" Bright was a director of The Parents' Voice, and both he and fellow director Claire Mann were jailed last year for perverting the course of justice in a case separate to Ms Randhawa's. Bright denies any wrongdoing, and says he and The Parents' Voice ""helped hundreds of families"". Claire Mann and David Bright acted as directors for The Parents' Voice When families break up and there is a dispute over the custody of children it can end up in the family court. But since changes to legal aid in 2013, it is more difficult for parents to get funding to help with their costs in these cases - which is why some are turning to McKenzie friends as a cheaper alternative. There is presently no regulation of these services. Stephen - not his real name - came across the The Parents' Voice after his marriage broke down and his ex-wife took custody of their children. He said Bright initially ""just sang to my ears"". ""He told me exactly what I wanted to hear,"" Stephen said. ""He asked me if I wanted custody. He asked me how much I wanted to see the kids."" But, he said, Bright took more than Â£12,000 from him, by charging him twice and for work he did not do. Richard Miller is concerned that some McKenzie friends advertise themselves as lawyers Both Stephen and Ms Randhawa won county court judgements against David Bright and The Parents' Voice, for more than Â£10,000 each for work that was not carried out. There have also been several other successful claims against the company. Jenny Lewington worked  for The Parents' Voice as a McKenzie friend before stopping in a dispute over payment. She was also disturbed by some of David Bright's working practices. ""I'd gone to the hearing with a mother who was trying to appeal an adoption and [David Bright] had submitted the wrong form to apply for the appeal,"" she said. Mrs Lewington said he had then told her he ""did it to try and delay matters"". Ultimately the mother lost her case, and Mrs Lewington felt The Parents' Voice had given her false hope that she could win. Senior judges have been considering making changes to the way paid-for McKenzie friends operate. Among proposals in a consultation last year was the introduction of a code of practice. The Law Society, which represents solicitors, has called for a ban on McKenzie friends being able to recover costs in court cases, to underline the fact that they are different to solicitors or barristers. Richard Miller, from the Law Society, said: ""One of our concerns about the rise in paid-for McKenzie friends is that a lot of these people are effectively acting as lawyers and advertising themselves as lawyers. ""But they do not have legal training and legal qualifications, and they do not have the duties to the court that a qualified lawyer does.""

Tim Harford: Money via mobile - The M-Pesa revolution,"M-Pesa now has about 20 million users in Kenya When 53 police officers in Afghanistan checked their phones in 2009, they felt sure there had been some mistake. They knew they were part of a pilot project to see if public sector salaries could be paid via a new mobile money service called M-Paisa. But had they somehow overlooked the detail that their participation brought a pay rise? Or had someone mistyped the amount to send them? The message said their salary was significantly larger than usual. In fact, the amount was what they should have been getting all along. But previously, they received their salaries in cash, passed down from the ministry via their superior officers. Somewhere along the line, about 30% of their pay had been skimmed off. Indeed, the ministry soon realised that one in 10 police officers whose salaries they had been dutifully paying did not exist. The police officers were delighted to be getting their full salary. Their commanders were less cheerful about losing their cut. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Afghanistan is one of a number of developing countries whose economies are currently being reshaped by mobile money - the ability to send payments by text message. The ubiquitous kiosks that sell prepaid mobile airtime effectively function like bank branches: you deposit cash, and the agent sends you an SMS adding that amount to your balance. Or you send the agent an SMS, and she gives you cash. And you can text some of your balance to anyone else. It is an invention with roots in many places. But it first took off in Kenya, and that story starts with a presentation made at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 by Vodafone's Nick Hughes. His topic was how to encourage large corporations to allocate research funding to ideas that looked risky but might help poor countries' development. In the audience was an official for the United Kingdom's Department for International Development. DfID had money to invest in a ""challenge fund"" to improve access to financial services. And phones looked interesting. DfID had noticed the customers of African mobile networks were transferring prepaid airtime to each other as a sort of quasi-currency. So the man from DFID had a proposition. DfID would chip in Â£1m, provided Vodafone committed the same. That got the attention of Mr Hughes's bosses. But his initial idea was not about tackling corruption in the public sector. It was about something much more limited - microfinance, a hot topic in international development at the time. Hundreds of millions of would-be entrepreneurs were too poor for the banking system to bother lending them money. If only they could borrow a small amount - enough to buy a cow, or sewing machine, or motorbike - they could start their own business. Mr Hughes wanted to explore microfinance clients repaying their loans via SMS. Mobile phones allowed Africans to work around their often woefully inadequate landline networks By 2005, Mr Hughes's colleague Susie Lonie was in Kenya with Safaricom, a mobile network part-owned by Vodafone. She recalls conducting one training session in a sweltering tin shed, and the incomprehension of microfinance clients. Before she could explain M-Pesa, she had to explain how mobile phones worked. But once people started using the service, it soon became clear they were using it for much more than repaying microfinance loans. One woman in the pilot project texted some money to her husband after he was robbed, so he could catch the bus home. Others said they had used M-Pesa to avoid being robbed, depositing money before a journey and withdrawing it on arrival. Businesses deposited money overnight rather than keeping it in a safe. People paid each other for services. And workers in the city used M-Pesa to send money to relatives back home: much safer than the previous option, entrusting the bus driver with an envelope of cash. M-Pesa transactions now account for almost half of Kenya's GDP Ms Lonie realised they were on to something big. Just eight months after its launch, a million Kenyans had signed up to M-Pesa. Today, there are about 20 million users. Within two years, M-Pesa transfers amounted to 10% of Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) - now it accounts for nearly half. Soon, there were 100 times as many M-Pesa kiosks in Kenya as cash machines. M-Pesa is a textbook ""leapfrog"" technology: where an invention takes hold because the alternatives are poorly developed. Mobile phones allowed Africans to leapfrog their often woefully inadequate landline networks. M-Pesa exposed their banking systems, typically too inefficient to turn a profit from serving the low-income majority. The steel box that changed global trade How the barcode changed retailing The hidden strengths of unloved concrete The warrior monks who invented banking If you are plugged into the financial system, it is easy to take for granted that paying your utility bill does not require wasting hours trekking to an office and standing in a queue, or that you have a safer place to accumulate savings than under the mattress. About two billion people are still outside the system, though the number is falling fast - driven largely by mobile money. Most of the poorest Kenyans - those earning under $1.25 (Â£0.99) a day - signed up to M-Pesa within a few years. By 2014, mobile money was in 60% of developing-country markets. Some, such as Afghanistan, have embraced it quickly - but it has not even reached some others. Nor do most developed-country customers have the option of sending money by SMS, even though it is simpler than a banking app. Why did M-Pesa take off in Kenya? One big reason was the relaxed approach of the banking and telecoms regulators. According to one study, what rural Kenyan households most like about M-Pesa is the convenience for family members sending money home. But two more benefits could be even more profound. The first was discovered by those Afghan police officers - tackling corruption. In Kenya, similarly, drivers soon realised that the police officers who pulled them over would not take bribes in M-Pesa: it would be linked to their phone number, and could be used as evidence. Estimates suggest that Kenya's matatus - public transportation minibuses - lose a third of their revenue to theft and extortion. Will mobile phone-based payment systems cut fraud on Kenya's buses? In response, Kenya's government announced an ambitious plan to make mobile money mandatory on matatus - after all, if the driver has no cash, he cannot be asked for bribes. But many matatu drivers have resisted. Cash transactions facilitate not only corruption, but also tax evasion. When income is traceable, it is also taxable. That is the other big promise of mobile money: broadening the tax base, by formalising the grey economy. From corrupt police commanders to tax-dodging taxi drivers, mobile money could lead to a profound cultural change.

Co-op Bank running out of options,"After a near death experience in 2013 when Co-op Bank nearly went bust, it has been limping along ever since. It was kept alive back then when lenders wrote off their debts in return for a stake in the bank, in a so-called debt for equity swap, but it has been unable to earn itself back to health. It had been operating without the recommended shock absorbing capital for some time, the Bank of England told the BBC last week. This morning, the Bank welcomedCo-op bank's announcement,external. When a bank has too little capital it only has three realistic options. The first is to earn your way out of trouble. Retain any earnings you make to bolster the rainy-day kitty.  In this super-low interest rate environment we have seen since 2008, all banks have found it very difficult to make a margin between what they pay their borrowers and charge their lenders. In fact, this year the Co-op is expected to make a loss - after any earnings have been more than offset by the costs of sorting out old problems. The second is to get your owners to put in extra money. Those owners include the Co-op Group who own 20%, a group of former lenders, plus a few hedge funds. Although Co-op Group has not ruled out putting in extra money, it's a questionable use of funds for all of them, given that the bank is finding it hard to make a return for that investment for the reasons mentioned in option one. The third is to find someone else well placed to add four million customers to an existing business - one which is not so bedevilled by legacy issues and might be able to find some economies of scale. This list is not a long one but one name does suggest itself. The TSB, which was carved out of Lloyds to satisfy competition concerns over the scale of the Lloyds/HBOS merger. With 600 branches, it lacks the scale to compete against the Big Five and it has a very strong capital position with no legacy issues. Whether the bank would want to take on the problems of Co-op is questionable but it terms of brand (both have a local and ethical flavour to them) it might work. The TSB is currently focused on completing a complicated IT separation from Lloyds, but the BBC understands that at the right price it might consider it, Determining the right price will be hard as the amount of capital any buyer needs to sink into the Co-op is very far from clear.

Time for change in Saudi Arabia?,"Women are banned from driving in Saudi Arabia Ask about change in Saudi Arabia. The reply used to be: it will come, in its own way and in its own time, in the conservative kingdom. It was another way of saying it would take a long time - and might never happen. But, in Saudi Arabia now, talk of change is measured in months. ""I made a bet with a male colleague that the ban on women driving would end in the first six months of this year, and he said it would happen in the second half,"" a successful Saudi businesswoman says to me over lunch in the capital, Riyadh. ""But now I think it will happen early next year, and apply only to women over 40,"" she adds. This video can not be played Rocking out, Saudi-style That's a prediction you hear in Riyadh's royal circles too. Some even say younger women will be allowed to drive before too long. Change on every front is still slow and cautious in a culture where ultra-conservative religious authorities wield great influence, and many Saudis want to hold on to their old ways of living. But an accelerating pace is largely being forced on Saudi rulers and society by a dramatic change in fortune for the world's biggest oil producer. Oil and gas provide 90% of Saudi Arabia's income The crash in world prices for Saudi Arabia's black gold halved its revenues a few years ago and now shapes the hard choices and changes it must make in many parts of life here. ""It's been a one engine jet for decades,"" is how John Sfakianakis of the Gulf Research Center explains a country that depends on oil and gas for 90% of its income. ""Now it needs multiple engines."" Enter a new master plan, grandly titled Vision 2030, which was unveiled with great fanfare last year. Vision 2030 hopes to boost private sector growth It's stamped with the imprimatur of the 31-year-old Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who crafted the ambitious blueprint with a cast of highly paid foreign consultants. The deputy crown prince and those around him know that someday oil wells will run dry and, even before that, most people will be driving electric cars. ""It's absolutely necessary to get to Vision 2030 and our objectives,"" says the country's powerful Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih. The former CEO of the state oil giant, Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, Mr al-Falih even has the need to diversify written into his new title. He's the minister of energy, industry and mineral resources. ""Whether we get there in 2030, whether we get some of them in 2025, some of them in 2030, some of them in 2035, we'll see,"" he explains in a nod to a master plan with demanding benchmarks for every ministry. Saudi editor and writer Khaled Maeena points to a new accountability starting to emerge. ""Everybody is on the go, ministers bureaucrats and all, looking over their shoulders not to make mistakes,"" he says. Those at the top, he adds, must ""lead by example"". Two third's of Saudi Arabia's population is aged below 30 Salaries and lavish perks have been slashed in government jobs. The private sector is expected to provide one of the big engines for growth. It's still not up to speed. ""We're not hiring now,"" asserts a Saudi business executive who oversees a vast conglomerate of companies. ""And we're not selling to the government unless we're sure we'll get paid for our goods."" ""Vision 2030 is unlikely to reach its destination in 2030,"" a sceptical Saudi statistician replies when I ask for his view. Like most Saudis who criticise, he asks not to use his name. ""But at least there is a vision, and this time there are practicalities about how to achieve it,"" he adds, in a reference to previous schemes which never went anywhere. ""This is la la land,"" was the even more scathing assessment of another consultant. ""Is there a bureaucracy able to implement it and a readiness at the top to change their own lives?"" Many of Saudi Arabia's young are educated abroad The young deputy crown prince driving this plan, who is seen as the favourite son of 81-year-old King Salman, knows there's another clock fuelling pressure for change. Two-thirds of Saudis are his age or younger. Hundreds of thousands of them, men and women, were educated at the best western universities thanks to a generous scholarship programme started by the former King Abdullah. Now they're back, looking for work but also ways to spend their weekends in an austere culture where even cinemas are banned, Saudi restaurants are carefully segregated Under the rules, men can only sit with women if they are dining with their female relatives, or ""families"" as that section is known. But even since my last visit about a year ago, small but significant steps are visible. Gone from the streets of the capital are the notorious religious police, the Mutawa, who used to roam in a mission to ""prevent vice and promote virtue"" and were often accused of zealously abusing their powers. The deputy crown prince is credited with sorting this out. Many Saudis are excited at the prospect of more entertainment events Wealthy Riyadh residents speak excitedly of newly opened restaurants where seating arrangements are less strict and music blares loudly. ""We need to see women drivers and cinemas here,"" insists Waleed al-Saedan when we meet at one of the few public places where the speed of life truly picks up. ""Dune bashing"" in the desert provides one of the few legal thrills as Saudis rev the engines of sand buggies and SUVs to careen down the soft slopes of sand. Dune bashing is a popular sport in parts of the Middle East As is so often the case here, it's usually a men-only adventure. But a new General Entertainment Authority is on the case.  Despite its stern title, the people who run it are on a mission to bring some fun to Saudi lives, albeit within limits. No one is suggesting drinking and dancing. ""My mission is to make people happy,"" asserts the authority's chairman Ahmed al-Khatib, whose own serious demeanour is quickly brightened by a smile. A calendar of some 80 events ranging from art festivals to light shows and live music concerts is carefully prepared and implemented to avoid any backlash which could put the whole project at risk. Huge crowds turned out for a rare concert in January ""We will definitely provide things for the more open people and we will provide activities and things for the more conservative people,"" Mr al-Khatib explains, choosing his words carefully. Opening up more social freedoms isn't just about providing more fun. ""Seventy billion riyals are being spent by Saudis on holidays abroad,"" laments a Saudi tour operator who is trying to tempt Saudis to spend more of their time and money at home instead of fleeing to the bright lights of Dubai or London. Women are being encouraged to take part in Vision 2030 More profound changes like political reform, tackling a questionable human rights record, or easing a web of restrictions on women's lives aren't on the agenda. And at the same time as happiness is on the agenda, so is pain. This is a country where people have always lived with cheap petrol, without taxes, and free water and electricity. Saudi Arabia will have to diversify its revenue streams in the coming years Now subsidies are being cut and a sales tax introduced. A new ""Citizen's Account"" will help lighten the burden for poorer families, but Saudis are having to juggle their own finances now. ""Saudis have taken too much for granted for too long,"" insists Nadia al-Hazza, an engineer who used to work in the oil and gas sector who is now helping to get women involved in Vision 2030. She starts her presentations with a famous mantra from former US President John F Kennedy: ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."" So now Saudis are also being asked to do more, and faster, than they've ever been used to. ""We're like a turtle on wheels,"" says political observer Hassan Yassin.  ""We're moving in a faster way to try to meet local demands and 21st Century obligations."" Saudi women's rights video goes viral Can Saudi Arabia adapt to cheap oil?

It's tough being Spidey,"The Bafta awards had laughter, passion andplenty of politics. Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan. So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. ""Hopefully!"" ""It's been like a whirlwind,"" said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. ""I'm so happy everything seems to be working out."" The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. ""Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. ""So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!"" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. ""Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting,"" she said. ""That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone."" She didn't stop there. ""This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession,"" Viola continued. ""One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet."" Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. ""She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit,"" he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. ""There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. ""I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important."" ""I'm a little bit wobbly,"" confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. ""I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family."" Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. ""I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was,"" he laughed. ""My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing."" Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. ""It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute."" And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut ""for many months"" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. ""I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous,"" said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. ""I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. ""What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... ""I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble."" Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle. ""I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational,"" he chuckled.

Wetland turned into giant Lego model,"A number of Lego creatures including this dragonfly have already been created for the map A Lego-mad couple renowned for creatinggiant Christmas decorationsare using their love of the plastic bricks to raise funds for a wildlife project. Mike Addis and Catherine Weightman will use 500,000 bricks to create a 10m (32ft) 3D ""map"" of Cambridgeshire wetland the Great Fen, complete with Lego ""native species"". The land is part of a long-term Wildlife Trust conservation project. More than 100 people have paid to help build Lego creatures to go on the map. The Great Fen is a 50-year project to create a huge wetland between Peterborough and Huntingdon. The creatures, like this Lego longhorn beetle and froghopper, are about 10cm in length Managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, it is one of the largest restoration projects of its type in Europe. Working with organisations including Natural England and the Environment Agency, they aim to transform the land and conserve its wildlife. In the future, the Great Fen will include a fully-equipped visitor centre It will, of course, include toilet facilities which have already been created in Lego Eventually the Great Fen should cover 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres). About 55% of that land has been acquired so far. The idea for a fundraising and awareness-raising giant Lego model came about as Ms Weightman works for Natural England and colleagues were aware of her love of Lego creations. The 10m (32ft) x 5m (16.5ft) map base will be created on about 14 tables in the visitor centre at Hinchingbrooke Country Park from Sunday. Catherine Weightman with a few of the many boxes of Lego which will be used to make the map A Lego cardinal beetle is one of many which will be put on the map Ms Weightman and Mr Addis have already made a few creatures such as dragonflies and spiders to populate the map, as well as buildings including a proposed visitor centre for Great Fen, complete with Lego public toilets. A number of sold-out sessions later in the week will see members of the public build their own creatures which will be added to the base. Jo Dixon, from the Wildlife Trust, said: ""We aren't too particular, and if the odd dinosaur or alien turns up, we'll add it to the map anyway.""

Money via mobile: The M-Pesa revolution,"M-Pesa now has about 20 million users in Kenya When 53 police officers in Afghanistan checked their phones in 2009, they felt sure there had been some mistake. They knew they were part of a pilot project to see if public sector salaries could be paid via a new mobile money service called M-Paisa. But had they somehow overlooked the detail that their participation brought a pay rise? Or had someone mistyped the amount to send them? The message said their salary was significantly larger than usual. In fact, the amount was what they should have been getting all along. But previously, they received their salaries in cash, passed down from the ministry via their superior officers. Somewhere along the line, about 30% of their pay had been skimmed off. Indeed, the ministry soon realised that one in 10 police officers whose salaries they had been dutifully paying did not exist. The police officers were delighted to be getting their full salary. Their commanders were less cheerful about losing their cut. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Afghanistan is one of a number of developing countries whose economies are currently being reshaped by mobile money - the ability to send payments by text message. The ubiquitous kiosks that sell prepaid mobile airtime effectively function like bank branches: you deposit cash, and the agent sends you an SMS adding that amount to your balance. Or you send the agent an SMS, and she gives you cash. And you can text some of your balance to anyone else. It is an invention with roots in many places. But it first took off in Kenya, and that story starts with a presentation made at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 by Vodafone's Nick Hughes. His topic was how to encourage large corporations to allocate research funding to ideas that looked risky but might help poor countries' development. In the audience was an official for the United Kingdom's Department for International Development. DfID had money to invest in a ""challenge fund"" to improve access to financial services. And phones looked interesting. DfID had noticed the customers of African mobile networks were transferring prepaid airtime to each other as a sort of quasi-currency. So the man from DFID had a proposition. DfID would chip in Â£1m, provided Vodafone committed the same. That got the attention of Mr Hughes's bosses. But his initial idea was not about tackling corruption in the public sector. It was about something much more limited - microfinance, a hot topic in international development at the time. Hundreds of millions of would-be entrepreneurs were too poor for the banking system to bother lending them money. If only they could borrow a small amount - enough to buy a cow, or sewing machine, or motorbike - they could start their own business. Mr Hughes wanted to explore microfinance clients repaying their loans via SMS. Mobile phones allowed Africans to work around their often woefully inadequate landline networks By 2005, Mr Hughes's colleague Susie Lonie was in Kenya with Safaricom, a mobile network part-owned by Vodafone. She recalls conducting one training session in a sweltering tin shed, and the incomprehension of microfinance clients. Before she could explain M-Pesa, she had to explain how mobile phones worked. But once people started using the service, it soon became clear they were using it for much more than repaying microfinance loans. One woman in the pilot project texted some money to her husband after he was robbed, so he could catch the bus home. Others said they had used M-Pesa to avoid being robbed, depositing money before a journey and withdrawing it on arrival. Businesses deposited money overnight rather than keeping it in a safe. People paid each other for services. And workers in the city used M-Pesa to send money to relatives back home: much safer than the previous option, entrusting the bus driver with an envelope of cash. M-Pesa transactions now account for almost half of Kenya's GDP Ms Lonie realised they were on to something big. Just eight months after its launch, a million Kenyans had signed up to M-Pesa. Today, there are about 20 million users. Within two years, M-Pesa transfers amounted to 10% of Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) - now it accounts for nearly half. Soon, there were 100 times as many M-Pesa kiosks in Kenya as cash machines. M-Pesa is a textbook ""leapfrog"" technology: where an invention takes hold because the alternatives are poorly developed. Mobile phones allowed Africans to leapfrog their often woefully inadequate landline networks. M-Pesa exposed their banking systems, typically too inefficient to turn a profit from serving the low-income majority. The steel box that changed global trade How the barcode changed retailing The hidden strengths of unloved concrete The warrior monks who invented banking If you are plugged into the financial system, it is easy to take for granted that paying your utility bill does not require wasting hours trekking to an office and standing in a queue, or that you have a safer place to accumulate savings than under the mattress. About two billion people are still outside the system, though the number is falling fast - driven largely by mobile money. Most of the poorest Kenyans - those earning under $1.25 (Â£0.99) a day - signed up to M-Pesa within a few years. By 2014, mobile money was in 60% of developing-country markets. Some, such as Afghanistan, have embraced it quickly - but it has not even reached some others. Nor do most developed-country customers have the option of sending money by SMS, even though it is simpler than a banking app. Why did M-Pesa take off in Kenya? One big reason was the relaxed approach of the banking and telecoms regulators. According to one study, what rural Kenyan households most like about M-Pesa is the convenience for family members sending money home. But two more benefits could be even more profound. The first was discovered by those Afghan police officers - tackling corruption. In Kenya, similarly, drivers soon realised that the police officers who pulled them over would not take bribes in M-Pesa: it would be linked to their phone number, and could be used as evidence. Estimates suggest that Kenya's matatus - public transportation minibuses - lose a third of their revenue to theft and extortion. Will mobile phone-based payment systems cut fraud on Kenya's buses? In response, Kenya's government announced an ambitious plan to make mobile money mandatory on matatus - after all, if the driver has no cash, he cannot be asked for bribes. But many matatu drivers have resisted. Cash transactions facilitate not only corruption, but also tax evasion. When income is traceable, it is also taxable. That is the other big promise of mobile money: broadening the tax base, by formalising the grey economy. From corrupt police commanders to tax-dodging taxi drivers, mobile money could lead to a profound cultural change.

She may look cute...,"This video can not be played A heavy metal-loving panda full of rage is a new character Japanese working women can identify with Being kawaii - or cute - is a huge part of being a good Japanese girl, but what happens when you finally grow up? For decades Hello Kitty was Japan's ambassador of cute, but now an angry red panda is channelling the frustrations of ordinary working women. In Japan, girls are taught etiquette from a young age and often much more strictly than boys. It's not just about your appearance, but also how you behave. The Japanese firm most closely associated with kawaii products, Sanrio, understands this all too well. It can take credit for the global phenomenon that is Hello Kitty, the well-mannered kitten which Sanrio claims is actually a British schoolgirl, despite being seen as perhaps the most quintessentially Japanese thing ever. She even appears in educational videos to teach children about manners. But recently the company has introduced  a character with a somewhat different approach to life. Aggressive Retsuko - or Aggretsuko -  is a 25-year-old red panda who works a mundane office job. Aggretsuko is far from the cute Hello Kitty stereotype Sanrio is also responsible for Her appearance is cute, but when she gets angry at her boss or colleagues her face transforms until it becomes a made-up mask somewhat reminiscent of American glam metal band Kiss. ""I'll quit one day anyway!!! This is not my fate!!!"" she screams inside, as her boss piles up more paperwork on her desk. After work, she goes to karaoke alone and sings metal songs with lyrics complaining about her day. ""She reminds me of myself when I was 25,"" said Reika Kataoka who is now a stay-at-home mother. ""I used to spew venom like that at work."" Aggretsuko hates her job ""Japanese girls suffer from a social structure where we are supposed to act properly,"" a cross-dressing singer who goes by the stage name Charlie Shikazaki and works as a researcher by day, told the BBC. ""But many of us have two sides. They might look cute on the outside but can be aggressive inside. Sanrio shows this kind of girls quite well with Aggretsuko,"" she explained. In a society which puts a lot of value on politeness, you don't often see people expressing raw emotions in public and the Japanese language doesn't have equivalents to the everyday profanities you might hear muttered at work in English. She spends much of her time on the edge of rage So how was Aggretsuko created? It was in fact through a popular vote of characters submitted by Sanrio staff and others. The theme was ""salaryman"" or office workers. It clearly struck a chord. Sanrio says the designer, who goes by the name of Yeti,  wants to remain anonymous. But through the company's corporate communications department, the designer said: ""I observed office workers who are at the centre of Japan's corporate culture and I could hear their heartfelt screams."" ""Japan's working environment often becomes an issue and I think there are many people who are enduring a lot of stress,"" Yeti added. It is a subject being debated in Japan at the moment as just last month, the chairman of Japan's top advertising agency Dentsu resigned to take responsibility for the death of a 24-year-old employee. Matsuri Takahashi who took her own life on Christmas Day in 2015, after complaining about excessive working hours. Her death is part of a phenomenon known as karoshi, or ""death from overwork"", which was first recognised 30 years ago. When we asked  Japanese women what their Aggretsuko moment is, their most uncute habits, they were certainly forthcoming. Singer Charlie Shikazaki says she got tired of the pressure to seem feminine Ms Shikazaki said it was the pressure to look cute and behave appropriately that drove her to start singing in a band dressed as a man one year ago. It was ""to express my feelings and emotions"". ""Because I used to teach at universities, the reaction from my former students has been overwhelming - like 'what on earth happened?',"" she said. ""I sing in both London and Tokyo but I find that people in London accept me without any hesitation."" ""But in Japan, I don't really expect them to understand so I haven't told many people who I used to work with,"" she added. Aggretsuko drowns her sorrows with beer and heavy metal - most unladylike For communications specialist Momo Ohmura, it is about what she eats and drinks. ""People say what I order at restaurants isn't cute,"" she said. ""I like things like dried fish and inner organs like chicken liver. I also love Japanese sake - even more than champagne!"" Kawaii ladies are allowed to drink in Japanese society, but being able to drink more than men is not something you'd show off to your boyfriend. Many Aggretsuko fans were surprised to find out that she was created by Sanrio. But she is not their first unconventional character. Gudetama or ""lazy egg"" was born in 2013 and suffers from crippling depression, spewing cold one-liners that reflect the dark realities of life. The character was seen as reflective of the younger generation's diminishing self-esteem and growing unhappiness. The character is occasionally cheerful, and even recently found love ""I always thought Sanrio's target audience was children but I wonder if they are targeting millennial or older people,"" said Ms Kataoka. Ahead of Valentine's Day, Aggretsuko appears to have fallen in love. In her weekly programme on broadcaster TBS, for once, she didn't get angry for an entire episode. While it is adorable to watch her being just cute, her many fans hope she will continue to vent her darker feelings even after finding the love of her life. This appears to be what more working women in Japan want licence to do. Snow-anime pop up around Japan Tokyo2020: When Japan's PM dressed up as Mario Fantasy food at Studio Ghibli show.

Breastfeeding toddlers,"Rebekah Ellis breastfeeds her baby son and three-year-old daughter Women who breastfeed their toddlers say they are either branded ""hippy earth mothers"" or seen as ""weird and disgusting"". Many have applauded model Tamara Ecclestone forbraving the backlashto post a photograph of herself breastfeeding her daughter, who is nearly three. TheNHS says,externalmost women in the UK wish they could breastfeed for longer than they do, yet onlyone in 200 mothersdo so past their baby's first birthday. Here, five mothers who carried on breastfeeding share their stories. Rebekah Ellis, 32, from Cambridge, breastfeeds both her six-month-old son and her daughter, who is three and a half. She says: ""The reaction from the NHS has been supportive, albeit surprised. The midwives who attended my son's birth at home said 'Good for you,' when my husband explained. ""Most people don't know that I am still feeding my daughter. I know that I would get a negative reaction from the vast majority. Even nursing past a year old is often seen as weird, disgusting - despite the WHO [World Health Organisation] recommendation [that children should be breastfed until the age of two or older]. ""When I nurse my son out in public (my daughter hasn't wanted milk during the day since the age of 18 months), I use a cover. This is more for me than for the benefit of others. ""People still look uncomfortable though, even when they can't see anything."" Kelly Lane, 38, from Redditch in Worcestershire, breastfed her daughter, now nine, and her son, now seven, until the age of two and a half. She says her confidence took a knock after a friend's husband criticised her, telling her it was ""pointless"" - but she carried on because she could see the health benefits for her children. She says: ""You do have to be dedicated to do it but I was happy to give that up for what was only a very short period of my life. ""The one quite hard thing is having a meal. I personally felt too uncomfortable to breastfeed in public and would use breast-feeding rooms or the toilet. ""But breastfeeding in toilets is horrendous - they're not hygienic, there's not enough space and you're conscious you are taking up space for someone who might be queuing. ""Both my children did not like having blankets thrown over them when feeding, as they like to look at Mummy and be talked to and, to be honest, rightly so. A child shouldn't be covered up when it's being nursed. ""I feel so sad that society is so negative and disgusted that a mother would be feeding her child the way nature intended in public, than actually congratulating her for doing a great thing. ""It's ok though for women to be up on billboards everywhere flashing every body part possible! The hypocrisy is astonishing!"" Tamara Ecclestone sparked a debate online with this photo Rebecca Alexander, 34, from Liverpool, still breastfeeds her son who will be three in April.  She says she loves Tamara Ecclestone's ""continued support and promotion of breastfeeding"". She told the BBC: ""I struggled feeding my elder daughter for more than three weeks first time around because of the lack of knowledge and support. Breastfeeding should be visible in our society. It's how we learn; by seeing others do it. ""I set out on this journey [with my son] thinking I would breastfeed till two years and then pump until four. ""When he has had big changes such as starting nursery, with a new childminder and me returning to work, breastfeeding has been his source of comfort and a way to reconnect after being apart all day. ""How anyone can see it as sexual completely shocks me, and I think it says more about our society, and the view of women than anything else."" Sarah Johnson, who breastfeeds her two-year-old son twice a day, says: ""I think it is a benefit for his health and also a nice bonding moment for us both, especially as I work away part of the week. ""I have decided to continue until he is ready to stop, but I am coming under pressure from family members to stop - grandparents - who say he is 'no longer a baby'. ""I tell them about the WHO guidelines for breastfeeding until two and beyond, but I guess in our Western culture you are seen as a hippy earth mother or odd if you still breastfeed a toddler - shame as in other parts of the world it is totally normal. ""When did something natural become unnatural? I don't judge mothers who choose to bottle feed, so would not liked to be judged either. ""Although the pictures [of Tamara Ecclestone] are rather posed, I commend her for posting them."" Sue Burgess, 57, from Oxford, breastfed her daughter until she was two and a half, and while she says she cannot understand why anyone would describe it as disgusting, she admits she only did it in public ""a handful of times"" as she found it ""embarrassing"". Although her daughter is now 16, Sue still cringes when she thinks about the ""worst time"" feeding her in a village square in Italy and feeling ""exposed"" as a solemn church procession took place close by. ""My daughter started to say 'A boo! A boo! A BOO!!!' at ever-increasing volumes, which was her way of asking for a breastfeed. I complied unwillingly."" Sue adds: ""Nonetheless, if other people feel the strength to take such experiences in their stride, I can only admire them.""

Italian tragedy,"This video can not be played Tiziana's mother Maria Teresa: 'I just want justice for my daughter.' It probably took no more than a few seconds for Tiziana Cantone to begin the sequence of events that led to her suicide. In April 2015, the 31-year-old from Mugnano, on the outskirts of Naples, sent a series of sex videos to five people via WhatsApp. The recipients included her boyfriend Sergio Di Palo, with whom she had an unstable relationship. The videos showed her performing sex acts with a number of unidentified men. ""She was beautiful but fragile,"" remembers Teresa Petrosino, a friend for 15 years. ""She was with the wrong people at the wrong time."" The videos were soon shared and uploaded to several adult websites. The physical actions on the tapes did not stand out. But a single sentence from Tiziana Cantone did. ""You're making a video?"" she asked the man holding the camera. ""Bravo!"" The words suggested an uninhibited young woman, who enjoyed being filmed during sex. By accident, the phrase gave viewers licence to watch the video without reservations: if she was so happy to be filmed, she wouldn't mind them watching. But Italians did more than watch. Users soon turned her comment into a meme-worthy punchline. Her image appeared on t-shirts and parody websites. No-one seemed to worry what the subject herself might think as she seemed so pleased about it. But this was a profound misunderstanding. Tiziana's mother remembers her as beautiful but vulnerable ""People confuse being an uninhibited person with wanting to go viral,"" says social commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. ""You can film a video, share it with some people but there's a tacit agreement that you won't share it further."" Tiziana Cantone, a fragile woman, was horrified. ""She and I never actually spoke about the details of the video,"" says her friend Teresa. ""I never saw them, and I never want to see them. You could tell she was suffering a lot. But she was strong."" Read more here:How Italians reacted to Tiziana's death Ms Cantone decided to fight back. But there was no immediate way to get the videos taken down. She took the case to court, arguing the tapes were uploaded to public sites without her consent. By this time, she was no longer able to live a normal life. ""She didn't want to go out as people would recognise her. She realised that the virtual world and the real world were the same thing,"" Teresa explains. ""She understood at some point that the situation would never be resolved; that a potential husband, her potential children could find those videos; that they would never disappear."" Tiziana's mother Maria Teresa is now devoting her life to defending her daughter's name Tiziana Cantone retreated to her family home in a quiet street in Mugnano, a working-class suburb of Naples. It took her mother, Maria Teresa Giglio, weeks to find the strength to tell reporters about her daughter's life. ""My daughter was a good girl but she was also vulnerable,"" she told the BBC. ""She lacked a paternal figure, from birth. She never met her father. This affected her entire life."" Mother and daughter lived together. In happier times, Tiziana listened to Italian singers, read novels and played the piano. But after the intimate videos were shared online, she withdrew. ""Her life was ruined, in front of everyone,"" says her mother. ""People made fun of her, parodies ended up on pornographic websites. She was called shameful names."" In September, a court in Naples ordered the intimate videos to be removed from several websites and search engines. But the court also ordered her to pay â¬20,000 (Â£17,200, $21,600) in legal costs. It was all too much. On 13 September 2016, Maria Teresa Giglio went to work at the local town hall. Her daughter stayed at home. Ms Giglio received a phone call at work. ""My sister-in-law called me, and in a calm voice told me to come home; when I got here I saw the police, the ambulance, and I quickly understood,"" she says, breaking down. ""My sister-in-law tried to pick her up and save her. My neighbours didn't allow me to get out of my car. I almost fainted. They didn't want to let me into this house. I wasn't even able to see her for a last time. ""The day she died, my life ended."" Italians were stunned by Tiziana's death and her funeral was widely covered by Italian media One day later, Maria Teresa Giglio buried her daughter in a white coffin. The notice outside the funeral described her as a ""sweet, beautiful, fragile angel"". There is a sad paradox at the heart of Tiziana Cantone's death. By taking her own life, she drew even more attention to the videos she hoped everyone might forget. Her mother has forced herself to watch the tapes. ""You can only imagine what it is like. I wanted to see details that would allow me to understand the truth. That was not my Tiziana,"" she says, convinced that her daughter was under the effect of drugs. She believes that the distribution of the videos didn't happen by chance. ""It's as if this was a premeditated, criminal plan. They just wanted to show the face of this poor girl, with the intention of exposing her on the internet."" Read more here: The Skype sex scam - a fortune built on shame Surprising reaction to Georgia politicians' sex tapes Sex, honour, shame and blackmail in an online world In particular, Ms Giglio wants her daughter's former boyfriend, Mr Di Palo, to explain exactly what role he had in the sharing of the videos. ""He didn't help me to save her life. But maybe he can help me get to the truth. I'm desperate."" In November 2016, prosecutors questioned Mr Di Palo for 10 hours. They wanted to know whether anyone was guilty of inciting Tiziana's suicide. Mr Di Palo declined our request for an interview. ""We refrain from making comments, out of respect for poor Tiziana who suffered so much due to the enormous publicity that her case received,"" says Bruno Larosa, Mr Di Palo's lawyer. ""We trust the courts and it should be noted that my client is not accused of anything."" In the aftermath of Tiziana Cantone's suicide, the tone of Italy's debate about pornography and privacy has changed. ""I think this case did make a difference, quite drastically, to the way that Italian journalists talk about these cases of revenge porn,"" says social commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. ""They used to have a very carefree approach, and her death changed it. In subsequent cases, one of them involving a celebrity, they were a lot more cautious."" But there is also a lesson for anyone who chooses to share intimate videos online. ""People think that their virtual life and their real life are parallel realities,"" warns Ms Lucarelli. ""They're not. They coincide. The web is our life. So anything that you don't do in real life you shouldn't do online."" Tiziana's mother wants her daughter's legacy to help other women in future Tiziana's videos can no longer be found on the main search engines but they still exist. Her mother wants Italy and the rest of the EU to agree a much faster way to get private material removed from the internet and make the big internet firms act responsibly. ""I speak on behalf of other mothers who may be suffering like me,"" she says. Italy's privacy tsar, Antonello Soro, agrees things have to change but does not specify what the government might do. ""We need a quicker response mechanism from different online platforms, but it is also necessary to increase respect online,"" he said in a statement. ""We need strong investment in digital education to promote a culture and sensibility that are adequate to the new online world."" For Tiziana's mother, life is now a fight to defend her daughter's name, and to prevent others from suffering the same fate. ""I hope that the name Tiziana Cantone, instead of standing for mockery, becomes a name that could save the lives of other women. I would like this to happen. To save other people.""

Awake under the knife,"Canadian Donna Penner was relaxed at the prospect of abdominal surgery - until she woke up just before the surgeon made his first incision. She describes how she survived the excruciating pain of being operated on while awake. In 2008, I was booked in for an exploratory laparoscopy at a hospital in my home province of Manitoba in Canada. I was 44 and I had been experiencing heavy bleeding during my periods. I'd had a general anaesthetic before and I knew I was supposed to have one for this procedure. I'd never had a problem with them, but when we got to the hospital I found myself feeling quite anxious. During a laparoscopy, the surgeon makes incisions into your abdomen through which they will push instruments so they can take a look around. You have three or four small incisions instead of one big one. The operation started off well. They moved me on to the operating table and started to do all the normal things that they do - hooking me up to all the monitors and prepping me. The anaesthesiologist gave me something in an intravenous drip and then he put a mask on my face and said, ""Take a deep breath."" So I did, and drifted off to sleep like I was supposed to. When I woke up I could still hear the sounds in the operating room.  I could hear the staff banging and clanging and the machines going - the monitors and that kind of thing.  I thought, ""Oh good, it's over, it's done."" I was lying there feeling a little medicated, but at the same time I was also alert and enjoying that lazy feeling of waking up and feeling completely relaxed. That changed a few seconds later when I heard the surgeon speak. This video can not be played When Donna Penner woke she thought the operation must be over They were moving around and doing their things and then all of a sudden I heard him say, ""Scalpel please."" I just froze. I thought, ""What did I just hear?"" There was nothing I could do. I had been given a paralytic, which is a common thing they do when work on the abdomen because it relaxes the abdominal muscles so they don't resist as much when you're cutting through them. Unfortunately the general anaesthetic hadn't worked, but the paralytic had. I panicked. I thought this cannot be happening. So I waited for a few seconds, but then I felt him make the first incision. I don't have words to describe the pain - it was horrific. I could not open my eyes. The first thing that I tried to do was to sit up, but I couldn't move. It felt like somebody was sitting on me, weighing me down. Accidental awareness during general anaesthesia is reported in around one in 19,000 operations Patients often cannot communicate they are awake due to the use of muscle relaxants Most waking events last for less than five minutes Forty per cent of those affected suffer moderate to severe psychological harm Waking is most likely to occur during a caesarean section or cardiothoracic surgery, or if the patient is obese ThisRoyal College of Anaesthetists leaflet,externalexplains more about why accidental awareness during general anaesthesia happens, what steps are taken to prevent it, and what to do if you think it has happened to you Source: The Royal College of Anaesthetists/Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland I wanted to say something, I wanted to move, but I couldn't.  I was so paralysed I couldn't even make the tears to cry. At that point, I could hear my heart-rate on the monitor. It kept going up higher and higher. I was in a state of sheer terror. I could hear them working on me, I could hear them talking. I felt the surgeon make those incisions and push those instruments through my abdomen. I felt him moving my organs around as he explored.  I heard him say things like, ""Look at her appendix, it's really nice and pink, colon looks good, ovary looks good."" I managed to twitch my foot three times to show I was awake. But each time, someone put their hand on it to still it, without verbally acknowledging I had moved. The operation lasted for about an hour-and-a-half. To top it all off, because I was paralysed, they had intubated me - put me on a breathing machine - and set the ventilator to breathe seven times a minute.  Even though my heart rate was up at 148 beats per minute, that's all I got - those seven breaths a minute. I was suffocating. It felt as though my lungs were on fire. There was a point when I thought they had finished operating and they were starting to do their final things. That's when I noticed I was able to move my tongue. I realised that the paralytic was wearing off.  I thought, ""I'm going to play with the breathing tube that's still in my throat."" So I started wiggling it with my tongue to get their attention. And it worked. I did catch the attention of the anaesthesiologist. But I guess he must have thought I was coming out of the paralytic more than I was because he took the tube and pulled it out of my throat. I lay there thinking, ""Now I'm really in trouble."" I'd already said mental goodbyes to my family because I didn't think I was going to pull through. Now I couldn't breathe. I could hear the nurse yelling at me. She was on one side saying, ""Breathe Donna, breathe."" But there was nothing I could do. As she was continuously telling me to breathe, the most amazing thing happened. I had an out-of-body experience and left my body. I'm of Christian faith and I can't say I went to heaven, but I wasn't on Earth either. I knew I was somewhere else. It was quiet. The sounds of the operating room were in the background, I could still hear them. But it sounded as though they were very, very far away. The fear was gone, the pain was gone. I felt warm, I felt comforted and I felt safe. And instinctively I knew I was not alone. There was a presence with me. I always say that was God with me because there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that he was there beside me. And then I heard a voice saying, ""Whatever happens, you're going to be OK."" At that point I knew that if I lived or died, it would be just fine. I had been praying throughout the whole thing to keep my mind occupied, singing to myself and thinking of my husband and my children. But when this presence was with me, I thought, ""Please let me die because I can't do this any more."" But just as quickly as I went there, I was back. In the time it takes to snap your fingers I was back in my body in the operating room again. I could still hear them working on me and the nurses yelling, ""Breathe Donna."" All of a sudden the anaesthesiologist said, ""Bag her!"" They put a mask on my face and used a manual resuscitator to force air into my lungs. As soon as they did, the burning sensation I'd had in my lungs left. It was huge relief. I started to breathe again. At that point, the anaesthesiologist gave me something to counteract the paralytic. It didn't take long before I was able to start talking. Later, as I recovered from the ordeal, the surgeon came into my room, grabbed my hand with both of his and said, ""I understand there were some problems, Mrs Penner."" I said to him, ""I was awake, I felt you cutting me."" His eyes filled with tears as he grabbed on to my hands and said, ""I am so sorry."" I started telling him the different things that I had heard him say - the comments he had made about my appendix and my internal organs. He kept saying, ""Yes I said that, I said that."" I said, ""Have you noticed that I have not asked you what the diagnosis was?'"" And he looked at me for a moment and said, ""You already know, don't you?""  And I said, ""Yes I do,"" and I told him what my diagnosis was. It's now nine years since I woke up during surgery. I have since pursued a legal claim against the hospital which was resolved. Prof Michael Wang, a clinical psychologist with a special interest inaccidental awareness during anaesthesia,external, feels that relying on patient reports is not an accurate measure Some studies have found the incidence of awareness during anaesthesia to be as high as one in 600 Prof Wang would like to see more studies using the controversial ""isolated forearm technique"" - it leaves the arm free to move so the patient can alert doctors Immediately after the operation I was referred to a therapist because I was so traumatised. I didn't even have a clue what day of the week it was on my first appointment. I was pretty messed up. It definitely takes its toll on a person. But talking about it has helped. After time, I was able to tell my story. I have done a lot of research into anaesthesia awareness. I contacted the University of Manitoba's anaesthesiology department and have spoken to the residents a couple of times now. They are usually horrified by my story. There are usually quite a few who have tears in their eyes when I'm speaking to them. My story is not to lay blame or to point fingers. I want people to understand that this thing can happen and does happen. I want to raise awareness, and help something good come out of this awful experience.

High Street tax and La La Land star,"Several papers concern themselves with matters of crime and punishment, as Justice Secretary Liz Truss prepares to deliver a speech rejecting calls for cuts in the number of people in prison. The Daily Telegraph reports that Ms Truss will say it would be dangerous,externalto public safety if the number of inmates went down, simply to meet a target. The paper describes the forthcoming speech as a ""rebuke"" to Labour, which had called for the prison population to be reduced by half. The Daily Express praises the justice secretary's approach,external, calling it a ""forceful riposte"" to Labour's ""softly, softly"" attitude. While the Express acknowledges that rehabilitation is vital, it says Ms Truss's assertion that ""public protection is paramount"" cannot be said often enough. An editorial in the Times,external, though, cautions that prisons in England and Wales are ""full to bursting"" and will breed more violence and criminality if ministers fail to tackle overcrowding. The paper urges the justice secretary to revisit sentencing guidelines, which are ""keeping too many people inside for too long"", as the only way to repair what it calls a broken system. Writing in the i,external, commentator Ian Birrell challenges politicians to ""defy the media"" and adopt some radical new approaches. He argues that tougher sentencing is rarely the answer. When it comes to knife crime, for example, he says the threat of prison does not deter ""scared or silly people from carrying these weapons, just as prohibition of drugs fuels gangsterism"". ""What a waste!"" proclaims the front of theDaily Mail,external. The paper accuses government ministers and officials of a series of blunders that have cost the public Â£5.5bn in two years. The Mail has analysed the accounts of Whitehall's 20 departments. It says the biggest money waster was the Ministry of Defence, which wrote off almost Â£2bn - including Â£11m on two RAF drones that crashed during testing. Another Â£1m went on x-ray equipment which was intended to screen passengers for TB at two airports but was then scrapped after a change in policy. The paper laments a combination of ""blunder, muddle and incompetence"", and describes such ""arrant waste"" as an insult to taxpayers. The Sun reportshow a man it calls  an ""Albanian murderer"",externalwas deported from the UK but managed to sneak back in under the noses of the ""bungling"" Border Force. It says the ""violent criminal"" was kicked out of the UK in 2009 when he was found to have escaped from prison in Albania. He is pictured apparently running a car wash business in Leicestershire. The paper's leader column says the case ""beggars belief"", and exposes how vulnerable Britain's borders are. While variety may be the spice of life, theTimes reports that bland uniformity is more the order of the day,externalfor millions of us when it comes to lunch. A survey suggests that more than three-quarters of office workers have eaten the same midday meal for the past nine months. More than seven in ten of the unimaginative diners said eating the same thing was ""easy"". In the most extreme example, one respondent reported eating a ham sandwich and a piece of fruit every day since they started work 20 years ago.

Prison undercover: The reporterâs story13 February 2017 (00:01:00),"This video can not be played Undercover footage shows prisoners incapacitated by drugs An undercover investigation by Panorama has revealed the reality of life behind bars in the crisis-hit prison system. From prisoner officers who say they've lost control to some inmates regularly taking drugs, undercover reporter Joe Fenton explains what it's like to work on the prison front line. Prison custody officer Joe Fenton, Her Majesty's Prison Northumberland - this was my life for two months as an undercover reporter for the BBC's Panorama programme. HMP Northumberland is a prison with a problem. Many problems in fact. And within hours of being in the job, I was to see astonishing examples of this. On my very first day, I was taken into a room with some of the other new recruits where we were shown a table covered in drugs. It was a massive find by prison staff - 2.5kg of a drug called spice - a much stronger, cheaper, synthetic alternative to cannabis. Spice is now one of the most popular illegal drugs used in prison. Prisoners told officers this find had barely scratched the surface. In my first week, I was responsible for escorting 70 prisoners but in reality, it felt like they were escorting me. I didn't really know where I was going and I just followed the prisoners, opening the gates for them. It didn't take too long to realise that the inmates were, in effect, running this prison. I saw prisoners stumbling around drunk, others who were high on drugs and some struggling to cope with addiction. On a standard 10-hour shift, the demands from prisoners were endless. The work didn't stop from the moment we got there to the moment we left. You just can't work five or six days solid there - it ruins you and you don't feel like a person any more, you just exist. The prison officers were all drained and with the constant demands from prisoners, I felt like I was working in a very busy hotel with a lot of angry guests. I've seen staff at their wits' ends and staff who are struggling to cope. Nurses attend to a prisoner who has taken the drug spice There were drugs everywhere in HMP Northumberland and I found myself walking through clouds of smoke, some of which were from prisoners smoking spice. Spice affected prisoners in different ways. Some would look a bit blurry-eyed. One reacted by moving his forearms around uncontrollably, his eyes completely vacant and his face expressionless. Officers called the nurses for this particular prisoner but they weren't called for every inmate who reacted badly to spice. It happens too often. The time officers had least control was during the couple of hours in the evening when prisoners were allowed to socialise - they could go into each other's rooms, close the door and even lock it from the inside, although we could then unlock it again. Often I would be alone on a landing and it wouldn't have been safe for me to challenge them by myself. I often felt that there was nothing I could really do if I suspected prisoners were about to deal or take drugs. Some officers told me they often don't confront prisoners because they are not confident backup will arrive if they are attacked. Prison officers have the power to challenge prisoners but the prisoners had lookouts and warning codes so they were often one step ahead. This enabled them to hide their drugs, put out their cigarettes or throw their mobile phone under the pillow. Those few extra seconds were all they needed. As in all walks of life you'll get people who can cope by themselves and those who need a little bit of help. It's the same in prison. I met one vulnerable prisoner who was being bullied - we're calling him John in order to disguise his identity. On one occasion, I witnessed him totally off his head while other prisoners watched, laughing - I suspect they had spiked his cigarettes with spice. He told me he'd previously had buckets of water thrown over him and had been burnt with cigarettes. It would be great if staff were there to look after these prisoners every step of the way but I felt there just weren't enough officers to protect people like John all the time. This video can not be played BBC Panorama spent two months inside one of the country's biggest prisons Prison officers repeatedly told me they had lost control of the prison. I saw officers worried about their safety and losing confidence. I witnessed one officer convulsing on the floor because he had inadvertently inhaled spice while patrolling a landing. It was hard to see this happening to a colleague, someone whose company I enjoyed. But this is what prison officers have to deal with and it wasn't an isolated incident. Sources have told us that at least three members of staff at this prison needed hospital treatment for inhaling spice smoke in the last seven months. And the drugs continue to flow in - prison officers told me that that's because of lapses in security. While working on one house block at HMP Northumberland, staff found black clothing, balaclavas and wire-cutting tools. I witnessed doors where the alarms weren't working and a hole in an internal security fence which would have allowed prisoners to collect drugs thrown in from the outside. I have a lot of sympathy for the prison officers I met while working at HMP Northumberland - there are many good people there trying to do a difficult job with limited resources. Prisoners are in prison for a reason and prisons must exist to both punish and rehabilitate. But from my experience, I didn't see much of either.

Has Facebook slipped up with VR?Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter11 February 2017 (01:47:53),"HTC Vive has been outselling the Oculus Rift I first tried the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in the corner of a drab conference room in Las Vegas. I was convinced within seconds - despite feeling a little dizzy - that the device, held together by duct tape and hope, was destined for big things. A year or so later, I met the same company, Oculus VR, in a (slightly) fancier room at the E3 gaming event in Los Angeles. ""Hold this,"" I said, abruptly thrusting an audio cable into the hands of a young man who I thought was helping out - but was in fact the company's chief executive, Palmer Luckey. Again, I was blown away by the technology. The next time I'd meet Luckey he'd be many, many millions of dollars richer, and Oculus would be a Facebook-owned company. But despite that very real marker of success, our topic of conversation each time we met remained the same: How are you going to convince people it's worth it? And isn't it going to be way too expensive? ""It isn't,"" he saidthe last time I asked him- but he's wrong. At around $600 (plus a powerful PC) to get started, it is too expensive. But money isn't the problem. The price of the technology will come down, and I'm still convinced virtual reality can be a success - but will it be Facebook's success? The company's strategy in this blossoming market is under question. Best Buy retreat This week we learned that demo stations set up in Best Buy - the huge US technology retail chain -are being rolled back due to poor foot traffic,external. Facebook has described the move as a ""seasonal"" change, but suffice it to say, if they were shifting units they'd still be there. Instead, 200 of the 500 stations across the US are being shut down. It's a potentially troubling moment for the company. Those who back virtual reality - myself included - always subscribed to the view that the key to selling them would be to get people to try it out. Once you've been in VR, we all assumed, you'd be hooked, and your wallet would follow soon after. Google's Daydream VR system could be a threat to Facebook's budget VR success But that doesn't seem to have been the case. For whatever reason, too few people were bothering to even try the demo, let alone buy the product. There are a few theories for this, but the most likely, in my mind, was suggested by NPR's Molly Wood. The problem, she observed recently, might be the ""pink-eye factorâ. She said,external: ""It could be as simple as - and I have said this a million times - not wanting to go into a store and put something on your face that has been on a bunch of other people's faces."" But that wouldn't explain why the Oculus Rift is apparently performing poorly against its closest rival. At the high-end of the virtual reality market, Oculus is up against HTC's Vive, an extremely capable device which has the involvement of Valve, the revered games publisher. Good enough Unofficial data (which I'm using as the companies themselves haven't shared sales figures with us) suggest that the Vive, despite being more expensive, is trouncing Oculus. Games research firm SuperData estimated that 420,000 Vive headsets were sold in 2016, compared to 250,000 sales for the Oculus Rift. The lower end of the market is far more positive for Facebook. The Samsung Gear VR runs the Oculus VR experience, and that is by far and away the most popular device for VR on the market today, according to SuperData. But the hardware is all Samsung's and, for the most part, the headset itself (a simple plastic frame with lenses) has beengiven awaywith many smartphones. The hope that the Gear VR might act as a kind of gateway drug into pricier VR experiences has yet to come to fruition. Or maybe it has, just not for Oculus: the middle ground in VR is Sony's PlayStation VR, $399 and works with the PlayStation 4. It's more powerful than the Gear VR, but less powerful than the high-end headsets. But here's where Facebook should be worried - it seems to be good enough for most gamers. And it's ""good enough"" that makes Facebook's strategy all the more precarious. Who is the Oculus Rift for, exactly? Super serious gamers are gravitating to the HTC Vive. Moderately serious gamers are happy with PlayStation VR. And at the budget end, the Gear VR, while popular now, faces a clear and present threat from Daydream, Google's new VR ecosystem which is far more open. While Gear VR insists you have a Samsung smartphone, Daydream is designed to eventually work with any sufficiently powerful Android device (and it wouldn't be too tricky to make it work with Apple's iOS, either). This compatibility comes at a price, mind - the Daydream View headset is far less comfortable, in my experience, than the Gear VR. But it's comfortable enough, and the little handheld controller provides a far more intuitive way of navigating the VR world than tapping blindly at the side of your head, a la Gear VR. Here comes Hugo So what are the next steps if Facebook is to get on top of this? I'd ask Palmer Luckey, but he's hard to reach at the moment - hidden away from public view after controversy surrounding his support of Donald Trump which involvedfunding a hateful trolling group,external. He still works at the company, but Facebook and Oculus have repeatedly refused to tell me what his job actually is. (Palmer, if you're reading... my Twitter direct messages are open!) The only public appearance he has made since that debacle has been to turn up in court where Facebook (unsuccessfully) defended against claims Oculus illegally used intellectual property belonging to games publisher Zenimax in the early days. A $500m bill for damages awaits,unless Facebook can win on appeal. Mark Zuckerberg has brought on ex-Google executive Hugo Barra In a recent earnings call, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is still incredibly enthusiastic about VR and what it means for his network's future, called for patience from his investors. ""It's not going to be really profitable for a while,"" he said. He's never claimed otherwise, it has to be said. VR appears on Facebook's 10-year strategy, a slow burner with potentially big rewards. But falling behind now would be a serious blow, which is why Zuckerberg has brought in Hugo Barra, a man most recently at Chinese firm Xiaomi, but before that, a major name at Google. He'll be in charge of Facebook's efforts in virtual reality from here on in. In Barra, Oculus gains both a visionary and a safe pair of hands. He  having worked on Android, today's most popular smartphone platform. At Xiaomi, his role was to help the company expand globally - and while the company didn't, as some had expected, break into the US under Barra's watch, it did cement a reputation as making good quality devices. He hasn't started his new role at Facebook just yet - he'll be at the company in a month or so, apparently excited to be back in California after a few years away. When he starts his first day - I feel those two questions I've been asking Palmer Luckey still stand: Isn't it still too expensive? And more importantly - how are you going to convince people it's worth it?
