Anti-diversity memo causes row at Google,"A Google employee's opinion criticising the firm's diversity initiatives is causing a furore at the firm. In an internal memo, a male software engineer argued the lack of women in top tech jobs was due to biological differences between men and women. ""We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,"" he wrote in the piece which was widely criticised. But the author said he had received ""many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude"". Posted on an internal discussion board, the article was published in full bytech website Gizmodo,external. Former Reddit boss Ellen Pao was among a number of women from the tech industry to criticise the memo It argues that the ""abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership"". The unnamed author says women generally ""prefer jobs in social or artistic areas"" while ""more men may like coding"". The article prompted a response from the search engine giant's new head of diversity Danielle Brown, who said ""the heated debate"" over the issue had ""compelled"" her to say a few words. In an internal email, published bytech website Motherboard,external, she said the article was ""not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages"". This video can not be played Zoe Jervier tells Today pre-classroom initiatives are needed to solve gender gap in tech industry ""Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the culture we continue to cultivate,"" she added. ""We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul.""

David Cameron photobombs festival selfie,"David Cameron photobombed a Labour activist's selfie at Wilderness Festival It's not what most people expect to see when they're swiping through their selfies. At the Wilderness Festival near his Oxfordshire home this weekend, David Cameron photobombed a Labour activist's selfie, along with his wife Samantha. Enjoying a star line-up which included Bonobo and Grace Jones, Vanessa Price was capturing a cheery moment with her husband, unaware that the former Tory MP for Witney was crashing their photo with a deadpan expression. ""We took the selfie and then Steve looked at it and said, 'Oh my god, I think that's David Cameron.'

Dolls' house on Rightmove fools movers,"The doll's house was placed on property website Rightmove for a ""joke"" A Â£500 dolls' house put on a property website has attracted queries from buyers thinking it was a real home. The 75cm (30in) high house belongs to a Warwickshire hospice charity - Shipston Home Nursing - which is hoping to raise money to support its services. It was placed on Rightmove ""as a joke"" by an estate agent which is supporting the charity,the Warwick Courier reports,external. The charity said the toy did look like a ""charming property"". The house is described as having a ""unique feature"" in that its front swings open The toy is described on the website as a ""classic Georgian house"" with four bedrooms, a drawing room and ""potential for further accommodation"". ""A classic Georgian House in a quiet location situated in a popular village in south Warwickshire with many original traditional features,"" the description reads. ""Notably there is a fireplace, an Aga, exposed wood floors and charming period features. ""A unique feature of the property is the roof and front elevations swing open to reveal beautiful accommodation set on three floors and it is part furnished. ""The property is not sold to include land or outside space but we suggest a child's playroom or bedroom would be the perfect setting for the grand home."" The house has ""many traditional features"", the description says ""We put it on Rightmove as a joke but we actually had somebody who wanted to view it, thinking it was a proper house,"" said branch manager Sally Coombs, of Peter Clarke Estate Agents.

TV's Clarkson in hospital with pneumonia,"TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson is being treated for pneumonia after being admitted to hospital in Majorca. The 57-year-old was on a family holiday on the Spanish island when he was taken ill. The former Top Gear host is on a break from filming his new Amazon Prime show and plans to return to work next week. He tweeted friend Jemima Goldsmith he was ""in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital"", and also posted a picture of himself on Instagram. A spokesman for The Grand Tour confirmed the TV presenter was being treated for pneumonia. Clarkson's Instagram picture showed tubes in his arm and his patient wrist band. The caption read: ""Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday."" Clarkson is the second Grand Tour host to be admitted to hospital this year. Fellow Top Gear alumnus Richard Hammond, 47, was flown to hospital in Switzerland after crashing an electric super car in Switzerland in June. The car, which was being filmed for the latest series of The Grand Tour, burst into flames after Hammond escaped the wreckage. The presenter said he thought he was going to die during the incident, during which he became airborne and crashed after completing the Hemberg Hill Climb in Switzerland.

"'Cuffed, drugged and stuffed in a bag'","A model from south London, who is said to have been kidnapped in Italy by a man who threatened to sell her to the highest bidder on the dark web, is widely quoted describing what happened. It's the lead story in the Sun and is also reported in the Mirror, the Times, the Telegraph and the Mail. Chloe Ayling describes being abducted and waking up handcuffed in a suitcase in the boot of a car. She says she feared for her life ""second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour"". The Black Death Group is suspected of being behind the apparent kidnapping. The Times,externalsays the group is either ""one of the most dangerous criminal gangs in the world, or the depraved fantasy of people who rarely leave their keyboards"". The Times also reports,externalhow the father of Justin Gatlin - the sprinter who beat Usain Bolt to win the 100m final at the world championships - has called on British fans to lay off his son. Gatlin - who has twice been suspended for failed drugs tests - was booed as he accepted his gold medal at the London Stadium on Sunday. Willie Gatlin says his son has not committed a crime and that the people who booed him should read the official reports on his case. But theDaily Telegraph's Paul Hayward,externalbelieves Gatlin plays the system with a ""poor me"" routine. Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Matt Lawton says Gatlin's gold will ultimately be good for athletics - by forcing the sport to confront the problem of doping. He says anti-doping agencies lack the power and funding to tackle what he calls a ""global disease"" and that ""the sport of athletics got what it deserved on Saturday night"". The Daily Mirror says,externalit is an ""outrage"" that Gatlin was allowed to compete and that any athlete convicted of doping should face a lifetime ban. The Guardian,externalcarries warnings of a postcode lottery in IVF treatment. The paper says NHS commissioning groups in 13 areas of England have restricted or stopped offering IVF since the start of the year in an effort to save money. National guidelines recommend that women aged under the age of 40 should be offered three cycles of IVF if they have been trying to conceive for two years. The Guardian quotes one of the pioneers of the technique, Professor Simon Fishel, as saying that people across the country should be treated equally - and that only a tiny fraction of those who need the treatment have access to it. Some councils are angry at oBikes being ""dumped"" in their boroughs The Financial Times reports,externalthat Wandsworth Council in London has seized more than 130 rental bicycles, describing them as a ""yellow bike plague"" cluttering up pavements. The ""oBike"" has been launched as a rival to Transport for London's bike scheme and users can pick up and leave the bicycles anywhere, unlocking them with a smartphone app. The council has accused oBike of dumping thousands of bikes on London's streets without any warning. oBike says it is ""disappointed"" with the council's response. And finally, men's make-up counters are likely to appear in chemists' shops and department stores within five years, according to the UK boss of L'Oreal. Vismay Sharma has toldthe Daily Telegraph,externalthat demand for make-up is growing fast among men of what he calls ""the selfie generation"".

V&A apologises to breastfeeding mother,"The Victoria and Albert Museum has apologised after a mum said she was asked to ""cover up"" while breastfeeding on a visit to the London attraction. In a post on Twitter, the woman said she was ""perplexed"" by the request and posted several images of naked female statues from the museum's exhibitions. She went on to say she had a lovely day at the V&A ""exploring depictions of breasts through the ages"". Its director Tristram Hunt said women may breastfeed ""wherever they like"". Tweeting under the name @vaguechera, the womansaid,external: ""Flashed a nanosecond of nipple while breastfeeding and was asked to cover up in the V&A courtyard. I am perplexed."" Her tweet has been liked more than 6,700 times and received more than 3,900 retweets, with many people offering messages of support. The mother pointed out the irony of the request at a museum which displays many statues of naked women.

'Oh sorry you're fine then.'"" The woman posted several pictures of naked sculptures from the museum on Twitter The woman told the BBC she was ""stunned into silence"" by the request from a female member of staff. She said it was the first negative experience she has had in three-and-a-half years of breastfeeding. ""I had been attempting to be discreet and to feed under a cardigan, but with a distracted one-year-old it can be challenging. ""The staff member was friendly and polite, but obviously asking me to cover up was still intrusive, unpleasant and embarrassing for me, as well as obviously ludicrous."" The mum pointed out the irony of being told to ""cover up"" in the museum The mum said she felt it was important to highlight the incident because ""the shame and embarrassment caused by that kind of interjection when you are trying to feed could be crushing for a woman who was less Teflon than me"". She added: ""It could really badly affect someone's attempt to breastfeed if they were struggling with their confidence."" Mr Hunt, a former Labour MP and shadow minister, apologised on twitter,saying,external: ""Very sorry. Our policy is clear.

The museum also tweeted an apology and said it was investigating the incident,adding,external: ""Women are welcome to breastfeed in the museum & we have quiet spaces for those who prefer privacy."" The museum said its staff received regular customer service training and they will be reminded of their breastfeeding policy.

Search on for armed rebels in Venezuela,"This video can not be played Army officers posted a video calling their move ""a legitimate rebellion"" A search is under way in Venezuela for 10 men who escaped with weapons after an attack on a military base, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says. The assault in the north-western city of Valencia was carried out by 20 people, he said. Two were killed, one was injured and seven were arrested. Earlier, a video posted on social media showed uniformed men saying they were rising against a ""murderous tyranny"". Despite the incident, the situation appears to be calm in the country. On state television, Mr Maduro congratulated the army for its ""immediate reaction"" in putting down the attack in the early hours of Sunday, saying they had earned his ""admiration."" He called the incident a ""terrorist attack"" carried out by ""mercenaries"", and said the security forces were actively searching for those who had escaped. ""We'll get them,"" he vowed. This video can not be played The week's most powerful photos from Venezuela Military vehicles were patrolling the streets in and around Valencia and at least one helicopter was being used in the operation. The government said that those arrested included a first lieutenant who had deserted. It said the others were civilians wearing uniforms. Venezuela crisis explained Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent Throughout these past four months of often violent protests in Venezuela, the country's army has, several times, reaffirmed its ""unconditional loyalty"" to President Maduro. The opposition has tried to test that loyalty. When they organised an unofficial referendum last month to let Venezuelans have their say on the Constituent Assembly, one of the questions asked was whether people wanted the armed forces to defend the existing constitution. So far, the army has remained by Mr Maduro's side but the video that surfaced on Sunday claiming to be from the 41st Brigade in Valencia and calling for military and civilian action to restore order to the country is an interesting development. One, of course, denied by the Maduro administration who said that most of the men in the videos were civilians, led by a deserter. But with an economy being pushed to the brink, how long can he enjoy military backing? After all, soldiers have families and nobody can escape the food shortages and spiralling inflation faced by millions every day. And with criticism being heaped upon him for what opponents call a creeping dictatorship, you have to wonder when, not if, the tipping point will come. What lies ahead for divided Venezuela? Mr Maduro said they had been backed by anti-government leaders based in the US and Colombia. There were some demonstrations of support to the uprising in Valencia but they were dispersed with tear gas, witnesses said. Elsewhere in the country, the situation remained calm. Anti-government protesters gathered in Valencia on Sunday In Sunday's video, a rebel leader who identified himself as Juan Caguaripano, said that his group - which he called the 41st Brigade - was taking a stand against the ""murderous tyranny of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro"". ""This is not a coup but a civic and military action to re-establish constitutional order."" Is Maduro on a power grab? Violent demonstrations since April have left more than 100 people dead in the country which, despite being oil-rich, is experiencing severe shortages of food and medicines, as well as inflation in excess of 700%. The incident in Valencia came the day after the first session of the newly inaugurated Constituent Assembly, seen by the opposition as a way for the left-wing president to cling to power. But Mr Maduro has repeatedly said that the new body would bring peace to the country. This video can not be played Your video guide to the crisis gripping Venezuela The Constituent Assembly has the ability to rewrite the constitution and could override the opposition-controlled parliament, the National Assembly.

One dead and two missing as boat sinks,"This video can not be played Lifeboat crews and the coastguard carried out searches along the West Sussex coast One man has died and another two are believed missing after a boat sank off the West Sussex coast. A 45-year-old man from London was rescued at about 05:50 BST after the vessel went down two miles off the coast of Shoreham, the RNLI said. The rescued man, who said he was part of a crew of four, was found clinging to a buoy and saved by a passing fisherman. The coastguard later suspended its search for the two missing people. Andy Jenkins, controller with the UK Coastguard, said: ""Following an extensive search of the area using multiple assets nothing further has been found at this time so the decision has been made to suspend the search pending further information. ""A review of the incident details will be ongoing through the rest of the day."" Lifeboat crews carried out searches along the West Sussex coast The rescued man, who is originally from Romania, was picked up by an RNLI lifeboat and taken to shore at Shoreham before being taken to hospital. Matt Pavitt, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's south east coastal operations area commander, said: ""Anybody that spends that length of time, numerous hours potentially, in the sea without any protective equipment - at this time of year it's a nice day but the sea is still cold - is very, very lucky to be alive."" Mr Pavitt said it would look into suggestions the men's boat collided with another vessel, but said it was too early to confirm what happened. He said that whatever happened had been very quick, as ""there was no distress call, no-one raised the alarm until the chap was found this morning"". BBC South East reporter Simon Jones said there had been some communication difficulties between the rescued man and emergency crews but he told them there had been three other men in boat. A search of the area started and a man's body was recovered from the sea at about 08:15. It was brought ashore by a coastguard helicopter. RNLI lifeboats from Shoreham and Brighton are involved in the search for the missing crew members Boats and ships in the area were asked to look out for the two men who could be missing from the boat. Up to 15 boats and ships, helped by two coastguard helicopters from Lydd and Lee-on-Solent, were involved in the search for the two missing men before it was suspended. They included about 10 vessels from the nearby Rampion offshore wind farm. One man's body was recovered from the sea and brought to shore Sussex Police said they believed the men onboard, all thought to be Romanian, left Brighton Marina at about midnight on a fishing trip and the boat may have sunk ""a couple of hours later, but the facts are not clear at this time"". The men are thought to have gone out to sea on a fishing trip. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is examining what happened. Video: English Channel search after boat sinks.

"Stop missile tests, China tells North Korea","Wang Yi said his talks with North Korea's foreign minister were ""very thorough"" China's foreign minister has told his North Korean counterpart that Pyongyang should stop carrying out nuclear and missile tests, hours after fresh sanctions were agreed by the United Nations Security Council. Wang Yi said he urged Ri Yong-ho to abide by UN resolutions in a meeting on Sunday in the Philippines. He did not say how Mr Ri replied. Saturday's resolution banning North Korean exports and limiting investments in the country was passed unanimously. Mr Wang said sanctions were needed, but ""are not the final goal"", and he urged dialogue. He said he had told North Korea to remain calm, and not provoke the international community with more tests. The Chinese envoy also urged the US and South Korea not to increase tensions, saying that the situation was at a ""critical point"", but also a juncture at which talks could be resumed. North Korea: 'All US within missile range' Pyongyang's missile programme explained US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley earlier said North Korea was facing ""the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation"". Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit the US. However, experts doubt the missiles can hit their targets. The tests were condemned by South Korea, Japan and the US, and prompted the drafting of the new UN sanctions. Importing coal, seafood, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore from North Korea is banned Countries cannot receive new North Korean workers No new joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals No new investment in existing joint ventures More individuals targeted with travel bans and assets freezes Member states to report to Security Council within 90 days on how they have implemented resolution China, North Korea's only international ally and a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, voted in favour of the resolution after negotiations with the US that Ms Haley said were ""tough"". Beijing has often protected Pyongyang from harmful resolutions in the past. Russia, which the US has also criticised for its economic links with North Korea, also voted for the sanctions. This video can not be played Nikki Haley: Resolution ""put the North Korean dictator on notice"" Top diplomats including US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are gathered for a regional forum under the aegis of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in the Philippines' capital, Manila. North Korea's nuclear programme is expected to be a major issue but there are no plans for a bilateral meeting between Mr Tillerson and the North Korean representative. Speaking earlier as he sat down for talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Mr Tillerson said the sanctions were a ""good outcome"". Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia Correspondent The steady advances in North Korean missile technology have lent a sense of urgency to US diplomacy in Asia, and Rex Tillerson's attendance at the Asean Regional Forum is well-timed. The US wants a show of unity at this forum in condemning North Korea - uniquely, Mr Tillerson will find himself in the same room as his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, although the two are very unlikely to speak to one another. Mr Tillerson will also be holding bilateral meetings with his Russian and Chinese counterparts. Just by being at this diplomatic talkfest Rex Tillerson will offer a striking change of tone. In the first seven months of the Trump administration his voice has been subdued on Asia, whereas the president's comments have been seen by many Asian officials as erratic and at times inflammatory. However there are important differences over how best to deal with North Korea. The US believes pressure must be ramped up on Pyongyang, to get it to reverse, not just freeze, its nuclear and missile programmes. Many Asian countries fear the Trump administration's growing anxiety and anger over North Korea's missile tests risk escalating into a dangerous confrontation; there is still a broad consensus in this region that engagement, however frustrating, is the only way forward - so the US bid to have North Korea expelled from the Asean Regional Forum will meet plenty of resistance. US President Donald Trumptweeted,externalto say the sanctions would cost the North more than $1bn (Â£0.7bn). The export of coal, ore and other raw materials to China is one of North Korea's few sources of cash. Estimates say that North Korea exports about $3bn worth of goods each year - and the sanctions could eliminate $1bn of that trade. But China's participation will be key and top US diplomats say they will be keeping a close eye on Beijing to make sure it consistently abides by the sanctions. Allow Twitter content?

A senior official told South Korea's Yonhap news agency: ""We will make our stance clear when things are determined."" But ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun earlier said nuclear action or sanctions taken by Washington would lead to an ""unimaginable sea of fire"" engulfing the US. What can the outside world do? The isolated state's repeated missile and nuclear weapon tests in breach of UN resolutions have been condemned by neighbours in the region. But South Korea says it may hold direct talks with the North during the Asean summit.

New Bake Off presenter 'avoids sugar',"Bake Off will have three new presenters when it returns this autumn on Channel 4 New Great British Bake Off presenter Noel Fielding says he is careful about eating sugar because ""no-one likes a tubby gut"". The Mighty Boosh startold the Sunday Times,externalhe ""can't put on weight"" because he gets more work when he is thinner. Meanwhile, healthy food campaigner Prue Leith, who takes over from Mary Berry on the show, insists ""baking is the best way to get people into cooking"". The latest series returns this autumn on Channel 4 after it outbid the BBC. Fielding, who joins Leith in the show's new line-up, told The Sunday Times Magazine: ""Sugar is a powerful thing"". The comedian explained that he recently lost a stone to play the singer Alice Cooper: ""I get more work when I'm thinner, so I can't put on weight. ""I don't eat anything, I'm like a plant."" He added: ""It's not that I don't like cake, I have a very sweet tooth."" The BBC lost the contract to broadcast Bake Off last year after Love Productions, the makers of the show,signed a three-year deal with Channel 4. It is understood the channel offered Â£25m for the rights, in contrast to the Â£15m offered by the BBC. Paul Hollywood is the only original member of the BBC line-up to appear on the new series, describing the new C4 line-up - Fielding, Leith and QI host Sandi Toksvig - as a ""dysfunctional family"". Fielding and Toksvig were announced as Bake Off's new presenters in March, after previous hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc announced they ""were not going with the dough"" when the show switched channels. The pair had presented all seven series of the show - since its launch in 2010 - alongside judges Berry and Hollywood. Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc began hosting The Great British Bake Off in 2010 Similarly Berry also announced she would not remain with the show on Channel 4, citing ""loyalty"" to the BBC. Restaurateur and broadcaster Leith - renowned for her no-nonsense attitude as a judge on The Great British Menu - was subsequently announced as Berry's replacement. Asked if the show, with its abundance of cakes and biscuits, fitted with her healthy eating ideals, Leith told the Sunday Times: ""I really thought twice about accepting Bake Off... but I reasoned that, actually, baking is the best way to get people into general cooking."" ""And that's what we need the nation to do: to get interested in the kitchen."" ""Even if you don't allow yourself to eat too much cake, you still like drooling over it."" Bake Off became a huge ratings hits for BBC One, pulling in record-breaking viewing figures. The final BBC episode, broadcast last October, saw an average of 14 million people tune in to see PE teacherCandice Brown crowned the victor. Yet, in the same interview, Fielding intimated that co-host Toksvig, had never previously watched Bake Off. Asked what her favourite episode was, Toksvig said: ""The one where they make cake? I don't watch a lot of television, I'm more of a reader.""

Peace-loving boxer offers belt to rival,"Vijender Singh won a bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics An Indian boxer who beat a Chinese rival has offered to return the championship belt he won as peace gesture, amid a tense border stand-off. Vijender Singh, an Olympic medallist, beat Zulpikar Maimaitiali on Saturday, winning the WBO Oriental Super Middleweight belt from him. But he dedicated his win to the ""India-China friendship"", and said he wanted to give the belt back. India and China have been feuding over a disputed border area since June. The row erupted when India opposed China's attempt to extend a border road through a plateau known as Doklam in India and Donglang in China. Mr Singh, 31, has been widely praised in India for his win in the much-anticipated fight in Mumbai. But some appear not to share his message of reconciliation. ""Chinese met a grand defeat in Mumbai and same will happen in Doklam,"" a yoga guru and businessman called Baba Ramdevtweeted,external. Why is the India-China border stand-off escalating? It is unclear if the Chinese competitor has responded to the offer, or if competition officials would allow the belt to be returned. The disputed plateau lies at a junction between China, the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim and Bhutan. It is currently disputed between China and Bhutan. India supports Bhutan's claim over it. India is concerned that if the road is completed, it will give China greater access to India's strategically vulnerable ""chicken's neck"", a 20km (12-mile) wide corridor that links the seven north-eastern states to the Indian mainland. On Thursday China's defence ministry warned India that it would not back down. Why is the India-China border stand-off escalating? What's behind the India-China border stand-off?

Eiffel Tower knifeman held by police,"A man is being held by police in Paris after he tried to force his way into the Eiffel Tower brandishing a knife. He was ""very quickly overpowered and arrested"" and no-one was hurt, the company that runs the landmark said. France has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 attacks in the capital that left 130 people dead. The incident at the Eiffel tower happened at 23:30 pm (21:30 GMT) on Saturday night. After the arrest, police evacuated the tower. How France is wrestling with jihadist terror The detained man, wearing a Paris Saint-Germain football shirt, shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" - God is greatest - as he broke through security, a source told AFP news agency. The tower was lit up with PSG's team colours and hosted a screen displaying a message welcoming Brazilian star Neymar to the club. French prosecutors have opened a counter-terrorism investigation because of the suspect's statements to police and his apparent radicalisation. The unnamed source said the knifeman was aged about 19 and had a history of psychological problems. He told investigators that he wanted to attack a soldier and that he had been in contact with a member of the Islamic State terror group, the source added.

Chinese tourists arrested for Nazi salute,"The men made the gesture outside the Reichstag building in Berlin Two Chinese tourists were arrested in Berlin for making Hitler salutes outside the German parliament on Saturday. Criminal proceedings have been started against the middle-aged men for using symbols from a banned organisation. The pair have been released on bail of â¬500 (Â£450; $600) each. Germany has strict laws on hate speech and symbols linked to Hitler and the Nazis. The men - aged 36 and 49 - could face a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years, according to police. The same charges are most commonly used to prosecute members of the far right. A police spokeswoman told AFP news agency that the men could leave the country during the investigation and that if a fine is handed down, the bail money they had already paid would probably cover it. The visitors were seen taking pictures of each other with their mobile phones outside the Reichstag building, which houses the German parliament.

Police said the Land Rover's driver was cut free but did not suffer serious injuries. The Ford's Gloucester-based driver died.

Cable: Young 'shafted' over Brexit,"Those with pensions had suffered ""relatively little"" in the financial crisis, Sir Vince said Older people who voted for Brexit have ""comprehensively shafted the young"", Sir Vince Cable has said. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, the Lib Dem leader accused the over-65s of being ""self-declared martyrs"" who claim leaving the EU is worth the cost. ""The martyrdom of the old comes cheap,"" he said, as fewer have jobs to lose and living standards are protected by the triple lock on pensions. ""For the Brexit martyrs, paradise beckons,"" he added. Brexit: All you need to know UK 'must prepare a Brexit fallback' Cars, curry and tortillas' role in Brexit charm offensive Quoting statistics that 64% of over-65s voted for Brexit -compared with 71% of under-25s who voted Remain- Sir Vince said he was ""struck by the heavily Remain sentiment in colleges and schools, and the heavily Brexit mood of church-hall meetings packed with retired people"" during the referendum campaign. He claimed that austerity measures had largely affected the working population, with pensioners suffering ""relatively little"" after the financial crisis. Young people, he said, have the added problems of ""prohibitive housing costs, growing job insecurity and limited career progression"". ""The old have comprehensively shafted the young,"" added Sir Vince. ""And the old have had the last word about Brexit, imposing a world view coloured by nostalgia for an imperial past on a younger generation much more comfortable with modern Europe."" The newly-elected party leader warned that describing such ""masochism"" as martyrdom was ""dangerous"", adding: ""We haven't yet heard about 'Brexit jihadis' but there is an undercurrent of violence in the language which is troubling."" Sir Vince also criticised cabinet ministers, who he claimed were ""waging civil war, rather than working out what they want from Brexit."" He says former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith called for trade envoys to be sacked as a result of them ""talking down our country"". ""At this rate, we will have Brexit thought crimes before long,"" said Sir Vince. He said that with the government confirming freedom of movement will end in 2019, the UK will leave the single market and there will be no transition. Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks?

Fox News host suspended over 'lewd texts',"Eric Bolling is a long-time host at Fox News US television network Fox News has suspended one of its presenters after he was accused of sending lewd photographs to three female co-workers. Eric Bolling, a long-time host at the network, allegedly sent the messages on separate occasions several years ago. His lawyer described the claims as ""untrue and terribly unfair"". Fox News said an investigation was under way. The conservative cable news outlet has been hit by several high-profile harassment cases recently. Citing 14 unnamed sources,the Huffington Post,external, a politically liberal news site, reports that Mr Bolling sent unsolicited photos of male genitalia by text message to at least two colleagues at Fox Business and one at Fox News. ""Eric Bolling has been suspended pending the results of an investigation, which is currently under way,"" a Fox News spokesperson said. Mr Bolling's lawyer, Michael Bowe, told Reuters news agency: ""The anonymous, uncorroborated claims are untrue and terribly unfair. ""We intend to fully co-operate with the investigation so that it can be concluded and Eric can return to work as quickly as possible."" Other allegations of sexual harassment involving top Fox News stars recently included: Bill O'Reilly, who was dropped from the channel in April following reports that five women had received $13m (Â£10m) in payouts because of his behaviour.

Schools 'wrapping pupils in cotton wool',"Teachers must stop trying to wrap children in cotton wool with over-the-top health and safety policies, the chief inspector of schools has said. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Amanda Spielman said it stopped the children developing resilience and grit. She wants the education watchdog Ofsted to prepare new guidance for schools inspectors in England. Ms Spielman said making pupils wear high-vis vests on trips made them look like mini-builders minus the hard hats. She said schools had developed an over-cautious culture that made it difficult for young people to cope with everyday events. While individual schools have imposed bans on playing conkers and on pupils bringing toys such as yo-yos over the years, the Health and Safety Executive point outs there has never been official regulation. And Ms Spielman said every minute enforcing bans on conkers and yo-yos was a minute away from tackling a multitude of real dangers. ""I want Ofsted to make sure that schools are properly focused on pupil safety but that it doesn't come at the expense of opportunities to broaden and enrich young minds,"" she said. ""My message to schools is this - keeping children safe from harm should always be your overriding concern but in doing so make sure you distinguish between real and imagined risk. ""Trying to insulate your pupils from every bump, germ or bruise won't just drive you to distraction, it will short-change those pupils as well, limiting their opportunity to fully take advantage of the freedom of childhood and to explore the world around them."" Next month, 1,800 school inspectors will take part in sessions to ensure they focus only on the safeguarding of vulnerable children. Ms Spielman said she looked forward to seeing more eager young faces on trips in the next school year but hopes ""fewer of them will be auditioning for Bob the Builder"".

Venezuela arrests over 'uprising attempt',"This video can not be played Army officers posted a video calling their move ""a legitimate rebellion"" Arrests have been made in Venezuela after soldiers tried to launch an uprising against President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. An attack was launched against a military barracks in Valencia in the north-western Carabobo state. Two attackers were killed and at least eight were arrested, Mr Maduro said. A video released on social media showed uniformed men saying they were rising against a ""murderous tyranny"". Venezuela has seen months of protests. ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. The ruling Socialist Party's deputy leader, Diosdado Cabello, called it a ""terrorist attack"" on Twitter. Mr Cabello said full control had been restored at the Fuerte Paramacay military barracks. What is behind the crisis in Venezuela? Venezuela's chief prosecutor rejects dismissal Army chief Gen Jesus Suarez Chourio said: ""What happened today was a terrorist, paramilitary, mercenary attack paid for by the right [the opposition] and its collaborators, paid for by the North American empire"" - a reference to the US, which has denounced President Maduro's recent actions. Despite the reported arrests, Juan Carlos Colina, a reporter with the Venezolana de Prensa newspaper, told the BBC that loud explosions continued to be heard at the base in the early afternoon, local time. This video can not be played The week's most powerful photos from Venezuela In his short speech, the rebel leader said that his group - which he called the 41st Brigade - was standing against the ""murderous tyranny of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro"". He named young people who have died after attending anti-government protests: Neomar Lander, Geraldine Moreno, Juan Pablo Pernalete and ""lots of others with their cardboard shields"". Lander, 17, and Pernalete, 20, died earlier this year, while Moreno, 23, was shot in the face in a 2014 demonstration. Two members of the National Guard were later jailed for her death. Regular protests have been held in the country since April. The opposition accuses left-wing President Maduro of trying to entrench his power.

Belgium kept Dutch egg concerns secret,"Suspect eggs have been destroyed at farms in the Netherlands Belgium has admitted it knew in June that eggs from Dutch farms might be contaminated with an insecticide - a month before the issue became public. The information was not shared because of a fraud investigation, a spokeswoman for Belgium's food safety agency said. Tests found the chemical fipronil, which can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands, in Dutch eggs. Supermarkets in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have removed potentially contaminated eggs. ""We have known since early June there was potentially a problem with fipronil in the poultry sector,"" spokeswoman Katrien Stragier told reporters. ""We immediately launched an investigation and we also informed the prosecutor because it was a matter of possible fraud,"" she added, without giving more details. Aldi pulls eggs from German stores over poison fear German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt expressed concern about the revelation, and planned to call his Belgian counterpart on Monday. One German official said up to 10 million of the contaminated eggs may have been sold in Germany. The Netherlands is Europe's largest exporter of eggs and egg products, and one of the biggest in the world. It exports an estimated 65% of the 10 billion eggs it produces every year. About 180 poultry farms in the country have been temporarily shut while investigations are held.

"Stop missile tests, China tells N Korea","Wang Yi said his talks with North Korea's foreign minister were ""very thorough"" China's foreign minister has told his North Korean counterpart that Pyongyang should stop carrying out nuclear and missile tests, hours after fresh sanctions were agreed by the United Nations Security Council. Wang Yi said he urged Ri Yong-ho to abide by UN resolutions in a meeting on Sunday in the Philippines. He did not say how Mr Ri replied. Saturday's resolution banning North Korean exports and limiting investments in the country was passed unanimously. Mr Wang said sanctions were needed, but ""are not the final goal"", and he urged dialogue. He said he had told North Korea to remain calm, and not provoke the international community with more tests. The Chinese envoy also urged the US and South Korea not to increase tensions, saying that the situation was at a ""critical point"", but also a juncture at which talks could be resumed. North Korea: 'All US within missile range' Pyongyang's missile programme explained US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley earlier said North Korea was facing ""the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation"". Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit the US. However, experts doubt the missiles can hit their targets. The tests were condemned by South Korea, Japan and the US, and prompted the drafting of the new UN sanctions. Importing coal, seafood, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore from North Korea is banned Countries cannot receive new North Korean workers No new joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals No new investment in existing joint ventures More individuals targeted with travel bans and assets freezes Member states to report to Security Council within 90 days on how they have implemented resolution China, North Korea's only international ally and a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, voted in favour of the resolution after negotiations with the US that Ms Haley said were ""tough"". Beijing has often protected Pyongyang from harmful resolutions in the past. Russia, which the US has also criticised for its economic links with North Korea, also voted for the sanctions. This video can not be played Nikki Haley: Resolution ""put the North Korean dictator on notice"" Top diplomats including US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are gathered for a regional forum under the aegis of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in the Philippines' capital, Manila. North Korea's nuclear programme is expected to be a major issue but there are no plans for a bilateral meeting between Mr Tillerson and the North Korean representative. Speaking earlier as he sat down for talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Mr Tillerson said the sanctions were a ""good outcome"". Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia Correspondent The steady advances in North Korean missile technology have lent a sense of urgency to US diplomacy in Asia, and Rex Tillerson's attendance at the Asean Regional Forum is well-timed. The US wants a show of unity at this forum in condemning North Korea - uniquely, Mr Tillerson will find himself in the same room as his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, although the two are very unlikely to speak to one another. Mr Tillerson will also be holding bilateral meetings with his Russian and Chinese counterparts. Just by being at this diplomatic talkfest Rex Tillerson will offer a striking change of tone. In the first seven months of the Trump administration his voice has been subdued on Asia, whereas the president's comments have been seen by many Asian officials as erratic and at times inflammatory. However there are important differences over how best to deal with North Korea. The US believes pressure must be ramped up on Pyongyang, to get it to reverse, not just freeze, its nuclear and missile programmes. Many Asian countries fear the Trump administration's growing anxiety and anger over North Korea's missile tests risk escalating into a dangerous confrontation; there is still a broad consensus in this region that engagement, however frustrating, is the only way forward - so the US bid to have North Korea expelled from the Asean Regional Forum will meet plenty of resistance. US President Donald Trumptweeted,externalto say the sanctions would cost the North more than $1bn (Â£0.7bn). The export of coal, ore and other raw materials to China is one of North Korea's few sources of cash. Estimates say that North Korea exports about $3bn worth of goods each year - and the sanctions could eliminate $1bn of that trade. But China's participation will be key and top US diplomats say they will be keeping a close eye on Beijing to make sure it consistently abides by the sanctions. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this year,China suspended imports of coalto increase pressure on Pyongyang. However, repeated sanctions have so far failed to deter North Korea from continuing with its missile development.

This video can not be played North Korea missile ""seen from Japan"" North Korea has is yet to officially respond to the new sanctions. A senior official told South Korea's Yonhap news agency: ""We will make our stance clear when things are determined."" But ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun earlier said nuclear action or sanctions taken by Washington would lead to an ""unimaginable sea of fire"" engulfing the US. What can the outside world do? The isolated state's repeated missile and nuclear weapon tests in breach of UN resolutions have been condemned by neighbours in the region. But South Korea says it may hold direct talks with the North during the Asean summit. Its foreign minister said she was willing to talk to her counterpart from Pyongyang, if the chance ""naturally occurs"". Altogether, 27 nations are sending representatives to the Asean Regional Forum.

Three missing after boat collision,"This video can not be played Lifeboat crews and the coastguard carried out searches along the West Sussex coast One man has died and another two are believed missing after a boat sank off the West Sussex coast. A 45-year-old man from London was rescued at about 05:50 BST after the vessel went down two miles off the coast of Shoreham, the RNLI said. The rescued man, who said he was part of a crew of four, was found clinging to a buoy and saved by a passing fisherman. The coastguard later suspended its search for the two missing people. Andy Jenkins, controller with the UK Coastguard, said: ""Following an extensive search of the area using multiple assets nothing further has been found at this time so the decision has been made to suspend the search pending further information. ""A review of the incident details will be ongoing through the rest of the day."" Lifeboat crews carried out searches along the West Sussex coast The rescued man, who is originally from Romania, was picked up by an RNLI lifeboat and taken to shore at Shoreham before being taken to hospital. Matt Pavitt, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's south east coastal operations area commander, said: ""Anybody that spends that length of time, numerous hours potentially, in the sea without any protective equipment - at this time of year it's a nice day but the sea is still cold - is very, very lucky to be alive."" Mr Pavitt said it would look into suggestions the men's boat collided with another vessel, but said it was too early to confirm what happened. He said that whatever happened had been very quick, as ""there was no distress call, no-one raised the alarm until the chap was found this morning"". BBC South East reporter Simon Jones said there had been some communication difficulties between the rescued man and emergency crews but he told them there had been three other men in boat. A search of the area started and a man's body was recovered from the sea at about 08:15. It was brought ashore by a coastguard helicopter. RNLI lifeboats from Shoreham and Brighton are involved in the search for the missing crew members Boats and ships in the area were asked to look out for the two men who could be missing from the boat. Up to 15 boats and ships, helped by two coastguard helicopters from Lydd and Lee-on-Solent, were involved in the search for the two missing men before it was suspended. They included about 10 vessels from the nearby Rampion offshore wind farm. One man's body was recovered from the sea and brought to shore Sussex Police said they believed the men onboard, all thought to be Romanian, left Brighton Marina at about midnight on a fishing trip and the boat may have sunk ""a couple of hours later, but the facts are not clear at this time"". The men are thought to have gone out to sea on a fishing trip. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is examining what happened. Video: English Channel search after boat sinks.

US halts search for missing marines,"Three MV-22 Osprey aircraft were photographed off Sydney in June US officials say they have suspended a search and rescue operation for three marines missing after their aircraft crashed off the Australian coast. Saturday's incident involved an MV-22 Osprey belonging to the US Marines based in Okinawa, Japan. The third Marine Expeditionary Force said they had shifted their operations to recovery efforts, which could last several months. Families of the three marines have been notified. Teams rescued 23 people. The circumstances of the incident off the east coast of Australia are still under investigation,a statement said.,external ""As the sea state permits, recovery efforts will be conducted to further search, assess and survey the area, in coordination and with assistance from the Australian Defence Force,"" it added.

Children's online time 'like junk food',"Parents must intervene to stop their children overusing social media and consuming time online ""like junk food"", the children's commissioner has said. In aninterview with the Observer,,externalAnne Longfield criticised the ways social media giants use to draw children into spending more time. She said parents should be proactive in stopping their children from bingeing on the internet in the summer holidays. Ms Longfield has launched a campaign to help parents with the issue. She said: ""It's something that every parent will talk about especially during school holidays; that children are in danger of seeing social media like sweeties, and their online time like junk food. ""None of us as parents would want our children to eat junk food all the time. ""For those same reasons we shouldn't want our children to do the same with their online time."" Use talk to tame online habits US changes toddler screen time advice The commissioner added: ""When phones, social media and games make us feel worried, stressed and out of control, it means we haven't got the balance right. ""With your diet, you know that, because you don't feel that good. It's the same with social media."" Last year, industry watchdog Ofcom said the internet overtook television as the most popular media pastime for children in the UK. Children aged five to 15 are spending 15 hours a week on the internet. Ms Longfield said children should be helped to understand that sites encourage them to continue their use based on what they have previously been doing online. A study earlier this yearof screen time and mental wellbeing among teenagers suggested that moderate use of devices may be beneficial. The research, which appeared in the journal Psychological Science, was based on self-reported data from 120,000 15-year-olds in England.

Review into energy costs launched,"An independent review looking at ways to reduce energy costs has been launched by the government. The study will examine how the UK can keep household bills down while also meeting its climate change targets. Oxford University professor Dieter Helm, who is carrying out the work, said he would ""sort out the facts from the myths about the cost of energy"". The launch comes just days afterBritish Gas raised electricity pricesby 12.5% for 3m customers. The study, which is expected to be published in October, will look at the key factors affecting bills - including energy and carbon pricing, efficiency measures and regulation. It will consider how costs can be reduced at all stages of the energy supply chain, as well as the impact of new technology on the sector. How to switch energy supplier However, it will not examine whether to introduce a cap on energy bills, which wasa pre-election pledge by the Conservatives. Professor Helm said:  ""My review will be independent and sort out the facts from the myths about the cost of energy, and make recommendations about how to more effectively achieve the overall objectives."" The government says it is already looking at ways to cut bills and has called upon the energy regulator Ofgem to use its existing powers to reduce prices. The regulator said it isconsidering extending a price cap on energy billsto more households on low incomes. Will Hodson of the Big Deal energy switching group said the review was ""kicking the can down the road"" and said consumers needed an immediate solution to the rising costs of energy. He added that households which were constantly switching providers were getting the best deals, but loyal customers were paying significantly higher prices, as they were on a standard variable tariff which fluctuates. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said: ""All homes and businesses rely on an affordable and secure energy supply and the government is upgrading our energy system to make it fit for the future. ""We want to ensure we continue to find the opportunities to keep energy costs as low as possible, while meeting our climate change targets."" Lawrence Slade, chief executive of trade body Energy UK, said he welcomed ""greater transparency"" over energy cost as the UK moves to a decarbonised energy system. ""Using our energy as smartly as possible is critical so energy efficiency must be a national infrastructure priority,"" he added. Consumer group Which? said the review will be ""cold comfort"" to many households already overpaying on their energy bills. Alex Neill from Which? said: ""Consumers need to see urgent action from the government and regulator to tackle the lack of competition in the market and to ensure they are getting a good deal."" Announcing the rise in electricity prices, British Gas owner Centrica said it was one of the last suppliers to raise its tariff and the move was a result of transmission and distribution costs and the costs of government policy. But the government said its policy costs ""could not explain"" the rises. British Gas to raise electricity prices Reality Check: Why has British Gas put up prices?
