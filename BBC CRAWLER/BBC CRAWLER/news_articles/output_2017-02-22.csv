Rooney unlikely to leave this month,"Wayne Rooney's agent Paul Stretford is in China to see if he can negotiate a deal for the forward to leave Manchester United. There are no guarantees of success and it is thought a deal remains highly unlikely before the Chinese transfer window closes on 28 February. But the fact Stretford has travelled to China is a clear indication United boss Jose Mourinho would let Rooney, 31, go. In a BBC Sport poll, 30% of voters think that Wayne Rooney's next move should be to move to China. And if he does not leave this month it seems certain he will go in the summer. Rooney has fallen down the pecking order at United under Mourinho. Rooney should stay - Phil Neville Mourinho not ruling out Rooney exit Would a China move work for Rooney? The England captain has been made aware of interest in him from the Chinese Super League for some time, although it is not known which clubs Stretford has spoken to. However, two of the three clubs who looked the most likely options for Rooney have ruled themselves out. Beijing Guoan, believed to be the favourite team of Chinese President Xi, had been seen as one of the favourites to sign Rooney but sources close to the club have told BBC Sport they are not interested in signing him. The England captain's representatives have already spoken to Tianjin Quanjian and their coach, Fabio Cannavaro, said talks did not progress, while sources close to Jiangsu Suning also dismissed speculation over a transfer. On Tuesday, Mourinho said he did not know whether Rooney, who has only just returned to training after a hamstring injury, would still be at Old Trafford in a week's time. It is not known whether this latest development will affect Rooney's chances of being involved in Sunday's EFL Cup final against Southampton. They had appeared to have increased afterHenrikh Mkhitaryan limped outof Wednesday's1-0 Europa League win against Saint-Etienne. If Rooney follows former team-mate Carlos Tevez to the Chinese Super League, it would almost certainly cost him any chance of making the seven appearances he needs to become England's most capped player. Rooney's preference is understood to be to remain with United for the rest of his contract, whichexpires in 2019, but a lack of time on the pitch is forcing him to consider alternatives. Rooney is United'srecord goalscorerand has won five Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy since joining them as an 18-year-old for Â£27m from Everton in 2004. The forward, who has started only three games since 17 December, has said he would not play for an English club other thanUnited or Everton,external. Hong Kong-based player representative Christopher Atkins The big difference between Chinese Super League clubs' transfer process and their Premier League counterparts is the preparation. English top-flight clubs have extensive scouting departments with links around the world. They identify players months in advance, watch many live games and base their decision on an extensive process. Oscar moved to Shanghai SIPG from Chelsea in a Â£60m deal in December and scored on his debut for his new club In CSL, the process is more agent-led. Most of the clubs are approached with recommendations for a position they are recruiting in, rather than seeking out players themselves. Foreign players coming in on large fees are commanding three-, four-, five-year deals, even at the end of their career. They have the upper hand in negotiations and wouldn't leave European football without long-term financial guarantees. However, the Chinese government is concerned about capital leaving the country and it is difficult for these big transactions to exist while they are trying to crack down in other areas. I think we will see a levelling out in fees. The Â£15m-Â£20m transfers will continue to happen for the next few years, but maybe we won't see the likes ofthe Â£60m deal that brought Oscar to China.

Unilever stung into action by Kraft,"Unilever is behind some of Britain's best-known brands Think of Kraft Heinz's assault on Unilever as a slap in the face for management. It was short-lived, shocking, and will smart for a good while yet. It's a slap that says ""we think we can do a better job for your shareholders than you"". That is not a message you want to get lodged in shareholders minds if you are Unilever's management and today the company acknowledged the sting. ""Unilever is conducting a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders. The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever."" That is the sound of a company cheek smarting. It is very rare for corporate raiders like Warren Buffett (24% owner of Kraft Heinz) and Brazilian financier Jorge Lemann (owner of 3G) to back off so quickly. Once you dangle higher returns in front of pragmatic investors, they usually want to see what the next chat up line might be. The Unilever management will take some pride in the fact they convinced some of their own major shareholders to back their rejection of the offer so flatly. The management argument, as told to me by senior management, went something like this. Yes - Kraft has much higher profit margins than Unilever (23% compared to 15%) so looks like the better operator. But - Kraft habitually invests less in the future, therefore has lower organic (internally generated) growth and is saddled with more than average amounts of debt. As a result it needs to acquire other companies to keep the growth going and pays for it by using yet more debt, which is financed in part with cash the target company has in the bank. That model, argues Unilever, is not sustainable. Before long, we would be part of an underinvested, short-term profit-seeking, company-eating machine. As soon as Unilever had been digested, Kraft would be hungry again. When the management of the company you want to buy REALLY don't want to sell to you, you can always go over their heads, cut them out of the negotiation and appeal directly to the shareholders. But ""going hostile"" costs a lot more money and excites much more regulatory and political interest than a deal which the management recommends. Many UK politicians welcomed the Kraft defeat as a victory for responsible long-term thinking by one of Europe's biggest companies and its shareholders who wisely eschewed the Jerry Maguire ""show me the money"" approach. It's lucky for them they did. It will give the government a bit more time to figure out their own play book for how to deal with future bids - which are certainly coming thanks to the discount UK companies are selling at thanks to a near 20% depreciation in sterling post-referendum. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, I spoke to half a dozen US executives who were running the rule over potential UK targets - big and small. Current rules only allow the government to intervene when takeovers could compromise financial stability, national security or media plurality. Targets I heard discussed included food and drink, engineering and technology companies based or listed in the UK with foreign earnings potential. You can come up with a reasonably long list using those criteria. Despite a few eye-catching deals like Japan's Softbank swoop on ARM Holdings and the upstart company Skyscanner being sold to a Chinese rival, there is no flood yet. In fact, merger activity overall is still subdued as bidders are still wary of the prospects for UK companies with exposure to domestic and EU markets until greater clarity emerges on the future relationship between the two. As Kraft Heinz retreats with its tail between its legs for now there is plenty of food for thought for both Unilever and government. Unilever's CEO Paul Polman has been warned that if he doesn't focus more on the bottom line, someone else will. The government may have to decide quickly whether foreign takeovers are a sign of confidence in the UK to be welcomed or opportunistic raiding parties to be resisted.

NHS 'rapped' over leaks of A&E data,"Pressures have been building on the NHS this winter NHS leaders in England have been asked by the statistics watchdog to rethink current policies that delay publishing official data on accident and emergency waiting times. This followstwo separate leaksto BBC News of A&E data forJanuary, which suggested the worst performance by hospitals since records began. NHS England and the regulator NHS Improvement have been told by the UK Statistics Authority to review the practice of publishing the data six weeks after collecting it. Their leaders have been asked to ""to determine how you could reduce the time lag in publication"". The call for a review comes in a letter from Ed Humpherson, director general for regulation at the authority, to those who chair the organisations. NHS problems unacceptable, says Hunt 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble What's causing hospital delays? The two leaks of A&E statistics to BBC News came from management information collected by NHS Improvement. The second leak - relating to the full month of January - suggested that from a total of more than 1.4 million attendances at A&E: 82% of patients in A&E - rather than the target 95% - were transferred, admitted or discharged within four hours More than 60,000 people waited between four and 12 hours in A&E for a hospital bed, after a decision to admit, known as a ""trolley wait"" More than 780 people waited for more than 12 hours for a bed At the time the leaked data, obtained by BBC reporter Faye Kirkland, was dismissed as incomplete by NHS sources. Mr Humpherson described the leaks of management information as ""a disorderly release of data"", which had created ""a confused picture"". But, in what amounts to a rap over the knuckles, he goes on to urge the NHS organisations to ""undertake the appropriate reviews of how this management information is used and shared"". Embarrassingly for NHS leaders, the Statistics Authority chief criticises the publication policy for A&E attendance stats. In the summer of 2015, NHS England announced it would stop publishing this data weekly and would shift to a monthly cycle to ""standardise reporting arrangements"" with other information such as cancer waiting times and ambulance response times. This was criticised at the time as a reduction in timely information flow from hospitals, especially during winter months. Mr Humpherson notes that the monthly publication policy creates a six-week lag for A&E data, which ""leaves the system vulnerable to leaks because management information circulates around the NHS system for operational purposes well in advance of the publication of the statistics"". He has called on the NHS bodies to review the ""timeliness"" of the official performance data by the end of April and talks of the importance of ""maintaining trust"". In effect, the statistics watchdog is saying that if the information is available to NHS managers in January, it should also be made available to the media and the public rather than held until March for publication. It amounts to a warning to NHS England that leaks are inevitable under the current arrangements. A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""UKSA has approached the NHS following a leak of unvalidated NHS improvement material to the BBC ahead of its official publication, and NHS Improvement is now considering with other national bodies how best to ensure timely official publication while ensuring this doesn't happen again."" This will no doubt create headaches for NHS chiefs who have tried hard to justify the adoption of monthly rather than weekly data releases. Their case was weakened when the Scottish government opted to move to a weekly A&E publication schedule just as NHS England was going in the opposite direction. And the case has certainly been weakened even further by the UK Statistics Authority's intervention and what amounts to a clarion call for transparency.

The Scottish Six is dead - long live the Scottish Nine,"The BBC is very experienced at broadcasting news to as many people as possible. Traditionally it's always been much less good at keeping secrets. Journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip. So, it was highly unusual that BBC bosses had managed to keep the launch ofa whole new BBC Scotland channelentirely secret until it was announced to staff on Wednesday morning. Staff, viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a ""Scottish Six"" had been shelved. No one knew that there would be an hour-long news programme with Scottish, UK and world news at 9pm instead. Already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel, new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes. The announcement of new nightly news programme at 9pm does mean that the idea of a ""Scottish Six"" is now dead. So people who had been campaigning for that will be frustrated. Already the First Minster Nicola Sturgeon has said there is lots to welcome in this announcement but that it doesn't deliver everything she wanted. Saying it's disappointing that there is no Scottish Six - but ""progress and hopefully sign of new thinking"". Another SNP politician told me that the decision not to put a Scottish news hour on BBC One looks ""entirely political"". Saying that viewers accustomed to getting their news at tea time may not immediately develop the habit of watching a digital channel at 9pm. But for those who wanted a news programme reflecting the world from a Scottish perspective, produced and presented from Scotland - the BBC is now delivering what they asked for. The Scottish Six is dead. Long live the Scottish Nine.

Driverless cars - no halfway house?,"Ford is developing autonomous vehicles The progress in driverless car technology over recent years has been astounding. A future when you can hop in and have a sleep while an autonomous vehicle takes you to your destination appears to be closer than anyone thought just five years ago. Getting there, however, will involve quite a few stages, with cars getting more and more autonomous but human drivers still having some role. Or will it? Areport by Bloomberg,externalsays Ford is going to skip a step and go straight to fully autonomous driving. The article says that is because engineers who are testing the company's self-driving vehicles are falling asleep at the wheel because there is so little for them to do. Ford tells me that only part of this story is true: ""Reports that Ford engineers were falling asleep while testing autonomous vehicles are inaccurate."" But it goes on to say that ""high levels of automation without full autonomy capability could provide a false sense of security"". That means it is difficult for the driver to suddenly take control if there is a situation where the technology is not up to it. And that's why it is going to head straight to what is known as SAE level four - ""autonomous capability that will take the driver completely out of the driving process in defined areas"". SAE is aglobal organisation of automotive engineers,externalthat has come up with a definition of six levels of automation, from zero - where the driver is in full control - to five, where the car does everything in all circumstances. In January, at CES in Las Vegas, Ford's Ken Washingtontold me confidentlythat the company would have a fully autonomous car on the road by 2021: ""The vehicles we are going to put in our 2021 fully autonomous ride service will not have a steering wheel, they won't have a brake pedal,"" he explained. ""So this means there's no issue with drivers having to take over control because the vehicle will know how to handle all scenarios."" Most of the car industry seems to believe that the evolution of automation will be a more gradual affair, with drivers slowly learning to trust their cars to do ever more.  But I can see why Ford sees a problem with a halfway house, where the driver only occasionally needs to take over. Last year, I drove a Tesla in Autopilot mode down an American freeway - and found it a nerve-wracking experience. My hands hovered over the steering wheel and my foot over the brake, ready to act if needed. As the technology improves, perhaps we will get more relaxed about taking our hands off the wheel, eating a sandwich or watching a video - but that could then make us less capable of responding quickly when we need to take over. That is why Ford wants to move swiftly to full autonomy - but is that practical? I caught up with a leading British figure in this field, Professor Paul Newman, whose Oxbotica firm is developing autonomous vehicles. Google's autonomous cars look less conventional He thought Ford was serious about that 2021 target but stressed that what it was promising was not a car that would drive itself anywhere but what he called ""mobility as a service"". The vehicles would be owned by the company and would operate as a sort of autonomous taxi: ""It would be a limited service on specific routes. Just like a bus can't go anywhere, you would only operate this where you were confident that it would work."" Professor Newman believes that we will first see fully autonomous vehicles operating at quite slow speeds in cities rather than on motorways. ""The trick is then to have the machines learn through use and ever expand their domains."" So we have two competing strategies. Most of the car industry is looking to build ever more autonomous capabilities into something that will still look like a traditional car, in the expectation that it will take until 2030 to reach the full autonomy of SAE level five. But both Ford and Google seem confident that building vehicles that won't look so familiar will get them to level four - full autonomy in defined areas.  They hope that will change the way we think about road transport far more quickly. Let battle commence... Ford: Self-driving cars in four years.

Clinton takes swing at golf-loving Trump,"President Trump (pictured here with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the left) has made visits to his Florida golf courses a weekend habit during his first month in office A Hillary Clinton retweet has drawn attention to President Donald Trump's golf outings, which critics are hoping to turn into a political handicap. The former Democratic White House candidate shared a graph suggesting her former rival spent 25 hours on the links during his first month in office. Mr Trump made his sixth trip to the golf course on Sunday, joined by professional golfer Rory McIlroy. The Republican was a frequent critic of Barack Obama's fairway excursions. President Trump: Seven ways the world could change How much has the president achieved so far? Trump's America: Are things as bad as he says? According to ananalysis of Washington Post pool reports,externalthat was retweeted by Mrs Clinton, the president has dedicated 21 hours to foreign relations, 13 hours to tweeting and six hours to intelligence briefings in his first weeks. What do you do when your life's goal, a dream that was nearly realised, slips away in a flash? That's the question Hillary Clinton has faced since Donald Trump smashed her presidential hopes last November. In the ensuing days, the former secretary of state has taken long walks in New York woods with her husband, Bill. She's given a few speeches and caught some shows on Broadway, where she's always warmly received. And she's tweeted. Haltingly, at first. A few Thanksgiving messages here, a get-well note to George HW Bush there. She stood firmly on uncontroversial ground. Now, however, her voice is sharpening. She celebrates the anti-Trump protests that have swept across the country. She's poked fun at the president and taken more pointed shots at his policies and positions. As the president has stumbled, she's tiptoeing closer and closer to the land of ""I told you so"". What's next for a woman in her life's third or fourth act? Rumours of a run for New York swirled then receded. When the presidential prize was so close, will anything else bring satisfaction? Given that the Clintons have been in the national spotlight for decades, a quiet exit seems increasingly unlikely. Mr Trump joined Rory McIlroy, one of the world's highest ranked golfers, at Trump International Golf Club on Sunday. The Irishman later told a golf blog he had played a full 18 holes with the president, as well as the chief executive of Clear Sports and former New York Yankee Paul O'Neill. But McIlroy's account contradicted White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She said Mr Trump had only ""played a couple of holes"" on Saturday, as well as Sunday. When pressed about McIlroy's comments on Monday, she said Mr Trump had ""intended to play a few holes and decided to play longer"". The White House has otherwise declined to say who plays with Mr Trump, drawing backlash from US media over how much time he spends on the green. But the president's golf hobby also recalls his repeated criticism of President Obama. Mr Trump regularly accused Mr Obama of spending too much time golfing before and throughout his presidential campaign. President Trump (2nd left) with Rory McIlroy (2nd right) on Sunday ""Can you believe that, with all the problems and difficulties facing the US, President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter,"" hetweeted in October 2014,external. Ten days later,he tweeted,external: ""President Obama has a major meeting on the NYC Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!"" Mr Trump also said he would be too busy to swing at a tee if elected. ""I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf,"" he said last August. But he later softened his tone toward the game, which he said could be used as a tool of diplomacy. President Barack Obama (R) lines up a putt as British Prime Minister David Cameron (L) looks on near Watford in Hertfordshire, England, in April 2016 ""I don't think you should play very much,"" he told the Golf Channel in July. ""But if you're going to play, you should use it to your advantage, and the country's advantage."" Earlier this month, the president hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and played a full round with the foreign leader as well as professional golfer Ernie Els. However, his foursome on Sunday did not include any political types. Former Presidents George W Bush and his father, George HW Bush, were also criticised for their golf outings, at the outsets of the first and second Iraq wars.

Transgender doll,"A new toy billed as the world's ""first transgender doll"" has created a buzz on social media. Thousands of tweets about the product unveiled by the Tonner Doll Company have been posted since it was announced that the doll would make its first appearance at this week's New York Toy Fair. The doll is modelled on a teenage activist who was born a boy, but lives as a female. Jazz Jennings shot to fame when she was interviewed about her gender dysphoria by US TV presenter Barbara Walters. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external That was a decade ago, and Jennings is now 16. She said on herFacebook,externalpage: ""I was assigned male at birth but was a girl right from the start. I expressed myself as a girl to my family by gravitating towards dolls, dresses, sparkles, and everything feminine. I didn't just like girly objects, but I heavily insisted that I WAS a girl."" Jazz Jennings was just six years old when she went on US television to talk about her gender dysphoria The question on many people's lips on social media was: what exactly makes a doll transgender?

One-punch deaths,"Oliver Dearlove, pictured with his girlfriend Claire, died within 24 hours of the attack Trevor Timon has been convicted of killing bank worker Oliver Dearlove with a single punch. It's not the first case of its kind to make headlines, but how does one punch kill someone and what are the consequences for those involved? Robert Holland had been on a rare night out after months of working seven-day weeks. Before the 36-year-old went to the Oceana nightclub in Nottingham, he phoned his mother, Therese, to tell her he would visit her the next day. It was the last time they spoke. Hours later, in the early morning of 28 October 2011, Robert suffered fatal brain injuries from just one punch. Robert Holland, pictured with his mother Therese and niece, Megan Therese learned what had happened later that morning when police visited her home. ""When they told me I was just screaming,"" she said. ""I even punched them and told them to get out of my house, telling them how dare they tell me lies."" Robert's death was caused by the force of one punch severing an artery in his brain. Liam Rockley, a 21-year-old former bouncer, later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. Robert's death is far from an isolated case. While no official figures are available on one-punch deaths, the campaign group One Punch Can Kill has recorded more than 80 fatalities since 2007. Many of the cases have attracted media attention - in large part because it seems extraordinary that one punch can kill. But Duncan Bew, a consultant in trauma and acute care at King's College Hospital, said this reflects a fundamental lack of understanding. ""People are very much focused on penetrating injuries, but actually punching someone in the head can be just as lethal,"" he said. Robert's death was caused by a fatal damage to the brain which caused an artery to sever Mr Bew said deaths from one punch tended to happen in one of three ways. Sometimes, as in Robert's case, the blow itself will cause fatal damage to the brain. Alternatively, it could cause a physiological response where people stop breathing and the brain is starved of oxygen. But in other cases, a punch will cause a person to lose consciousness and strike their head on a hard surface. The impact is similar to being hit over the head with a block of concrete, Mr Bew said. Many one-punch killings involve young men, often in drink-fuelled, random acts of violence. But Finola Farrant, a criminologist at the University of Roehampton, said the circumstances of cases often varied dramatically. These can range from unprovoked assaults, to people who have landed fatal blows in self-defence. In some cases arguments between close friends have resulted in a fatal punch. Last October, Richard Eveleigh was jailed for killing his best friend of 45 years, Paul Lightowler, with a single punch in what the court heard was a ""silly"" row. Dr Farrant said the question for courts to explore in these cases was the extent to which defendants should be culpable for someone's death when they may not have intended - or even realised - that one punch could kill. Indeed, such is the shock of those unintended consequences that the attackers and their families may come to see themselves as victims too, she added. Jacob Dunne was 19 when he killed 28-year-old trainee paramedic James Hodgkinson with one punch in 2011. He was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment for manslaughter. After his release, Jacob agreed to answer questions from James's parents about what happened as part of a scheme called Restorative Justice. Later he met them in person, and keen to show them he was turning his life around, he re-took his GCSEs, did an Access course for university, and is now studying criminology at Nottingham Trent University. Jacob, now 24, says he believes one-punch deaths, and violent crime in general, could be reduced by teaching children emotional wellbeing in schools. ""A lot of this aggression stems from people not being in control of their emotions. ""In reality people need to ask the question 'why are you fighting on the weekends?' The answer is going to be different for everyone."" Jacob now speaks in schools about his experience and in December gave a talk to the TED conference. He remains in touch with James's parents. For those affected by one-punch deaths, the end of the court process can signal the end of formal support and counselling. That lack of support contributed to Ann Bartlett setting up One Punch Can Kill in 2010. Her son, Kyle, a 21-year-old Royal Navy sailor, suffered a fatal brain injury after being punched in Portsmouth on 5 May 2009. ""Our message is: 'Be a hero and walk away from a fight'"", Ann says. The death of sailor Kyle Bartlett prompted his mother, Ann, to set up a campaign group The question of how the number of one-punch deaths can be reduced is one both Ann and Therese believe needs to be considered by lawmakers. Both want sentences to be toughened to match Australia, where there is aminimum of eight years for one-punch killings. Currently in the UK, the attacks are usually treated as manslaughter and often result in custodial sentences of fewer than five years. But Dr Farrant said she was doubtful specific guidelines around one-punch deaths would help. ""We've got a very experienced judiciary who can hear and understand the nuances of individual cases that are so markedly different,"" she said. Mr Bew said the UK should consider following Australia's lead by introducing padded flooring outsides pubs, bars and nightclubs. But one area all four agree on is the need for a high-profile campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of one punch. ""Perhaps they need to have signs up in nightclubs, 'think before you punch' and things like that."" Therese said. Remembering Robert, she added: ""He had such plans and he wanted to be a dad. That's never going to happen. ""It's such a waste."" 23 killed by 'one punch' attacks in NI Man killed best friend in 'silly' row One Punch Can Kill Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Irish army 'should fight rhododendrons',"Rhododendrons are a non-native shrub that can grow taller than 25ft (8m) if not controlled The Irish army should be called in to do battle with rhododendrons because the plants are ""taking over"" a national park, the government has been told. The invasion of the ""aggressive"" plant was raised in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) by the colourful County Kerry politician, Michael Healy-Rae. He claimed ""we are losing the war"" against overgrown rhododendrons in Killarney National Park. He also said the park's deer population had ""exploded"" in recent years. The Kerryman claimed the park was being neglected by the authorities and pleaded with Regional Economic Development Minister Michael Ring to allocate more resources to its maintenance. ""The rhododendron situation in Killarney National Park has become so bad that nothing short of calling in the army is going to put it right,"" said Mr Healy-Rae. This video can not be played Michael Healy-Rae said 'nothing short of the army' would solve the problem Rhododendrons are a non-native shrub that can grow taller than 25ft (8m) if they are not controlled. Mr Healy-Raerequested a DÃ¡il debate on the issue,external, in which he warned the plants were ""taking over completely, despite programmes of work over the years to cut them"". The minister admitted that the management of the ""aggressive rhododendron is a long-standing, ongoing programme in the national park"". However, Mr Ring rejected the suggestion that the government had neglected the public facility or its flowery foreign foes. ""My department has invested heavily in tackling this invasive species, the control of which is difficult, costly and labour-intensive,"" he said. Mr Ring added that more than 700,000 euros (Â£590,000) had been spent on rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park over the past six years. He said this work had made ""significant inroads into the problem"". The minister added that his department was working on an ""updated strategic rhododendron management plan"" and had appointed a ""specialist"" to assist with the shrub situation. Wild rhododendrons decorate Torc waterfall in Killarney National Park, but the plants are difficult to manage In respect of the exploding deer, Mr Healy-Rae referred to a 2008 study which he said was the most up to date he could find. This research, he said, showed red deer numbers had ""increased by 565%"" over a 30-year period while and the sika deer population had risen by 353%. Mr Ring said staff from his department are ""currently undertaking a cull of deer"" in the national park. The cull, which is due to end next month, followed a ""comprehensive survey"" on the park's deer population carried out at the end of last year. Mr Healy-Rae is not the first person to issue warnings over the Republic of Ireland's rhododendron invasion. In 2014, a couple in their 50s had to be rescued after they becametrapped in a ""treacherous"" rhododendron forest. It took search teams five hours to reach the couple in the Knockmealdowns Mountains, on the border between County Waterford and County Tipperary.

Free range-ish,"Stickers have started to appear on boxes of free range eggs announcing that the hens that laid the eggs have been kept, temporarily, in barns ""for their welfare"". So what are the rules around the free range status - and what do recent changes mean for farmers and consumers? There are four different types of eggs sold in the UK, all of which are stamped on the carton for you to see: organic, free range, barn-reared, and caged. To be classed as a free range egg, the hen laying it must have had unlimited daytime access to runs - fenced areas - with vegetation and at least four square metres of outside space per bird. The hens are then kept in barns with bedding and perches overnight, with nine birds allowed per square metre. Yes. Towards the end of 2016, there was an outbreak of avian flu - or bird flu - across Europe. Farmers hoped it would never make it to British shores, but in December the H5N8 strain of the disease was found in some wild and farmed birds in the UK. As a result, on 6 December the government'sDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) issued a prevention zone orderin England, making farmers keep their birds inside to stop the spread of the disease. Similar restrictions were introduced in Scotland and Wales. After the flocks were taken indoors, companies selling the eggs started to put stickers on their products, or signs in shops, to let consumers know animals were being ""temporarily housed"" during the outbreak. However, this is only a temporary solution. Rules from the European Commission (EC) state that after 12 weeks of hens being housed indoors, their eggs cannot be marketed as ""free range"" and instead would become ""barn-reared"". The current Defra order runs until 28 February, after which the majority of farmers are expected to be allowed to let their hens back out. Some shops, including Co-op, are putting up signs to tell customers about the rules But farmers forced to continue following the order after this date will no longer be able to call their eggs ""free range"". For now, the stickers and signs are within regulations, but the situation has been described as ""fluid"" by retailers and it is uncertain how long stickers can be used after the end of the month, instead of full package redesigns. There is much debate in the industry as to whether free range eggs taste any different to those from caged or barn-reared hens. While high-profile chefs like Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall sing the praises of letting hens loose around the farm, taste inevitably remains subjective. But there are no health concerns for consumers during the avian flu outbreak, according to the government and producers. Retailers have told the BBC that the prices - up to twice as much as caged hens' eggs - will remain static for now. A spokesman for Sainsbury's said the cost to their suppliers would not change, so prices would stay put to support them - although the supermarket expects few of its suppliers to continue to be affected after the end of the month. But farmers know they cannot continue to charge a premium forever if their hens stay indoors. The National Farmers Union (NFU) has warned of a potentially ""huge impact"" on the free range sector and is ""very concerned"" for its members. Places that sell products containing eggs, including Boots, are also putting up signs It is lobbying the EU decision makers to extend the 12-week rule. But, according to the British Egg Industry Council, its demands have had no impact so far. According to the Daily Mail,external, farmers in Holland are already in the process of re-labelling free range eggs and poultry after losing an appeal against the EU to extend the 12-week rule. Three quarters of farms will be allowed to let free range birds back outside by the end of February, according to Defra. However, farmers will have to continue with extra bio-security measures, including fencing off ponds. Bird flu is also transmitted via the environment, for example in wild bird droppings, making strict bio-security vital, says chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens. Precautions include: putting up netting keeping food and water inside, and disinfecting footwear and equipment after contact with birds And concern about avian flu persists in high-risk areas. The remaining quarter of farms can expect the emergency rules to stay in place - thereby affecting some producers' claims to free range status. Some smaller farms will, however, be able to allow hens outside under netting, meaning their eggs can be classed as free range.

Weird and wonderful,"Designers have been showing their autumn/winter collections at London Fashion Week, which drew to a close on Tuesday. Many of the outfits in Burberry's show were inspired by the late sculptor Henry Moore, who often challenged conventional views on the female body, and focused on curves and unusual shoulder shapes. It was good news for fans of flower power at the the Tata Naka presentation. The fashion house is named after the nicknames for its designers - identical twins Tamara and Natasha Surguladze. Roksanda's use of red was inspired by a room of Rothko paintings at the Royal Academyâs recent Abstract Expressionism show. If you plan to apply for the next Winter Olympics it might be worth having a look at Anya Hindmarch's latest collection, which had a distinct Alpine feel. The British designer used a great deal of fur for her autumn/winter show. The theme for the Marques' Almeida show was diversity, with the range showing a wide variety of shapes and colours. Outfits by the designer duo have previously been worn by the likes of Rihanna. Canadian model Winnie Harlow, who has the skin condition vitiligo, walked the runway for British designer Julien Macdonald in one of his black gowns with cut-outs at the waist. Mary Katrantzou was inspired by 1940s Disney film Fantasia in her latest collection, which saw many of the outfits explode with fantasy and colour. She said the movie ""allowed me to dream"". Fearne Cotton took to the catwalk to model an all-white PVC outfit for Pam Hogg's autumn/winter collection. Sisters GiGi and Bella Hadid both walked the runway for the Versus Versace, modelling outfits which had a futuristic look with elements of grunge. The audience squeezed themselves into a narrow corridor for JW Anderson's show, which saw a huge array of styles, from ostrich feathers mixed with silk florals to shiny metalic dresses. You may remember Roland Mouret as the designer who came up with the famous Galaxy dress in 2005, which went on to be worn by the likes of Victoria Beckham and Cameron Diaz. He made a triumphant return to LFW to unveil his 20th anniversary collection - an homage to his design work so far. One recurring theme so far this week has been gender fluidity. We've seen men modelling what would traditionally be seen as women's wear and vice versa. Many of the clothing brands have been designed to be deliberately unisex or androgynous. Outfits by Oliver Thame (left) and Robert Sanders were particularly noted for their lack of gender constraints. It wasn't all about the outfits on the catwalk, however, as bags took centre stage at the Mulberry show. Five models aged between 47 and 65 staged a protest against the lack of age diversity on the catwalk. Retailer JD Williams supported the protest, which took place on The Strand. There was one designer who could certainly not be accused of ageism - Simone Rocha. The Irish designer included several models in their seventies in her autumn/winter show.

'I feel like a single mum',"Toni Stew met her Egyptian husband Mohamed El Faramawi in 2009 Immigration rules that require a Briton to be earning a minimum amount before they can bring a non-EU spouse to the UKhave been upheld in the Supreme Court. How does this policy affect families? ""My son has seen his father a few times only,"" says British national Toni Stew. ""I feel like a single mother rather than a wife."" Ms Stew, from Worcester, met her Egyptian husband Mohamed El Faramawi, 33, while on holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2009. They got married six years later. But, as the 25-year-old does not earn a minimum of Â£18,600 per year, her husband has been unable to join her and their 17-month-old son Ali in the UK. ""I feel very guilty towards my baby,"" she says. ""He hasn't done anything to deserve being without his father."" Ms Stew, who works as a part-time sales assistant, says she can't afford to work full-time as she also needs to care for Ali. They are just one couple out of thousands who are said to be unable to meet the minimum income requirement that came into force in July 2012. Under the family migration policy, only British citizens, foreign nationals who aredeemed to be ""present and settled"" in the UK,external, or those with refugee status can apply to sponsor their non-European partner's visa. And whichever of those three categories they are in, they must also show they have sufficient funding. In most cases, this is proof of an annual salary of Â£18,600, held for at least six months prior to the application.  This level rises to Â£22,400 for a non-European partner and child, with an additional levy of Â£2,400 for each additional child. The rule does not apply to EU citizens. Those who are granted the ""family of a settled person"" visa cannot usually claim benefits or other public funds. The Home Office introduced the rules as part of attempts to control immigration from outside Europe, with ministers in the then coalition government arguing that the rules would ensure no incoming families would burden the UK taxpayer. Mohamed El Faramawi has been unable to join his son Ali in the UK But the minimum income requirement policy was challenged in the High Court in 2013 and again in the Court of Appeal in 2014 by two British claimants and one claimant who has refugee status who want to bring their non-EU spouses to the UK. They said the rules were discriminatory and interfered with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to a private and family life. The case then went to the Supreme Court, which said that while family immigration rules requiring minimum income cause hardship, they are lawful. These rules need to be changed as the income threshold is too high, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants says. The charity's chief executive Saira Grant says it would ""greatly help"" if the income of the foreign partner was taken into account. Thousands of people are impacted by the rules, she says. British national Laura Segan and her American husband Spencer Russ are facing the possibility of separation less than a year after they have got married. ""Just because she happens to fall in love with me and I have the wrong passport, she isn't allowed to live with me in her own country,"" says Spencer, 28. His student visa expired in January and he has applied for leave to remain in the UK, but if that is rejected he fears he will have to leave the country. Laura Segan and Spencer Russ have found their relationship complicated by visa rules Full-time graduate student Laura would then need to earn a minimum of Â£18,600 per year for a minimum amount of six months in order to bring her husband back to the UK. Laura, from Devon, says she cannot work full-time while she is studying. ""It doesn't seem right,"" the 28-year-old says. ""I think it is ridiculous to put a financial requirement on love,"" adds Spencer, who met his wife when they were both teaching English in Russia. Andy Russell, from Bath, reluctantly describes himself as ""one of the lucky ones"". ""Yet I don't feel that,"" he says. Molly's only contact with her family for a year was on Skype The 43-year-old teacher faced a long battle to get his Chinese wife Molly, 36, a partner visa after they decided to move to the UK from China in 2012 with their two sons - then just three and five years old. Molly had to return to China to apply for the visa while Andy searched for a job that met the income requirement. She was told she could not enter the UK on a visitor visa because she had expressed her intention to get a partner visa. A year of separation with Molly able to see her family only via Skype led to her youngest son referring to her as ""computer mummy"". ""It broke my heart,"" Andy says. He says their sons lost the ability to speak Chinese, which affected their bond with their mother as she struggled with English, and led to them ""losing some respect for her"", although their relationship is ""much better now"". Molly was finally granted a partner visa in 2013. ""They [the government] have got to deal with migration, but not at the expense of genuine, honest families. It is a scandal,"" Andy says. The Children's Commissioner for England says thatat least 15,000 children are separated from a parentbecause of the income rules and are growing up in ""Skype families"". Andy Russell with his two sons and wife Molly before she left for China Some Britons who are unable to meet the sufficient funding requirementshave used the ""Surinder Singh"" route to get their non-EU partners into the country.This involves working in another nation in the European Economic Area (EEA) for about three months. It means that when they return to the UK, their case is considered under different rules - as they are treated as a citizen of the EEA rather than a British citizen. But the Home Office must be satisfied that people who have demonstrated they did actually ""move"" to their new EEA country for the period they lived there and did not just simply take a short-term job there for immigration purposes. Home Office figures show the number of partner visas granted fell from 46,906 in the year ending June 2006 to 27,345 in the year ending June 2015, when it says 66% of applications were approved. A Home Office spokesman said those who wish to make a life in the UK were welcomed ""but family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense"". He said that was ""why we established clear rules"" based on advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee. All cases are ""considered on their individual merits,"" he said.

'Man City need Aguero now more than ever',"Sergio Aguero took his tally to 20 goals for the season Manchester City's heady mix of fantasy football and flawed defending was on display for all to see in the thrilling Champions League victory over Monaco at Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola's side were irresistible going forward and an open door at the back as they secured a 5-3 first-leg win in the last 16, the highest-scoring game at this stage of the tournament's 25-year history. City's performance still leaves them with questions to answer when they confront this gifted Monaco side in the second leg on 15 March - but one fact remains without dispute in this Guardiola era... Leroy Sane was the stand-out performer in one of the finest matches seen at Etihad Stadium - but the cutting edge was provided by 28-year-old Argentine Sergio Aguero, whosefuture has come under scrutinyin recent weeks. The spectacular and instant impact of Brazilian teenagerGabriel Jesussaw Aguero left on the bench for the Premier League victories against West Ham, Swansea City and Bournemouth. It is on nights like this, however, where Aguero demonstrated that the idea City would somehow be better off without him is a nonsense. Jesus, at just 19, and 21-year-old Sane, represent a golden future for Manchester City along with Raheem Sterling at 22, but Aguero looks like a player in his prime and fit to play his part - not just now but in the years ahead. Report: Man City 5-3 Monaco Relive Manchester City's entertaining win against Monaco Aguero has no point to prove, his record speaks eloquently enough, but he has accumulated a reputation and body of work that makes the finest defenders fear his threat. And at the elite level of the Champions League, that is a priceless commodity. It was a match that was arguably the most enthralling seen here since Aguero's 94th-minute winner in May 2012 which secured City their first title in 44 years. And the striker showed he still retains all the old powers. Aguero and his City colleagues had to contend with a blaze of attacking intent from Monaco, but in between the youthful zest of Sane and Sterling, he was the spearhead and the creator. He was rewarded for trying his luck with his first goal that prompted a dreadful error from Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. He scored his second with a crisp, instinctive right-foot volley and then set up the fifth for Sane, the goal that gave City a cushion. It was the complete, consummate attacking performance. Aguero also has a psychological impact on opponents and it gives Guardiola and City a powerful weapon. His first goal was City's 200th in the Champions League and he has now scored five in his past three games at Etihad Stadium in this competition. Yes, his recent goalscoring form has not been of his usual standard but he is the epitome of the phrase ""class is permanent"". One of the modern game's great strikers Aguero has scored 20 goals in 29 appearances this season, with 11 in 19 Premier League games The Argentine has scored a total of 156 goals in 237 games for Man City He has scored 91 goals at Etihad Stadium in 116 games at a rate of a goal in 94.84 minutes, 0.78 goals per game He has 64 in 116 games away from home and one goal in five games on neutral territory The Catalan's decision to shunt the popular goalkeeper Joe Hart out to Torino on loan was taken on the chin by supporters who idolised him. Any similar fate for Aguero would not meet such easy acceptance. The manager's embrace and kiss on Aguero's forehead when he left the action late on Tuesday evening was surely a gesture of appreciation that should end the speculation - although this latest masterclass must have done that anyway. And the bottom line is this. How much would it cost City to even think about replacing Aguero? A lot more than the Â£38m it cost them to bring him in from Atletico Madrid in July 2011. Amid the fanfare and celebration at the conclusion of a quite magnificent game of football, Manchester City were accompanied on their way to a warm weather break in Abu Dhabi by notes of caution. Yes, they have a crucial two-goal cushion, which Guardiola would have taken gratefully before kick-off - but an examination of City's defending and Monaco's wonderful attacking pace, movement and threat tells you this may yet be a flimsy advantage. Guardiola knows the score. Park the bus with this defence and Monaco will have that particular vehicle off the road and rolling away into the distance with ease. This will not be City's way, as Guardiola said: ""We will fly to Monaco to score as many goals as possible. If we don't score in Monaco we will be eliminated."" Read that as code for saying 'City have got no chance of keeping a clean sheet'. This reality has been grasped by Guardiola - helped by the fact that Monaco are the highest scorers in the top five European leagues with 111 goals in all competitions. He said: ""If one team can score a thousand million goals it's Monaco. They arrive with six or seven players in the box and it's tough to control that on the counter attack."" And if there is a team that is vulnerable to such a threat it is City. This video can not be played Monaco capable of comeback - Guardiola Guardiola's decision to play Fernandinho at left-back and leave Yaya Toure isolated was flawed - can he really repeat such a tactic in Monaco? Guardiola was, at times, frantic in his technical area. One cry of anguish as possession was conceded in a dangerous area was so pained it was plainly audible at the back of the lower tier of the stand behind him. Goalkeeper Willy Caballero's poor distribution led to Radamel Falcao's headed equaliser, while brilliant teenager Kylian Mbappe's rasping finish for Monaco's second saw City's defence split by a routine long ball. Falcao's second and Monaco's third was brilliantly executed but easily created as John Stones showed an alarming lack of strength and determination when challenging the Colombian. Guardiola must find a way to eradicate these flaws and somehow make City a tougher proposition by 15 March or this dangerous, predatory, pacy Monaco side will make short work of a two-goal deficit. And Manchester City's manager knows it. Caballero, it can now be assumed, is Manchester City's first-choice goalkeeper. Claudio Bravo, Guardiola's chosen one when he wasbrought in for Â£17m from Barcelona last August,has been demoted. Caballero was given the starting place on Tuesday after Bravo, who has earned a reputation as the shot-stopper who does not stop shots, was on FA Cup fifth round duty at Huddersfield. The 35-year-old Argentine is surely only a sticking plaster solution for a bigger problem facing Guardiola, one he must address in the summer. This means there is an element of muddling through some potentially vital games between now and May and Caballero delivered a decidedly mixed bag against Monaco. Willy Caballero has now established himself as Manchester City's number one The ability, or lack of, to play with the ball at his feet was among the factors that apparently did it for Hart and prompted the signing of Bravo. It is a central plank of Guardiola's philosophy and one that cost City the first goal against Monaco. The manager's leaping, head-in-hands reaction was a sign he knew trouble - in the shape of Falcao's header - was coming from the moment Caballero sent out a poor clearance. Caballero was only obeying orders but it was clear on several occasions he is not comfortable with them. He redeemed himself with a save from Falcao's penalty; the striker hesitating so long over the spot-kick he almost seemed to forget what he was supposed to do when he arrived at the ball. Caballero also pulled off a vital stop with his feet from Falcao's late effort with City 5-3 up, an intervention which may prove invaluable in the context of the tie. He made a significant contribution. There is no doubt, though, that the story of Manchester City's goalkeepers will provide a narrative between now and the end of the season.

Katie Hope: Should supermarkets sell more British food?,"The ingredients from a simple ready meal may have come from all corners of the earth When you pop your chicken tikka masala ready meal into the microwave at the end of a long day at work, you're likely to be thinking how hungry you are rather than marvelling at the global trade deals that brought it about in the first place. Yet the chicken, spices and rice in that box are in reality the result of a series of complex trading relationships. The chicken may have come from Thailand, the pilau rice from India and the spices from elsewhere in Asia. Even the packaging is likely to have been sourced internationally, while the meal itself may well have been produced outside the UK. The recent scandal at Waitrose, which was forced torebrand the lamb ready mealsin its ""British"" range because some are made with lamb from New Zealand, has highlighted the issue. Waitrose has said all its ""British"" lamb meals will be rebranded as ""Classic"" ""When we go into a supermarket, restaurant or coffee shop, we're at the very centre of a huge web of food and drink trading relationships, with layers and layers of exchanges going on out of sight,"" says James Walton, chief economist at food and grocery research charity IGD. All those deals add up to a significant industry. We import more than we export of all types of food. The UK imported a whoppingÂ£38.5bn worth of food, feed and drink in 2015,external, the most recent official statistics available. The number dwarfs the Â£18bn worth of food we exported that year. In fact, just half of the food we eat in the UK originates here, with most of the rest imported from Europe. A recent vegetable shortage, driven by bad weather in southern Europe, highlighted this dependence, and led to a flurry of pictures on social media of empty supermarket shelves. On top of this, the pound's 14% fall against the euro since the Brexit vote means imports cost more, and there is huge uncertainty over what effect leaving the EU will have on the cost and availability of food from Europe. All of this begs the obvious question: shouldn't supermarkets simply rely more on British suppliers instead? Supermarkets are coy on just how much they source from the UK, with Morrisons the only one of the ""Big Four"" to answer my email on this question. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's did not reply. Morrisons, which says it already sources around two-thirds of its supplies from the UK, has pledged to recruit 200 more British suppliers aftera report it commissionedfound global uncertainties meant it ""makes increasing sense to build up a stronger local food sector"". The report's author, Prof Tim Benton, said the aim of doing this ""is not to disengage from reliance on global trade, but to hedge our bets by increasing local production for local consumption"". Local is all the rage right now, with the popularity of farmers' markets, homemade artisan breads and craft beers continuing apace. People expect food and drink that hasn't travelled thousands of miles to taste better. The assumption is also that production standards will be higher. People are also keen to support their local economy. In fact, three-quarters of people said they try to buy British food and drink if it is available, mainly with the motivation to support British manufacturers and jobs, according to IGD's December survey of 1,700 shoppers. Although notably, a lot less - just under a third - said they were willing to pay more for the privilege. Tesco was criticised last year for tapping into this trend,using fictional British-sounding farm nameson labelling for a range of meat and fresh produce, some of which was sourced from abroad. Rosedene Farms may sound British - but the strawberries are from Morocco But while the notion of buying British may be appealing, the reality is that on a bigger scale it's very difficult to achieve. Even if we ate all the food we exported, we would still generate less than two-thirds of what we need, according to Prof Benton. And while Morrisons has pledged to source more from the UK, the chain is in an unusual position in that it already owns an abattoir and meat-processing operations, as well as bakeries and produce-packing sites, making it easier for it to be more self-reliant. For many of its rivals, replicating this kind of domestic supply chain would be much tougher. Paul Martin, head of retail at consultancy KPMG, says often the economics just don't stack up. ""On paper, it's very appealing, but the challenge is that due to the high cost of manufacturing in the UK, you need to have a very high utilisation rate. If you are a supermarket then you're likely only to supply to yourself,"" he says. The hurdles aren't just financial. The UK doesn't actually have enough room to grow all the crops and keep all the animals that we currently eat. The climate means there are also certain items, such as bananas, that we simply cannot grow at scale in the UK. Given the massive housing shortage in the UK, Mr Martin says it's unlikely to be desirable politically to use more land for farming. The UK could never produce enough wine to satisfy demand, says KPMG's Paul Martin And while supermarkets may talk of looking at alternative supply sources - something he notes is a good way of putting overseas suppliers under pressure to keep costs low - the reality is that the impact on consumers may also be unpalatable. ""If you suddenly say we'll shift 30% or 40% of imported food categories, even if it was possible, it would have a significant shift on the way people consume goods,"" says Mr Martin. Lots of products, such as tomatoes and strawberries, which we take for granted as being available all year round, no longer would be. And, he says with a smile, the UK could never produce enough wine to satisfy demand. The other problem is producing more home grown products in significantly more volume in an economy almost entirely reliant on the services economy would require a dramatic revolution that would take years. ""The evolution of our supply chain moving abroad took some years and moving it back would take a similar length of time. The reality is this is something that cannot be changed quickly, whether you're talking about courgettes or cotton trousers,"" says veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman. While the rising costs of imports are expected to push the cost of our supermarket shop higher, Mr Hyman thinks the intensity of competition from discounters Lidl and Adli, and the ever-present threat of Amazon, means supermarkets will be willing to absorb much of these to protect their market share. He believes for supermarkets this fierce war for customers is a far bigger priority than sourcing more food from the UK. ""This is the real challenge. A lot of questions go far, far deeper than a hut in a field in Lincolnshire. Would that it was that simple,"" he says.

Five challenges for the Met's new chief,"When the Metropolitan Police Service's newly appointed commissioner, Cressida Dick, begins work at the force's impressive new headquarters on the Embankment, she might like to take a moment to admire the view overlooking the River Thames. But only a moment. Ms Dick won't have time for much more than that. The new commissioner will find that when it comes to leading the Met, there's no off-switch. It's a policing organisation like no other in the UK, with a budget of Â£3bn, a workforce of 43,000 and responsibility for keeping everyone in London - from Barking to Buckingham Palace, from West Norwood to Westminster - safe. The leader of Britain's biggest and most influential police force will come under pressure to make early decisions: on whether to roll out controversial spit-guards, on how to police the Notting Hill Carnival and if Tasers should be extended to all officers. She'll face intense scrutiny from the media, which has a tendency to escalate stories of local difficulties into ones of national importance. And she'll be expected to provide regular updates to the London Assembly, MPs on the home affairs committee, the mayor of London and the home secretary. For Ms Dick there's also an added dimension: the need to stamp her authority on a police force that for over five years has bent to the will of Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, whose no-nonsense style was respected but not universally liked. Indeed, Sir Bernard's retirement may tempt officers who didn't always agree with him to speak out, to adopt a different approach, to do things their own way. And that could spell trouble for Cressida Dick as she sets out to make her mark. One of the key issues the new commissioner will have to grapple with is how to shore up the confidence of firearms officers. In Sir Bernard's final major speech last week, he said there was a ""very shallow pool"" of people wanting to do the job partly because they were increasingly ""portrayed as suspects"" when someone was shot. The problems may come to a head within weeks, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decides whether or not to charge a policeman over the death of Jermaine Baker in Wood Green in December 2015. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to retire Hogan-Howe in cuts warning Met Police chief calls for 'more trust' in armed officers The officer who fired the fatal shot was arrested, interviewed under criminal caution and bailed by police pending the CPS decision, which is seen as pivotal in the Met's efforts to recruit 600 more specialist armed officers. The move to boost police firearms capacity was sparked by concerns about the threat from terrorism - in particular, the possibility of a marauding gun attack. For Ms Dick, who will have national responsibility for counter-terrorism as well as for protecting London, a complicating factor in the security picture is the political turbulence caused by the election in the US of Donald Trump - and Brexit. The result of the EU referendum sparked a rise in hate crime which police will need to remain on the alert for, while Britain's departure from the EU means the Met and other forces will have to forge new relationships over law enforcement with their European counterparts. As for President Trump, his state visit to the UK, expected to be this year, will present the commissioner with a huge policing challenge. Protests have already taken place in London and are likely to continue, sometimes at very short notice. Many commissioners judge their success in terms of crime. Has it gone up or down? Since the mid-1990s the overall trend has been downwards, due mainly to large falls in acquisitive crimes such as car theft and burglary. For the past three years, however, offences recorded by the Met Police have been on the increase. In 2016, there were 761,998 crimes, 3.5% up on the year before, prompting Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to remark that the ""warning lights are flashing"". Although the rise in crimes such as sexual offences and domestic abuse is driven by a greater willingness on the part of victims to come forward, what'll most worry the new incumbent are the year-on-year increases of 6% in violence, 17% in knife crime and 22% in firearms offences. Understanding what's behind this apparent upsurge and finding ways to tackle it will be a priority for the commissioner. Her task will undoubtedly be made harder by the tough financial climate. Over the past six years the Met has saved about Â£600m on its annual budget, chiefly by selling police buildings and cutting civilian staff posts. Making further cutbacks - which Sir Bernard and Sadiq Khan, London's mayor, both anticipate if the government changes the way constabularies are funded in England and Wales - are almost certain to entail a reduction in the number of officers. So far, that's been avoided, with 32,000 currently in post. Over the past few months, the outgoing Met commissioner has issued a number of warnings about the impact of cutting officers in a city whose population is becoming bigger and more diverse. If recruitment slows or freezes, efforts to broaden the ethnic mix of the force so it better reflects the people of London will grind to a halt At present 13% of officers are black, Asian or from a minority ethnic background, compared to 40% of those living in the capital. The issue of officer numbers and possible budget cuts is likely to be the biggest and most immediate political challenge facing Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe's replacement. Will she be as bold in confronting the problem as he's been? Or will she take a more diplomatic approach? However calm the Thames may look from her vantage point in New Scotland Yard, Cressida Dick will know that choppy waters lie ahead.

Five questions ahead of new US travel ban,"The first ban was met by protests in airports across the US - in Dallas, Muslims prayed in protest The US Supreme Court has upheld President Donald Trump's revised travel ban and overruled legal challenges from lower courts. This is the government's third version of a controversial policy since Mr Trump took office in January. The latest presidential proclamation,external- which was issued in September - bans nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. It also covers travellers from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela. But lower courts had already allowed those provisions to take effect. Chad was removed from the list in April. This third version of the travel ban has been in operation since December, when the Supreme Court allowed it to go into force as legal challenges went on. The 5-4 ruling at the highest court in the US reverses a series of lower court decisions that had said the ban was unconstitutional. It hands a major victory to President Trump, who made immigration a central plank of his campaign and introduced the first version of his travel ban just one week into office. Why did a US veteran give his medal to a stranger? Is Trump's bleak vision of America justified? The Canadian town feeling refugee burden Chief Justice John Roberts gave the landmark opinion and the court's other four conservative judges also ruled in favour of the president. The four liberal justices dissented. Theoriginal order,externalissued in January 2017 barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya - from entering the US for 90 days. It also halted refugee resettlement for 120 days and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. Chaos ensued at airports, where there was some confusion about enforcement. That travel ban was later blocked by federal courts. Therevised order,externalin March removed Iraq from the list, after it agreed to boost co-operation with the US, and it also lifted the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. It was also struck down but in June 2017, the Supreme Court allowed that version of the policy to take partial effect, against travellers without close links to the US. A third version of the ban was issued in September, taking Sudan off the list but adding Chad, North Korea and Venezuelan government officials. The latest travel ban says that the countries ""remain deficient at this time with respect to their identity-management and information-sharing capabilities, protocols, and practices.  In some cases, these countries also have a significant terrorist presence within their territory"". Critics have noted that major attacks such as the 9/11 New York attacks, the Boston marathon bombing and the Orlando nightclub attack were carried out by people from countries not on the list, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan, or by US-born attackers. This was a crucial question in the legal battle, as six out of eight countries on the list are predominantly Muslim. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' In one early challenge, a US district judge in Virginiaruled the first order was unconstitutionalbecause it had religious bias at its heart  - an appeals court in the same state ruled along the same lines on the second ban too. Ruling on the second version, the Hawaii court also dismissed the government's argument that the ban is not anti-Muslim because it targets all individuals from the six countries, regardless of religion, and the countries themselves represent only a small fraction of the world's Muslim population. ""The illogic of the government's contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,"" the court ruling said, pointing out that the countries' populations were between 90% and 99% Muslim. The court also cited statements made by Mr Trump, such as a 2015 press release calling for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". But the Department of Justice has said a distinction should be made between things said as a candidate and as president.

Grieving widow,"Helen Bailey's husband John Sinfield died while the pair were on holiday in Barbados in 2011 Helen Bailey's life changed completely following the death of her husband in 2011. Overcome by loneliness, she sought solace through the internet, writing a successful blog and communicating with others dealing with grief. It was here that she met the man she thought would become her life partner - but he would instead prove to be her killer. Six years ago, Ms Bailey was enjoying success as a children's author, having written more than 20 books, including the popular Electra Brown series. A lover of cooking, Arsenal FC and her Dachshund Boris, the Northumberland-born writer lived with her husband John Sinfield in Highgate, north London. The pair had been together for 22 years, and married for 15. In February 2011, during a holiday to Barbados, her world was turned upside down when Mr Sinfield got caught in a rip current in the sea and drowned. Ms Bailey was, in her own words, ""a wife at breakfast, but a widow by lunch"". The aftermath saw her start a blog, Planet Grief. The posts shine with wit, humour, honesty and authenticity as she recounts moments from her life as a widow. She describes releasing memorial balloons on Hampstead Heath; buying a single Scotch egg in the deli she used to frequent with her husband; coping with Christmas and the loss of the festive traditions she used to enjoy as a couple. And she describes meeting Ian Stewart. Ms Bailey wrote more than 20 books, including the Electra Brown series for teenagers ""I'm on a Facebook bereavement page, piddling around,"" she wrote in one post. ""A photo comes up. I am surprised to see it because I know the man in the photo. ""I keep wondering where we met, wracking my grieving brain. ""As it turned out, we had never met, but the man was Gorgeous Grey-Haired Widower, a man who from the moment we first met, I felt as if I had known for my entire life."" Ms Bailey went on to date GGHW, as she referred to him in her blog, and they later bought a house in Royston, Hertfordshire, moving in together along with his two sons. They were planning to marry and were arranging a wedding at nearby Brocket Hall. But in April last year, she was reported missing; a disappearance friends and family said was completely out of character. Ms Bailey and Stewart moved in together at a house in Royston, Hertfordshire Ms Bailey's Dachshund, Boris, was her constant companion Stewart made the initial call to police - he claimed to have found a note from Ms Bailey saying she needed ""space"" and had gone to her holiday home in Broadstairs, Kent. He later issued a heartfelt message which said: ""You not only mended my heart five years ago but made it bigger, stronger and kinder. ""Now it feels like my heart doesn't even exist. Our plans are nowhere near complete and without you there is no point."" Stewart sent text messages to her phone asking him to let her know she was OK, pleading with her to call. Friends and fellow dog walkers organised searches to try to find her, with many also sending messages to her phone and social media accounts. But all along, her body - and that of her beloved pet Boris - were hidden metres away from where police were searching. When she was found in a cesspit three months later, tests revealed she had been systematically drugged over a period of time before finally being suffocated. Stewart and Ms Bailey were described by a neighbour as ""complete opposites"" Ian Stewart's wife Diane died in 2010 Stewart, described by many as ""quiet"" and ""reserved"", had been widowed in 2010 when his wife, Diane, died. She had an epileptic fit in the garden of their home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire. The 56-year-old had worked as a software engineer before being forced to give up work due to poor health. Early in 2016 he had been told there was a high chance he had bowel cancer, but was later given the all-clear. He suffered from insomnia and was prescribed a drug called zopiclone - the same drug pathologists found in Ms Bailey's system. Mavis Drake, the couple's nearest neighbour in Royston, said Stewart was a man ""without much personality"". ""He didn't make any impression on me,"" she said. ""He wouldn't venture information, so you'd have to try to prise it out of him. ""I would never in a million years have matched them up as a couple. To me they were complete opposites in character."" The search for Ms Bailey lasted three months During the murder trial, St Albans Crown Court heard evidence about Stewart's behaviour and actions in the weeks after the killing. On 11 April, the day he suffocated Ms Bailey, he went to watch his son Jamie play bowls before having a Chinese takeaway in the evening. Detectives investigating the author's disappearance told the jury he seemed ""quite blasÃ© and non-committal"", appearing, at one point, to ""turn his head to the side and look at us and grin"". As the prime beneficiary of Ms Bailey's will, he stood to inherit the bulk of her fortune - thought to be more than Â£3.3m at the time of her death. While the search for her was under way, he renewed their Arsenal season tickets from the couple's joint account and went on holiday to Mallorca, the jury heard. ""In hindsight, I think he was beginning to believe everything was going to carry on as normal and she'd never be found,"" said neighbour Mrs Drake. An aerial view of the couple's home in Royston and the garage, beneath which Ms Bailey's body was found Ms Bailey's body was found in a cesspit underneath a Victorian well It was a comment from Mrs Drake herself that led to his downfall, after she mentioned to officers about the cesspit hidden below her neighbours' garage. Three months after he reported her missing, Stewart was charged with murder. He was convicted after a seven-week trial at St Albans Crown Court. ""To say it sent shockwaves through the widowed community is an understatement,"" said Laraine Mason, who, like Stewart, had met Ms Bailey online following the death of her spouse. ""For this tragedy to have happened to a lady who had found happiness again, after being widowed in the most tragic of circumstances is in itself horrific. ""Words cannot possibly express the horror and repulsion we feel by the fact that these acts have been perpetrated by one of our own against one of our own."" Stewart was arrested on suspicion of murder on 11 July last year Comments left by friends on the final Planet Grief blog post after Ms Bailey's death show just how loved and respected she was within the bereaved community online. They speak of the comfort her words had brought over the years, her honesty and humour, how much she would be missed. The blog had been hugely successful, gaining followers from around the world. In 2015, the posts had formed the basis for a book: ""When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis."" At Ms Bailey's memorial service, Ms Mason spoke of the ""exceptional talent"" of her friend, the ""searingly honest, yet at the same time witty account of life after the death of a loved one"". Bereavement coach Shelley Whitehead, who met Ms Bailey a few months after Mr Sinfield died, called her ""a brave, gutsy, connected woman"" who was ""so funny"". ""Helen created tribes - she had a following on widow and widower's websites,"" she said. ""It helped her, and it helped others who had experienced loss. ""She was making sense of the world and her loss through her writing."" Ms Bailey's Planet Grief blog gained followers from around the world Shelley Whitehead, left, said she was ""blessed"" to call Ms Bailey her friend For some of those closest to Ms Bailey, it is her writing which stirs up memories of the woman she was, and the impact she had on their lives. ""Helen lives on in her books - I keep copies of her book on grief in my office. I give them to newly bereaved partners,"" Ms Whitehead said. ""I feel blessed to have coached a woman like Helen. I feel blessed to call her my friend."" In the wake of the trial, with its revelations about the extent of Stewart's deception and his actions, the dedications at the end of Ms Bailey's book are difficult to read. ""And finally, this book is dedicated to my Gorgeous Grey-Haired Widower, Ian Stewart: BB, I love you,"" it says. ""You are my happy ending.""

Alt-right civil war,"Comedian Bill Maher (left) hosted Milo Yiannopoulos (right) on his television show Leading figures and activists on the alt-right have split over controversial comments made by one of the movement's champions. Milo Yiannopoulos is a passionate supporter of Donald Trump and rose to fame as an editor at the right-wing website Breitbart. His extreme views on feminism and Islam made him a darling of the American alt-right - a loose collection of anti-immigration, anti-political correctness conservatives including many white nationalists. Although Yiannopoulos has consistently said he is not a member of the movement, in March 2016 co-wrote a much-citeddefence of the alt-right,external. But now he appears to have crossed a line with his views after videos surfaced in which he appeared to condone paedophilia, and some of his former allies have turned against him. The footage showed him discussing the supposed merits of gay relationships between adults and boys as young as 13. Yiannopoulos will no longer speak at a US conservative conference and a book deal, reportedly worth $250,000, has been cancelled. On Tuesday heresigned from Breitbart. In a statement he said his ""poor choice of words"" was detracting from the work of his colleagues. Writer Milo Yiannopoulos at one of his controversial university speaking engagements in the US While many grass-root supporters are standing by him, a number of high profile right-wing figures seem to have decided his latest comments are a step too far. Tim Treadstone tweets under the name Baked Alaska and ranked number eight on Time Magazine's most influential Twitter feeds of 2017. He was one of the first alt-right activists to openly criticise Milo. Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice Media and now a leading anti-feminist campaigner, was also quick to distance himself from Milo's comments, but at the same time claimed that the Breitbart editor was being targeted by establishment forces. ""Advocating sex w 13-yr-olds under ANY conditions is indefensible but this is ultimately about the old right's disdain for the new right,"" he tweeted. Who is Milo Yiannopoulos? Yiannopoulos quits Breitbart News Trumpâs shock troops: Who are the âalt-rightâ? Visit theTrending Facebook page,external The white nationalist Richard B Spencer, one of the leaders of the movement and someone who had previously described Yiannopoulos as ""alt light"" was dismissive. Yiannopoulos did though get support from some parts of the far right. Alex Jones, who runs the far right Infowars, uploaded a video defending Yiannopoulos, blaming the mainstream media for taking his words out of context. Debate has also been raging on the social media site Gab, whichas BBC Trending has previously reported, is a favourite hangout of the alt-right. Users seem divided over whether Yiannopoulos deserves sympathy or condemnation. ""Yes, Milo is a flamboyant provocateur, but this coordinated attack on him by the #FakeNews is disgusting,"" wroteone user,externalwho signed off with the hashtag ""Stand with Milo."" Another wrote: ""Please let's not lose this guy. Nothing is worse than serving a cause, and getting chewed up and spit out."" While most of the messages on Gab defended Yiannopoulos, many users were critical: ""Regardless if recent events are justified or not, I haven't liked that many were hitching the movement to Milo. He's always been a bit of an attention whore."" ""Milo has always insisted he isn't #altright, he recently disavowed white identity and on Maher said he wasn't even conservative,"" wrote another. ""He basically disavowed the entire right so what are we defending here exactly?""

The grime star and the late rock icon are up for best British male. Other nominees at ""music's biggest night"" include Beyonce, The 1975 and Bastille. Performances will come from Ed Sheeran and Little Mix, as well as US stars Katy Perry and Bruno Mars. There will also be a tribute to pop star George Michael, who died on Christmas Day. The show kicks off at 19:30 on ITV and you can follow the red carpet action onBBC Music News Livefrom 15:00 GMT. Brit Awards 2017: Nominations in full 7 moments to watch for at the Brits 2017 - BBC Music 10 things you probably didn't know about the Brits - BBC Music Dermot O'Leary and Emma Willis have been drafted in to present the ceremony at London's O2 Arena, after original host Michael Buble pulled out to care for his young son, who isreceiving treatment for cancer. Willis, a mum-of-three who presents The Voice UK and Big Brother, said she hoped she could ""do him proud"". ""Every part of me sends so much love and all the best wishes in the world to Michael and his family at such a difficult time,"" she said. This video can not be played Best single nominee Zara Larsson on why she loves the Brit Awards The star will introduce performances from the following acts: Katy Perry - in her first UK TV appearance for three years Ed Sheeran - premiering a brand new song Robbie Williams - who receives the Brits Icon award Bruno Mars The 1975 Little Mix Emeli Sande Skepta This year's ceremony is notable for its recognition of grime, which re-emerged from the underground last year, asserting its position as the UK's biggest musical movement since Britpop. Skepta, who won the 2016 Mercury Prize for his self-released album Konnichiwa, is favourite to win best breakthrough artist; while fellow grime MCs Stormzy and Kano are also up for awards. Bowie - who died in January last year - is likely to prevail in the best British male category, as the music industry takes its chance to honour one of rock's most recognisable and influential figures. His haunting swansong, Blackstar, is also up for best British album. Little Mix have three nominations Pop group Little Mix tie with Skepta for the most-nominated act of the night  - each has three. The girl band look like they will be locked out of their categories, best group (likely to go to The 1975), best video (One Direction) and best single (Clean Bandit, for Rockabye). But they have solid support from Stormzy, who's rooting for Jade, Perry, Leigh-Anne and Jesy to take home a trophy. ""They have smashed it,""the grime star told BBC Newsbeat. ""Their new song, Touch, is a banger. I can't even lie.""

The Scottish Six is dead - long live the Scottish NineSarah SmithScotland editor22 February 2017 (12:03:49),"The BBC is very experienced at broadcasting news to as many people as possible. Traditionally it's always been much less good at keeping secrets. Journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip. So, it was highly unusual that BBC bosses had managed to keep the launch ofa whole new BBC Scotland channelentirely secret until it was announced to staff on Wednesday morning. Staff, viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a ""Scottish Six"" had been shelved. No one knew that there would be an hour-long news programme with Scottish, UK and world news at 9pm instead. Already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel, new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes. The announcement of new nightly news programme at 9pm does mean that the idea of a ""Scottish Six"" is now dead. So people who had been campaigning for that will be frustrated. Already the First Minster Nicola Sturgeon has said there is lots to welcome in this announcement but that it doesn't deliver everything she wanted. Saying it's disappointing that there is no Scottish Six - but ""progress and hopefully sign of new thinking"". Another SNP politician told me that the decision not to put a Scottish news hour on BBC One looks ""entirely political"". Saying that viewers accustomed to getting their news at tea time may not immediately develop the habit of watching a digital channel at 9pm. But for those who wanted a news programme reflecting the world from a Scottish perspective, produced and presented from Scotland - the BBC is now delivering what they asked for. The Scottish Six is dead. Long live the Scottish Nine.

Tinder wants AI to set you up on a dateDave LeeNorth America technology reporter22 February 2017 (03:49:58),"When I first met Sean Rad,back in 2013, Tinder was a blossoming dating app. It was known primarily for, how shall I put it,casualrelationships. Back then he told me Tinder was âgood for humanityâ, a line I instantly latched onto as being faintly ridiculous, and wonderful for a headline. But now when I think of how Tinder has impacted my life, and those of several people close to me, I start to see what he was getting at. Life-changing things have happened to millions of people thanks to that simple swipe-yes-swipe-no interface. I know people who have married their Tinder matches. I know many others who are in serious relationships. And yes, I know many people who have had casual hook-ups and one-night stands. Yet why that last point is seen as a negative to be joked about Iâll never know.  People have been doing that in bars for well over 100 years. Anyway, Tinder is growing up. Itâs now a serious technology company tackling one of lifeâs most important matters, and is by far the most popular dating app worldwide. After a lot of boardroom musical chairs,external, Mr Rad is the chairman of both Tinder and Swipe Ventures, the arm of the company designed to buy other dating-related technologies. One of which is artificial intelligence. And its collision with dating might be the most intriguing application of AI yet. Sean Rad spoke at the Startup Grind Global conference in Redwood City, California âI think this might sound crazy,â Mr Rad said on Tuesday at tech conference Start-Up Grind. ""In five years time, Tinder might be so good, you might be like âHey [Apple voice assistant] Siri, whatâs happening tonight?â âAnd Tinder might pop up and say 'Thereâs someone down the street you might be attracted to. Sheâs also attracted to you. Sheâs free tomorrow night. We know you both like the same band, and itâs playing - would you like us to buy you tickets?ââ¦ and you have a match. ""Itâs a little scary."" Also a little lazy, you might say. Part of the dating process is surely assessing someoneâs tastes and idea of fun. If thatâs taken out of the equation, itâs a lot harder to understand a person. Still, even though it can be difficult to admit, dating really is a numbers game, and right now the data Tinder uses is primitive: age, location and mutual friends - as well as a few mutual interests as defined by what you âlikeâ on Facebook. Why not add a few parameters and make it even more likely you will click? Traffic light party Anyone who has been a student will know about âtraffic light partiesâ (or stoplights if youâre an American). A hideous concept in which you go on a night out dressed in either red, amber or green. Red means âin a relationship and happyâ. Green means âsingle and lookingâ. Amber means youâre a bad human being. The idea is that two âgreensâ can find each other easily. Quite why anyone would go as a âredâ is anyoneâs guess. Now, this works (in theory) on university campuses. But such a system would be bedlam in the real world - particularly on St Patrickâs Day, I'd imagine. But you have to admit, a way of knowing someoneâs relationship status without having to ask would be a very useful tool. Indeed, itâs what made Facebook popular in its early days. Mr Rad sees a time when Tinder could offer a form of real-life traffic party through augmented reality. AR is the technology that overlays digital images onto the real world as you walk around. So far the only truly popular application of it has been Pokemon Go, which, while bringing people together, isnât the relationship fast-track most people are presumably looking for. But what if you could use AR to meet potential partners? ""That will definitely impact dating,â Mr Rad said, noting Tinder is popular for so many people because it allows us to show interest in a person without the fear of rejection. ""You can imagine how, with augmented reality, that experience could happen in the room, in real time. The impact is profound as these devices get closer to your senses, to your eyes, to your experiences.â That might make you deeply uncomfortable. I don't blame you. As ever, it will be up to technology companies - not just Tinder - to roll out such ideas in way that doesnât encroach on privacy, or indeed, common decency and manners. The key word here is, as always, consent. Tinderâs future lives and breathes on its ability to remain the most popular app for getting people together and into relationships. More recently, rival services like Bumble have shown signs of disrupting Tinderâs dominance. Bumbleâs key selling point is the fact women have to initiate the conversations. But thereâs plenty of market to go round. Tinder now has a far more global focus, Mr Rad said, with approximately 600 million smartphone-toting single people ready to find The One.

British Cycling 'misled UK Sport',"This video can not be played 'No indication of King report significance' British Cycling has been accused of watering down the findings of an internal review in 2012 by the chief executive of UK Sport. Liz Nicholl said the governing body ""fed a very light-touch version"" to the funding agency. Former British Cycling chief executive Peter King took anonymous statements from 40 personnel as part of a report that was never made public. ""We didn't receive the King report,"" Nicholl told BBC Sport. ""We were given to believe that... actually we had a very light-touch version of it fed to us at UK Sport, so we had no indication of the significance of that report. ""It's only now come to light."" Speaking to national newspapers,Nicholl confirmed she considered it to effectively be a cover-up,,externaladding: ""That's a complete lack of transparency and that's a relationship that is not acceptable in terms of what was shared with us as opposed to what the actual facts of that report were."" UK Sport have faced questions over why they did not act on a report that is known to include allegations of bullying. Nicholls' incendiary comments come as the country's most successful and best-funded sports governing body braces itself for thepublication of another reportinto alleged bullying, favouritism and sexism, led by British Rowing chair Annamarie Phelps. Publication is expected in the next month. Former British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake commissioned the King report in September 2012 but left the organisation in January, three months earlier than planned. He could not be reached for comment. UCI president Brian Cookson, who was president of British Cycling when King delivered the report in December 2012, said he would not comment until the Phelps report was published. UK Sport are currently considering whether to help fund Cookson's re-election campaign, having contributed Â£77,000 in 2013. King told BBC Sport he was ""disappointed"" to hear Nicholl say she never saw his full report. In a statement, British Cycling said: ""Contributions were made with a guarantee of anonymity, so key findings and recommendations were shared in briefings with UK Sport and the British Cycling board. ""The full report was also made available to the 2016 independent review, jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling in April last year, of the world class programme."" The current Phelps inquiry was jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling following allegations of sexism and bullying made by rider Jess Varnish against former technical director Shane Sutton. Varnish claimed the coach had used sexist and discriminatory language when dropping her from the Olympic programme, something he strongly denies. In October, Sutton resigned and was found guilty of one charge of using inappropriate language by an internal review. A number of other riders and former staff members have backed Varnish's portrayal of ""a culture of fear"" within British Cycling, including former road world champion Nicole Cooke, who told a parliamentary select committee that it was a sport ""run by men, for men"". Former performance director Sir Dave Brailsford has insisted he ran a regime that was ""not sexist but definitely medallist"". This video can not be played Sutton resigns amid discrimination row ""All those views are being taken into account through the review,"" said Nicholl. ""It's fair to say that the high-performance system here is pretty male-dominated. There aren't very many female coaches and there's an opportunity to address that in future, and to get a better balance to support athletes in a way that athletes of today want to be supported. ""Athletes have moved on and maybe the programmes haven't moved on as fast as they should have done, but what we see is an opportunity."" The legally sensitive nature of Phelps' report has meant it has been delayed, with fears it could be heavily redacted to protect witness confidentiality. Those who gave evidence are now being asked how much of their testimony can be revealed, while those criticised have an opportunity to respond. Publication could take another month, but on 1 March British Cycling will brief staff and riders on an ""action plan"" - effectively its response to the report and concerns over the way it operates. This will include greater oversight of its high-performance programme, and more consideration of athlete welfare. ""There's no excuse for not addressing duty of care responsibilities to athletes,"" said Nicholls. ""There's no excuse for not putting athletes first. ""They are are the ones who'll deliver the medals and every programme should be trying to ensure they have happy and successful athletes and there probably hasn't been enough attention in sport about how they do things. ""There's a lot of focus on operational delivery, probably not enough on leadership management and communication."" Nicholl told the BBC that she would be ""clear about the actions that UK Sport and British Cycling need to take"". Should welfare come before winning?

When these business people faced life-changing injuries and illnesses they set about creating their own companies which would work for them. This video can not be played How a paralysed man invented aids for disabled people Rob Smith had been studying engineering at Warwick University when he fell down a rock face and into a gully while on holiday with friends. The back injury he sustained paralysed him from the waist down and impaired the use of his hands. ""When I came out of hospital I wanted to get back into what I was doing before, such as taking up new sports,"" he says. ""But I was struggling to grip items in the gym with my poor hand function so I developed something to enable me to do that on my own."" Smith tried many prototypes until he developed Active Hands, a grip-aid which goes over the hand and straps around the item that needs to be picked up. Using a system of straps the Active Hand can help someone to grip an item ""A lot of the guys I was playing wheelchair rugby with at the time saw what I'd made and said 'that's really good can you make one for me?' So we started making a few more and that's how it developed."" So popular was the gadget that more than 100 Paralympians used it during the 2016 Games and about half of stock is sold overseas. This year's turnover is expected to be Â£250,000. Smith says: ""It really does empower disabled people and helps them to become more active and to get more access to activities that would otherwise just be impossible because of their weak hand function. ""We're really proud to be able to be a business and also help out those people to gain independence.""

He says he found his ataxic cerebral palsy - which affects hand-to-eye co-ordination - stressful in the pressurised environment. ""I started off as a banqueting chef in the Hilton, doing maybe 200 covers a night. ""The way my ataxic cerebral palsy affected me was that it was actually slowing me down. ""I couldn't chop things quick enough. I couldn't do the manual work quick enough which was then creating pressure upon myself."" Anthony left his job and opened the business which he describes as ""not your usual bakery"" focusing only on rustic, handmade, breads and steering clear of the ""really pretty breads"". All of the bread made in the Loaf and Ladder Secret Bakery is handmade ""They're rustic and they're more in tune with the way my brain will allow my hands to work,"" he says. After spending some time unemployed Anthony said making the leap from benefits to business-owner was difficult. ""Once I hit a threshold of Â£73 a week they start drastically reducing the housing benefit which effectively means I'm not taking a salary and I'm having to rely on my tax credits to basically feed me and keep the house warm."" He says the financial reality of running his artisan bakery comes with some tough decisions in the future which he hopes he doesn't have to make. ""The business has to take off within three to six months. If it's not done so by then I'm going to have to seriously reconsider my options.""

He is now focused on building up his business which serves farms across his local area and specialises in hedge-cutting, silage and hay bailing. ""It's a lot different. Frustration's the biggest thing, not being able to just jump out and open a gate. You have to be patient and ask a lot of people for help.

'Slow' progress on High Street accessForced to retire at 48 with arthritis1:01The power of the 'purple pound',"Product designer Sophie Morgan (right) is trying to make a change on the High Street New research shows that access to the High Street for disabled people remains ""slow"", according to a new survey by DisabledGo. The most recent investigation from the not-for-profit disability organisation reveals almost a quarter of all fashion retailers have no step-free access, with only 10% offering hearing loops to help deaf shoppers. When compared to a wider survey carried out in 2014, the results show a similar or in places poorer performance than before. It's been two years since DisabledGo shocked the government with evidence that highlighted the inaccessibility of the British High Street for disabled people. In 2014, the accessibility information providers visited over 25,000 shops and restaurants in person. It was one of the largest assessments of its kind in the UK. But fast-forward to 2017 and their most recent snapshot of 1,295 fashion retailers shows that not much has changed. The BBC's business and economics unit is looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them A range of stories will feature across online, TV and radio from 20-24 February 2017 On Twitter and Facebook you can follow the hashtag #DisabilityWorks and at the end of the week you can download theOuch podcast Disability Works: Breaking down barriers in business More Disability stories Speaking about the findings, Anna Nelson, executive director of DisabledGo.com, says: ""progress has been slow"". ""We were hoping the survey would show improvement over the past two years, but sadly this is not the case."" This week I'm looking into disability and the fashion industry, as part of the BBC's Disability Works week and have been given these exclusive figures. Of the 1,295 fashion retailers DisabledGo visited, over 60% didn't provide staff with any disability awareness training - a slight improvement on the 2014 audit. However, fewer retailers were able to provide a hearing loop, and the situation for wheelchair users was also slightly worse. Of the 1,295 fashion retailers DisabledGo visited: 23% did not have access for wheelchair users 96% were able to provide somewhere to sit and rest Only 10% had a hearing loop available for shoppers with hearing aids Only 38% gave staff disability awareness training The latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show the collective spending power of disabled people, often referred to as the ""purple pound"", has risen to Â£249bn. ""You would think that this together with the legal obligations for every retailer to make reasonable adjustments would have been a catalyst for change,"" says DisabledGo.com's Anna Nelson. ""To us, providing great service to disabled people should just be about providing great customer service."" This video can not be played The power of the ""purple pound"" explained The Equality Act 2010 is meant to ensure disabled people have equal access in all areas of life. This may mean changing the way in which services are delivered, providing extra equipment and/or removing physical barriers. But when it comes to fashion, the barriers facing disabled people don't just stop at physical access. According to the disability charity Scope, the representation of disability on the High Street is ""simply not up to scratch"". Yet there are signs that the government is now recognising this issue. In a statement to the BBC, Penny Mordaunt, the Minister of State for Disabled People, said: ""Our shop windows, magazine pages and catwalks should reflect the diversity of our society, and I want to see businesses making a real effort to be open to everyone. ""That's why this week I've announcednew champions to address the issues faced by disabled consumers, from buying clothes to travelling abroad. They'll highlight the importance of being inclusive, whilst tapping into the Â£249bn spending power of disabled consumers."" This video can not be played Wheelchair user creates mannequin to target disabled consumers One woman on a mission to change things is Channel 4 presenter and product designer Sophie Morgan. In 2010 she designed and developed the ""mannequal"", a wheelchair for a sitting mannequin. Having modelled in the past, Sophie is passionate about fashion being ""for every body"". Around 2012 she managed to get her mannequal in the shop front of a large High Street store. Her product was used as part of a campaign during the London Paralympics. But as soon as the Games came to an end, so did the campaign and Sophie's mannequal. Disillusioned by the endless obstacles, Sophie put her mannequal to bed. But now, she feels it's the right time to try again. Mannequal developer Sophie Morgan says the High Street is being slow to embrace equality I met Sophie in London to see her product, fresh off the production line. It's the first time she's seen it in a shop front in nearly five years. ""Fashion designers are opening up to the creative opportunity of diversity. But while the public and the press recognise and celebrate equality on the catwalk, this has yet to filter down to the High Street. ""The product itself is just a small thing. We've got to make a push so that retailers actually go, 'yeah, OK, we'll listen,'"" says Sophie. ""This chair is just one small thing in the bigger picture, but I feel that's why I did it, it was like taking baby steps and see what happens. And this is that step."" Responding to the findings of the latest survey, the British Retail Consortium said retailers were working hard to ensure stores were as accessible as possible. ""For example, many have wide aisles, offer ramps as alternatives to stairs and have members of staff on hand to provide any additional assistance if required. ""Unfortunately retailers can be restricted on what reasonable adjustments can be made due to the age or design of a building but will have other policies in place to help access to that service."" Away from the High Street, British design duo Teatum Jones have taken a giant step forward at this year's London Fashion Week. The casting of Kelly Knox, who was born without the lower half of her left arm, and amputee Jack Eyers is a first for London Fashion Week. Kelly Knox on the catwalk, modelling Teatum Jones during London Fashion Week But this is not a stunt, nor is it a campaign. Catherine Teatum and Rob Jones are thinking about disabled people when they design - something they don't feel is particularly revolutionary. ""They [disabled people] have a spending power that no one seems to be interested in tapping into. So that's a big enough reason to be honest, to begin with,"" they say. ""We haven't adapted anything for this collection, we approached the styling and the casting of this collection as we would any other collection. The main key message for us, is I feel like we are all the same. ""Why should someone with perhaps a seated disabilityâ¦ have any less desire for luxury fashion?""

Forced to retire at 48 with arthritis1:01The power of the 'purple pound',"Christine Lewis took medical retirement at 48 but felt she had more to give Some 600,000 people with arthritis are missing out on the opportunity to work, according to the charity Arthritis Research UK. BBC presenter Julian Worricker, who has psoriatic arthritis, spoke to people trying to juggle staying in work with a painful and debilitating condition. Britain is a nation of ""put up and shut up"" when it comes to workplace health. That's according to leading charity Arthritis Research UK. This isn't just based on anecdotal evidence - before Christmas the charity questioned more than 2,000 people about their attitudes and experience regarding health and the workplace. One theme arose time and time again - people's willingness to suffer in silence. The survey's key findings were: 20% worried they wouldn't be fit enough to work the following year 39% didn't feel confident discussing their health with their employer 33% thought that colleagues wouldn't understand the impact of their arthritis Nearly a fifth, 17%, have lied about why they took sick leave I have arthritis. Not rheumatoid, but another inflammatory form of the disease - psoriatic arthritis. It's linked to the common skin complaint, psoriasis. I'm lucky in that I've rarely had serious flare-ups. I'm now taking a drug that dramatically improves my symptoms, and at work I can think of only a handful of occasions when I've been hampered, discomforted or forced to make adjustments for any nagging pain I may have been experiencing. But for thousands of other people in the UK it's a very different story. Osteoarthritis - which makes movement more difficult - is the most common form of arthritis Arthritis is a condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. It affects around 10 million people in the UK The most common types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, although there are around 200 different musculoskeletal conditions Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, most commonly developing in adults in their 40s or older. It initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint, making movement more difficult than usual leading to pain and stiffness Rheumatoid arthritis can affect people of any age (although often starts when a person is between 40 and 50) and occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, leading to pain and swelling Source: Arthritis Research UK Sarah Dillingham is a case in point. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in her 20s when she was working in a high-pressure corporate environment. Some people at work didn't understand the severity of Sarah's health issues, she says During bad flare-ups she had to cope with extreme fatigue and intense pain. Everyday tasks, even holding a pen, were difficult. Commuting, or as Sarah put it ""being bashed about on the tube"", really took it out of her. Over 10 years she struggled to control her symptoms. ""My world became all about my job because in order to go in and deliver I could only do that if I got up early to deal with the pain. I didn't have any social life. Your world does shrink in quite an unhealthy way,"" she says. She experienced the best and the worst from the people she worked alongside. She tells me: ""A fantastic colleague used to help by writing on the white board for me during presentations when I couldn't lift my arms up."" But one boss made it very clear that Sarah's health issues were not something to be considered important, forcing her to try and act as if there was no problem at all. ""Being bashed about on the tube"" on her daily commute was one of the things that made working difficult, says Sarah Dillingham Christine Lewis's story taps into some of the same narrative. She was a nurse when she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, but daily work tasks became too much for her and she switched her career to banking. Initially her new employers were very receptive to her needs, but as time went on they became less supportive. ""They employed someone to come and assess me. She assessed my working environment and made various recommendations."" They suggested minor changes to her desk and workstation, Christine told me. ""They said that things don't happen very quickly in business. A year later, still nothing,"" she says. Sarah's and Christine's stories diverge at this point. Sarah is now her own boss, works mainly from home, and can manage her travel so that it rarely coincides with the London rush hour. Christine Lewis, pictured here with Julian, says employers are missing out on a ""wealth of experience."" She now volunteers for the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society As an employer, partly as a result of what she went through as an employee, she's a believer in what she calls ""sensible flexibility"". She says: ""I absolutely understand the importance of hiring people who will give 100%. ""At the same time pretty much everyone has something in their life, whether that's a long-term medical condition, or young children or having to care for someone. ""It can be as simple as being able to hold meetings over Skype, or an ergonomic mouse which is very cheap."" Christine, by contrast, took medical retirement at the age of 48. She feels she still had a number of good working years ahead of her but, without the necessary adjustments being made in the office to help her manage, she felt she had no choice but to give up her job. ""Employers are missing out on the wealth of experience that people have,"" she says. ""Being that bit older, I've got a house. I've had children, I've been a housewife and all that actually is quite a lot of experience that employers should tap into."" The Department for Work and Pensions told us that funding is available through the government's Access to Work scheme to pay for equipment or support that a disabled person might need in the workplace. Stories like those of Sarah and Christine might well influence the government's thinking in the coming months.

The Labour MP, Frank Field, chairs the parliamentary work and pensions committee. A lot of evidence about work and disability has come before him in recent months. ""Nobody doubts the will of the government wishing to do this. What's worrying is whether they've really thought about how hard this objective is to achieve,"" he says. One suggestion is to encourage employers using incentives. ""One should have, in this coming Budget, a reduction in national insurance contributions to those employers who say I'm taking [disabled] people onto my payroll,"" he says. During our conversation Mr Field highlighted one statistic that put into perspective what the government wants to do: according to the Learning and Work Institute, halving that disability gap will take - at current rates - 200 years. According to the Equality Act 2010 (which doesn't apply in Northern Ireland) you are disabled if your arthritis has, or is expected to have, a serious negative affect on your daily activities for at least 12 months Your rights are also covered under the Equality Act. You must be treated fairly and without discrimination if your employer knows, or could be expected to know, you're disabled An employer must make reasonable adjustments to enable you to work if you are disabled. This could include providing equipment or support or altering working arrangements An employer must not ask questions about health or disability unless they need to know you can carry out a vital function of the job with reasonable adjustments in place. But you have a duty to tell an employer about a health condition if it might present a health and safety risk to yourself or other colleagues Source: Arthritis Care Julian Worricker presents a mini-series about arthritis on You & Yours, from Wednesday 22 February to Friday 24 February at 12.15GMT on BBC Radio 4.

Tweeting bin,"Nighttime in the city but the sensors never sleep The connected city never sleeps. The thousands of sensors embedded in roads, sewers, water pipes, streetlights are busy collecting information day and night. Perhaps even your bin, which might also be tweeting. Sensor provider Enevo offers internet connection for bins in cities in Finland, the Netherlands, UK, Belgium, Canada and the US, and runs a Twitter feed - Trashcan Life. The tweets aren't exactly sparkling wit, including insights such as: ""I am 26% full"" ""My current internal temperature is 24C"" ""I expect to be full on Wednesday"" It is part of a push to make bin collection smarter, cheaper and less frequent and may ultimately mean an end to the early wake-up call of the bins being emptied. We may not be cyborgs yet, but many of us are already plugged into the network via wearables If our cities are getting increasingly plugged into the network, then so are we. Wearables that measure all kinds of things from body temperature, hydration levels, heart-rate and sleep patterns are commonplace. And the data we collect can reveal interesting insights about how our lives, day and night, impacts our health. Fitness band provider Jawbone compared the sleep data of one million users around the US and found that city residents tended to get far less than those in rural or suburban areas. It also found that people living in the Brooklyn area of New York went to bed the latest while those in Maiu, Hawaii, had the earliest bedtime. Will our future cities be run by machines? ''Our sleep cycles adapt to the pace and lifestyle of the world we live in and the world by which we are surrounded - which can be much more hectic, fast-paced and full of nightlife entertainment in major cities,"" the report said. Meanwhile, a recent study from Microsoft mined data from 75 million keystrokes and clicks on Bing from more than 30,000 individuals wearing a fitness device. The future of a good night out Are our cities killing us with bad air? Will we travel to work in jetpacks? Read all our Tomorrow's Cities coverage The research found that those who were busiest during the day, based on their Microsoft calendars and search activity, slept worse at night and those who slept less than six hours for two consecutive nights were sluggish for the next six days. The trend towards both cities and citizens being plugged into the network has only one logical conclusion, says Prof Andrew Hudson-Smith, from University College London's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. ""Bees exist on Earth to pollinate flowers, and maybe humans are here to build the machines,"" he says. ""Urban robots are just starting to appear, and in 200 years time, machines may run the urban form. ""The city will be one big joined-up urban machine, and humans' role on Earth will be done."" Light levels can be controlled via smart streetlamps If that thought doesn't keep you awake at night, then a more mundane problem just might. Cities never really get dark any more and that is becoming a serious issue, particularly for those who want to spend time looking at the night sky. In September, the city authorities in Reykjavik, Iceland, ordered all street lights to be turned off in multiple sections of the city to facilitate better views of the northern lights. Other cities are making the move to smart LED lights in an attempt to control the brightness of streetlights. As well as offering significant savings because they last longer (up to 20 years) and emit far less energy, such lights can also be plugged into the network, meaning cities can decide when they want to throw out light and when they want to dim it. Street lighting is estimated to account for 40% of a city's electricity bill, and cities that have made the move report huge savings - Detroit says it has shaved $2.5m (Â£2m) off of its annual bill. In Glasgow, the council has taken the idea one step further - fitting smart street lights with noise sensors and connecting them to CCTV cameras so that, if noise goes above a certain level, an alert is sent to its operations centre for evaluation in case it is caused by anti-social or criminal behaviour. The council told the BBC that it does not yet have any significant data on how the lights are performing. It is just one illustration of how connected cities can veer from their original purpose into entirely new territories, which may not always be ones their inhabitants will feel entirely comfortable about. Technology may help impose some order and efficiency on the urban landscape, but many who live there will hope cities long continue to be fast-paced and hectic. It is why many of us love them. Smart city case study: Barcelona Barcelona has an impressive 500km (311-mile) fibre-optic network, which acts as a backbone for a host of connected services as well as providing citizens with city-wide wi-fi. The city's lighting works hard: 1,100 lamp-posts have been converted to LED, offering cost savings of 30% Sensors in the lights can determine when people are passing beneath and light up or dim according to footfall They form part of the wi-fi network They are equipped with air-quality sensors There are 19,500 smart meters in targeted areas of the city, which monitor and optimise energy consumption. Smart bins monitor waste levels and optimise collection routes. In transport, Barcelona has plenty of electric cars and bike-sharing schemes, while digital bus-stops don't just give waiting passengers updates on when buses will arrive but also provide charging stations, free wi-fi and information about the best apps to download to learn more about the city. Drivers can take advantage of an app - ApparkB - that can identify empty parking spaces and allow users to pay for the spot online. Even the irrigation systems in Barcelona's parks are hooked into the network. Sensors monitor rain and humidity, allowing park workers to decide how much water is needed in each area, which has led to a 25% cut in the city's water bill. Barcelona has made its city operating system - Sentilo - which controls all the sensors open-source and available to other cities. Through the system, data is also shared with citizens.

Women missing out on workplace pensions,"Tens of thousands of women are missing out on workplace pensions as a result of having more than one job, according to Citizens Advice. To qualify for an auto-enrolment pension, workers have to earn at least Â£10,000 a year. But more than 100,000 people - most of them women - do not reach that threshold, because they work for several employers. The government said that it is planning to review the issue later this year. A separate study shows that women still receive far smaller pensions than men. According to the insurance company Zurich, the average woman will have Â£47,000 less in her pension pot than a man by the time she retires. Citizens Advice said that 72,000 women were missing out on auto-enrolment pensions, which require employers to pay a pension automatically, unless a worker deliberately opts out. The charity said too many people were being shut out of the opportunity to be paid a pension. ""Many people - particularly women - work several part time jobs, which helps them manage commitments like childcare or study,"" said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""But while in many cases they earn over Â£10,000, and pay tax on this combined income, they don't have access to a workplace pension and miss out on the opportunity to save for their retirement."" How to be a mum and get a decent pension How to get a pension of Â£20,000 by the time you retire The government saidin December,externalthat it would examine the issue of workers with multiple jobs when it reviews the auto-enrolment programme later this year. ""There's more to do - especially for people with more than one job - and we're currently reviewing the policy to see how it can be improved,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said. The Zurich analysis found that between 2013 and 2016 men received 7.8% of their salary in pension contributions on average, compared to women receiving 7%. It said men tend to work in sectors with more established or generous pension schemes. In addition, women are more likely to take career breaks. ""This difference in the contributions that they receive from their employer presents a serious - and growing - problem,"" said Rose St Louis, Zurich's head of partnership development. ""The triple effect of smaller salaries, career breaks for women and lower contribution rates needs to be addressed: we can't ignore a Â£47,000 shortfall,"" she said.

Should supermarkets sell more British food?,"The ingredients from a simple ready meal may have come from all corners of the earth When you pop your chicken tikka masala ready meal into the microwave at the end of a long day at work, you're likely to be thinking how hungry you are rather than marvelling at the global trade deals that brought it about in the first place. Yet the chicken, spices and rice in that box are in reality the result of a series of complex trading relationships. The chicken may have come from Thailand, the pilau rice from India and the spices from elsewhere in Asia. Even the packaging is likely to have been sourced internationally, while the meal itself may well have been produced outside the UK. The recent scandal at Waitrose, which was forced torebrand the lamb ready mealsin its ""British"" range because some are made with lamb from New Zealand, has highlighted the issue. Waitrose has said all its ""British"" lamb meals will be rebranded as ""Classic"" ""When we go into a supermarket, restaurant or coffee shop, we're at the very centre of a huge web of food and drink trading relationships, with layers and layers of exchanges going on out of sight,"" says James Walton, chief economist at food and grocery research charity IGD. All those deals add up to a significant industry. We import more than we export of all types of food. The UK imported a whoppingÂ£38.5bn worth of food, feed and drink in 2015,external, the most recent official statistics available. The number dwarfs the Â£18bn worth of food we exported that year. In fact, just half of the food we eat in the UK originates here, with most of the rest imported from Europe. A recent vegetable shortage, driven by bad weather in southern Europe, highlighted this dependence, and led to a flurry of pictures on social media of empty supermarket shelves. On top of this, the pound's 14% fall against the euro since the Brexit vote means imports cost more, and there is huge uncertainty over what effect leaving the EU will have on the cost and availability of food from Europe. All of this begs the obvious question: shouldn't supermarkets simply rely more on British suppliers instead? Supermarkets are coy on just how much they source from the UK, with Morrisons the only one of the ""Big Four"" to answer my email on this question. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's did not reply. Morrisons, which says it already sources around two-thirds of its supplies from the UK, has pledged to recruit 200 more British suppliers aftera report it commissionedfound global uncertainties meant it ""makes increasing sense to build up a stronger local food sector"". The report's author, Prof Tim Benton, said the aim of doing this ""is not to disengage from reliance on global trade, but to hedge our bets by increasing local production for local consumption"". Local is all the rage right now, with the popularity of farmers' markets, homemade artisan breads and craft beers continuing apace. People expect food and drink that hasn't travelled thousands of miles to taste better. The assumption is also that production standards will be higher. People are also keen to support their local economy. In fact, three-quarters of people said they try to buy British food and drink if it is available, mainly with the motivation to support British manufacturers and jobs, according to IGD's December survey of 1,700 shoppers. Although notably, a lot less - just under a third - said they were willing to pay more for the privilege. Tesco was criticised last year for tapping into this trend,using fictional British-sounding farm nameson labelling for a range of meat and fresh produce, some of which was sourced from abroad. Rosedene Farms may sound British - but the strawberries are from Morocco But while the notion of buying British may be appealing, the reality is that on a bigger scale it's very difficult to achieve. Even if we ate all the food we exported, we would still generate less than two-thirds of what we need, according to Prof Benton. And while Morrisons has pledged to source more from the UK, the chain is in an unusual position in that it already owns an abattoir and meat-processing operations, as well as bakeries and produce-packing sites, making it easier for it to be more self-reliant. For many of its rivals, replicating this kind of domestic supply chain would be much tougher. Paul Martin, head of retail at consultancy KPMG, says often the economics just don't stack up. ""On paper, it's very appealing, but the challenge is that due to the high cost of manufacturing in the UK, you need to have a very high utilisation rate. If you are a supermarket then you're likely only to supply to yourself,"" he says. The hurdles aren't just financial. The UK doesn't actually have enough room to grow all the crops and keep all the animals that we currently eat. The climate means there are also certain items, such as bananas, that we simply cannot grow at scale in the UK. Given the massive housing shortage in the UK, Mr Martin says it's unlikely to be desirable politically to use more land for farming. The UK could never produce enough wine to satisfy demand, says KPMG's Paul Martin And while supermarkets may talk of looking at alternative supply sources - something he notes is a good way of putting overseas suppliers under pressure to keep costs low - the reality is that the impact on consumers may also be unpalatable. ""If you suddenly say we'll shift 30% or 40% of imported food categories, even if it was possible, it would have a significant shift on the way people consume goods,"" says Mr Martin. Lots of products, such as tomatoes and strawberries, which we take for granted as being available all year round, no longer would be. And, he says with a smile, the UK could never produce enough wine to satisfy demand. The other problem is producing more home grown products in significantly more volume in an economy almost entirely reliant on the services economy would require a dramatic revolution that would take years. ""The evolution of our supply chain moving abroad took some years and moving it back would take a similar length of time. The reality is this is something that cannot be changed quickly, whether you're talking about courgettes or cotton trousers,"" says veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman. While the rising costs of imports are expected to push the cost of our supermarket shop higher, Mr Hyman thinks the intensity of competition from discounters Lidl and Adli, and the ever-present threat of Amazon, means supermarkets will be willing to absorb much of these to protect their market share. He believes for supermarkets this fierce war for customers is a far bigger priority than sourcing more food from the UK. ""This is the real challenge. A lot of questions go far, far deeper than a hut in a field in Lincolnshire. Would that it was that simple,"" he says.

British Cycling âmisled UK Sport',"This video can not be played 'No indication of King report significance' British Cycling has been accused of watering down the findings of an internal review in 2012 by the chief executive of UK Sport. Liz Nicholl said the governing body ""fed a very light-touch version"" to the funding agency. Former British Cycling chief executive Peter King took anonymous statements from 40 personnel as part of a report that was never made public. ""We didn't receive the King report,"" Nicholl told BBC Sport. ""We were given to believe that... actually we had a very light-touch version of it fed to us at UK Sport, so we had no indication of the significance of that report. ""It's only now come to light."" Speaking to national newspapers,Nicholl confirmed she considered it to effectively be a cover-up,,externaladding: ""That's a complete lack of transparency and that's a relationship that is not acceptable in terms of what was shared with us as opposed to what the actual facts of that report were."" UK Sport have faced questions over why they did not act on a report that is known to include allegations of bullying. Nicholls' incendiary comments come as the country's most successful and best-funded sports governing body braces itself for thepublication of another reportinto alleged bullying, favouritism and sexism, led by British Rowing chair Annamarie Phelps. Publication is expected in the next month. Former British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake commissioned the King report in September 2012 but left the organisation in January, three months earlier than planned. He could not be reached for comment. UCI president Brian Cookson, who was president of British Cycling when King delivered the report in December 2012, said he would not comment until the Phelps report was published. UK Sport are currently considering whether to help fund Cookson's re-election campaign, having contributed Â£77,000 in 2013. King told BBC Sport he was ""disappointed"" to hear Nicholl say she never saw his full report. In a statement, British Cycling said: ""Contributions were made with a guarantee of anonymity, so key findings and recommendations were shared in briefings with UK Sport and the British Cycling board. ""The full report was also made available to the 2016 independent review, jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling in April last year, of the world class programme."" The current Phelps inquiry was jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling following allegations of sexism and bullying made by rider Jess Varnish against former technical director Shane Sutton. Varnish claimed the coach had used sexist and discriminatory language when dropping her from the Olympic programme, something he strongly denies. In October, Sutton resigned and was found guilty of one charge of using inappropriate language by an internal review. A number of other riders and former staff members have backed Varnish's portrayal of ""a culture of fear"" within British Cycling, including former road world champion Nicole Cooke, who told a parliamentary select committee that it was a sport ""run by men, for men"". Former performance director Sir Dave Brailsford has insisted he ran a regime that was ""not sexist but definitely medallist"". This video can not be played Sutton resigns amid discrimination row ""All those views are being taken into account through the review,"" said Nicholl. ""It's fair to say that the high-performance system here is pretty male-dominated. There aren't very many female coaches and there's an opportunity to address that in future, and to get a better balance to support athletes in a way that athletes of today want to be supported. ""Athletes have moved on and maybe the programmes haven't moved on as fast as they should have done, but what we see is an opportunity."" The legally sensitive nature of Phelps' report has meant it has been delayed, with fears it could be heavily redacted to protect witness confidentiality. Those who gave evidence are now being asked how much of their testimony can be revealed, while those criticised have an opportunity to respond. Publication could take another month, but on 1 March British Cycling will brief staff and riders on an ""action plan"" - effectively its response to the report and concerns over the way it operates. This will include greater oversight of its high-performance programme, and more consideration of athlete welfare. ""There's no excuse for not addressing duty of care responsibilities to athletes,"" said Nicholls. ""There's no excuse for not putting athletes first. ""They are are the ones who'll deliver the medals and every programme should be trying to ensure they have happy and successful athletes and there probably hasn't been enough attention in sport about how they do things. ""There's a lot of focus on operational delivery, probably not enough on leadership management and communication."" Nicholl told the BBC that she would be ""clear about the actions that UK Sport and British Cycling need to take"". Should welfare come before winning?
