Boxing Day sales see slump in footfallOnline deals and the weather may have contributed to a fall in the number of people heading to the sales.Business,"Black Friday discounts and bad weather have been blamed for a decline in Boxing Day shoppers, with retail analysts reporting a fall in the number of people heading for the sales. Springboard, which analyses customer activity in stores, said footfall had seen the largest decline since 2011, dropping by 8.6%. It said Boxing Day was becoming less important as a trading day. But there were still queues for some shops from as early as 04:30 GMT. However, the retail data analyst, which examines information from UK High Street and shopping centre cameras, said more people were waiting until later in the day to head to the shops in search of a bargain. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""It is clear that consumers visited high streets more in the early evening than during the day."" By lunchtime on Boxing Day, footfall was 10.6% lower than last year, its biggest annual decline since 2010, when Springboard first published its data. Commenting on the disappointing morning for retailers, Ms Wehrle said many consumers were still celebrating Christmas with their family on Boxing Day, while the rainy weather, online shopping and increased Black Friday spending were also possible factors for the drop in footfall. ""Boxing Day is indisputably a less important trading day than it once was,"" Ms Wehrle said. Customers queue outside Selfridges in London ahead of the Boxing Day sale. Some bargain-hunters did brave the rain, with some shoppers on London's Oxford Street waiting for stores to open at 9am. Others queued outside Selfridges in Greater Manchester's Trafford Centre at 4.30am. As the doors to Next opened in Liverpool at 06:00 GMT, more than 150 people were waiting outside the store.

"'I closed my eyes, prayed, and prepared to die'","Survivors walk through the debris on Phuket's Patong beach the day after the tsunami Shortly before 08:00 on 26 December 2004, a magnitude-9.1 earthquake struck under the sea in northern Indonesia. In the hours that followed, a massive tsunami fanned out across the Indian Ocean, killing close to 230,000 people, most in Indonesia. Ahead of the 15th anniversary of the tragedy, BBC Thai's Chaiyot Yongcharoenchai visited southern Thailand, which was devastated by the tsunami. This is the story of some of those who survived and what they did to help afterwards. You may find some of the details distressing. Wittaya Tantawanich -emergency worker, Patong beach That morning on Patong beach was very quiet. I was stationed close to Patong Hospital on a rescue truck. Then I got hungry, so I drove toward the beach in order to find something to eat. Dr Weerawit Sarideepan -then-doctor at Vachira Phuket Hospital It was the day after the hospital staff party - it was my day off and I had a long lie-in. At 08:00, I heard my wooden bedroom windows were shaking. I told my wife that it must be from the car outside. Then I rolled back to sleep. Samran Chanyang -master of ceremonies and mortician at Yan Yao temple I led the prayer ceremony on the morning of 26 December 2004, which was a Buddhist holy day. I said the prayer into the microphone, so everyone could hear it. All of a sudden, we lost the power and we felt the earthquake. I continued without the speaker afterwards. Wittaya Tantawanich I sat there to enjoy my breakfast with the beach view. As I sat there, I felt the earthquake at around 08:00. No one panicked or worried. I continued to sit there waiting to get an emergency call. Captain Sathaporn Sawangpuk's ship rode the tsunami wave Sathaporn Sawangpuk -captain of the Mahidol ship We were on our way back from a month-long marine research trip in the Indian Ocean. We made a stop at Koh Racha Yai island in Phuket for a diving lesson for our interns. The sea was quite calm, the sky was so clear and blue. I told my team: 'What a perfect day to be in the sea.' Primpraow Jitpentom -nurse on a diving trip near the Mahidol ship I took my friends from Bangkok out for a diving trip on that Sunday morning. I did this many times but my husband had never seen the underwater world. I told him it was really worth it. Captain Sathaporn Sawangpuk After breakfast, we all went to the end of the boat on the deck to watch the intern diving with instructors. All of a sudden, I felt the ship lift and swing to the left and to the right. We had no idea what happened, but my instinct told me to start the ship and head out to the middle of the sea. Primpraow Jitpentom Our speedboat was getting closer to the shore. All of a sudden, the diving instructor told the boat driver to stop since he noticed something was wrong. He pointed to the sea and told me there was no water at the beach. He told me: 'This can't be good.' Emergency worker Wittaya Tantawanich: ""I closed my eyes, prayed, and prepared to die"" Wittaya Tantawanich -on Patong beach At 10:00, I started to hear local food sellers, they were pointing to the beach. They all said 'Let's go catch fish.' The water had gone down very far, to the middle of the sea, and there were many fish lying around all over the place. I chuckled at what I saw but it wasn't long before I realised something was wrong. As the water came back, one food seller ran back and told everyone in that area to run away from the beachfront as far as possible. Captain Sathaporn Sawangpuk As I looked toward the shore of the island, I saw one big wave hit the beach and sweep umbrellas and chairs down into the sea. Wittaya Tantawanich It didn't look like the killer wave you see in the movies. What I saw at first was just a flash flood that brought a massive amount of water. As the flood got closer, it started to pick up speed. Finally it hit street level and the water continued to rise. I hopped back in my truck and drove up the hill. At that moment, everything was crazy. So many people were running away from the water. Somchai and Primpraow Jitpentom, who treated the injured while on holiday Somchai Jitpentom -doctor on diving holiday with his wife I contacted my friend who was in the navy and he told me it was a tsunami. He told us to find a big ship and get up there. I saw the Mahidol ship was on its way out from the bay, so we stopped them and asked for help. Captain Sathaporn Sawangpuk Then the water went down, so far out, before the second wave hit the beach again. This time it dragged bungalows and restaurants down to the sea with it. Somchai Jitpentom As we got on the ship, I saw houses and restaurants on Koh Racha Yai pulled down into the sea. That's when I realised something serious had happened. So we all agreed that we should go help other people on the nearby island since we had two doctors and two nurses on board. Primpraow Jitpentom -nurse, and Somchai's wife I held my sons tight in my arms and told them 'Mummy and Daddy love you very much. If anything happens, just stay afloat in this life vest. Don't try to swim, someone will come to find you and help you.' Wittaya Tantawanich -on Patong beach I heard on my walkie-talkie that the second wave had hit. It didn't take long before the whole city was in mayhem. I went back down after the second wave retreated. At that point, I still had no idea what had happened. All I knew was I had to help people. Samran Chanyang was called to duty while knowing his son was missing Samran Chanyang -master of ceremonies and mortician at Yan Yao temple The ceremony ended just like any other day. Then I went back home, right behind the temple. Suddenly I heard a lot of cars go by on the main street. All of them were speeding through and honking and they passed by the area. Then villagers here started talking about how villages along the beach here were all gone because of the wave. Dr Weerawit Sarideepan -then-doctor at Vachira Phuket Hospital When I woke up again around 10:00, I took my family out for breakfast before I received a phone call from the hospital calling me in for an emergency. We had a plan to handle a disaster of a massive scale. But we didn't have a plan for something this big. Wittaya Tantawanich -on Patong beach I got a request to go to a supermarket on the beach road where many people were trapped inside. When I arrived, I saw staff floating face down in the water that flooded the basement of the building. Some of them were still alive but many of them were dead. Samran Chanyang -at Yan Yao temple I turned on the TV and saw what happened in my area. I didn't know about the tsunami until then. I was shocked and worried since my son had gone to work in Khao Lak [on the mainland coast north of Phuket]. He was a painter and it was meant to be the last working day for him before a long break. I contacted him, but I was unable to reach him. Primpraow Jitpentom -on diving trip We decided to head toward Phi Phi island as it wasn't too far and they had been badly hit. When we arrived, it wasn't something I expected. All I saw were dead bodies floating in the water. Wittaya Tantawanich As we tried to help more people in the supermarket, I heard from outside that another wave was coming. I was looking for the nearest way out but I knew I wouldn't be able to make it. So I closed my eyes, prayed, and prepared to die. Luckily, it came up to street level and stopped. Dr Weerawit Sarideepan: ""There were thousands of dead bodies waiting to be identified"" Dr Weerawit Sarideepan Hundreds of people were sent in. Most of them had broken bones or cuts on their bodies. Then dead bodies started to come in. Samran Chanyang -at Yan Yao temple My son's three friends told me he was missing. I was about to go out looking for him but then the hospital contacted me. They said they needed a place to put dead bodies from the wave so I had to be on standby at the temple waiting for the hospital to deliver the bodies. By 19:00, hundreds of dead bodies start to arrive. We had no place for them so they were wrapped in plastic and white sheets before laying on the ground all over the temple. Dr Weerawit Sarideepan The hospital director asked me to go to help implant microchips into the dead bodies as requested by the forensic police. When I first arrived, the local police took me to Wat Yan Yao, where there were thousands of dead bodies waiting to be identified. As I stepped into the temple, I could smell dead bodies the way I never had before in my life. I noticed the temple ground covered in blood and lymph. Primpraow Jitpentom -on diving trip We decided to help only the injured survivors and we finally rescued at least 414 tourists and locals, and transferred them to a more equipped hospital on Phuket. We were happy to help many people that day. Samran Chanyang The following day, more bodies start to come in. The military started to bring in containers to keep the bodies in. By the middle of the second day, I saw a mountain of dead bodies piling up and it was very sad to see. Hundreds of coffins lie inside Yan Yao temple in December 2004 Samran Chanyang I went out with my other sons and friends to look for my eldest son. It took me half a day to find him. He was trapped and died inside the building where he was. Wittaya Tantawanich -on Patong beach I'd been a rescue worker all my life but I'd never experienced anything that huge before.

EU 'love letter' says UK always welcome back,"""I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I'm like an old lover"" A leading EU official has penned a love letter to Britain, expressing his ""deep hurt"" over Brexit and concluding: ""You will always be welcome to come back."" European Commission Vice-PresidentFrans Timmermans wrote the letter in the Guardian,external. ""Since I went to a British school, you have always been part of me. Now you are leaving, and it breaks my heart,"" the top of the Guardian piece reads. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 31 January 2020. MPs passed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on 20 December, just eight days after his Conservative Party won a majority in the general election. This will trigger a transition period of negotiations, which Mr Johnson's EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill ensures will not go beyond 2020. The executive vice-president of the European Commission starts by saying he ""recently read a delightful book of love letters to Europe. And it made me contemplate my love for Britain"". The Dutch national recalls his time at St George's British International School in Rome and says that, during his life, ""Britain was always there. As part of me."" He adds: ""I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I'm like an old lover."" He says Britain thinks it is ""unique and different"" but that this is ""perhaps less than you think"". All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Brexit: What happens now? Mr Timmermans accepts there are differences between all member countries which can both be a positive and negative force, and that things can ""quickly get out of hand"". He says the UK is still in two minds about the EU, and ""I see it is hurting you"". He writes: ""Truth be told, I felt deeply hurt when you decided to leave. Three years later I am just sad that a member of our family wants to sever our ties. ""But at the same time I find comfort in the thought that family ties can never really be severed. We're not going away and you will always be welcome to come back."" A number of social media posts were positive about the letter. Former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, a new House of Lords peer, tweeted the letter was ""Something to remember. And thank you."" Labour peer and ex-Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis tweeted simply about the UK's return: ""Just a matter of time"". Brexiteers were less impressed. Former UKIP general secretary Paul Oakley wrote: ""Yuck. Just like a clingy ex, Frans Timmermans has written a soppy letter to Britain longing for our return to the EU."" Assuming the European Parliament also gives the green light, the UK will formally leave the EU on 31 January with a withdrawal deal - and it will then go into a transition period that is scheduled to end on 31 December 2020. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics on transition During this period, the UK will effectively remain in the EU's customs union and single market - but will be outside the political institutions and there will be no British members of the European Parliament. The first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU, and time is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate, and that means formal talks might only begin in March. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button What happens after Brexit?

Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge 'worth examining',"Ireland's premier Leo Varadkar has said he will not dismiss the idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, but insisted the UK must pay for it. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Democratic Unionist Party have spoken in favour of the idea. Last week Mr Johnson described it as a ""very interesting idea"" and added: ""Watch this space."" Mr Varadkar revealed he told the UK premier it was ""worth examining"". Is a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge likely? But the Taoiseach said he had also told Mr Johnson he would expect the UK to pay for it. Mr Varadkar added: ""At which point he suggested, 'no, no, the EU is going to pay for it'. ""So that's definitely not going to happen, because neither Northern Ireland or Scotland are going to be in the EU. But it was kind of half serious, half joking in a way. ""But all messing aside, I do think at the very least a high-level engineering assessment should be done as to whether it is a viable proposal."" Leo Varadkar said he has told Boris Johnson the bridge is an idea worth examining Two possible routes for a bridge have been floated in the past - from Portpatrick to Larne, or from near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. Architect Prof Alan Dunlop previously said the ""Celtic bridge"" wouldcost about Â£15bn, a fraction of the estimate of Â£120bn for an English Channel bridge. Other parties have been less enthusiastic about the idea, with Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken saying investment in Northern Ireland's existing infrastructure was a greater priority. Mr Varadkar said: ""I know people dismiss these things out of hand, but they used to dismiss the Channel Tunnel as well - the idea of building a tunnel between France and Britain - and I know what I see when I see a bridge tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, when you fly over New Orleans and you see 110 miles of bridge, it's extraordinary. ""I think we need to at least check out if this is viable in engineering terms and how much money it would cost to do."" However, Mr Varadkar also said his focus was on improving existing infrastructure, such as a high-speed rail link connecting Dublin, Belfast and Cork.

"EU 'love letter' says UK always welcome backEU official Frans Timmermans writes he is ""deeply hurt"" over Brexit but ""we're not going away"".Europe","""I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I'm like an old lover"" A leading EU official has penned a love letter to Britain, expressing his ""deep hurt"" over Brexit and concluding: ""You will always be welcome to come back."" European Commission Vice-PresidentFrans Timmermans wrote the letter in the Guardian,external. ""Since I went to a British school, you have always been part of me. Now you are leaving, and it breaks my heart,"" the top of the Guardian piece reads. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 31 January 2020. MPs passed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on 20 December, just eight days after his Conservative Party won a majority in the general election. This will trigger a transition period of negotiations, which Mr Johnson's EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill ensures will not go beyond 2020. The executive vice-president of the European Commission starts by saying he ""recently read a delightful book of love letters to Europe. And it made me contemplate my love for Britain"". The Dutch national recalls his time at St George's British International School in Rome and says that, during his life, ""Britain was always there. As part of me."" He adds: ""I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I'm like an old lover."" He says Britain thinks it is ""unique and different"" but that this is ""perhaps less than you think"". All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Brexit: What happens now? Mr Timmermans accepts there are differences between all member countries which can both be a positive and negative force, and that things can ""quickly get out of hand"". He says the UK is still in two minds about the EU, and ""I see it is hurting you"". He writes: ""Truth be told, I felt deeply hurt when you decided to leave. Three years later I am just sad that a member of our family wants to sever our ties. ""But at the same time I find comfort in the thought that family ties can never really be severed. We're not going away and you will always be welcome to come back."" A number of social media posts were positive about the letter. Former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, a new House of Lords peer, tweeted the letter was ""Something to remember. And thank you."" Labour peer and ex-Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis tweeted simply about the UK's return: ""Just a matter of time"". Brexiteers were less impressed. Former UKIP general secretary Paul Oakley wrote: ""Yuck. Just like a clingy ex, Frans Timmermans has written a soppy letter to Britain longing for our return to the EU."" Assuming the European Parliament also gives the green light, the UK will formally leave the EU on 31 January with a withdrawal deal - and it will then go into a transition period that is scheduled to end on 31 December 2020. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics on transition During this period, the UK will effectively remain in the EU's customs union and single market - but will be outside the political institutions and there will be no British members of the European Parliament. The first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU, and time is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate, and that means formal talks might only begin in March. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button What happens after Brexit?

British troops move black rhinos to Malawi,"British troops have helped to move a group of critically endangered black rhinos from South Africa to Malawi to protect them against poaching. Soldiers from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles moved 17 of the animals, which are hunted for their horns, in the hope they can be better protected. They were transported by air and road from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa to Liwonde National Park in Malawi. The troops then spent three months training rangers to keep them safe. Black rhino dies on way to release in wild How do you transport a rhino 500 miles? 'Web of corruption' behind SA rhino poaching Major Jez England, the officer commanding the British Army counter-poaching team in Liwonde, said the operation had been ""hugely successful"". ""Not only do we share skills with the rangers, improving their efficiency and ability to patrol larger areas, but it also provides a unique opportunity for our soldiers to train in a challenging environment"", he said. There are thought to be 5,500 black rhinos left in the wild The UK government says it has committed more than Â£36m to tackle the illegal wildlife trade between 2014 and 2021. Part of this is to help support trans-boundary work to allow animals to move more safely between areas and across national borders.

LiveLiveEngland v South Africa First Test - day one3 minutes ago,"South Africa rally from 111-5 De Kock 95, Hamza 39 Pretorius 33, Du Plessis 29 Curran four wickets, Broad three Anderson strikes with first ball of Test Stokes unwell - spends time off field Recalled Bairstow replaces ill Pope First Test, Centurion; Eng won toss Stephan Shemilt and Amy Lofthouse We'll be back bright and early tomorrow to see if England can wrap thing up quickly, then get stuck into the reply. I've got half a feeling this one won't go five days. Enjoy the rest of your Boxing Day. Decent day's cricket, that. You'd think England will probably have wanted to bowl out South Africa, but 277-9 is just about vindicating the decision to field first. More from Sam Curran on Sky Sports:""De Kock plays his natural game. He let him get off the hook a little bit. Fair play to him - and he got a good score. ""It's a pretty good wicket and fast-scoring outfield. Hopefully our batters can bat big and put overs in their legs. There is going to be cracks. Hopefully we can bat big first innings and put them under pressure."" #bbccricket Duke and Kookaburra:SA 277-9 at stumps and will feel a great deal happier than earlier on, England will feel they let the hosts wriggle away from 111-5; De Kock's innings may yet prove decisive. England seamer Sam Curran, who has 4-57, on Sky Sports:""It was an even day - we're pretty pleased. Any time you choose to bowl first there's a lot of responsibility on the bowlers. ""I felt good. The ball swung all day. I was pleased - it's my first time playing in South Africa, so it was enjoyable. The bowlers are pretty pleased to come to pitches that carry."" Excellent plug, Spike. Pick your team here. #bbccricket Spike Western:Broad gets a lot of stick but he's been a consistent performer for England for 10 years now and he's still coming up with the goods. Definitely in my team of the decade. Kate CrossEngland women's seamer on The Cricket Social It has been a hard-fought day and there will certainly be a relief in the dressing room having got that wicket late in the day. But you can't really judge it until both teams have batted. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent in Centurion It has been a really fascinating day's cricket. It is perhaps a bit too early too tell if this is a good score. Jonathan TrottEx-England batsman on The Cricket Social It's exactly even right now. Steven FinnEngland bowler on The Cricket Social Tomorrow will give us an indication of where we are up to and what exactly is happening. Both teams will sit in the dressing room having worked hard. The wickets in the last session have pegged South Africa back and brought it to a more even game. Who has had the better of that? I'll tell you tomorrow. Whichever way you look at it, England have not rolled South Africa. They are going to have to bat well at least once in this match. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent in Centurion It has been a very hot day. England are tired and they have flagged a bit. It will be interesting to see how they come back tomorrow - there will be some creaking limbs. Rabada b Broad 12 (SA 277-9) Bowled him! Stuart Broad gets through with what proves to be the final delivery of the day. Round the wicket to Kagiso Rabada, seam bolt upright, nipping back and taking the top of off stump, possibly via an inside edge. England drag themselves off. They are absolutely shattered. Jonathan TrottEx-England batsman on The Cricket Social Every single run is going to be crucial here. Might this be the last over of the day? Stuart Broad was the man who had to fetch the previous ball of the last over from the boundary, so this might take some time. Kate CrossEngland women's seamer on The Cricket Social You can tell that he hasn't much cricket over the last few months. For him, it will be important to just get through the day. He is the only bowler who has looked like he hasn't had a niggle or cramp, so that will be a massive positive for him. Michael CarberryFormer England batsman on The Cricket Social It's great to see Jimmy Anderson back. His first spell was a bit rusty, and when he has got the ball in the right area he has looked threatening. It has been a decent comeback but he still looks rusty. James Anderson to share the second new one. Not a great return for Jimmy, whose only wicket came with a real loosener. As Rabada jams down on one, scooting the ball down to third man for four, Anderson closes his eyes and runs a hand through his hair. When Rabada drives the last ball for four, Anderson is angrier than a swarm of hornets. #bbccricket Steve Johnson:If SA get 300 plus, then the decision to send them in to bat might not have been the way to go.    Cricket is a funny old game, with many twists and turns. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Seven die as migrant boat sinks in Turkey,"It was not clear why the migrants were on the boat in the lake A boat carrying migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan has sunk in Lake Van in eastern Turkey, with at least seven people dead, officials say. The lake is near the border with Iran, from where migrants often cross into Turkey on their journey towards Europe. Sixty-four people were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals and shelters. The incident happened at around 03:00 local time (00:00 GMT). It was not clear why they were on the boat in the lake which is completely within Turkey. The boat sank after capsizing as it approached Adilcevaz district in Bitlis, on the northern shores of the lake, the governor's office said. EU countries warned of 'lost generation' of young refugees How a teenager risked all for a life in limbo Five people were found dead at the scene and two died at hospital. Turkey has been a key transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe, many of them fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. Many rely on people's smugglers and face dangerous land and sea routes which often result in deaths. Turkey's security forces have held some 441,532 undocumented migrants on its territory this year,external, according to state-run Anadolu news agency. In 2016, Turkey reached a financial deal with the European Union to stem the flow of migrants and refugees to Europe. Last month, German media cited a confidential EU report as saying the number of crossings from Turkey rose sharply this year, with most people coming from Afghanistan.
