No 10 seeks to cancel Johnson court debt judgement,"Downing Street is seeking to cancel a county court judgement against Prime Minister Boris Johnson that cites an unpaid bill of Â£535. The order was made against Mr Johnson, of 10 Downing Street, on 26 October, according to a judgement database. The creditor and nature of the debt, which was first reported by Private Eye magazine, is not yet known. A Downing Street spokesperson said the claim against the PM was without merit. ""An application will be made for an order to set aside the default judgement, to strike out the claim and for a declaration that the claim is totally without merit,"" the spokesperson added. Watchdog to investigate PM's flat renovations What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The BBC understands the case relates to a defamation claim against Mr Johnson. County court judgements,externalare issued in England and Wales when people fail to repay money they owe. ""If you get a judgement, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money,"" according to a government website. A bailiff ""may visit your home if you do not pay your debts"",the website warns,external. Banks and loan companies can also use the information to decide whether to issue credit or loans. ""If you're late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs,"" the website adds. Anyone who has had a county court judgement (CCJ) against them can apply for it to be cancelled - or ""set aside"" in the legal language - but they must convince the court that there is a good reason for this to happen and they have also acted promptly in launching their challenge. That could include the judgement having been issued in error - perhaps because the debt had actually been paid, or because there was never a debt in the first place. Sometimes, people seek to have a CCJ cancelled because they genuinely did not know about it - or they can show the court that it has acted incorrectly in making the order. That can happen when the court has been provided with the wrong address for a debtor who only later learns of the judgement when they discover it has damaged their credit score. The official rules for applications to set aside a judgement state: ""Most applications will require a hearing and you will be expected to attend. The court will allocate a hearing date and time for the application. Please indicate in a covering letter any dates that you are unavailable within the next six weeks."" The application must come with some kind of ""statement of truth"", explaining why the judgement should be set aside. The prime minister could instruct a lawyer to appear for him. Applicants can also ask the court to consider waiving the Â£100 fee if it would cause them ""undue hardship"". The prime minister's personal finances have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. In particular, he has faced questions about how renovations to the flat, above 11 Downing Street, that he shares with fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds were paid for. He has insisted he personally paid for the work, but has declined to say whether he received an initial loan. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and whether any donation to the Conservative Party was properly declared. Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said the court judgement had nothing to do with the Downing Street estate refurbishment, saying: ""All bills have been paid by the government or the prime minister, personally."" Asked if Number 10 had only become aware of the judgement when it was first reported earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman said it was something they are ""looking into currently"". And on being asked whether there should be concerns about the prime minister's personal finances, Mr Johnson's press secretary said: ""You should not be concerned, no.""

'Birth family turned our adopted sons against us',"Three-quarters of adopted children experienced neglect or abuse in their birth families, raising concerns about contact Claire and Ed adopted their sons 13 years ago. When the brothers found their biological family on social media aged 15 and 16, it took just three months for them to cut off all contact with their adoptive parents. Claire and Ed say their children were sent ""intrusive"" messages from their birth family and withdrew from their parents. Both children no longer attend school and there have been reports the older boy is involved in drug dealing. ""For us, it's just been devastating to have our family broken,"" Ed tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But the big tragedy and the big, human cost is theirs. Because they've just been manipulated."" Adoption UK says such complete breakdowns of relationships are rare - but unsupervised contact is becoming more common. The charity's research suggests nearly a quarter of adopted children make direct contact with their birth family - often via social media - before they gain the right to access information about their origins at the age of 18. Former High Court family law judge Sir Mark Hedley says there are no legal means of preventing young people from using social media to get in touch with their biological family, and banning their relatives from responding could be counter-productive. The situation has prompted a call from Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on adoption, for social services to enable safer, supervised contact before the age of 18. Three-quarters of adopted child have experienced neglect or abuse in their birth families, according to Adoption UK, raising concerns that post-adoption contact could be risky in some circumstances. Listen: 'They've turned our sons against us' âDonât my birth children have a right to know Iâm dying?' Claire and Ed say despite more than 30 emails and repeated phone calls to social services and their regional adoption agency asking for support, no one intervened. ""You just scream into a void for help,"" says Claire. In October last year, before the contact happened, Claire says she felt her family seemed happy and settled, perhaps for the first time in years. Their older son was attending a specialist school, having therapies which seemed to be helping him, while the younger boy was in a mainstream school, seemingly a ""happy lad"" on course for his GCSEs, she says. The couple say their older child had been increasingly curious about his birth family and they had arranged for him to send a note through letterbox contact - a system that is used in many adoptions to keep birth families updated as a child grows up, monitored by the local authority. But before that happened, it took him just a ""matter of minutes"" to look his family up on social media using details he had been given during the adoption process, they say. His birth family welcomed the contact and were ""very persistent"" in keeping in touch. He began to go missing from home overnight and was found close to his biological family's house. In December, he stopped going to school and Claire says there were allegations he had been dealing drugs. ""He was completely knocked off course and started to follow a completely different life trajectory,"" she says. Claire says the younger boy had been ""resistant"" to being introduced to his birth family, but was subjected to ""intrusive"" contact over phone and Facetime. About a quarter of adopted children now search for birth relatives online He withdrew from his adoptive family and from school, began meeting with his birth family, and would return with vapes, clothes and money, she says. Claire says: ""Our boys struggled with friendships, they struggled with school, they struggled with attention, they struggled to live within society's boundaries. ""And then what happens if a group of people come along and say, look, you don't need to go to school, you don't need to live in society's boundaries, we love you no matter what? ""[They say] 'Your parents are too harsh on you. They're too critical. And this is your escape clause.' I'm sure, you know lots of children, at that stage in their life would be tempted to move away from their families."" Now the couple say they have not had any meaningful contact with their sons for three months. ""They no longer live with us or regard as their parents and they don't want us to be their parents going forward. They're quite hostile towards us,"" Ed says. He says the boys have blocked their adoptive parents' phone number, and when their sons initiate a call it is ""not in a positive way"". ""There might be a chance of amicable relations sometime in the future, but not as a family,"" says Ed. He says they cannot compromise on their values of ""hard work, honesty and being law-abiding"" but they now think their sons are ""in a different world to that"". They feel they cannot be a part of that world and cannot influence the boys back onto the right path, he says. Claire says she felt they were ""naive"", believing themselves to be a close family unit. Ed says they had not been prepared for the possibility of contact before the boys were 18, and the result was ""beyond any worst-case scenario we could ever have contemplated"". ""You wouldn't believe it was possible for you to try to instil values and raise children for so many years and for it just to be totally wiped out in such a short amount of time,"" Claire says. 'I'm in lockdown with my long-lost sister' 'The foster child who drew himself into our family photoâ Charlotte Ramsden, president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services, says when children contact birth family through social media and relationships are damaged, it is a ""really complex and tragic situation"". Modern adoption needs to recognise that ""children have multiple attachments, they have complex identities, they are desperate to be loved and to understand their backgrounds"", she says. But while lifelong support and advice for adoptive families has improved, ""it's not at the level we think it needs to be"", Ms Ramsden says. Trying to prevent contact by restricting information is not the answer, she says. ""In a sense that's where adoption was a very long time ago, that information wasn't shared with children, but that actually was proved to cause them more difficulties.""

Rockets pound Israel after Gaza militants killed,"This video can not be played Israeli Arabs clashed with police in a number of Israeli cities Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired dozens of rockets at Israel after its air strikes killed top commanders and felled another tower block there. The escalation, which began on Monday, has triggered street violence in Israel between Jews and Israeli Arabs. In two incidents, a Jewish man in Acre was attacked by Arab men, while in Bat Yam Jews pulled a Palestinian out of his car and beat him up. At least 67 people in Gaza and seven people in Israel have been killed. The fighting erupted on Monday after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence in Israel Children terrified as locals scramble for cover Jeremy Bowen: Old grievances fuel new fighting Israel-Gaza violence dominates Arab media More than 374 people were arrested and 36 officers were injured after clashes in Israeli cities, Israeli police said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking late on Wednesday night, said he planned to send in military forces to help police maintain order in cities ruptured by violence. Mr Netanyahu said the attacks in recent days amounted to ""anarchy"". ""Nothing can justify an Arab mob assaulting Jews, and nothing can justify a Jewish mob assaulting Arabs,"" he said in a video statement, as reported by the Times of Israel. Violent clashes continued in the town of Lod on Wednesday An Arab driver was attacked by a mob in the city of Bat Yam on Wednesday Militant groups in Gaza, run by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, have been firing rockets into Israel since Monday night, and Israel has responded by hitting targets in the territory. On Thursday morning, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said about 1,500 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli cities since hostilities escalated at the start of this week. The health ministry in Gaza says that more than 400 people have been injured there since the conflict began, in addition to the 67 who have died. Mr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside. But the Palestinian Authority, which governs in parts of the West Bank,condemned Israel's ""military aggression"" in a tweet,external, saying it was ""traumatising an already beleaguered population of two million people"". The militants in Gaza said they had fired 130 rockets into Israel in response to an Israeli air raid which destroyed the al-Sharouk tower in Gaza City. The tower, which is the third tall building to be destroyed by air strikes this week, housed al-Aqsa TV, the station run by Hamas. This woman and child were evacuated from a building in Gaza Israel said it had killed senior Hamas officials in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. Hamas confirmed a senior commander and ""other leaders"" had died. The IDF said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014. Residents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths. Five members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency. ""We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,"" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, said, breaking down in tears as he described their death. The strength and limitations of Hamas's arsenal Meanwhile millions of Israelis were in bomb shelters on Wednesday evening,according to the IDF,external, after sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country. Anna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, described spending Tuesday night in a shelter with her five-month-old baby. ""To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,"" she told the BBC. A child killed in the Israeli town of Sderot was named as Ido Avigal, aged six, who was caught in an attack on a block of flats. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system - seen here over Ashkelon - aims to protect towns and cities from rockets United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the ongoing violence. The UN Security Council has met to discuss the issue, but has not issued a statement. In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden offered his support for Israel's security but stressed the need to restore ""a sustainable calm"". ""My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,"" he told reporters at the White House. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he had sent an envoy to the region to meet both sides. Russia has called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia). A Russian foreign ministry statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped ""violent acts"" in East Jerusalem and ""illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents"". The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

What is the conflict about?,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip. About 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Why there is a war:What is Hamas and why is it fighting Israel? Gaza Strip mapped:Life in Gaza under siege Explained:The faces of hostages taken from Israel Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community. The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922. To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move. A Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli War of Independence 1948 Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two. Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased. In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented. The soldiers of allied Arab Legion forces fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel. It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews. Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, orthe ""Catastrophe"" By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.  9.8 millionPopulation 73.6%Jews 21.1%Arabs 5.3%Other Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East. Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades. Israel's borders explained in maps In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state. Israeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six Day War in 1967 Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital. In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this. Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt. Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years. Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel. Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live there There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugees Whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed Whether the two sides should share Jerusalem And - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence. A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton. In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up. Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal. Peace seemed possible in the early 1990s when the Oslo accords were signed The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995. In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington. The mostrecent peace plan - prepared by the USwhen Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground. Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries. Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment. This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the UN says. Palestinians also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis. These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack. But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons. The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel. The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. Where does Israel get its weapons? It also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war. The US has however criticised Israel over the scale of the Palestinian death toll and sharp differences have emerged between the two allies over the war. Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack. Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however,denied any involvement.

Residents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths. Five members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency. ""We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,"" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, said, breaking down in tears as he described their death. The strength and limitations of Hamas's arsenal Meanwhile millions of Israelis were in bomb shelters on Wednesday evening,according to the IDF,external, after sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country. Anna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, described spending Tuesday night in a shelter with her five-month-old baby. ""To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,"" she told the BBC. A child killed in the Israeli town of Sderot was named as Ido Avigal, aged six, who was caught in an attack on a block of flats. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system - seen here over Ashkelon - aims to protect towns and cities from rockets United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the ongoing violence. The UN Security Council has met to discuss the issue, but has not issued a statement. In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden offered his support for Israel's security but stressed the need to restore ""a sustainable calm"". ""My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,"" he told reporters at the White House. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he had sent an envoy to the region to meet both sides. Russia has called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia). A Russian foreign ministry statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped ""violent acts"" in East Jerusalem and ""illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents"". The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale,"Online travel agent On The Beach has stopped selling all holidays for this summer due to Covid uncertainty. The pause in sales until September includes ""green list"" countries such as Portugal. By contrast, EasyJet and Tui will begin offering holidays to countries classified as amber, despite government advice remaining not to travel for leisure. EasyJet said it would let people ""make up their own mind about their holiday"". Most countries are currently classed as amber, but it is not illegal to travel to them when holidays resume on 17 May for people in England and Scotland. Instead, arrivals from these places will be required to quarantine at home for 10 days and take a Covid test before departure and on arrival. However, On The Beach, one of the biggest UK online travel agents, said it would not be selling any holidays for June, July and August due to ""continuing uncertainty around international leisure travel"". The firm's chief executive, Simon Cooper, said: ""There's nothing we want more than to be able to send customers on holiday, but with the current number of unknowns, we don't think that now is the right time for customers to book new holidays departing in the next few months."" He told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been ""jaded by the experience"" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions. Mr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by ""administrative costs and loss of goodwill"". NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week Which countries are on the green list for foreign holidays? The Foreign Office stopped advising against all but essential travel to a number of amber destinations last week. However, its advice is based on different criteria to the Department of Transport's advice. At present, only 12 countries are on the government's ""green list"" for foreign holidays under the traffic light system for travel, meaning people are not required to quarantine when they get back. But they will need to take a Covid test before departure and another on arrival. By contrast, those visiting amber countries such as Spain and France must take a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. They also need to quarantine at home for 10 days when they return. On The Beach's Mr Cooper said it would not be offering foreign holidays to ""green list"" countries because ""it is very likely that we will see regular fluctuations in destinations' traffic light classifications"". ""Given this, there is too much uncertainty for us to take new bookings with confidence that they will go ahead, or for us to know the potential inconvenience or incremental costs that customers might experience or incur,"" he said. ""Unlike many of our competitors, we have no interest in selling holidays that are unlikely to happen, as our business model enables us to put customers first, rather than needing to get cash in the door to contribute to high fixed costs, and offering refunds in the form of a voucher when holidays get cancelled."" Tui to subsidise Covid tests for customers Travellers swapping summer holidays for autumn ones Speaking on Friday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that although holidays abroad would no longer be illegal from Monday 17 May, the government advised against travel to amber countries for leisure. However, Tui and EasyJet are still going to push ahead with their plans to offer holidays to ""amber list"" countries. An EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: ""We recognise that many our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday."" She added that EasyJet won't operate any holidays to destinations on the ""red"" list. Tui's spokeswoman said: ""We want to offer our customers flexibility and choice this summer, so where borders are open and FCDO advice allows travel, we will operate to those destinations. ""We know some customers may be unsure about travelling this summer, so we've offered free changes 14 days before travel for anyone due to travel before the end of August."" The flurry of activity by the FCDO at the start of last week led a few to think that they had cracked which countries would be on the green list early. But they spoke too soon; while there is overlap the two are not the same. The government would say the two lists each serve a different purpose. The Foreign office list is advice to help British travellers assess the risk posed to them if they travel to a country. The traffic light list is about stopping the virus and variants coming into the country. Essentially, one is about personal risk, one is about national risk. There is still a strong overlap between the two and the fact that the countries differ has still left some passengers and the industry scratching their heads. Unlike now, there will be no law stopping travellers from going to amber countries, just government advice not to do so for leisure. Doing so will mean quarantine on return and added cost for tests, which will put many off. But after low passenger numbers for over a year, some operators think that it's a price that certain passengers will be willing to pay. Also on Wednesday, Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya said the UK should take a regional approach when deciding which places should be on the green list. The country is on the amber list. She told BBC Breakfast: ""We are having good discussions with the UK authorities to convince them there are many regions in Spain - Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Valencia - where the numbers are equivalent to those in the UK today. ""Maybe if the UK looks with a regional lens they will discover that there are many safe places already in Spain to travel to. Let's keep on working, but it's looking good for British tourists to spend their holidays in Spain this summer."" She said Spain was proceeding at pace with its vaccination effort and that over 30% of Spaniards had already received at least one shot, with six million were fully vaccinated. She said that the country was 98 days away from collective immunity. It comes as Tui reported reported a sharp jump in demand for holidays this winter as more people defer their holidays. As of 2 May, bookings this year for winter 2021/22 breaks were up 17% on the same period in 2019. But total summer bookings were down 69% due to continued uncertainty over travel rules. Nevertheless, TUI said it expected the safe return of holidays in the coming months. ""The continued vaccination progress across our key customer markets and destinations, combined with more testing, and comprehensive hygiene measures throughout our eco-system, should enable the safe return to holidays this summer,"" it said. Due to the ongoing pandemic, third lockdown and travel restrictions, Tui's revenues dived by 89% to â¬716m (Â£614.6m) in the six months to March. However, TUI said customers were keen to travel once Covid restrictions were fully lifted. It said nearly three times as many Britons have decided to book with the travel giant for the summer of 2022 compared with 2019. The travel operator said it was focused on reopening a portfolio of destinations strong vaccination coverage and low incidence rates, including the Greek islands, the Balearics, the Canaries and Portugal.

Groups of six can meet in Wales pubs from Monday,"This video can not be played Cafes, pubs and restaurants get ready to reopen indoors Up to six people from different households will be able to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed indoor hospitality can reopen from 17 May as Wales' Covid case rate continues to fall. Extra cash support for hospitality businesses still affected by Covid restrictions has also been announced. Mr Drakeford said the funding would ""support firms and safeguard jobs"". The support is available to businesses such as pubs, clubs, restaurants and late-night entertainment venues. They can claim up to Â£25,000 to help them through to the end of June, as they prepare for re-opening and more normal trading conditions. The news comes after calls from some in the hospitality industry for allsignificant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July. In England pubs will also open indoors on Monday, with people from different households or not in a bubble having to stay one metre apart. When they reopen in Wales, six people from any households will be able to meet, but those who do not live together, or who are not in bubbles, will have to socially distance, with the rule being two metres apart. Numbers have been increased from the four peopleset out in the Welsh government's lockdown easing plan.,external BBC Wales understands this was changed to make it easier to enforce, bringing it into line with beer garden rules, and indoor meeting drinking rules in England. This video can not be played Sarah John began home brewing in her garage Sarah John, of Boss Brewery in Swansea, said while she was ""breathing a sigh of relief"" to reopen indoors, many small pubs would not be able to reopen unless the two-metre rule was reconsidered. ""Capacity-wise you can get a lot fewer people in, for some small venues it might not be feasible... ideally we would have liked to have seen that taken down to one metre as well,"" she said. Ms John said she hoped the Welsh government would reduce social distancing at the next lockdown briefing on Friday, and the industry needed clarity for the future. ""The back and forth has been difficult... it's very important to be on the home straight, we want to see some commitment from Mark Drakeford on when we will be totally restriction free,"" she said. Paul Slater, landlord of the Trotting Mare Inn in Overton-on-Dee, which is right on the Welsh-English border said he was delighted to open indoors, after two weeks of ""hit and miss weather"" with customers sitting outside with hot water bottles and blankets. He said the two-metre social distancing rule would mean numbers able to sit indoors would halve from 72, and would be a ""balancing act"". ""In the week it won't make too much of a difference, but at weekends we are going to be very limited... We have a lot of drinkers at a weekend, so it's a balancing act between reserving tables for drinkers or people eating,"" he toldRadio Wales Breakfast. Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine LÃ¶eber said while they were sure many patrons would come back, some may return less frequently At the Cross Keys in Penrhynside, near Llandudno, Conwy county, landlords Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine LÃ¶eber said they had concerns people's habits might have changed during lockdown. They said people may have saved money while being unable to go out, and want to spend money in their homes, and it may led to a ""slow recovery"". Due to social-distancing measures, the pub had temporarily got rid of its pool table to sit more people inside, but they said even then numbers would be reduced by a third. However the couple said they had not considered staying closed. ""We are a community pub, so long as we break even and provide a service...we are doing what we are passionate about,"" Mr Fitzpatrick said. Amy Wilson will keep groups to a maximum of four indoors at her premises Amy Wilson, who runs her grandfather's business Elmers Cafe, on Crwys Road in Cardiff, said they would be sticking to four people per table indoors because the cafe did not have a large area. Spectators to join sport and culture events trial Rules for reopening cinemas 'impractical' ""If there are six people then we'll encourage them to sit outside,"" she said. ""Our customer base includes students, builders and older local people. We have a 91-year-old regular called Bryn. He comes in every day and has a tea and toast. ""But it's been so sad seeing him having a takeaway and eating outside, sometimes even in the rain. We put a little chair out there for him. It'll be nice to have him coming back inside."" Marco Orsi, who runs the CafÃ© Royale in Pontypridd, said social distancing needed to be reduced to the same rules as in England After being closed since 18 December, Marco Orsi said he was looking forward to reopening his cafÃ© in Pontypridd and said he hoped people would be ""queueing out the door"". He said that he believed cafes should have been allowed to open indoors weeks ago, when non-essential shops pulled up their shutters. ""What we will be opening up to is a slight question mark...with the town centres, but I am confident, in due course, that things will get back to normal,"" he said. He added he believed it was customers' own responsibility to social distance and business owners should not be made to police it. ""People should know how to behave now, if they don't I'm not going to educate them, we will keep social distancing, but I don't expect to police it myself,"" he said. Sophia Joannides said the last year had been a rollercoaster, with the family-run business having to adapt to survive the pandemic Sophia Joannides, Owner of Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in TycÃ´ch, Swansea, said she was excited to see all her regulars again, some who had not visited for over a year due to having to shield. ""Outside dining hasn't really worked for us due to our lovely Welsh weather, we are lucky we have quite a bit of space inside Bluebell, but we are still working on a very reduced capacity,"" she said. ""Our customers are the most loyal and supportive, so we know the next few weeks will be great."" Supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF) can also apply for support. Mr Drakeford said the cash announced was part of a Â£200m package earmarked for the incoming Welsh government to help businesses affected by the pandemic. ""We know the restrictions have helped to keep us all safe but they have had a big impact on Welsh businesses, which is why we are making more funding available to support firms and safeguard jobs,"" he said. Tell us when we can reopen, nightclubs ask FM Let pubs reopen to control drinking, says Tory As leader of Welsh Labour, Mr Drakeford had faced criticism during the Senedd election campaign for not announcing the extra financial support for the hospitality sector. At the time, he said ""election rules"" prevented him from releasing the cash - and the move did not apparently harm Labour's chances of being re-elected last week. This video can not be played Outdoor hospitality in Wales opened on 26 April Hospitality businesses which can apply for this funding include pubs, clubs, restaurants, nightclubs, late night entertainment venues, supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF). The government said an ""eligibility checker"" would open on the Business Wales website at midday on 17 May so businesses can find out how much support they are likely to be entitled to and how to apply. Mr Drakeford added: ""The public health situation continues to improve in Wales - we have the lowest coronavirus rates and the best vaccination rates in the UK."" The relaxation is the latest development in the Welsh government's route out of the lockdown imposed last year to contain the spread of coronavirus. Gyms, swimming pools and community centres have already reopened while cinemas, theatres and museums are also due to reopen from 17 May, though with strict social-distancing rules still in place. The news came asonly six Welsh council areas reported deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekof figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Deaths overall were also below normal levels for a ninth week in succession. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on death certificates dropped to seven in the week ending 30 April - half the previous week's total and the lowest for more than seven months. These accounted for 1.2% of all registered deaths in Wales. It is a further indication of the retreat of Covid, which has resulted in low case numbers and falling hospital cases. The trend has been for a steady decline in deaths and the weekly total is 93% fewer than registered two months ago.

Fears of war as Israel-Gaza violence escalates,"This video can not be played Israeli Arabs clashed with police in a number of Israeli cities The deadly exchange of fire between Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military has escalated significantly, with the UN fearing a ""full-scale war"". More than 1,000 rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants, Israel says. Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, destroying three tower blocks and killing senior Hamas officials. Since Monday at least 65 Palestinians and six people in Israel have died. That includes 16 Palestinian children caught up in the conflict. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the ongoing violence. In a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken condemned Hamas rocket attacks but said Israel had an obligation to avoid civilian casualties. He said he had sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hady Amr to meet both sides. The fighting erupted on Monday night after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews.

But the Palestinian Authoritycondemned Israel's ""military aggression"" in a tweet,external, saying it was ""traumatizing an already beleaguered population of 2 million people"". Militants in Gaza began firing rockets into Israel on Monday night, and Israel responded by hitting targets in the territory. On Wednesday Israel said it had killed senior officials of the Hamas group in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. ""This was only the beginning. We will inflict blows on them that they have never dreamed of,"" said the Israeli prime minister. Hamas - which runs Gaza - confirmed the death of its commander in Gaza City and other ""warriors"". ""Thousands of leaders and soldiers will follow in their footsteps,"" Hamas said in a statement reported by Reuters news agency.

An 11-year-old resident of Gaza, Yasmine, told Save the Children Tuesday had been the worst night of her life. ""I had pain in my stomach from the fear and my parents were trying to comfort me and tell me the bombing was far away but I could feel that it was close,"" she told the charity.

Two people, a man and his teenage daughter, were killed in Lod when a rocket hit their car. They were both Israeli Arabs. Israeli police reported what they called violent riots in dozens of areas of the country overnight, with 270 people arrested. Synagogues and businesses in Lod were set on fire. Mr Netanyahu described the riots as ""unbearable"" and said they reminded the Jewish people of their past. Israeli police said that Lod would be placed under curfew from 20:00 local time on Wednesday until 04:00 on Thursday to preserve the safety and property of residents.

"Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, report says","Crematoriums were overwhelmed in India in recent weeks amid a devastating Covid wave The Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, an independent review panel has said. The panel, set up by the World Health Organization, said the combined response of the WHO and global governments was a ""toxic cocktail"". The WHO should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, its report said, adding that without urgent change the world was vulnerable to another major disease outbreak. More than 3.3 million people around the world have now died of Covid. While the US and Europe are beginning to ease restrictions and resume some aspects of pre-pandemic life, the virus is still devastating parts of Asia. India in particular is seeing record-breaking numbers of new cases and deaths, with severe oxygen shortages in hospitals across the country. Countries neighbouring India, such as Nepal, are also seeing surges of the virus. Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic,,externalwas compiled by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Its aim was to find answers as to how the virus had killed more than 3.3 million people and infected more than 159 million.

""It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response."" Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country WHO says India Covid variant of 'global concern' The panel argued that the WHO's Emergency Committee should have declared the outbreak in China an international emergency a week earlier than it did. It should have done so at its first meeting on 22 January last year, the report said, instead of waiting until 30 January. The month following the WHO's declaration was ""lost"" as countries failed to take appropriate measures to halt the spread of the virus. The WHO was then hindered by its own regulations that travel restrictions should be a last resort, the panel said, adding that Europe and the US wasted the entire month of February and acted only when their hospitals began to fill up. This video can not be played Are pandemics the new normal? When countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report said. To prevent another catastrophic pandemic, the report suggests key reforms: A new global threats council should be created with the power to hold countries accountable There should be a disease surveillance system to publish information without the approval of countries concerned Vaccines must be classed as public goods and there should be a pandemic financing facility There was an immediate request for the wealthy G7 nations to commit $1.9bn (Â£1.3bn) to the WHO's Covax programme providing vaccine support to low income countries Panel co-chair and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was ""critical to have an empowered WHO"". ""If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease and that remains the same today,"" she added. The most eye-catching line of this report is that the pandemic was the 21st Century's ""Chernobyl moment"" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. The panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. After the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of ""never again"". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first? The panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand. There are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth. The most fundamental one remains our relationship with the animal world to stop viruses jumping to humans in the first place.

Amber country holidays to begin despite advice,"Online travel agent On The Beach has stopped selling all holidays for this summer due to Covid uncertainty. The pause in sales until September includes ""green list"" countries such as Portugal. By contrast, EasyJet and Tui will begin offering holidays to countries classified as amber, despite government advice remaining not to travel for leisure. EasyJet said it would let people ""make up their own mind about their holiday"". Most countries are currently classed as amber, but it is not illegal to travel to them when holidays resume on 17 May for people in England and Scotland. Instead, arrivals from these places will be required to quarantine at home for 10 days and take a Covid test before departure and on arrival. However, On The Beach, one of the biggest UK online travel agents, said it would not be selling any holidays for June, July and August due to ""continuing uncertainty around international leisure travel"". The firm's chief executive, Simon Cooper, said: ""There's nothing we want more than to be able to send customers on holiday, but with the current number of unknowns, we don't think that now is the right time for customers to book new holidays departing in the next few months."" He told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been ""jaded by the experience"" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions. Mr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by ""administrative costs and loss of goodwill"". NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week Which countries are on the green list for foreign holidays? The Foreign Office stopped advising against all but essential travel to a number of amber destinations last week. However, its advice is based on different criteria to the Department of Transport's advice. At present, only 12 countries are on the government's ""green list"" for foreign holidays under the traffic light system for travel, meaning people are not required to quarantine when they get back. But they will need to take a Covid test before departure and another on arrival. By contrast, those visiting amber countries such as Spain and France must take a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. They also need to quarantine at home for 10 days when they return. On The Beach's Mr Cooper said it would not be offering foreign holidays to ""green list"" countries because ""it is very likely that we will see regular fluctuations in destinations' traffic light classifications"". ""Given this, there is too much uncertainty for us to take new bookings with confidence that they will go ahead, or for us to know the potential inconvenience or incremental costs that customers might experience or incur,"" he said. ""Unlike many of our competitors, we have no interest in selling holidays that are unlikely to happen, as our business model enables us to put customers first, rather than needing to get cash in the door to contribute to high fixed costs, and offering refunds in the form of a voucher when holidays get cancelled."" Tui to subsidise Covid tests for customers Travellers swapping summer holidays for autumn ones Speaking on Friday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that although holidays abroad would no longer be illegal from Monday 17 May, the government advised against travel to amber countries for leisure. However, Tui and EasyJet are still going to push ahead with their plans to offer holidays to ""amber list"" countries. An EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: ""We recognise that many our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday."" She added that EasyJet won't operate any holidays to destinations on the ""red"" list. Tui's spokeswoman said: ""We want to offer our customers flexibility and choice this summer, so where borders are open and FCDO advice allows travel, we will operate to those destinations. ""We know some customers may be unsure about travelling this summer, so we've offered free changes 14 days before travel for anyone due to travel before the end of August."" The flurry of activity by the FCDO at the start of last week led a few to think that they had cracked which countries would be on the green list early. But they spoke too soon; while there is overlap the two are not the same. The government would say the two lists each serve a different purpose. The Foreign office list is advice to help British travellers assess the risk posed to them if they travel to a country. The traffic light list is about stopping the virus and variants coming into the country. Essentially, one is about personal risk, one is about national risk. There is still a strong overlap between the two and the fact that the countries differ has still left some passengers and the industry scratching their heads. Unlike now, there will be no law stopping travellers from going to amber countries, just government advice not to do so for leisure. Doing so will mean quarantine on return and added cost for tests, which will put many off. But after low passenger numbers for over a year, some operators think that it's a price that certain passengers will be willing to pay. Also on Wednesday, Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya said the UK should take a regional approach when deciding which places should be on the green list. The country is on the amber list. She told BBC Breakfast: ""We are having good discussions with the UK authorities to convince them there are many regions in Spain - Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Valencia - where the numbers are equivalent to those in the UK today. ""Maybe if the UK looks with a regional lens they will discover that there are many safe places already in Spain to travel to. Let's keep on working, but it's looking good for British tourists to spend their holidays in Spain this summer."" She said Spain was proceeding at pace with its vaccination effort and that over 30% of Spaniards had already received at least one shot, with six million were fully vaccinated. She said that the country was 98 days away from collective immunity. It comes as Tui reported reported a sharp jump in demand for holidays this winter as more people defer their holidays. As of 2 May, bookings this year for winter 2021/22 breaks were up 17% on the same period in 2019. But total summer bookings were down 69% due to continued uncertainty over travel rules. Nevertheless, TUI said it expected the safe return of holidays in the coming months. ""The continued vaccination progress across our key customer markets and destinations, combined with more testing, and comprehensive hygiene measures throughout our eco-system, should enable the safe return to holidays this summer,"" it said. Due to the ongoing pandemic, third lockdown and travel restrictions, Tui's revenues dived by 89% to â¬716m (Â£614.6m) in the six months to March. However, TUI said customers were keen to travel once Covid restrictions were fully lifted. It said nearly three times as many Britons have decided to book with the travel giant for the summer of 2022 compared with 2019. The travel operator said it was focused on reopening a portfolio of destinations strong vaccination coverage and low incidence rates, including the Greek islands, the Balearics, the Canaries and Portugal.

"Fears of war as Israel-Gaza violence escalatesThe barrage of Palestinian militant rockets and Israeli air strikes grows, in the worst violence in years.Middle East","This video can not be played Israeli Arabs clashed with police in a number of Israeli cities The deadly exchange of fire between Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military has escalated significantly, with the UN fearing a ""full-scale war"". More than 1,000 rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants, Israel says. Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, destroying three tower blocks and killing senior Hamas officials. Since Monday at least 65 Palestinians and six people in Israel have died. That includes 16 Palestinian children caught up in the conflict. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the ongoing violence. In a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken condemned Hamas rocket attacks but said Israel had an obligation to avoid civilian casualties. He said he had sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hady Amr to meet both sides. The fighting erupted on Monday night after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews. Violence explodes in the mixed Arab-Jewish town of Lod Children terrified as locals scramble for cover Jeremy Bowen: Old grievances fuel new fighting Israel-Gaza violence dominates Arab media Violent unrest in towns in Israel with mixed Jewish and Arab populations has led to hundreds of arrests. Lod near Tel Aviv is under a state of emergency. Torah scrolls are removed from a damaged synagogue in Lod Mr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside. But the Palestinian Authoritycondemned Israel's ""military aggression"" in a tweet,external, saying it was ""traumatizing an already beleaguered population of 2 million people"". Militants in Gaza began firing rockets into Israel on Monday night, and Israel responded by hitting targets in the territory. On Wednesday Israel said it had killed senior officials of the Hamas group in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. ""This was only the beginning. We will inflict blows on them that they have never dreamed of,"" said the Israeli prime minister. Hamas - which runs Gaza - confirmed the death of its commander in Gaza City and other ""warriors"". ""Thousands of leaders and soldiers will follow in their footsteps,"" Hamas said in a statement reported by Reuters news agency. But the Russian foreign ministry in a statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped ""violent acts"" in East Jerusalem and ""illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents"". The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that more than 360 people have been injured there since the conflict began, as well as the 65 who have died. This building in the southern Gaza Strip was hit by an Israeli air strike The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014. On Wednesday a third high-rise building in Gaza was destroyed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Hamas said it was incensed by ""the enemy's targeting of residential towers"". Residents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths. Five members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency. An 11-year-old resident of Gaza, Yasmine, told Save the Children Tuesday had been the worst night of her life. ""I had pain in my stomach from the fear and my parents were trying to comfort me and tell me the bombing was far away but I could feel that it was close,"" she told the charity. ""Tomorrow is Eid and we won't be celebrating because of this conflict."" Millions of Israelis were heading to bomb shelters on Wednesday evening,according to the IDF,external, as sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country. On Wednesday morning an Israeli soldier was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Gaza into Israel, authorities said. There were conflicting reports on the fate of a six-year-old boy hit in a rocket attack on the town of Sderot, with some saying he had died in the attack. Two people, a man and his teenage daughter, were killed in Lod when a rocket hit their car. They were both Israeli Arabs. Israeli police reported what they called violent riots in dozens of areas of the country overnight, with 270 people arrested. Synagogues and businesses in Lod were set on fire. Mr Netanyahu described the riots as ""unbearable"" and said they reminded the Jewish people of their past. Israeli police said that Lod would be placed under curfew from 20:00 local time on Wednesday until 04:00 on Thursday to preserve the safety and property of residents. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system, seen here in Ashkelon, attempts to intercept rockets The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

No 10 seeks to cancel Johnson court debt judgment,"Downing Street is seeking to cancel a county court judgement against Prime Minister Boris Johnson that cites an unpaid bill of Â£535. The order was made against Mr Johnson, of 10 Downing Street, on 26 October, according to a judgement database. The creditor and nature of the debt, which was first reported by Private Eye magazine, is not yet known. A Downing Street spokesperson said the claim against the PM was without merit. ""An application will be made for an order to set aside the default judgement, to strike out the claim and for a declaration that the claim is totally without merit,"" the spokesperson added. Watchdog to investigate PM's flat renovations What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The BBC understands the case relates to a defamation claim against Mr Johnson. County court judgements,externalare issued in England and Wales when people fail to repay money they owe. ""If you get a judgement, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money,"" according to a government website. A bailiff ""may visit your home if you do not pay your debts"",the website warns,external. Banks and loan companies can also use the information to decide whether to issue credit or loans. ""If you're late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs,"" the website adds. Anyone who has had a county court judgement (CCJ) against them can apply for it to be cancelled - or ""set aside"" in the legal language - but they must convince the court that there is a good reason for this to happen and they have also acted promptly in launching their challenge. That could include the judgement having been issued in error - perhaps because the debt had actually been paid, or because there was never a debt in the first place. Sometimes, people seek to have a CCJ cancelled because they genuinely did not know about it - or they can show the court that it has acted incorrectly in making the order. That can happen when the court has been provided with the wrong address for a debtor who only later learns of the judgement when they discover it has damaged their credit score. The official rules for applications to set aside a judgement state: ""Most applications will require a hearing and you will be expected to attend. The court will allocate a hearing date and time for the application. Please indicate in a covering letter any dates that you are unavailable within the next six weeks."" The application must come with some kind of ""statement of truth"", explaining why the judgement should be set aside. The prime minister could instruct a lawyer to appear for him. Applicants can also ask the court to consider waiving the Â£100 fee if it would cause them ""undue hardship"". The prime minister's personal finances have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. In particular, he has faced questions about how renovations to the flat, above 11 Downing Street, that he shares with fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds were paid for. He has insisted he personally paid for the work, but has declined to say whether he received an initial loan. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and whether any donation to the Conservative Party was properly declared. Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said the court judgement had nothing to do with the Downing Street estate refurbishment, saying: ""All bills have been paid by the government or the prime minister, personally."" Asked if Number 10 had only become aware of the judgement when it was first reported earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman said it was something they are ""looking into currently"". And on being asked whether there should be concerns about the prime minister's personal finances, Mr Johnson's press secretary said: ""You should not be concerned, no.""

Bye for now from Becky Morton, Claire Heald, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Robert Greenall, who've brought you today's updates. And here's a recap of the main stories around the world today: We are going to be bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's events in the UK:  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has arrived at Westminster Abbey for a service to honour the contribution of nurses during the pandemic. The service, which takes place annually to mark Florence Nightingale's birthday on 12 May - now known as International Nurses' Day - is this year recognising the sacrifice of nurses and midwives since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the UK. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is a relative of Nightingale, are also at the service. Earlier, the Duchess of Cornwall met nurses, patients and staff on a visit to the Whittington Hospital, in London. Exams in Scotland have been cancelled as the Covid-19 pandemic forced pupils into extended periods of learning from home, but the alternative arrangements are ""exams in all but name"", Labour's education spokesman has said. Michael Marra has written to Education Secretary John Swinney calling for greater clarity in the system, claiming there is inconsistency in this year's process, a lack of planning and a lack of information about appeals. He wrote: ""Lessons must be learned from last year's unfair appeals process, where young people had no ability to have their teacher estimate scrutinised, even where they felt evidence existed."" He went on: ""Young people in Scotland are right now sitting exams in all but name, they need clarity and certainty about the process they are undertaking."" Some pupils told the BBC they were at ""breaking point"" over school assessments. More than 4,000 people have died so far in Nepal with cases rising While much of the world's attention in recent weeks has been focused on India's Covid plight, its small northern neighbour Nepal has been facing its own crisis. The Himalayan nation of about 30 million people is one of the least developed countries in the world, and it relies on India for supplies of medical equipment and oxygen. And as India stops exports, Nepal is struggling to find alternatives. Meanwhile nearly one in two of its citizens are testing positive for the virus. More than 4,000 people have died and many more deaths are expected. Read more here from the BBC's Ambarasan Ethirajan on the tragedy of Nepal's second wave. England play Scotland at Wembley Stadium on 18 June Key workers have been offered exclusive access to watch the Uefa Euro 2020 matches in London's Trafalgar Square. The capital will be one of 12 cities hosting the European Championship, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Police, transport workers, NHS and ambulance staff will be given the chance to watch the first two England games in the square's fan park. Wembley Stadium will stage eight games during the tournament, which runs from 11 June to 11 July, all of them to be shown on giant TV screens in London. Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was hoped up to 9,500 people could be hosted in the Fan Zone Under the Prime Minister'sroadmap out of lockdown, social distancing measures and limits of people gathering outdoors will still be in place for England's first two games.

Italy's prime minister remembers Covid victims in Bergamo, one of the first European cities to be ravaged by the virus Some more now on the independent report published today which highlights serious flaws in the world's initial response to the pandemic. We've already mentioned criticisms aimed at the World Health Organization. But the report says that when combined with the actions of individual governments, these failures created a ""toxic cocktail"". So what did governments do wrong? The panel says US and European countries wasted the entire month of February when the virus was advancing across the world, and only acted when their hospitals began to fill up. And when countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report says. Read more about the report here. Boris Johnson has announced an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.But what does this mean? A public inquiry is a major investigation, launched by the government. Its job is to respond to ""public concern"" about a particular event or set of events - such as the pandemic. According to a leading specialist lawyer, it must ask three questions:  An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses, and to provide documentation and material evidence. At the end, the public inquiry usually draws up a report and makes recommendations to the government. Previous high-profile public inquiries have included the Chilcot investigation into the UK's role in the Iraq war - which took seven years - and the events of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Northern Ireland - which took 12 years. Here's everything we know about the Covid inquiry so far. Concern is growing about a rising number of Covid cases in Glasgowas the area prepares to ease restrictions. The latest published case rate is 58.3 per 100,000 population - well above a key threshold for moving from level three to level two in the roadmap out of lockdown. A senior health official said there were clusters of high infection rates in parts of the city. The variant first identified in India is suspected to be involved, although this has yet to be confirmed. All mainland council areas with the likely exception of Moray are due to move to level two on Monday, allowing people to meet indoors in groups of up to six people from up to three different households. Meanwhile, Rangers fansare being warned to think of their families before gathering in crowds to celebrate their league win. A woman mourns her son's death in Delhi as fatalities continue to rise India has seen its deadliest 24 hours of the pandemic yet, as the country's total number of Covid fatalities passed 250,000. Deaths increased by a record 4,205 while infections rose 348,421 to more than 23 million. Experts believe the death toll could actually be much higher. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of the country, with deaths rising significantly in recent weeks. There are shortages of medicines, hospital beds and oxygen, and most of the country's crematoriums have run out of spaces. Watch the BBC's Vikas Pandey's journey through the capital Delhi in the throes of the pandemic: This video can not be played India coronavirus: 'My city is under siege from Covid' A total of54,160,993coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's35,722,461first jabs and18,438,532second dose total.

Members of the Unison trade union have voted to accept the Scottish Government's 4% pay offer for most NHS workers. Unison, Scotland's largest public sector union, had campaigned for the previous three-year deal to be renegotiated in light of the pandemic. In March, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman set out the pay rise of at least 4% for staff with contracts under theAgenda for Change system. Almost 50,000 Unison members were balloted on the proposal and 35% voted, with 84% accepting the pay deal. Union officials say they will now push for the deal to be implemented as soon as possible. In England, the government recommended in March that NHS staff should receive a 1% pay increase this year. Pop star Dua Lipa called for NHS workers to be paid more as she won two major awards at the Brits last night. The Canary Islands have seen few tourists so far this year Spain is expecting as many as 45 million foreign visitors this year, more than half pre-pandemic levels, its tourism minister says. ""International tourists can start planning their Spanish
vacations now,"" Reyes Maroto said at the launch of Spain's summer promotional campaign, describing the forecast as ""cautious but realistic"". The European Union is expected to update its restrictions on non-essential visits from outside the bloc on 20 May, just three days after the UK - Spain's biggest source of tourists - allows international travel to resume. But Spain will remain on England and Scotland's amber list of countries, meaning people should not be travelling there for leisure and should quarantine on their return home. Spain is making a major push to boost tourism after last year's numbers collapsed by nearly 80% compared with 2019. French and German visitors are also being targeted. Earlier we reported that Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya was urging the UK to consider a regional approach to easing restrictions, as many Spanish regions had similar case numbers to Britain. Downing Street has defended the timescale for starting the public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, after a group for bereaved families said it was beginning too late. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We're about to take one of the biggest steps forward in step three, which will involve a lot of unlocking, and that needs to be monitored carefully as we know variants are still an issue of concern and, of course, we will then be going into winter and the usual pressures that places on our NHS. ""Therefore it is right to wait until we are out of certainly winter time and hopefully due to the vaccine rollout globally... we will be in a better position to take this forward. ""Because these sorts of inquiries do require a great deal of government time with officials who are currently working on our Covid response.""

Bye for now from Becky Morton, Claire Heald, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Robert Greenall, who've brought you today's updates. And here's a recap of the main stories around the world today: We are going to be bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's events in the UK:  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has arrived at Westminster Abbey for a service to honour the contribution of nurses during the pandemic. The service, which takes place annually to mark Florence Nightingale's birthday on 12 May - now known as International Nurses' Day - is this year recognising the sacrifice of nurses and midwives since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the UK. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is a relative of Nightingale, are also at the service. Earlier, the Duchess of Cornwall met nurses, patients and staff on a visit to the Whittington Hospital, in London. Exams in Scotland have been cancelled as the Covid-19 pandemic forced pupils into extended periods of learning from home, but the alternative arrangements are ""exams in all but name"", Labour's education spokesman has said. Michael Marra has written to Education Secretary John Swinney calling for greater clarity in the system, claiming there is inconsistency in this year's process, a lack of planning and a lack of information about appeals. He wrote: ""Lessons must be learned from last year's unfair appeals process, where young people had no ability to have their teacher estimate scrutinised, even where they felt evidence existed."" He went on: ""Young people in Scotland are right now sitting exams in all but name, they need clarity and certainty about the process they are undertaking."" Some pupils told the BBC they were at ""breaking point"" over school assessments. More than 4,000 people have died so far in Nepal with cases rising While much of the world's attention in recent weeks has been focused on India's Covid plight, its small northern neighbour Nepal has been facing its own crisis. The Himalayan nation of about 30 million people is one of the least developed countries in the world, and it relies on India for supplies of medical equipment and oxygen. And as India stops exports, Nepal is struggling to find alternatives. Meanwhile nearly one in two of its citizens are testing positive for the virus. More than 4,000 people have died and many more deaths are expected. Read more here from the BBC's Ambarasan Ethirajan on the tragedy of Nepal's second wave. England play Scotland at Wembley Stadium on 18 June Key workers have been offered exclusive access to watch the Uefa Euro 2020 matches in London's Trafalgar Square. The capital will be one of 12 cities hosting the European Championship, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Police, transport workers, NHS and ambulance staff will be given the chance to watch the first two England games in the square's fan park. Wembley Stadium will stage eight games during the tournament, which runs from 11 June to 11 July, all of them to be shown on giant TV screens in London. Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was hoped up to 9,500 people could be hosted in the Fan Zone Under the Prime Minister'sroadmap out of lockdown, social distancing measures and limits of people gathering outdoors will still be in place for England's first two games.

Italy's prime minister remembers Covid victims in Bergamo, one of the first European cities to be ravaged by the virus Some more now on the independent report published today which highlights serious flaws in the world's initial response to the pandemic. We've already mentioned criticisms aimed at the World Health Organization. But the report says that when combined with the actions of individual governments, these failures created a ""toxic cocktail"". So what did governments do wrong? The panel says US and European countries wasted the entire month of February when the virus was advancing across the world, and only acted when their hospitals began to fill up. And when countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report says. Read more about the report here. Boris Johnson has announced an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.But what does this mean? A public inquiry is a major investigation, launched by the government. Its job is to respond to ""public concern"" about a particular event or set of events - such as the pandemic. According to a leading specialist lawyer, it must ask three questions:  An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses, and to provide documentation and material evidence. At the end, the public inquiry usually draws up a report and makes recommendations to the government. Previous high-profile public inquiries have included the Chilcot investigation into the UK's role in the Iraq war - which took seven years - and the events of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Northern Ireland - which took 12 years. Here's everything we know about the Covid inquiry so far. Concern is growing about a rising number of Covid cases in Glasgowas the area prepares to ease restrictions. The latest published case rate is 58.3 per 100,000 population - well above a key threshold for moving from level three to level two in the roadmap out of lockdown. A senior health official said there were clusters of high infection rates in parts of the city. The variant first identified in India is suspected to be involved, although this has yet to be confirmed. All mainland council areas with the likely exception of Moray are due to move to level two on Monday, allowing people to meet indoors in groups of up to six people from up to three different households. Meanwhile, Rangers fansare being warned to think of their families before gathering in crowds to celebrate their league win. A woman mourns her son's death in Delhi as fatalities continue to rise India has seen its deadliest 24 hours of the pandemic yet, as the country's total number of Covid fatalities passed 250,000. Deaths increased by a record 4,205 while infections rose 348,421 to more than 23 million. Experts believe the death toll could actually be much higher. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of the country, with deaths rising significantly in recent weeks. There are shortages of medicines, hospital beds and oxygen, and most of the country's crematoriums have run out of spaces.

"Coronavirus public inquiry to be held in spring 2022""We are fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage of this crisis,"" Boris Johnson says.UKComments","This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson said the UK's Covid response would be ""placed under the microscope"" The government is ""fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage"" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"". What is the Covid inquiry and how will it work? What's changing in England, Scotland and Wales? Town's Covid surge leaves hospitality nervous On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale He said the ""new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here"". ""Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January."" Boltonhas one of the highest instances of the Indian variantin the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s. Health officials in Glasgow have expressed concern abouta rising number of Covid cases in the city- the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. More than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths. The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year. ""A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter."" Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed an ""informal"" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published. The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"". She told the BBC: ""That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would. ""That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions."" Dame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years."" Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"". In response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly"" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would ""say that with more clarity a bit later on"". Everyone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice. On Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST. Pregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers. More than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab.

'Talk to me': A train driver asking men to open up,"As Scotland's only woman freight train driver, Heather Waugh was already a pioneer. Then a tragedy from her past inspired her to take on a new mission - getting men to talk about their mental health. When it was time to set off, Heather briskly pulled a handle towards her: ""Star Trek-style"", she said, deadpan, as though she were Mr Sulu putting the USS Enterprise into warp speed. But this wasn't a spaceship; it was a British Rail-vintage Class 90 locomotive. Its motors growled, then the train shuddered forward. Behind her, container wagons stretched down the line for three-quarters of a mile. It wasn't Heather's job to know what sort of cargo she was carrying, just how much it all weighed - tonight, a little under 1,500 tonnes - and whether it included anything hazardous. Her task was to drive the lot of it south through the valleys of lowland Scotland and beyond. In the cab, with her right hand on the power controller and her left on a train brake handle she was deep in concentration and looked, in spite of the clatter and din around her, entirely serene. Heather, 44,  drove passenger trains for 15 years before switching to Freightliner, her present employer, in 2019. And after so much practice in the rain and darkness, she could anticipate every gradient and curve of the line ahead. She knew how fast to approach each corner; when to apply the brakes and how long it would take before the wagons at the back would actually start to slow down. This was a job, she'd realised, that matched her temperament. She loved the camaraderie she shared in the mess hall with other drivers and train crew, the sense of the railway as one big family. But the solitude of the driver's cab suited her, too. When she went over to freight, her mother had mostly worried that Heather would be lonely, driving all by herself through the night. Here in the cab, though, Heather felt empowered and trusted. She liked the idea that here, it was just her and the train. Much as she loved rail, it was an industry where her gender set her apart. When she worked on passenger services, she'd been part of a very small minority; now, she was the only female freight driver north of the border. There'd been a time when she hadn't dwelt much on this. Back then, Heather thought equality was about being treated the same as male colleagues. But recently she'd learned it was about much more than that. From her window, Heather could see road traffic on M74. ""You're going alongside the motorway at times and looking at the lorry drivers, feeling quite smug,"" she said. She marvelled at the fact that her freight train could carry 76 times as much cargo as a single HGV. ""When you see a freight train passing by, it just looksphenomenal. So to know that you're the one that's actually responsible for thatâ¦"" She paused. ""It's a great feeling."" Inside the cab, the number of tasks to remember was endless. It wouldn't stop, either, when she slowed the train into a station and stepped out. If she met any of her male colleagues, or saw anyone standing around on the platform, she had a checklist to go through with them too. The railways had always been in Heather's blood. Her father, Neil, had worked on them for 45 years, as a guard and then a senior conductor at Edinburgh Waverley station. But it was her mother, Kathleen, who made her fall in love with trains. ""My dad had no sense of humour,"" Heather says, affectionately. ""He would come home each day, very staid: 'Oh my God, this happened today.'"" But Kathleen would draw out the funny side of all the stories he'd tell them about his work, and she and Heather would laugh uproariously. ""My mum's Glaswegian, so she has a great sense of humour."" The family lived in a flat in Niddrie, a housing scheme on the south side of the Scottish capital. Thanks to the free passes to which family members of British Rail staff were entitled, Heather's horizons were always much broader - the Highlands, the Fife coast, across the border into England. ""My mum would always take me to different places in Scotland, and I think that's where my love of the railway comes from,"" she says. The passes came in handy, too, when Heather discovered she had a love of football. She supported Rangers until her hero, the winger Davie Cooper, was transferred to Motherwell; Heather cried her eyes out, then started following his new team around the country each week instead. Cooper was deeply touched when found out about the little girl who had switched allegiances because of him - on matchdays, Heather recalls, he would give her and her mum a lift from Motherwell train station to the ground, and became a close friend of the family until his tragic death from a brain haemorrhage in 1995. Heather had discovered she had a talent for the game herself - in lunchtime kickabouts she'd be picked ahead of most of the boys. But in those days, girls weren't allowed to play for the primary school team. Kathleen didn't accept this. ""I remember my mum leaving one day to book ballet lessons for me and coming back with my first football boots instead, saying: 'My daughter will be whatever the hell she wants to be,'"" Heather recalls. Her mum found a women's club across the city. The first team was mostly made up of adult women, but Heather stood out as a central midfielder. When she was 11 she travelled with them to Italy to play in a tournament, which they won - on their return they were met by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and paraded through the city. After school she joined the Royal Mail and, by the age of 20, had risen to become the manager of 100 male postal workers. She was on the fast track to greater things, but after a decade with the Royal Mail she felt burnt out. Then she noticed a job advert - ScotRail were looking for train drivers. She knew it would be hugely competitive but she thought about the camaraderie her father, who had died the previous year, had enjoyed on the railways. She sent in her application. The process was ""like Pop Idol"", Heather says - thousands of applicants, written tests, waiting in a room for her name to be called out and told she'd made it to the next stage. Eventually she was told she'd landed the job. It took two years of intensive training to become a fully qualified train driver - first of all digesting the rulebook and safety procedures, and only after that learning to drive the train - ""or more specifically learning to drive the routes, because you do need to drive them blind,"" says Heather. ""The level of concentration is huge,"" she says. ""You can have 150 stations in a single shift - and if you think, 'What did I bring for my tea tonight?' you can miss the braking point for your next station."" Heather started work at a depot outside Glasgow. She loved the job immediately. There was the challenge and the satisfaction of the task itself. But there was also the bond that was formed with others doing the same, highly pressurised occupation. ""There are so many things that you can do wrong, and I think that's why there's such a bond between train drivers,"" Heather says. Lack of experience didn't count for much among her colleagues: a newly-qualified driver was expected to speak up and intervene if they saw one with years of experience do anything that was unsafe. ""They don't see that you've only been doing the job for two minutes and they don't see you as female - they just see you as a train driver."" Nonetheless, at her depot there were 106 other drivers, and only one of them other than Heather was female. ""I probably should have been more aware of my gender, but I suppose because of my background - because I had to play football with the boys at school, because I was at Royal Mail - this, unfortunately, was my normal, so I didn't question it,"" she says. Heather sat in the doctor's surgery. Everything was coloured in in neutral tones. There was a solitary window. She'd been a driver now for eight years, but she wasn't on duty at the moment. For the past month she'd been signed off from work. Heather told the doctor about the boy who'd used her train to end his life. She'd always known something like this could happen - drivers were warned about it in their training and would discuss it among themselves. According to Network Rail, 4.4% of suicides in Great Britain take place on the railways; there were 283 lives lost this way in 2019-20. But nothing could have prepared Heather for the reality of it actually happening to her. She talked about how numb she'd felt ever since it had happened. How guilt had gnawed at her. All the questions she kept asking herself - could she have reacted slightly quicker? Might she have done anything to save him? Heather told the doctor how horrific it seemed to her that anyone could do that - especially someone so young.

""Actually,"" the doctor said, ""You'd be surprised at the problems we see with men and boys."" He was talking about mental health. The doctor's answer saddened her, but having spent her entire career working in heavily male-dominated environments, Heather understood what he meant. ""Something I'd picked up on is that men don't talk about simple things,"" Heather says. ""It's not that men havemoreproblems than women, orworseproblems. We all have problems. But women deal with the smaller ones through talking."" Heather was signed off work for three months. Her employers supported her - she was sent for counselling and hypnotherapy. One of the things that helped her most was the support she received from colleagues. ""Big, hard, burly men, who don't show their emotions, rang me up to say: 'I've been through this too, I'm here for you,'"" she says. When she returned to her duties, she knew she wasn't quite the same person that she had been before. She was more irritable, less patient than she used to be. She couldn't watch television crime dramas or anything violent that might remind her of what she'd witnessed. ""A relationship that I'd been in for probably 19 or 20 years ultimately came to an end,"" she says. ""And I can now look back and recognise that part of that was as a result of me changing."" A few years later she saw another job advert, this time with Freightliner. Moving into freight was a greater technical and professional challenge; what's more, it offered a rota without weekend shifts. But the gender dynamics were even more stark. At ScotRail female drivers were a small minority, but there were also women guards and ticket examiners. ""Now I amentirelysurrounded by men,"" she says. Historically, freight had been widely regarded - inaccurately, Heather quickly discovered - as dirty, heavy, physically draining work, and the workplace was exclusively male as a result. ""In this day and age, you don't expect to be the only woman,"" she says. ""Even with my background, it was intimidating."" To her surprise, her new colleagues were overjoyed to have her on the team. They'd look forward to her being on shift - not because they wanted to chat her up, but because they could open up to her about their problems in a way they wouldn't with other men, Heather found. ""I've had conversations with colleagues where I know I'm the first person they've had that conversation with,"" Heather says. All this made her rethink her long-held idea that being treated equally in a male-dominated environment required her to keep her head down and not ask for any special treatment.  ""I realised that it's important that you don't shy away from being a woman,"" she says. ""Diversity is about bringing different energies into the room."" It also brought home to her once again the lack of opportunities men were given to talk about their mental health. She'd never stopped wondering about the boy that her passenger train had struck. ""I always think back to: Was that young boy showing signs? Could somebody have seen those signs?"" Sometimes she would visit the town he had grown up in. She'd see young men who would have been around his age and now had families of their own. It brought home to her again the terrible meaning of a young life lost. Then Heather learned of a course run by the Samaritans charity in partnership with Network Rail. It was called Managing Suicidal Contacts and was offered to all rail industry staff and British Transport Police officers - some 22,000 people had taken it since it was launched. Its purpose was to teach them to identify people on the railways - whether passengers, passers-by or fellow employees - who might be vulnerable to suicide, and then how to approach them. To Heather, it was a massive eye-opener. ""It's teaching staff to recognise what is out of the ordinary,"" she says. ""As human beings it's our job to go and take five minutes to speak to somebody and say, 'Are you OK?'"" she says. Since then, she says, ""I've approached people numerous times - you do become aware of when something isn't quite normal, there are danger signs you can see."" These include unusual body language, staring straight ahead or at the track, and standing somewhere on the platform where you wouldn't normally go if you were planning to board a train. It didn't take much to notice when she was getting through. ""Sometimes you'll be sitting having a chat with someone - a really basic chat - and you'll see the weight of the world lifted from them."" She'd think back to the boy who died, and wonder if talking could have helped him too. The evening light was fading as Heather approached Carlisle. She eased the locomotive alongside the platform until it came to a halt. The cargo would carry on towards the ports of the south of England. But Heather's shift was over. It was time to hand over to another driver. Afterwards, she'd make her way home to Airdrie in Lanarkshire. A few years ago her mum, who is now 80, moved in with her. Kathleen was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, but her sense of humour is very much intact. ""We still have  great laughs - she's still got a crazy Glaswegian sense of humour, absolutely loves that I'm on the railway. And that I come home with all these stories,"" Heather says. ""And she's got a photograph of me driving a freight train up on the mantelpiece, which she insists everyone who walks in the room takes a look at."" Before the journey home, Heather watched the freight train she'd driven leave the platform. It rumbled away from the station and into the night.

Coronavirus public inquiry to be held in spring 2022,"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson said the UK's Covid response would be ""placed under the microscope"" The government is ""fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage"" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"".

Boltonhas one of the highest instances of the Indian variantin the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s. Health officials in Glasgow have expressed concern abouta rising number of Covid cases in the city- the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. More than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths. The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year. ""A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter."" Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed an ""informal"" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published. The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"". She told the BBC: ""That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would. ""That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions."" Dame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years."" Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"". In response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly"" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would ""say that with more clarity a bit later on"". Everyone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice.

'Talk to me': A train driver asking men to open upA tragedy inspired Scotland's only woman freight train driver to get men talking about mental health.,"As Scotland's only woman freight train driver, Heather Waugh was already a pioneer. Then a tragedy from her past inspired her to take on a new mission - getting men to talk about their mental health. When it was time to set off, Heather briskly pulled a handle towards her: ""Star Trek-style"", she said, deadpan, as though she were Mr Sulu putting the USS Enterprise into warp speed. But this wasn't a spaceship; it was a British Rail-vintage Class 90 locomotive. Its motors growled, then the train shuddered forward. Behind her, container wagons stretched down the line for three-quarters of a mile. It wasn't Heather's job to know what sort of cargo she was carrying, just how much it all weighed - tonight, a little under 1,500 tonnes - and whether it included anything hazardous. Her task was to drive the lot of it south through the valleys of lowland Scotland and beyond. In the cab, with her right hand on the power controller and her left on a train brake handle she was deep in concentration and looked, in spite of the clatter and din around her, entirely serene. Heather, 44,  drove passenger trains for 15 years before switching to Freightliner, her present employer, in 2019. And after so much practice in the rain and darkness, she could anticipate every gradient and curve of the line ahead. She knew how fast to approach each corner; when to apply the brakes and how long it would take before the wagons at the back would actually start to slow down. This was a job, she'd realised, that matched her temperament. She loved the camaraderie she shared in the mess hall with other drivers and train crew, the sense of the railway as one big family. But the solitude of the driver's cab suited her, too. When she went over to freight, her mother had mostly worried that Heather would be lonely, driving all by herself through the night. Here in the cab, though, Heather felt empowered and trusted. She liked the idea that here, it was just her and the train. Much as she loved rail, it was an industry where her gender set her apart. When she worked on passenger services, she'd been part of a very small minority; now, she was the only female freight driver north of the border. There'd been a time when she hadn't dwelt much on this. Back then, Heather thought equality was about being treated the same as male colleagues. But recently she'd learned it was about much more than that. From her window, Heather could see road traffic on M74. ""You're going alongside the motorway at times and looking at the lorry drivers, feeling quite smug,"" she said. She marvelled at the fact that her freight train could carry 76 times as much cargo as a single HGV. ""When you see a freight train passing by, it just looksphenomenal. So to know that you're the one that's actually responsible for thatâ¦"" She paused. ""It's a great feeling."" Inside the cab, the number of tasks to remember was endless. It wouldn't stop, either, when she slowed the train into a station and stepped out. If she met any of her male colleagues, or saw anyone standing around on the platform, she had a checklist to go through with them too. The railways had always been in Heather's blood. Her father, Neil, had worked on them for 45 years, as a guard and then a senior conductor at Edinburgh Waverley station. But it was her mother, Kathleen, who made her fall in love with trains. ""My dad had no sense of humour,"" Heather says, affectionately. ""He would come home each day, very staid: 'Oh my God, this happened today.'"" But Kathleen would draw out the funny side of all the stories he'd tell them about his work, and she and Heather would laugh uproariously. ""My mum's Glaswegian, so she has a great sense of humour."" The family lived in a flat in Niddrie, a housing scheme on the south side of the Scottish capital. Thanks to the free passes to which family members of British Rail staff were entitled, Heather's horizons were always much broader - the Highlands, the Fife coast, across the border into England. ""My mum would always take me to different places in Scotland, and I think that's where my love of the railway comes from,"" she says. The passes came in handy, too, when Heather discovered she had a love of football. She supported Rangers until her hero, the winger Davie Cooper, was transferred to Motherwell; Heather cried her eyes out, then started following his new team around the country each week instead. Cooper was deeply touched when found out about the little girl who had switched allegiances because of him - on matchdays, Heather recalls, he would give her and her mum a lift from Motherwell train station to the ground, and became a close friend of the family until his tragic death from a brain haemorrhage in 1995. Heather had discovered she had a talent for the game herself - in lunchtime kickabouts she'd be picked ahead of most of the boys. But in those days, girls weren't allowed to play for the primary school team. Kathleen didn't accept this. ""I remember my mum leaving one day to book ballet lessons for me and coming back with my first football boots instead, saying: 'My daughter will be whatever the hell she wants to be,'"" Heather recalls. Her mum found a women's club across the city. The first team was mostly made up of adult women, but Heather stood out as a central midfielder. When she was 11 she travelled with them to Italy to play in a tournament, which they won - on their return they were met by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and paraded through the city. After school she joined the Royal Mail and, by the age of 20, had risen to become the manager of 100 male postal workers. She was on the fast track to greater things, but after a decade with the Royal Mail she felt burnt out. Then she noticed a job advert - ScotRail were looking for train drivers. She knew it would be hugely competitive but she thought about the camaraderie her father, who had died the previous year, had enjoyed on the railways. She sent in her application. The process was ""like Pop Idol"", Heather says - thousands of applicants, written tests, waiting in a room for her name to be called out and told she'd made it to the next stage. Eventually she was told she'd landed the job. It took two years of intensive training to become a fully qualified train driver - first of all digesting the rulebook and safety procedures, and only after that learning to drive the train - ""or more specifically learning to drive the routes, because you do need to drive them blind,"" says Heather. ""The level of concentration is huge,"" she says. ""You can have 150 stations in a single shift - and if you think, 'What did I bring for my tea tonight?' you can miss the braking point for your next station."" Heather started work at a depot outside Glasgow. She loved the job immediately. There was the challenge and the satisfaction of the task itself. But there was also the bond that was formed with others doing the same, highly pressurised occupation. ""There are so many things that you can do wrong, and I think that's why there's such a bond between train drivers,"" Heather says. Lack of experience didn't count for much among her colleagues: a newly-qualified driver was expected to speak up and intervene if they saw one with years of experience do anything that was unsafe. ""They don't see that you've only been doing the job for two minutes and they don't see you as female - they just see you as a train driver."" Nonetheless, at her depot there were 106 other drivers, and only one of them other than Heather was female. ""I probably should have been more aware of my gender, but I suppose because of my background - because I had to play football with the boys at school, because I was at Royal Mail - this, unfortunately, was my normal, so I didn't question it,"" she says. Heather sat in the doctor's surgery. Everything was coloured in in neutral tones. There was a solitary window. She'd been a driver now for eight years, but she wasn't on duty at the moment. For the past month she'd been signed off from work. Heather told the doctor about the boy who'd used her train to end his life. She'd always known something like this could happen - drivers were warned about it in their training and would discuss it among themselves. According to Network Rail, 4.4% of suicides in Great Britain take place on the railways; there were 283 lives lost this way in 2019-20. But nothing could have prepared Heather for the reality of it actually happening to her. She talked about how numb she'd felt ever since it had happened. How guilt had gnawed at her. All the questions she kept asking herself - could she have reacted slightly quicker? Might she have done anything to save him? Heather told the doctor how horrific it seemed to her that anyone could do that - especially someone so young.

BBC Action Linehas details of organisations offering information and support if you, or someone you know, has been affected by mental health issues. ""Actually,"" the doctor said, ""You'd be surprised at the problems we see with men and boys."" He was talking about mental health. The doctor's answer saddened her, but having spent her entire career working in heavily male-dominated environments, Heather understood what he meant. ""Something I'd picked up on is that men don't talk about simple things,"" Heather says. ""It's not that men havemoreproblems than women, orworseproblems. We all have problems. But women deal with the smaller ones through talking."" Heather was signed off work for three months. Her employers supported her - she was sent for counselling and hypnotherapy. One of the things that helped her most was the support she received from colleagues. ""Big, hard, burly men, who don't show their emotions, rang me up to say: 'I've been through this too, I'm here for you,'"" she says. When she returned to her duties, she knew she wasn't quite the same person that she had been before. She was more irritable, less patient than she used to be. She couldn't watch television crime dramas or anything violent that might remind her of what she'd witnessed. ""A relationship that I'd been in for probably 19 or 20 years ultimately came to an end,"" she says. ""And I can now look back and recognise that part of that was as a result of me changing."" A few years later she saw another job advert, this time with Freightliner. Moving into freight was a greater technical and professional challenge; what's more, it offered a rota without weekend shifts. But the gender dynamics were even more stark. At ScotRail female drivers were a small minority, but there were also women guards and ticket examiners. ""Now I amentirelysurrounded by men,"" she says. Historically, freight had been widely regarded - inaccurately, Heather quickly discovered - as dirty, heavy, physically draining work, and the workplace was exclusively male as a result. ""In this day and age, you don't expect to be the only woman,"" she says. ""Even with my background, it was intimidating."" To her surprise, her new colleagues were overjoyed to have her on the team. They'd look forward to her being on shift - not because they wanted to chat her up, but because they could open up to her about their problems in a way they wouldn't with other men, Heather found. ""I've had conversations with colleagues where I know I'm the first person they've had that conversation with,"" Heather says. All this made her rethink her long-held idea that being treated equally in a male-dominated environment required her to keep her head down and not ask for any special treatment.  ""I realised that it's important that you don't shy away from being a woman,"" she says. ""Diversity is about bringing different energies into the room."" It also brought home to her once again the lack of opportunities men were given to talk about their mental health. She'd never stopped wondering about the boy that her passenger train had struck. ""I always think back to: Was that young boy showing signs? Could somebody have seen those signs?"" Sometimes she would visit the town he had grown up in. She'd see young men who would have been around his age and now had families of their own. It brought home to her again the terrible meaning of a young life lost. Then Heather learned of a course run by the Samaritans charity in partnership with Network Rail. It was called Managing Suicidal Contacts and was offered to all rail industry staff and British Transport Police officers - some 22,000 people had taken it since it was launched. Its purpose was to teach them to identify people on the railways - whether passengers, passers-by or fellow employees - who might be vulnerable to suicide, and then how to approach them. To Heather, it was a massive eye-opener. ""It's teaching staff to recognise what is out of the ordinary,"" she says. ""As human beings it's our job to go and take five minutes to speak to somebody and say, 'Are you OK?'"" she says. Since then, she says, ""I've approached people numerous times - you do become aware of when something isn't quite normal, there are danger signs you can see."" These include unusual body language, staring straight ahead or at the track, and standing somewhere on the platform where you wouldn't normally go if you were planning to board a train. It didn't take much to notice when she was getting through. ""Sometimes you'll be sitting having a chat with someone - a really basic chat - and you'll see the weight of the world lifted from them."" She'd think back to the boy who died, and wonder if talking could have helped him too. The evening light was fading as Heather approached Carlisle. She eased the locomotive alongside the platform until it came to a halt. The cargo would carry on towards the ports of the south of England. But Heather's shift was over. It was time to hand over to another driver. Afterwards, she'd make her way home to Airdrie in Lanarkshire. A few years ago her mum, who is now 80, moved in with her. Kathleen was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, but her sense of humour is very much intact. ""We still have  great laughs - she's still got a crazy Glaswegian sense of humour, absolutely loves that I'm on the railway. And that I come home with all these stories,"" Heather says. ""And she's got a photograph of me driving a freight train up on the mantelpiece, which she insists everyone who walks in the room takes a look at."" Before the journey home, Heather watched the freight train she'd driven leave the platform. It rumbled away from the station and into the night.

"Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, report saysAn independent review calls the international response to the pandemic a ""toxic cocktail"".WorldComments","Crematoriums were overwhelmed in India in recent weeks amid a devastating Covid wave The Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, an independent review panel has said. The panel, set up by the World Health Organization, said the combined response of the WHO and global governments was a ""toxic cocktail"". The WHO should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, its report said, adding that without urgent change the world was vulnerable to another major disease outbreak. More than 3.3 million people around the world have now died of Covid. While the US and Europe are beginning to ease restrictions and resume some aspects of pre-pandemic life, the virus is still devastating parts of Asia. India in particular is seeing record-breaking numbers of new cases and deaths, with severe oxygen shortages in hospitals across the country. Countries neighbouring India, such as Nepal, are also seeing surges of the virus. Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic,,externalwas compiled by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Its aim was to find answers as to how the virus had killed more than 3.3 million people and infected more than 159 million. ""The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented,"" co-chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, told reporters. ""It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response."" Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country WHO says India Covid variant of 'global concern' The panel argued that the WHO's Emergency Committee should have declared the outbreak in China an international emergency a week earlier than it did. It should have done so at its first meeting on 22 January last year, the report said, instead of waiting until 30 January. The month following the WHO's declaration was ""lost"" as countries failed to take appropriate measures to halt the spread of the virus. The WHO was then hindered by its own regulations that travel restrictions should be a last resort, the panel said, adding that Europe and the US wasted the entire month of February and acted only when their hospitals began to fill up. This video can not be played Are pandemics the new normal? When countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report said. To prevent another catastrophic pandemic, the report suggests key reforms: A new global threats council should be created with the power to hold countries accountable There should be a disease surveillance system to publish information without the approval of countries concerned Vaccines must be classed as public goods and there should be a pandemic financing facility There was an immediate request for the wealthy G7 nations to commit $1.9bn (Â£1.3bn) to the WHO's Covax programme providing vaccine support to low income countries Panel co-chair and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was ""critical to have an empowered WHO"". ""If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease and that remains the same today,"" she added. The most eye-catching line of this report is that the pandemic was the 21st Century's ""Chernobyl moment"" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. The panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. After the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of ""never again"". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first? The panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand. There are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth. The most fundamental one remains our relationship with the animal world to stop viruses jumping to humans in the first place.

Facebook moderator: âEvery day was a nightmareâ,"Isabella Plunkett has spoken out about her experience as a Facebook content moderator A Facebook moderator has for the first time given evidence revealing the mental toll of the job, to a parliamentary committee. The Irish parliament heard how moderators viewed graphic content up to eight hours a day. Law firm Foxglove and the Communication Workers Union, representing moderators, called for better psychological support and freedom to speak out. Facebook said it provides 24 hours support to staff. Isabella Plunkett has worked as a Facebook content moderator for just over two years, and still works there. Her job is to review posts on the platform - which can contain graphic violence, exploitation, extremism, abuse and suicide. The 26-year-old says she could not speak to her friends or family about the things she saw at work due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) which she had signed at the beginning of her contract. Members of Ireland's Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, commended her bravery in speaking out. Isabella Plunkett gives evidence at the Irish committee âI'm here speaking out and I don't actually necessarily know in detail what I'm legally allowed to say and not to say,â she said. âIt was always clear we couldn't speak about our job, we couldn't speak about our job to friends, family... and it's definitely a workplace with a sense of secrecy.â Facebook told the BBC that NDAs are standard practice and that reviewers can discuss any aspect of their job with doctors and counsellors. Staff can discuss the general challenges and rewards of their jobs with family and loved ones, but not specific details of the content they are reviewing. âIâve done the job for two years and I donât think I could do it for much longer because of the strain it does cause to your mental health,â Isabella told the BBC. âIt's not like a normal job where you can go to work and go home and forget about it - the stuff youâre seeing is really ingrained in your mind.ââ Isabella processes around 100 ""tickets"" a day - these can be videos, images or text posts on the platform. She said they often contain graphic violence, suicide, exploitation and abuse. She works for Covalen, one of Facebookâs largest contractors in Ireland. Isabella claims she was not allowed to work from home, unlike her counterparts who were employed directly by Facebook who did the same job. As a result, she says she is exposed to more graphic content, because she is in the office. âThe high priority queues - the graphic violence, the child stuff, the exploitation and the suicides, people working from home donât get that - the burden is put on us.â Despite having family shielding at home, she was told to come into the office and developed anxiety, for which she now takes antidepressants. âEvery day was a nightmare,â she said, adding that the support given was âinsufficient.â Facebook says psychological help is available to all its moderators 24 hours a day, but Isabella claims its wellness coaches are not qualified psychiatrists. âI was seeing the wellness team but didnât feel I got the support I needed. I canât say I left work feeling relieved or knowing I could go home and have a good night's sleep - thatâs not possible,â she added. âIt would follow me home. I could just be watching TV at home and think back to one of the horrible, really graphic tickets.â This video can not be played Meet people who review Facebook's reported content Sub-contracted staff are given 1.5 hours of ""wellness"" time a week, she says, which can be used for speaking to a wellness coach, going for walks or taking time out when feeling overwhelmed. âItâs not enough. Iâm now seeing the content I view in work in my dreams. I remember it, I experience it again and it is horrible. âYou never know what is going to come next and you have to watch it the full way through because they might have violators.â Some Facebook moderators are asked to sign a disclaimer before starting work, accepting that the content seen in their jobs could lead to poor mental health and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). An example of the contract, read out in the committee said: âI understand that exposure to this content may give me post traumatic stress disorder. ""I will engage in a mandatory wellness coaching session but I understand that those are not conditions and may not be sufficient to prevent my contracting PTSD.â A Facebook spokeswoman said: ""Everyone who reviews content for Facebook goes through an in-depth training programme on Facebook's Community Standards and has access to psychological support to ensure their wellbeing. âWe are committed to working with our partners to provide support for our content reviewers as we recognise that reviewing certain types of content can sometimes be hard,"" she added. ""In Ireland, this includes 24/7 on-site support with trained practitioners, an on-call service, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment. ""We are also employing technical solutions to limit their exposure to potentially graphic material as much as possible. This is an important issue, and we are committed to getting this right.â Facebook uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and human moderators to review content. In future, it hopes to reduce the number of human moderators through machine learning. But Isabella said this was a Facebook ""fantasy"", that systems were ânot even near that stageâ. Speaking to the committee, Isabella said âpeople are intimidatedâ by the NDA process and afraid of losing their jobs. She cited an internal communications platform on Facebook, in which workers' posts were deleted when speaking up. Facebook denied these claims and said no disciplinary action is taken for employees raising concerns. âPeople complained about the treatment and what was going on and how they felt unsafe,â Isabella told the committee. âIt was clear that it was being censored because people's comments were being deleted, accounts were being disabled."" She said her experience drove her to give evidence: âI just had such a feeling that I needed to do it,â she added in her testimony. âI need to speak for the people that are too afraid, that feel they have too many responsibilities, and they can't afford to take any risks.""

County Court judgment against Boris Johnson,"Downing Street is seeking to cancel a county court judgement against Prime Minister Boris Johnson that cites an unpaid bill of Â£535. The order was made against Mr Johnson, of 10 Downing Street, on 26 October, according to a judgement database. The creditor and nature of the debt, which was first reported by Private Eye magazine, is not yet known. A Downing Street spokesperson said the claim against the PM was without merit. ""An application will be made for an order to set aside the default judgement, to strike out the claim and for a declaration that the claim is totally without merit,"" the spokesperson added. Watchdog to investigate PM's flat renovations What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The BBC understands the case relates to a defamation claim against Mr Johnson. County court judgements,externalare issued in England and Wales when people fail to repay money they owe. ""If you get a judgement, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money,"" according to a government website. A bailiff ""may visit your home if you do not pay your debts"",the website warns,external. Banks and loan companies can also use the information to decide whether to issue credit or loans. ""If you're late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs,"" the website adds. Anyone who has had a county court judgement (CCJ) against them can apply for it to be cancelled - or ""set aside"" in the legal language - but they must convince the court that there is a good reason for this to happen and they have also acted promptly in launching their challenge. That could include the judgement having been issued in error - perhaps because the debt had actually been paid, or because there was never a debt in the first place. Sometimes, people seek to have a CCJ cancelled because they genuinely did not know about it - or they can show the court that it has acted incorrectly in making the order. That can happen when the court has been provided with the wrong address for a debtor who only later learns of the judgement when they discover it has damaged their credit score. The official rules for applications to set aside a judgement state: ""Most applications will require a hearing and you will be expected to attend. The court will allocate a hearing date and time for the application. Please indicate in a covering letter any dates that you are unavailable within the next six weeks."" The application must come with some kind of ""statement of truth"", explaining why the judgement should be set aside. The prime minister could instruct a lawyer to appear for him. Applicants can also ask the court to consider waiving the Â£100 fee if it would cause them ""undue hardship"". The prime minister's personal finances have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. In particular, he has faced questions about how renovations to the flat, above 11 Downing Street, that he shares with fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds were paid for. He has insisted he personally paid for the work, but has declined to say whether he received an initial loan. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and whether any donation to the Conservative Party was properly declared. Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said the court judgement had nothing to do with the Downing Street estate refurbishment, saying: ""All bills have been paid by the government or the prime minister, personally."" Asked if Number 10 had only become aware of the judgement when it was first reported earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman said it was something they are ""looking into currently"". And on being asked whether there should be concerns about the prime minister's personal finances, Mr Johnson's press secretary said: ""You should not be concerned, no.""

UK economy picks up as lockdown restrictions ease,"The UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of 2021, but gathered speed in March as lockdown restrictions began to ease, official figures show. The reopening of schools and strong retail spending helped the economy grow 2.1% in March, its fastest monthly growth since last August. But the economy is still 8.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic. However, March marked a possible turning point, economists suggested. Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, predicted the UK economy was now on course for a bumper bounce-back this year. ""The first quarter should mark the low point for the economy in 2021,"" said Mr Parikh. ""The lockdown, and added costs of navigating new trading terms with the EU, limited many businesses' trading activities at the start of the year."" The UK economy suffered arecord annual slump in 2020as coronavirus restrictions hit output and 2021 started off equally downbeat. The reintroduction of restrictions in January led to a fall in business investment and household consumption expenditure, according to the ONS. However, schools reopening on 8 March triggered an uplift in retail sales and sectors such as construction and manufacturing remained resilient, growing strongly in March. Businesses also continued to adapt and make themselves Covid secure. The vaccine rollout, the extension of support measures at the Budget, and the roadmap to reopen the economy have led to expectations that the UK economy will rebound strongly this year. But there are concerns about long term damage. Surenâ¯Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The first quarter decline should be followed by a robust rebound in the second quarter as the effects of the release of pent-up demand, as restrictions ease and the strong vaccine rollout, are fully felt. ""However, with the longer-term economic damage caused by coronavirus likely to increasingly weigh on activity as government support winds down, the recovery may be slower than many, including the Bank of England, currently predict.""â¯ What is GDP and why does it matter? UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 years Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said that households and businesses have adapted better to working and living under Covid restrictions ""despite the brutal cost of doing so"". But Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs pointed out that the UK's economic growth was still the slowest of the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries, for the fourth quarter in a row. GDP looks on course to grow by 5% between April and June ""which should mean that the UK finally hands over the wooden spoon to another G7 economy"", he added. On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the the BBC the economy was ""getting back on track"". ""Despite a difficult start to this year, economic growth in March is a promising sign of things to come,"" he added. Earlier this month,the Bank of England saidit expected the UK economy to enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years this year, as restrictions are lifted. But it cut its forecast for 2022 from 7.25% to 5.75%, suggesting the government was likely to raise taxes to pay for its huge pandemic-support programmes. Official trade figures, published at the same time as growth figures, showed a shift away from trading with EU countries since Brexit. ""Imports from Europe remained sluggish in the first three months of the year, being outstripped by non-EU imports for the first time on record,"" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan. New Brexit trading rules between the EU and the UK came into effect at the beginning of January. In the January to March quarter, the UK's exports to the EU fell 18.1% to Â£32.2bn, while exports to non-EU countries rose by 0.4% to Â£41.1bn, compared with the previous quarter. The value of imports from the EU fell by 21.7% to Â£50.6bn, and imports from non-EU countries fell by 0.9% to Â£53.2bn. The ONS said the UK's total trade deficit, excluding precious metals, narrowed by Â£8.4bn to Â£1.4bn. Mr Sunak told the BBC the government has invested ""hundreds of millions of pounds to help businesses adjust to those new trading arrangements and support them in the process"". ""We've always said there will be a period of adjustment and that's what you're seeing,"" he added. In ordinary times a 1.5% quarterly hit would be considered a considerable economic fall. In context of a further national shutdown, it shows some resilience in the UK economy. Businesses, particularly manufacturing and construction, were beginning to work out how to cope with pandemic restrictions. The good news is that by the end of the quarter the rebound was starting. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is not getting carried away with euphoria about the fastest growth in decades. The Treasury is well aware that this is mostly the arithmetic consequence of the bounce back from a sharp hit in 2020. The ONS showed that the economic hole in the UK caused by the pandemic still does not compare favourably with other major economies, with the US, for example, having recovered all lost output. Mr Sunak points to the much better than expected unemployment figures as the result of the furlough scheme. There is still uncertainty about how the global economy will respond to new waves of the pandemic. The chancellor is not changing the plan for tax rises on business.

Cats must be microchipped under animal care plan,"Around 70% of cats are microchipped, while for dogs - where it is compulsory - the figure is over 90% Microchipping pet cats will become compulsory under a wide-ranging new animal welfare plan. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the policy would be monitored by vets and enforced in the same way as it is for dogs, which he said has led to over 90% compliance. The plan will also formally recognise the sentience of many animals. But Mr Eustice said this measure was aimed at pets and livestock, rather than wild animals. The government's Action Plan for Animal Welfare also includes measures to ban exporting live animals for slaughter, the keeping of primates as pets and importing hunting trophies. There may also be changes to the ways that animals can be confined - such as the practice of keeping them in cages. However, there is no plan to require imports to meet the same welfare standards as in the UK, which the National Farmers' Union (NFU) described as ""hypocrisy"". The plan will also see remote-controlled training collars for dogs outlawed and the government says it will look at banning the sale of foie gras - a food made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese. UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Missing cat reunited with owner after 13 years Zoo animals 'at risk' in lockdown Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Eustice said that compulsory microchipping for cats would resemble the current rules for dogs, where vets advise pet owners whose animals do not have a microchip to get one, and ""if they ignore it, there is an enforcement process"". Dog owners can be fined Â£500 under the existing law. Lianna Angliss at Hopefield Animal Sanctuary said that as well as helping to reunite lost cats with their owners, compulsory microchipping could help animal sanctuaries trace people who abandon their pets. The environment secretary also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the recognition of animal sentience would give the UK an equivalent to a declaration that already applies in the European Union. Clyde was reunited with his owners six years after they moved house - thanks to his microchip It will enshrine in law that animals have the capacity to feel hunger and pain, and are aware of what is happening to them. It will apply to vertebrates, but not to animals such as octopus and squid. Mr Eustice said there would be an expert animal sentience committee which would advise on policy. But asked if it would affect hunting, fishing or road-building projects which might disturb habitats, he said the recognition of animal sentience was ""much more applicable"" to pets and livestock than wildlife. Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society, said recognising animal sentience was a key part of ""probably the biggest new set of commitments on animal welfare for decades"". The plan includes legislation in a number of bills set to be approved in the coming months. These include the Kept Animals Bill, the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill and the Animals Abroad Bill. These will expand on the protections in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Legislation to restrict the use of glue traps, designed to capture rats and mice, will also be supported. Reacting to the news that owners will have to get their cats microchipped, Jacqui Cuff, head of advocacy and government relations for Cats Protection, said she was ""delighted"". In France, geese are force-fed to produce foie gras, which is made from their distended livers. ""We had the dog microchipping regulation passed in 2016, so we've been waiting a long time. There are around 2.6 million unchipped pet cats in the UK; that's a lot of cats wandering around with no permanent identification,"" she said. Cat theft reportedly increased by more than 12% over the last year, and only around 70% of owned cats are chipped at the moment. Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: ""These announcements will make a real and lasting difference to animals' welfare, so we're pleased the government is committed to improving animals' lives in the UK and abroad. We can no longer ignore the inextricable link that exists between the way we treat animals, our own health and that of the planet - but to really achieve a step change, it will take courage from right across government. ""We urge the government to put animal welfare at the heart of policy making and make these announcements just the beginning of an evolving, holistic animal health and welfare strategy."" With regard to farmed animals, live exports for fattening and slaughter will be banned. This is only possible because the UK has left the EU. The caging of poultry and the practice of restricting the movement of pregnant and suckling pigs will also be examined. In 2012 Thanet council suspended live exports from Ramsgate after an incident in which 45 sheep died Sows can legally be kept in a ""farrowing crate"" for up to five weeks. These crates are of a size that prevents the sow from turning around and potentially crushing her new-born piglets. However, preventing sows from engaging in normal behaviour can cause them to become stressed. There is, however, no legal guarantee that food from animals reared abroad will have been produced to high animal-welfare standards. Last year, ministers controversiallyvoted againsta House of Lords amendment which would have blocked imports that didn't meet welfare and food safety standards in the UK. It will now depend on post-Brexit trade deals with countries such as the US, where cows are routinely treated with hormones and chickens are washed with chlorine - which is illegal here. The deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, Stuart Roberts, said it was ""ridiculous"" if high standards weren't applied to imports as well. ""We have some of highest standards for animal welfare in the world. It's good that the government have that same ambition,"" he said. There are concerns imports won't meet existing farm standards ""But at the moment we are negotiating a trade deal with Australia, where you can have journey times for animals in excess of 24 hours without access to food or water. We cannot increase standards here, and at the same time not apply the same criteria to imports, it's just hypocrisy."" Mr Eustice said the UK could use tariffs on imported produce to uphold its standards and could also impose a ban on the sale of imported food which relied on practices banned domestically - such as foie gras. Other measures in the plan include banning the advertisement of ""unacceptable low-welfare animal practices abroad"" such as elephant rides, along with prohibiting the export of ""detached shark fins"". The Ivory Act, banning the sale of ivory, will also be implemented. There will also be new laws to ""crack down on illegal hare coursing,"" and police will be given more powers to protect farm animals from dangerous or out-of-control dogs.

Renters seize on lower costs to live in UK cities,"Tenants are showing signs of returning to major cities to take advantage of rents that were lowered during lockdown, a report suggests. Work and leisure restrictions, as well as younger adults returning to live with their families, meant demand dropped in the last year. This in turn led to rent falls, including a drop of 9.4% in London, according to property portal Zoopla. But, since Easter, it said demand had picked up. There was a two-speed rental market over the last year, according to the Zoopla figures. Outside London, rents rose by 3% in the year to the end of March. However, the cost of renting in some of the UK's big cities fell. In Edinburgh, it dropped by 3.2% and in Manchester it was down by 1%. In London, the drop was particularly pronounced. This meant average rents accounted for 42% of an average single earner income in London, down from 49% in March last year. That was considerably lower than the peak of 53% in late 2016. London still remained a comparatively expensive place to rent a home. The national average sees rent take up 31% of a single earner's income. Demand among renters for city properties is starting to rise significantly again, the report suggests, with tenants looking out for particular characteristics in the light of Covid. 'Fear of missing out' fuels record house prices How Covid has changed where we want to live Private outdoor space is a priority. The proportion of renters searching for properties with gardens had doubled since last year, the report said. GrÃ¡inne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, said the availability of mortgages for people only able to offer a low deposit meant some were keen to buy a first home rather than rent, but this would be limited by economic uncertainty. ""The opening up of the economy and the slow return to business as usual as the vaccine rolls out means [rental] demand will continue to build over the summer as more people move to rent their first property - although, as ever, this will be dependent on the economy opening up in line with the planned timetable,"" she said.

"Coronavirus public inquiry to be held in spring 2022""We are fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage of this crisis,"" Boris Johnson says.UK","This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson said the UK's Covid response would be ""placed under the microscope"" The government is ""fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage"" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"". What is the Covid inquiry and how will it work? What's changing in England, Scotland and Wales? Town's Covid surge leaves hospitality nervous On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale He said the ""new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here"". ""Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January."" Boltonhas one of the highest instances of the Indian variantin the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s. Health officials in Glasgow have expressed concern abouta rising number of Covid cases in the city- the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. More than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths. The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year. ""A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter."" Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed an ""informal"" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published. The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"". She told the BBC: ""That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would. ""That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions."" Dame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years."" Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"". In response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly"" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would ""say that with more clarity a bit later on"". Everyone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice. On Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST. Pregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers. More than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab.

Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic.

The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"".

Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"".

"Coronavirus public inquiry to be held in spring 2022""We are fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage of this crisis,"" Boris Johnson says.UKMajor study into long Covid launched in ScotlandEvery adult who tested positive for the virus will be asked to tell researchers how it affected their life.Scotland","This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson said the UK's Covid response would be ""placed under the microscope"" The government is ""fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage"" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"". What is the Covid inquiry and how will it work? What's changing in England, Scotland and Wales? Town's Covid surge leaves hospitality nervous On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale He said the ""new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here"". ""Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January."" Boltonhas one of the highest instances of the Indian variantin the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s. Health officials in Glasgow have expressed concern abouta rising number of Covid cases in the city- the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. More than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths. The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year.

Serious failures in global Covid response - report,"Crematoriums were overwhelmed in India in recent weeks amid a devastating Covid wave The Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, an independent review panel has said. The panel, set up by the World Health Organization, said the combined response of the WHO and global governments was a ""toxic cocktail"". The WHO should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, its report said, adding that without urgent change the world was vulnerable to another major disease outbreak. More than 3.3 million people around the world have now died of Covid. While the US and Europe are beginning to ease restrictions and resume some aspects of pre-pandemic life, the virus is still devastating parts of Asia. India in particular is seeing record-breaking numbers of new cases and deaths, with severe oxygen shortages in hospitals across the country. Countries neighbouring India, such as Nepal, are also seeing surges of the virus. Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic,,externalwas compiled by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Its aim was to find answers as to how the virus had killed more than 3.3 million people and infected more than 159 million. ""The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented,"" co-chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, told reporters. ""It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response."" Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country WHO says India Covid variant of 'global concern' The panel argued that the WHO's Emergency Committee should have declared the outbreak in China an international emergency a week earlier than it did. It should have done so at its first meeting on 22 January last year, the report said, instead of waiting until 30 January. The month following the WHO's declaration was ""lost"" as countries failed to take appropriate measures to halt the spread of the virus. The WHO was then hindered by its own regulations that travel restrictions should be a last resort, the panel said, adding that Europe and the US wasted the entire month of February and acted only when their hospitals began to fill up. This video can not be played Are pandemics the new normal? When countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report said. To prevent another catastrophic pandemic, the report suggests key reforms: A new global threats council should be created with the power to hold countries accountable There should be a disease surveillance system to publish information without the approval of countries concerned Vaccines must be classed as public goods and there should be a pandemic financing facility There was an immediate request for the wealthy G7 nations to commit $1.9bn (Â£1.3bn) to the WHO's Covax programme providing vaccine support to low income countries Panel co-chair and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was ""critical to have an empowered WHO"". ""If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease and that remains the same today,"" she added. The most eye-catching line of this report is that the pandemic was the 21st Century's ""Chernobyl moment"" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. The panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. After the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of ""never again"". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first? The panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand. There are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth. The most fundamental one remains our relationship with the animal world to stop viruses jumping to humans in the first place.

County court judgement against Boris Johnson,"Downing Street is seeking to cancel a county court judgement against Prime Minister Boris Johnson that cites an unpaid bill of Â£535. The order was made against Mr Johnson, of 10 Downing Street, on 26 October, according to a judgement database. The creditor and nature of the debt, which was first reported by Private Eye magazine, is not yet known. A Downing Street spokesperson said the claim against the PM was without merit. ""An application will be made for an order to set aside the default judgement, to strike out the claim and for a declaration that the claim is totally without merit,"" the spokesperson added. Watchdog to investigate PM's flat renovations What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The BBC understands the case relates to a defamation claim against Mr Johnson. County court judgements,externalare issued in England and Wales when people fail to repay money they owe. ""If you get a judgement, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money,"" according to a government website. A bailiff ""may visit your home if you do not pay your debts"",the website warns,external. Banks and loan companies can also use the information to decide whether to issue credit or loans. ""If you're late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs,"" the website adds. Anyone who has had a county court judgement (CCJ) against them can apply for it to be cancelled - or ""set aside"" in the legal language - but they must convince the court that there is a good reason for this to happen and they have also acted promptly in launching their challenge. That could include the judgement having been issued in error - perhaps because the debt had actually been paid, or because there was never a debt in the first place. Sometimes, people seek to have a CCJ cancelled because they genuinely did not know about it - or they can show the court that it has acted incorrectly in making the order. That can happen when the court has been provided with the wrong address for a debtor who only later learns of the judgement when they discover it has damaged their credit score. The official rules for applications to set aside a judgement state: ""Most applications will require a hearing and you will be expected to attend. The court will allocate a hearing date and time for the application. Please indicate in a covering letter any dates that you are unavailable within the next six weeks."" The application must come with some kind of ""statement of truth"", explaining why the judgement should be set aside. The prime minister could instruct a lawyer to appear for him. Applicants can also ask the court to consider waiving the Â£100 fee if it would cause them ""undue hardship"". The prime minister's personal finances have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. In particular, he has faced questions about how renovations to the flat, above 11 Downing Street, that he shares with fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds were paid for. He has insisted he personally paid for the work, but has declined to say whether he received an initial loan. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and whether any donation to the Conservative Party was properly declared. Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said the court judgement had nothing to do with the Downing Street estate refurbishment, saying: ""All bills have been paid by the government or the prime minister, personally."" Asked if Number 10 had only become aware of the judgement when it was first reported earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman said it was something they are ""looking into currently"". And on being asked whether there should be concerns about the prime minister's personal finances, Mr Johnson's press secretary said: ""You should not be concerned, no.""

Government lays out plans to protect users online,"The Online Safety Bill is designed to protect children and adults Social media firms will have to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines under new legislation. The government's Online Safety Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech, comes with a promise of protecting debate. It is ""especially"" geared at keeping children safe and says ""democratically important"" content should be preserved. But campaigners say the plans will lead to censorship, while others warn fines do not go far enough. Online harms bill: Warning over unacceptable delay Online harms law to let regulator block apps in the UK The draft legislation, previously known as the Online Harms Bill, has been two years in the making. It covers a huge range of content to which children might fall victim - including grooming, revenge porn, hate speech, images of child abuse and posts relating to suicide and eating disorders. But it goes much further, taking in terrorism, disinformation, racist abuse and pornography, too. Late additions to the bill include provisions to tackle online scams, such as romance fraud and fake investment opportunities. It will not include fraud via advertising, emails or cloned websites. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the ""ground-breaking laws"" would usher in ""a new age of accountability for tech"". And Home Secretary Priti Patel added the scam provisions would help fight ""ruthless criminals who defraud millions of people"". New details published about the government's Online Safety Bill again emphasise its commitments to enforce social media sites to better protect users from online harm. That includes child sexual exploitation, racist abuse, terrorism - and harmful disinformation on social media. I've spent the past year investigating the very real-world harm myths and conspiracy theories shared online - about the pandemic, vaccines, and elections - can cause offline. Under the proposals, social media sites will be required to act on harmful content like this - even when legal. Otherwise, they'll find themselves at risk of fines or even criminal action from regulator Ofcom. The line between free speech and harm posed by misleading posts online has been a tricky one to tread for tech companies - and with a nod to the on-going debate, the bill highlights the importance of freedom of expression on social media. While more concrete plans will be welcomed by critics of the social media giants, the government has come under fire for repeated delays to this legislation. But those who I've interviewed - who have already been impacted by online conspiracies - would argue this comes too late to protect them and their loved ones. The government has added a new duty of care for social-media sites to protect content defined as ""democratically important"". This includes content promoting or opposing government policy or a political party ahead of a vote, election or referendum. Context will also need to be taken into account when moderating political content. While content on news publishers' websites is not part of the legislation, articles shared on social media are. Social-media firms should offer a fast-track appeals process if journalistic content is removed, both from professional and ""citizen"" journalists, it says. But campaigners remain unhappy. Ruth Smeeth, the chief executive of the Index on Censorship who has personal experience of online abuse, described the bill as a ""censor's charter... outsourced to Silicon Valley"". The former Labour MP added that ""targeting the platforms rather than the perpetrators of hate seems a strange proposed solution"". Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, warned the idea that speech was ""inherently harmful"" and needed to be controlled by private companies was ""very dangerous"". The government said companies would need to ""put in place safeguards for freedom of expression"" and have effective routes for users to appeal. Users will also be able to appeal directly to Ofcom. Ofcom will issue codes of practice outlining the systems and processes that companies need to adopt in order to be compliant. The government has already published codes on terrorism and child sexual exploitation because of their serious nature. The largest and most popular social-media sites - described as category-one services - will need to state explicitly in their terms and conditions how they will address so-called legal harms. Ofcom will be able to issue fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of global turnover, whichever is higher, if firms fail to comply with the new rules. It will also have the power to block access to sites in the UK, the government said. The death of Molly Russell prompted calls for tougher rules to be imposed on online services used by teenagers Some campaigners do not think so. Tech entrepreneur Belinda Parmar said: ""The ambition is great. The regulator is going to have teeth, but no codes of practice for non-legal harms have yet been published, and it is all very vague."" Others have said fines do not go far enough, including the NSPCC which has called for the senior managers of tech firms to be made criminally liable for harmful content. Labour called the proposals ""watered down and incomplete"" and said the new rules would do ""very little"" to ensure children are safe online. The government has reserved the powers for Ofcom to pursue criminal action ""if tech companies fail to live up to their new responsibilities"". A review will take place two years after the new regime is operational. Ian Russell, father of Molly, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing thousands of posts about suicide and self-harm on social media, said he hoped the new law would ""focus the minds of the tech platforms"" to change their corporate culture and to reduce online harms. There has been frustration that the legislation, first conceived by Theresa May's government back in April 2019, has taken a long time to come to fruition. The bill will now be examined by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, whose chairman, Julian Knight, said it would be pressing for the legislation ""to be given top priority"".

"Breaking|Breaking newsPM announces coronavirus public inquiryThere will be an independent public inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms to MPsUK","This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson said the UK's Covid response would be ""placed under the microscope"" The government is ""fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage"" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"". What is the Covid inquiry and how will it work? What's changing in England, Scotland and Wales? Town's Covid surge leaves hospitality nervous On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale He said the ""new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here"". ""Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January."" Boltonhas one of the highest instances of the Indian variantin the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s. Health officials in Glasgow have expressed concern abouta rising number of Covid cases in the city- the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. More than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths. The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year. ""A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter."" Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed an ""informal"" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published. The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"". She told the BBC: ""That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would. ""That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions."" Dame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years."" Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"". In response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly"" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would ""say that with more clarity a bit later on"". Everyone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice. On Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST. Pregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers. More than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab.

The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year. ""A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter."" Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed an ""informal"" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published. The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"". She told the BBC: ""That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would. ""That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions."" Dame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years."" Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"". In response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly"" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would ""say that with more clarity a bit later on"". Everyone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice. On Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST. Pregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers. More than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab.

He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"".

Bye for now from Becky Morton, Claire Heald, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Robert Greenall, who've brought you today's updates. And here's a recap of the main stories around the world today: We are going to be bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's events in the UK:  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has arrived at Westminster Abbey for a service to honour the contribution of nurses during the pandemic. The service, which takes place annually to mark Florence Nightingale's birthday on 12 May - now known as International Nurses' Day - is this year recognising the sacrifice of nurses and midwives since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the UK. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is a relative of Nightingale, are also at the service. Earlier, the Duchess of Cornwall met nurses, patients and staff on a visit to the Whittington Hospital, in London. Exams in Scotland have been cancelled as the Covid-19 pandemic forced pupils into extended periods of learning from home, but the alternative arrangements are ""exams in all but name"", Labour's education spokesman has said. Michael Marra has written to Education Secretary John Swinney calling for greater clarity in the system, claiming there is inconsistency in this year's process, a lack of planning and a lack of information about appeals. He wrote: ""Lessons must be learned from last year's unfair appeals process, where young people had no ability to have their teacher estimate scrutinised, even where they felt evidence existed."" He went on: ""Young people in Scotland are right now sitting exams in all but name, they need clarity and certainty about the process they are undertaking."" Some pupils told the BBC they were at ""breaking point"" over school assessments. More than 4,000 people have died so far in Nepal with cases rising While much of the world's attention in recent weeks has been focused on India's Covid plight, its small northern neighbour Nepal has been facing its own crisis. The Himalayan nation of about 30 million people is one of the least developed countries in the world, and it relies on India for supplies of medical equipment and oxygen. And as India stops exports, Nepal is struggling to find alternatives. Meanwhile nearly one in two of its citizens are testing positive for the virus. More than 4,000 people have died and many more deaths are expected. Read more here from the BBC's Ambarasan Ethirajan on the tragedy of Nepal's second wave. England play Scotland at Wembley Stadium on 18 June Key workers have been offered exclusive access to watch the Uefa Euro 2020 matches in London's Trafalgar Square. The capital will be one of 12 cities hosting the European Championship, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Police, transport workers, NHS and ambulance staff will be given the chance to watch the first two England games in the square's fan park. Wembley Stadium will stage eight games during the tournament, which runs from 11 June to 11 July, all of them to be shown on giant TV screens in London. Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was hoped up to 9,500 people could be hosted in the Fan Zone Under the Prime Minister'sroadmap out of lockdown, social distancing measures and limits of people gathering outdoors will still be in place for England's first two games.

Italy's prime minister remembers Covid victims in Bergamo, one of the first European cities to be ravaged by the virus Some more now on the independent report published today which highlights serious flaws in the world's initial response to the pandemic. We've already mentioned criticisms aimed at the World Health Organization. But the report says that when combined with the actions of individual governments, these failures created a ""toxic cocktail"". So what did governments do wrong? The panel says US and European countries wasted the entire month of February when the virus was advancing across the world, and only acted when their hospitals began to fill up. And when countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report says. Read more about the report here. Boris Johnson has announced an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.But what does this mean? A public inquiry is a major investigation, launched by the government. Its job is to respond to ""public concern"" about a particular event or set of events - such as the pandemic. According to a leading specialist lawyer, it must ask three questions:  An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses, and to provide documentation and material evidence. At the end, the public inquiry usually draws up a report and makes recommendations to the government. Previous high-profile public inquiries have included the Chilcot investigation into the UK's role in the Iraq war - which took seven years - and the events of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Northern Ireland - which took 12 years. Here's everything we know about the Covid inquiry so far. Concern is growing about a rising number of Covid cases in Glasgowas the area prepares to ease restrictions. The latest published case rate is 58.3 per 100,000 population - well above a key threshold for moving from level three to level two in the roadmap out of lockdown. A senior health official said there were clusters of high infection rates in parts of the city. The variant first identified in India is suspected to be involved, although this has yet to be confirmed. All mainland council areas with the likely exception of Moray are due to move to level two on Monday, allowing people to meet indoors in groups of up to six people from up to three different households. Meanwhile, Rangers fansare being warned to think of their families before gathering in crowds to celebrate their league win. A woman mourns her son's death in Delhi as fatalities continue to rise India has seen its deadliest 24 hours of the pandemic yet, as the country's total number of Covid fatalities passed 250,000. Deaths increased by a record 4,205 while infections rose 348,421 to more than 23 million. Experts believe the death toll could actually be much higher. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of the country, with deaths rising significantly in recent weeks. There are shortages of medicines, hospital beds and oxygen, and most of the country's crematoriums have run out of spaces. Watch the BBC's Vikas Pandey's journey through the capital Delhi in the throes of the pandemic: This video can not be played India coronavirus: 'My city is under siege from Covid' A total of54,160,993coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's35,722,461first jabs and18,438,532second dose total. About a million 38 and 39-year-olds in Englandwill be able to book an appointment for a vaccine from 07:00 on Thursday on the NHS website. And you can find outwhen you should be due a vaccination here. A further 11 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external The total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test is now 127,640. There were also 2,284 new infections recorded today. Medics in PPE have become one of the defining images of the pandemic - and are now a subject for a monument planned in central London. The National Emergency Services Memorial was devised before Covid but later adapted to recognise the efforts of NHS staff. The BBC has been given an exclusive view of the first of six statues to be completed. The female medic stands 8ft (2.5m) tall and has been been meticulously carved in clay by sculptor Philip Jackson at his West Sussex studio ahead of a final finish. Dressed in full PPE, only her eyes are visible behind a visor and mask. ""She's had a 12-hour stint on the ward. She's fatigued, she's tired,"" Jackson says. ""She's taking off her gloves for the last time during the day and all that she has seen during the day is seen in her eyes."" Read more here. Members of the Unison trade union have voted to accept the Scottish Government's 4% pay offer for most NHS workers. Unison, Scotland's largest public sector union, had campaigned for the previous three-year deal to be renegotiated in light of the pandemic. In March, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman set out the pay rise of at least 4% for staff with contracts under theAgenda for Change system. Almost 50,000 Unison members were balloted on the proposal and 35% voted, with 84% accepting the pay deal. Union officials say they will now push for the deal to be implemented as soon as possible. In England, the government recommended in March that NHS staff should receive a 1% pay increase this year. Pop star Dua Lipa called for NHS workers to be paid more as she won two major awards at the Brits last night. The Canary Islands have seen few tourists so far this year Spain is expecting as many as 45 million foreign visitors this year, more than half pre-pandemic levels, its tourism minister says. ""International tourists can start planning their Spanish
vacations now,"" Reyes Maroto said at the launch of Spain's summer promotional campaign, describing the forecast as ""cautious but realistic"". The European Union is expected to update its restrictions on non-essential visits from outside the bloc on 20 May, just three days after the UK - Spain's biggest source of tourists - allows international travel to resume. But Spain will remain on England and Scotland's amber list of countries, meaning people should not be travelling there for leisure and should quarantine on their return home. Spain is making a major push to boost tourism after last year's numbers collapsed by nearly 80% compared with 2019. French and German visitors are also being targeted. Earlier we reported that Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya was urging the UK to consider a regional approach to easing restrictions, as many Spanish regions had similar case numbers to Britain. Downing Street has defended the timescale for starting the public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, after a group for bereaved families said it was beginning too late. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We're about to take one of the biggest steps forward in step three, which will involve a lot of unlocking, and that needs to be monitored carefully as we know variants are still an issue of concern and, of course, we will then be going into winter and the usual pressures that places on our NHS. ""Therefore it is right to wait until we are out of certainly winter time and hopefully due to the vaccine rollout globally... we will be in a better position to take this forward. ""Because these sorts of inquiries do require a great deal of government time with officials who are currently working on our Covid response."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Masks could become mandatory in Taiwan if restrictions are further tightened Taiwan could
be heading for a near lockdown, as a result of numerous outbreaks on the island
over the last couple of weeks. There have
been a spate of cases in Yilan County and the city of Taipei, linked
to an arcade and an airport hotel respectively. Yesterday,
Taiwan increased its alert level from Level 1 to 2, meaning that
large-scale indoor and outdoor activities are now banned. President Tsai Ing-wencalled on citizens to follow the rules in a tweet.,external However, according to Focus Taiwan, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centreâappears ready to further raise the alert level to Level 3â,external, in light of Taiwan confirming 16 cases in a single day, âthe highest number reportedâ¦ since the outbreak beganâ. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, and a Level 3 alert would âstop short of a lockdownâ. Masks would become mandatory, and all but essential businesses would close. Gatherings would also be restricted. This would be unprecedented, as Taiwan has not had to resort to a Level 3 lockdown throughout the pandemic. It has been something of a success story, having only recorded 1,210 Covid-19 cases throughout. It has a population of 23.8 million. The majority of these cases were reported very early on in the pandemic, peaking in April 2020. However, swift travel bans and strict quarantine measures led to Taiwan subsequently being able to go 253 days without reporting a single case of Covid-19 in 2020. Naomi GrimleyBBC News The most eye-catching lines of the report by theIndependent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Responseare that the pandemic was the 21st Century's ""Chernobyl moment"" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. The panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. After the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of ""never again"". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first? The panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet still many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand. There are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth. The most fundamental one remains our relationship with the animal world to stop viruses jumping to humans in the first place. As jabs in England are extended to those in their late 30s, Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged those eligible for the coronavirus jab to come forward, describing vaccines as ""our way out of the pandemic"". ""Our incredible vaccination programme has already saved
thousands of lives and has helped to significantly reduce hospital and
infection rates, allowing us to begin safely easing restrictions,"" he added. NHS
national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said the success of the programme was ""not by accident but down to the careful planning and precision of NHS staff"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Israel declares emergency in city as riots erupt,"This video can not be played The Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapses in an Israeli air strike on Tuesday Israel has declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod after rioting by Israeli Arabs, as conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants intensified. Cars were set alight and a father and daughter - both Israeli Arabs - died when a rocket from Gaza hit their car. Palestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets deep into Israel, while Israel carried out heavy air strikes on Gaza. At least 40 people have died in some of the worst violence in years. Israel's military says it is targeting militants in Gaza in response to rocket attacks on Jerusalem and other areas. More than 1,000 rockets have been fired towards central and southern Israel by Palestinian militants since Monday evening, when hostilities suddenly escalated, the Israeli army said. The Palestinian militants said they targeted the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after an Israeli air strike demolished a tower block in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. A second tower block collapsed in the territory after another Israeli strike. Residents were warned to evacuate the 12-storey al-Jawhara Tower. However, health officials say there were still civilian deaths. More than 200 rockets were fired at Tel Aviv and Beersheba after the tower attack, Palestinian militants said Jeremy Bowen: Old grievances fuel new fighting Residents react to the latest violence What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The fighting came after weeks of rising tensions that were stoked by violent confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters at a site in Jerusalem that is holy to both Muslims and Jews. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation. The UN's Middle East peace envoy, Tor Wennesland, said they were ""escalating towards a full-scale war"". At least 35 Palestinians, including 10 children, and five Israelis have been killed in the violence so far, according to health officials and medics. Protests by Israeli Arabs broke out in Lod, a city near Tel Aviv, and escalated to full-scale rioting, with protesters throwing rocks at police, who responded with stun grenades. The protests followed the funeral of an Israeli Arab man who died during unrest in the city a day earlier. At least 12 people were injured in the clashes,Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported,external. As night fell, the situation degenerated in Lod, police said. On Wednesday morning, a 52-year-old father and his 16-year-old daughter were killed when a rocket fired from Gaza hit their car, also seriously injuring the mother, according to the Times of Israel. Israeli media reported that synagogues and several businesses had been set on fire, while Reuters news agency said there were reports of Jews stoning a car that was being driven by an Arab resident. On Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod. Israeli border police have been brought in from the West Bank. The Times of Israel said this was the first time the government had used emergency powers over an Arab community since 1966. The conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants in Gaza has stirred unrest among the Arab minority inside Israel, leading to protests. There has also been unrest in other cities with a large Israeli Arab population, as well as in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. A funeral was held for a man who died during unrest in Lod on Monday Cars and businesses were burned during the riots in Lod, Israeli media reported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod ""All of Israel should know, this is a complete loss of control,"" Lod Mayor Yair Revivo was quoted as saying bythe Times of Israel newspaper,external. ""Civil war has erupted in Lod."" Mr Netanyahu, who went to the city to call for calm, said he would impose a curfew if necessary. After two days of hostilities, rocket fire by Palestinian militants and air strikes by the Israeli military continued unabated on Wednesday morning. In a tweet,external, Israel's military said it had struck ""a number of significant terror targets"" across the Gaza Strip in response to hundreds of rockets. The strikes were the biggest since 2014, it said. A high-rise building, homes and offices used by Palestinian militant leaders in Gaza were among the targets hit by fighter jets, Israel's military said. The Israeli military says its strikes on Gaza are the largest since 2014 Meanwhile, Palestinian militant groups continued to fire rocket barrages into Israel. Loud booms and air-raid sirens were heard across targeted cities, which included Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, Modiin, and Beersheba. For days, Palestinian militants have been launching hundreds of rockets towards Israeli cities in an apparent attempt to overwhelm missile defences. Earlier on Tuesday Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, said it had launched rockets at Tel Aviv and its suburbs in response to ""the enemy's targeting of residential towers"". Video footage from the city shows rockets streaking through the night sky, some exploding as they are hit by Israeli interceptor missiles. A damaged bus in Holon In the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, a rocket hit an empty bus, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told AFP news agency. A girl of five and two women, one 50 and one 30, were injured in the town. Ben Gurion airport briefly halted flights on Tuesday and an energy pipeline between the cities of Eilat and Ashkelon was hit. The rockets were launched after the destruction of the Hanadi Tower in Gaza, which houses an office used by the political leadership of Hamas. Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the Israeli strikes were ""just the beginning"". ""Terror organisations have been hit hard and will continue to be hit because of their decision to hit Israel,"" he said. ""We'll return peace and quiet, for the long term."" Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group was ""ready"" if Israel chose to escalate. ""If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready,"" he said in a televised address. ""There is a new balance of force."" The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. It was further fuelled by an expected court ruling on the fate of the families in Sheikh Jarrah - ultimately postponed because of the unrest - and Israel's annual celebration on Monday of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

UK economy showing resilience,"The UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of 2021, but gathered speed in March as lockdown restrictions began to ease, official figures show. The reopening of schools and strong retail spending helped the economy grow 2.1% in March, its fastest monthly growth since last August. But the economy is still 8.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic. However, March marked a possible turning point, economists suggested. Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, predicted the UK economy was now on course for a bumper bounce-back this year. ""The first quarter should mark the low point for the economy in 2021,"" said Mr Parikh. ""The lockdown, and added costs of navigating new trading terms with the EU, limited many businesses' trading activities at the start of the year."" The UK economy suffered arecord annual slump in 2020as coronavirus restrictions hit output and 2021 started off equally downbeat. The reintroduction of restrictions in January led to a fall in business investment and household consumption expenditure, according to the ONS. However, schools reopening on 8 March triggered an uplift in retail sales and sectors such as construction and manufacturing remained resilient, growing strongly in March. Businesses also continued to adapt and make themselves Covid secure. The vaccine rollout, the extension of support measures at the Budget, and the roadmap to reopen the economy have led to expectations that the UK economy will rebound strongly this year. But there are concerns about long term damage. Surenâ¯Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The first quarter decline should be followed by a robust rebound in the second quarter as the effects of the release of pent-up demand, as restrictions ease and the strong vaccine rollout, are fully felt. ""However, with the longer-term economic damage caused by coronavirus likely to increasingly weigh on activity as government support winds down, the recovery may be slower than many, including the Bank of England, currently predict.""â¯ What is GDP and why does it matter? UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 years Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said that households and businesses have adapted better to working and living under Covid restrictions ""despite the brutal cost of doing so"". But Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs pointed out that the UK's economic growth was still the slowest of the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries, for the fourth quarter in a row. GDP looks on course to grow by 5% between April and June ""which should mean that the UK finally hands over the wooden spoon to another G7 economy"", he added. On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the the BBC the economy was ""getting back on track"". ""Despite a difficult start to this year, economic growth in March is a promising sign of things to come,"" he added. Earlier this month,the Bank of England saidit expected the UK economy to enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years this year, as restrictions are lifted. But it cut its forecast for 2022 from 7.25% to 5.75%, suggesting the government was likely to raise taxes to pay for its huge pandemic-support programmes. Official trade figures, published at the same time as growth figures, showed a shift away from trading with EU countries since Brexit. ""Imports from Europe remained sluggish in the first three months of the year, being outstripped by non-EU imports for the first time on record,"" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan. New Brexit trading rules between the EU and the UK came into effect at the beginning of January. In the January to March quarter, the UK's exports to the EU fell 18.1% to Â£32.2bn, while exports to non-EU countries rose by 0.4% to Â£41.1bn, compared with the previous quarter. The value of imports from the EU fell by 21.7% to Â£50.6bn, and imports from non-EU countries fell by 0.9% to Â£53.2bn. The ONS said the UK's total trade deficit, excluding precious metals, narrowed by Â£8.4bn to Â£1.4bn. Mr Sunak told the BBC the government has invested ""hundreds of millions of pounds to help businesses adjust to those new trading arrangements and support them in the process"". ""We've always said there will be a period of adjustment and that's what you're seeing,"" he added. In ordinary times a 1.5% quarterly hit would be considered a considerable economic fall. In context of a further national shutdown, it shows some resilience in the UK economy. Businesses, particularly manufacturing and construction, were beginning to work out how to cope with pandemic restrictions. The good news is that by the end of the quarter the rebound was starting. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is not getting carried away with euphoria about the fastest growth in decades. The Treasury is well aware that this is mostly the arithmetic consequence of the bounce back from a sharp hit in 2020. The ONS showed that the economic hole in the UK caused by the pandemic still does not compare favourably with other major economies, with the US, for example, having recovered all lost output. Mr Sunak points to the much better than expected unemployment figures as the result of the furlough scheme. There is still uncertainty about how the global economy will respond to new waves of the pandemic. The chancellor is not changing the plan for tax rises on business.

Animal welfare plan unveiled by government,"Around 70% of cats are microchipped, while for dogs - where it is compulsory - the figure is over 90% Microchipping pet cats will become compulsory under a wide-ranging new animal welfare plan. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the policy would be monitored by vets and enforced in the same way as it is for dogs, which he said has led to over 90% compliance. The plan will also formally recognise the sentience of many animals. But Mr Eustice said this measure was aimed at pets and livestock, rather than wild animals. The government's Action Plan for Animal Welfare also includes measures to ban exporting live animals for slaughter, the keeping of primates as pets and importing hunting trophies. There may also be changes to the ways that animals can be confined - such as the practice of keeping them in cages. However, there is no plan to require imports to meet the same welfare standards as in the UK, which the National Farmers' Union (NFU) described as ""hypocrisy"". The plan will also see remote-controlled training collars for dogs outlawed and the government says it will look at banning the sale of foie gras - a food made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese. UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Missing cat reunited with owner after 13 years Zoo animals 'at risk' in lockdown Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Eustice said that compulsory microchipping for cats would resemble the current rules for dogs, where vets advise pet owners whose animals do not have a microchip to get one, and ""if they ignore it, there is an enforcement process"". Dog owners can be fined Â£500 under the existing law. Lianna Angliss at Hopefield Animal Sanctuary said that as well as helping to reunite lost cats with their owners, compulsory microchipping could help animal sanctuaries trace people who abandon their pets. The environment secretary also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the recognition of animal sentience would give the UK an equivalent to a declaration that already applies in the European Union. Clyde was reunited with his owners six years after they moved house - thanks to his microchip It will enshrine in law that animals have the capacity to feel hunger and pain, and are aware of what is happening to them. It will apply to vertebrates, but not to animals such as octopus and squid. Mr Eustice said there would be an expert animal sentience committee which would advise on policy. But asked if it would affect hunting, fishing or road-building projects which might disturb habitats, he said the recognition of animal sentience was ""much more applicable"" to pets and livestock than wildlife. Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society, said recognising animal sentience was a key part of ""probably the biggest new set of commitments on animal welfare for decades"". The plan includes legislation in a number of bills set to be approved in the coming months. These include the Kept Animals Bill, the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill and the Animals Abroad Bill. These will expand on the protections in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Legislation to restrict the use of glue traps, designed to capture rats and mice, will also be supported. Reacting to the news that owners will have to get their cats microchipped, Jacqui Cuff, head of advocacy and government relations for Cats Protection, said she was ""delighted"". In France, geese are force-fed to produce foie gras, which is made from their distended livers. ""We had the dog microchipping regulation passed in 2016, so we've been waiting a long time. There are around 2.6 million unchipped pet cats in the UK; that's a lot of cats wandering around with no permanent identification,"" she said. Cat theft reportedly increased by more than 12% over the last year, and only around 70% of owned cats are chipped at the moment. Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: ""These announcements will make a real and lasting difference to animals' welfare, so we're pleased the government is committed to improving animals' lives in the UK and abroad. We can no longer ignore the inextricable link that exists between the way we treat animals, our own health and that of the planet - but to really achieve a step change, it will take courage from right across government. ""We urge the government to put animal welfare at the heart of policy making and make these announcements just the beginning of an evolving, holistic animal health and welfare strategy."" With regard to farmed animals, live exports for fattening and slaughter will be banned. This is only possible because the UK has left the EU. The caging of poultry and the practice of restricting the movement of pregnant and suckling pigs will also be examined. In 2012 Thanet council suspended live exports from Ramsgate after an incident in which 45 sheep died Sows can legally be kept in a ""farrowing crate"" for up to five weeks. These crates are of a size that prevents the sow from turning around and potentially crushing her new-born piglets. However, preventing sows from engaging in normal behaviour can cause them to become stressed. There is, however, no legal guarantee that food from animals reared abroad will have been produced to high animal-welfare standards. Last year, ministers controversiallyvoted againsta House of Lords amendment which would have blocked imports that didn't meet welfare and food safety standards in the UK. It will now depend on post-Brexit trade deals with countries such as the US, where cows are routinely treated with hormones and chickens are washed with chlorine - which is illegal here. The deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, Stuart Roberts, said it was ""ridiculous"" if high standards weren't applied to imports as well. ""We have some of highest standards for animal welfare in the world. It's good that the government have that same ambition,"" he said. There are concerns imports won't meet existing farm standards ""But at the moment we are negotiating a trade deal with Australia, where you can have journey times for animals in excess of 24 hours without access to food or water. We cannot increase standards here, and at the same time not apply the same criteria to imports, it's just hypocrisy."" Mr Eustice said the UK could use tariffs on imported produce to uphold its standards and could also impose a ban on the sale of imported food which relied on practices banned domestically - such as foie gras. Other measures in the plan include banning the advertisement of ""unacceptable low-welfare animal practices abroad"" such as elephant rides, along with prohibiting the export of ""detached shark fins"". The Ivory Act, banning the sale of ivory, will also be implemented. There will also be new laws to ""crack down on illegal hare coursing,"" and police will be given more powers to protect farm animals from dangerous or out-of-control dogs.

Bye for now from Becky Morton, Claire Heald, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Robert Greenall, who've brought you today's updates. And here's a recap of the main stories around the world today: We are going to be bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's events in the UK:  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has arrived at Westminster Abbey for a service to honour the contribution of nurses during the pandemic. The service, which takes place annually to mark Florence Nightingale's birthday on 12 May - now known as International Nurses' Day - is this year recognising the sacrifice of nurses and midwives since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the UK. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is a relative of Nightingale, are also at the service. Earlier, the Duchess of Cornwall met nurses, patients and staff on a visit to the Whittington Hospital, in London. Exams in Scotland have been cancelled as the Covid-19 pandemic forced pupils into extended periods of learning from home, but the alternative arrangements are ""exams in all but name"", Labour's education spokesman has said. Michael Marra has written to Education Secretary John Swinney calling for greater clarity in the system, claiming there is inconsistency in this year's process, a lack of planning and a lack of information about appeals. He wrote: ""Lessons must be learned from last year's unfair appeals process, where young people had no ability to have their teacher estimate scrutinised, even where they felt evidence existed."" He went on: ""Young people in Scotland are right now sitting exams in all but name, they need clarity and certainty about the process they are undertaking."" Some pupils told the BBC they were at ""breaking point"" over school assessments. More than 4,000 people have died so far in Nepal with cases rising While much of the world's attention in recent weeks has been focused on India's Covid plight, its small northern neighbour Nepal has been facing its own crisis. The Himalayan nation of about 30 million people is one of the least developed countries in the world, and it relies on India for supplies of medical equipment and oxygen. And as India stops exports, Nepal is struggling to find alternatives. Meanwhile nearly one in two of its citizens are testing positive for the virus. More than 4,000 people have died and many more deaths are expected. Read more here from the BBC's Ambarasan Ethirajan on the tragedy of Nepal's second wave. England play Scotland at Wembley Stadium on 18 June Key workers have been offered exclusive access to watch the Uefa Euro 2020 matches in London's Trafalgar Square. The capital will be one of 12 cities hosting the European Championship, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Police, transport workers, NHS and ambulance staff will be given the chance to watch the first two England games in the square's fan park. Wembley Stadium will stage eight games during the tournament, which runs from 11 June to 11 July, all of them to be shown on giant TV screens in London. Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was hoped up to 9,500 people could be hosted in the Fan Zone Under the Prime Minister'sroadmap out of lockdown, social distancing measures and limits of people gathering outdoors will still be in place for England's first two games.

Italy's prime minister remembers Covid victims in Bergamo, one of the first European cities to be ravaged by the virus Some more now on the independent report published today which highlights serious flaws in the world's initial response to the pandemic. We've already mentioned criticisms aimed at the World Health Organization. But the report says that when combined with the actions of individual governments, these failures created a ""toxic cocktail"". So what did governments do wrong? The panel says US and European countries wasted the entire month of February when the virus was advancing across the world, and only acted when their hospitals began to fill up. And when countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a ""winner takes all"" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report says. Read more about the report here. Boris Johnson has announced an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.But what does this mean? A public inquiry is a major investigation, launched by the government. Its job is to respond to ""public concern"" about a particular event or set of events - such as the pandemic. According to a leading specialist lawyer, it must ask three questions:  An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses, and to provide documentation and material evidence. At the end, the public inquiry usually draws up a report and makes recommendations to the government. Previous high-profile public inquiries have included the Chilcot investigation into the UK's role in the Iraq war - which took seven years - and the events of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Northern Ireland - which took 12 years. Here's everything we know about the Covid inquiry so far. Concern is growing about a rising number of Covid cases in Glasgowas the area prepares to ease restrictions. The latest published case rate is 58.3 per 100,000 population - well above a key threshold for moving from level three to level two in the roadmap out of lockdown. A senior health official said there were clusters of high infection rates in parts of the city. The variant first identified in India is suspected to be involved, although this has yet to be confirmed. All mainland council areas with the likely exception of Moray are due to move to level two on Monday, allowing people to meet indoors in groups of up to six people from up to three different households. Meanwhile, Rangers fansare being warned to think of their families before gathering in crowds to celebrate their league win. A woman mourns her son's death in Delhi as fatalities continue to rise India has seen its deadliest 24 hours of the pandemic yet, as the country's total number of Covid fatalities passed 250,000. Deaths increased by a record 4,205 while infections rose 348,421 to more than 23 million. Experts believe the death toll could actually be much higher. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of the country, with deaths rising significantly in recent weeks. There are shortages of medicines, hospital beds and oxygen, and most of the country's crematoriums have run out of spaces. Watch the BBC's Vikas Pandey's journey through the capital Delhi in the throes of the pandemic: This video can not be played India coronavirus: 'My city is under siege from Covid' A total of54,160,993coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's35,722,461first jabs and18,438,532second dose total.

And you can find outwhen you should be due a vaccination here. A further 11 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external The total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test is now 127,640. There were also 2,284 new infections recorded today. Medics in PPE have become one of the defining images of the pandemic - and are now a subject for a monument planned in central London. The National Emergency Services Memorial was devised before Covid but later adapted to recognise the efforts of NHS staff. The BBC has been given an exclusive view of the first of six statues to be completed. The female medic stands 8ft (2.5m) tall and has been been meticulously carved in clay by sculptor Philip Jackson at his West Sussex studio ahead of a final finish. Dressed in full PPE, only her eyes are visible behind a visor and mask. ""She's had a 12-hour stint on the ward. She's fatigued, she's tired,"" Jackson says. ""She's taking off her gloves for the last time during the day and all that she has seen during the day is seen in her eyes."" Read more here. Members of the Unison trade union have voted to accept the Scottish Government's 4% pay offer for most NHS workers. Unison, Scotland's largest public sector union, had campaigned for the previous three-year deal to be renegotiated in light of the pandemic. In March, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman set out the pay rise of at least 4% for staff with contracts under theAgenda for Change system. Almost 50,000 Unison members were balloted on the proposal and 35% voted, with 84% accepting the pay deal. Union officials say they will now push for the deal to be implemented as soon as possible. In England, the government recommended in March that NHS staff should receive a 1% pay increase this year. Pop star Dua Lipa called for NHS workers to be paid more as she won two major awards at the Brits last night. The Canary Islands have seen few tourists so far this year Spain is expecting as many as 45 million foreign visitors this year, more than half pre-pandemic levels, its tourism minister says. ""International tourists can start planning their Spanish
vacations now,"" Reyes Maroto said at the launch of Spain's summer promotional campaign, describing the forecast as ""cautious but realistic"". The European Union is expected to update its restrictions on non-essential visits from outside the bloc on 20 May, just three days after the UK - Spain's biggest source of tourists - allows international travel to resume. But Spain will remain on England and Scotland's amber list of countries, meaning people should not be travelling there for leisure and should quarantine on their return home. Spain is making a major push to boost tourism after last year's numbers collapsed by nearly 80% compared with 2019. French and German visitors are also being targeted. Earlier we reported that Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya was urging the UK to consider a regional approach to easing restrictions, as many Spanish regions had similar case numbers to Britain. Downing Street has defended the timescale for starting the public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, after a group for bereaved families said it was beginning too late. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We're about to take one of the biggest steps forward in step three, which will involve a lot of unlocking, and that needs to be monitored carefully as we know variants are still an issue of concern and, of course, we will then be going into winter and the usual pressures that places on our NHS. ""Therefore it is right to wait until we are out of certainly winter time and hopefully due to the vaccine rollout globally... we will be in a better position to take this forward. ""Because these sorts of inquiries do require a great deal of government time with officials who are currently working on our Covid response.""

President Tsai Ing-wencalled on citizens to follow the rules in a tweet.,external However, according to Focus Taiwan, Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centreâappears ready to further raise the alert level to Level 3â,external, in light of Taiwan confirming 16 cases in a single day, âthe highest number reportedâ¦ since the outbreak beganâ. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, and a Level 3 alert would âstop short of a lockdownâ. Masks would become mandatory, and all but essential businesses would close. Gatherings would also be restricted. This would be unprecedented, as Taiwan has not had to resort to a Level 3 lockdown throughout the pandemic. It has been something of a success story, having only recorded 1,210 Covid-19 cases throughout. It has a population of 23.8 million. The majority of these cases were reported very early on in the pandemic, peaking in April 2020. However, swift travel bans and strict quarantine measures led to Taiwan subsequently being able to go 253 days without reporting a single case of Covid-19 in 2020. Naomi GrimleyBBC News The most eye-catching lines of the report by theIndependent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Responseare that the pandemic was the 21st Century's ""Chernobyl moment"" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. The panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. After the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of ""never again"". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first? The panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet still many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand. There are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth. The most fundamental one remains our relationship with the animal world to stop viruses jumping to humans in the first place. As jabs in England are extended to those in their late 30s, Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged those eligible for the coronavirus jab to come forward, describing vaccines as ""our way out of the pandemic"". ""Our incredible vaccination programme has already saved
thousands of lives and has helped to significantly reduce hospital and
infection rates, allowing us to begin safely easing restrictions,"" he added. NHS
national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said the success of the programme was ""not by accident but down to the careful planning and precision of NHS staff"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Israel declares emergency in city as riots eruptRiots sweep Lod as unrest grows after days of fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants.Middle EastQueen's Speech commits to Troubles legislationNew legislation to deal with the Troubles legacy will be set out in the coming weeks.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played The Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapses in an Israeli air strike on Tuesday Israel has declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod after rioting by Israeli Arabs, as conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants intensified. Cars were set alight and a father and daughter - both Israeli Arabs - died when a rocket from Gaza hit their car. Palestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets deep into Israel, while Israel carried out heavy air strikes on Gaza. At least 40 people have died in some of the worst violence in years. Israel's military says it is targeting militants in Gaza in response to rocket attacks on Jerusalem and other areas. More than 1,000 rockets have been fired towards central and southern Israel by Palestinian militants since Monday evening, when hostilities suddenly escalated, the Israeli army said. The Palestinian militants said they targeted the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after an Israeli air strike demolished a tower block in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. A second tower block collapsed in the territory after another Israeli strike. Residents were warned to evacuate the 12-storey al-Jawhara Tower. However, health officials say there were still civilian deaths. More than 200 rockets were fired at Tel Aviv and Beersheba after the tower attack, Palestinian militants said Jeremy Bowen: Old grievances fuel new fighting Residents react to the latest violence What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The fighting came after weeks of rising tensions that were stoked by violent confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters at a site in Jerusalem that is holy to both Muslims and Jews. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation. The UN's Middle East peace envoy, Tor Wennesland, said they were ""escalating towards a full-scale war"". At least 35 Palestinians, including 10 children, and five Israelis have been killed in the violence so far, according to health officials and medics. Protests by Israeli Arabs broke out in Lod, a city near Tel Aviv, and escalated to full-scale rioting, with protesters throwing rocks at police, who responded with stun grenades. The protests followed the funeral of an Israeli Arab man who died during unrest in the city a day earlier. At least 12 people were injured in the clashes,Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported,external. As night fell, the situation degenerated in Lod, police said. On Wednesday morning, a 52-year-old father and his 16-year-old daughter were killed when a rocket fired from Gaza hit their car, also seriously injuring the mother, according to the Times of Israel. Israeli media reported that synagogues and several businesses had been set on fire, while Reuters news agency said there were reports of Jews stoning a car that was being driven by an Arab resident. On Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod. Israeli border police have been brought in from the West Bank. The Times of Israel said this was the first time the government had used emergency powers over an Arab community since 1966. The conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants in Gaza has stirred unrest among the Arab minority inside Israel, leading to protests. There has also been unrest in other cities with a large Israeli Arab population, as well as in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. A funeral was held for a man who died during unrest in Lod on Monday Cars and businesses were burned during the riots in Lod, Israeli media reported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod ""All of Israel should know, this is a complete loss of control,"" Lod Mayor Yair Revivo was quoted as saying bythe Times of Israel newspaper,external. ""Civil war has erupted in Lod."" Mr Netanyahu, who went to the city to call for calm, said he would impose a curfew if necessary. After two days of hostilities, rocket fire by Palestinian militants and air strikes by the Israeli military continued unabated on Wednesday morning. In a tweet,external, Israel's military said it had struck ""a number of significant terror targets"" across the Gaza Strip in response to hundreds of rockets. The strikes were the biggest since 2014, it said. A high-rise building, homes and offices used by Palestinian militant leaders in Gaza were among the targets hit by fighter jets, Israel's military said. The Israeli military says its strikes on Gaza are the largest since 2014 Meanwhile, Palestinian militant groups continued to fire rocket barrages into Israel. Loud booms and air-raid sirens were heard across targeted cities, which included Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, Modiin, and Beersheba. For days, Palestinian militants have been launching hundreds of rockets towards Israeli cities in an apparent attempt to overwhelm missile defences. Earlier on Tuesday Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, said it had launched rockets at Tel Aviv and its suburbs in response to ""the enemy's targeting of residential towers"". Video footage from the city shows rockets streaking through the night sky, some exploding as they are hit by Israeli interceptor missiles. A damaged bus in Holon In the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, a rocket hit an empty bus, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told AFP news agency. A girl of five and two women, one 50 and one 30, were injured in the town. Ben Gurion airport briefly halted flights on Tuesday and an energy pipeline between the cities of Eilat and Ashkelon was hit. The rockets were launched after the destruction of the Hanadi Tower in Gaza, which houses an office used by the political leadership of Hamas. Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the Israeli strikes were ""just the beginning"". ""Terror organisations have been hit hard and will continue to be hit because of their decision to hit Israel,"" he said. ""We'll return peace and quiet, for the long term."" Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group was ""ready"" if Israel chose to escalate. ""If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready,"" he said in a televised address. ""There is a new balance of force."" The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. It was further fuelled by an expected court ruling on the fate of the families in Sheikh Jarrah - ultimately postponed because of the unrest - and Israel's annual celebration on Monday of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

Firms could face fines over harmful online content,"The Online Safety Bill is designed to protect children and adults Social media firms will have to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines under new legislation. The government's Online Safety Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech, comes with a promise of protecting debate. It is ""especially"" geared at keeping children safe and says ""democratically important"" content should be preserved. But campaigners say the plans will lead to censorship, while others warn fines do not go far enough. Online harms bill: Warning over unacceptable delay Online harms law to let regulator block apps in the UK The draft legislation, previously known as the Online Harms Bill, has been two years in the making. It covers a huge range of content to which children might fall victim - including grooming, revenge porn, hate speech, images of child abuse and posts relating to suicide and eating disorders. But it goes much further, taking in terrorism, disinformation, racist abuse and pornography, too. Late additions to the bill include provisions to tackle online scams, such as romance fraud and fake investment opportunities. It will not include fraud via advertising, emails or cloned websites. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the ""ground-breaking laws"" would usher in ""a new age of accountability for tech"". And Home Secretary Priti Patel added the scam provisions would help fight ""ruthless criminals who defraud millions of people"". New details published about the government's Online Safety Bill again emphasise its commitments to enforce social media sites to better protect users from online harm. That includes child sexual exploitation, racist abuse, terrorism - and harmful disinformation on social media. I've spent the past year investigating the very real-world harm myths and conspiracy theories shared online - about the pandemic, vaccines, and elections - can cause offline. Under the proposals, social media sites will be required to act on harmful content like this - even when legal. Otherwise, they'll find themselves at risk of fines or even criminal action from regulator Ofcom. The line between free speech and harm posed by misleading posts online has been a tricky one to tread for tech companies - and with a nod to the on-going debate, the bill highlights the importance of freedom of expression on social media. While more concrete plans will be welcomed by critics of the social media giants, the government has come under fire for repeated delays to this legislation. But those who I've interviewed - who have already been impacted by online conspiracies - would argue this comes too late to protect them and their loved ones. The government has added a new duty of care for social-media sites to protect content defined as ""democratically important"". This includes content promoting or opposing government policy or a political party ahead of a vote, election or referendum. Context will also need to be taken into account when moderating political content. While content on news publishers' websites is not part of the legislation, articles shared on social media are. Social-media firms should offer a fast-track appeals process if journalistic content is removed, both from professional and ""citizen"" journalists, it says. But campaigners remain unhappy. Ruth Smeeth, the chief executive of the Index on Censorship who has personal experience of online abuse, described the bill as a ""censor's charter... outsourced to Silicon Valley"". The former Labour MP added that ""targeting the platforms rather than the perpetrators of hate seems a strange proposed solution"". Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, warned the idea that speech was ""inherently harmful"" and needed to be controlled by private companies was ""very dangerous"". The government said companies would need to ""put in place safeguards for freedom of expression"" and have effective routes for users to appeal. Users will also be able to appeal directly to Ofcom. Ofcom will issue codes of practice outlining the systems and processes that companies need to adopt in order to be compliant. The government has already published codes on terrorism and child sexual exploitation because of their serious nature. The largest and most popular social-media sites - described as category-one services - will need to state explicitly in their terms and conditions how they will address so-called legal harms. Ofcom will be able to issue fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of global turnover, whichever is higher, if firms fail to comply with the new rules. It will also have the power to block access to sites in the UK, the government said. The death of Molly Russell prompted calls for tougher rules to be imposed on online services used by teenagers Some campaigners do not think so. Tech entrepreneur Belinda Parmar said: ""The ambition is great. The regulator is going to have teeth, but no codes of practice for non-legal harms have yet been published, and it is all very vague."" Others have said fines do not go far enough, including the NSPCC which has called for the senior managers of tech firms to be made criminally liable for harmful content. Labour called the proposals ""watered down and incomplete"" and said the new rules would do ""very little"" to ensure children are safe online. The government has reserved the powers for Ofcom to pursue criminal action ""if tech companies fail to live up to their new responsibilities"". A review will take place two years after the new regime is operational. Ian Russell, father of Molly, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing thousands of posts about suicide and self-harm on social media, said he hoped the new law would ""focus the minds of the tech platforms"" to change their corporate culture and to reduce online harms. There has been frustration that the legislation, first conceived by Theresa May's government back in April 2019, has taken a long time to come to fruition. The bill will now be examined by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, whose chairman, Julian Knight, said it would be pressing for the legislation ""to be given top priority"".

US petrol supplies tighten after pipeline hack,"This video can not be played How did a cyber-attack lead to US petrol queues? US motorists have been urged to not hoard fuel as supplies tighten due to a major pipeline remaining shut after a cyber-attack. Some drivers in the south east were seen stocking up as petrol stations began running dry and prices rose. The average price for petrol was the highest on Tuesday since November 2014, at $2.98 (Â£2.11) per gallon, the American Automobile Association said. North Carolina, Virginia and Florida have declared a state of emergency. But US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no need for motorists to hoard petrol. Ms Granholm said there was not a shortage but a supply ""crunch"" in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and southern Virginia, regions that typically rely on Colonial for fuel. A ransomware cyber-attack on Friday forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down the main part of its network. The operator has forecast that it will not substantially restore operations of the 5,500-mile (8,900km) pipeline network that supplies nearly half of the East Coast's fuel until the end of the week. The FBI hasaccused a criminal gang called DarkSide,externalof the ransomware attack. The gang is believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe and avoids targeting computers that use languages from former Soviet republics, cyber experts said. Ransomware is a type of malware designed to lock computers by encrypting data and demanding payment to regain access. Russia's embassy in the US rejected speculation that the country's government was behind the attack. President Joe Biden a day earlier said there was no evidence so far that Russia was responsible. If the general public or politicians ever needed proof of how devastating cyber-attacks can be, this hack will more than suffice: chaos at the pumps, states of emergency declared and the White House calling for calm. And this is just the stuff we're being told about. In Colonial Pipeline's latest press update, we're given hints about the mayhem inside the company. With high-tech sensors and safety systems taken offline, the firm says it's hired dozens of staff to walk or drive the 5,000-mile length of the pipeline every day. It's also deployed helicopters to check on the pipes and a growing fleet of delivery trucks. Another clue to the chaos is that the company's website has been periodically taken offline. Colonial says this is a separate problem, but tellingly it has now blocked all traffic from outside of the US. Even the hackers themselves seemsurprised by the damagethey've caused. According to new research from cyber-security company FireEye, the hackers known as Darkside launched their global crime spree in August last year, raking in millions from organisations in more than 15 countries. But this hack seems like it may have crossed some sort of line even for these hardened criminals. The true test of their morals, though, will depend on whether or not they will continue the extort the company or help it recover. More than 7% of petrol stations in Virginia and 5% in North Carolina were out of fuel on Tuesday as demand jumped 20%, tracking firm GasBuddy said. Colonial hack: How did cyber-attackers shut off pipeline? US fuel pipeline hackers 'didn't mean to create problems' On Tuesday, the government stepped in to issue an emergency fuel waiver lasting one week, designed to help alleviate any shortages. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the move, which relaxes some rules usually applied to fuel, would run until 18 May in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC. In addition, Georgia suspended sales tax on petrol until Saturday. On Monday North Carolinadeclared a state of emergency,externaland temporarily suspended vehicle fuel regulations ""to ensure adequate fuel supply supplies throughout the state"". While the pipeline outage is having short-term consequences in some regions, some experts believe the longer term impact will be small. ""Markets will go crazy, but two weeks later no one knows it happened,"" said Chuck Watson, director of research at Enki, which studies the economic effects of natural and other disasters. Fuel prices were expected to rise with the start of the summer driving season, although the US Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that theongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,externalwould ""significantly affect petroleum markets in the summer of 2021"". The pipeline shutdown contributed to the rise in fuel prices, the AAA said. ""We might see the delivery challenges due to the attack add a few cents to the expected increase in the national average,"" a spokesperson added.

Dua demands pay rise for nurses as she wins Brits,"This video can not be played Brits 2021: Highlights from a female-dominated night Dua Lipa demanded a pay rise for NHS workers as she won two major awards at the Brits - the UK's first major in-person ceremony of the Covid era. And Little Mix called out sexism in the music industry after becoming the first all-female outfit to win best British group. The other big winners on the night were J Hus, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift. The test event at London's O2 Arena took place with a 4,000-strong audience and no social distancing or face masks. Rappers Headie One and AJ Tracey used several verses of their performance to call out the demonisation of drill music and criticise the government, while highlighting the work done by footballer and free school meals campaigner Marcus Rashford. The best outfits from the Brit Awards red carpet Great show, shame about the videos Brits 2021: Full list of winners While the 2021 Brits were not on a leap year it was very much a Lipa year, as the singer won two of the three awards for which she was nominated. Future Nostalgia, the best-selling album released last year in the UK, predictably won best album. But it was after winning the best British female award, her first of the night, that the star called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give nurses and NHS workers pay rises, as opposed to mere applause. This year, each of the Brit award trophies came in two parts and Dua dedicated hers to British nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu - who she noted has spent ""a stellar nursing career fighting racial injustice"" and ""protecting frontline workers"". ""She has also said that there's a massive disparity between gratitude and respect for frontline workers,"" said the singer. ""Because it's very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them. How much will NHS staff be paid? ""So I think what we should do, is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris a message that we all support a fair pay rise is for our frontline."" The audience, which was packed with key workers, gave her a standing ovation. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, environment secretary George Eustice responded to Dua Lipa's speech by stressing there was a ""difficult public finance environment"". ""There's been a pay freeze for most of the public sector and it's also important to recognise that in recent years that there have been some pay rises as well, particularly for nurses and the lower paid,"" he said. ""We can't always go as far as you'd like, but it's also the case that there's a pay review that's going on into the NHS,"" he continued. The government recommended in March that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year, while many other public sector workers will have their pay frozen. Before her double win, Dua Lipa had performed a medley of hits from her latest floor-filling record. It was a visual love letter to her home city of London, complete with a Tube platform string quartet, Amy Winehouse-style beehive hair and a union jack skirt which evoked memories of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell's famous patriotic dress. The night's big winner also shared her delight at seeing more women on both the stage and the winners' podium - several years after she called out the Brits for overlooking female artists. This year, by contrast, women won four of the five mixed categories. One such example, Little Mix dedicated their award to some of the great all-female bands who could and should have won in previous years. ""It's not easy, being a female in the UK pop industry,"" said Leigh-Anne Pinnock while accepting their award. ""We've seen white male dominance, misogyny and sexism, and a lack of diversity. ""We're proud that we've stuck together, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever."" ""The fact that a girl band has never won this award really does speak volumes,"" added bandmate Jade Thirlwall. ""So this award isn't just for us, it's for the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, Girls Aloud. ""All of the incredible female bands - this one's for you."" Since the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC the day after Little Mix's speech, former Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts said: ""They absolutely deserved that award last night and it's long overdue. I feel very proud of the girls because obviously they've been going for 10 years and it's not too dissimilar from the story of Girls Aloud."" She told 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: ""We were nominated a good few times for that award but we never received it, it was always a male indie band that would be recognised."" Elsewhere, rapper J Hus was not on hand on the night to pick up his award for best male solo star. But Harry Styles was - in typically well-tailored fashion, sporting a brown and white Gucci suit - to collect best British single for his ubiquitous hit Watermelon Sugar. If last month's Oscars took place in tinsel town then the Brits was very much tonsil town, as spectators underwent Covid tests on their way into the event. The event formed part the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events safely, which includes the forthcoming FA Cup Final. The live audience of about 4,000 people was about one-fifth of the O2's capacity and more than half of the ticket-holders were key workers from Greater London and their guests. Several performances were pre-recorded including Coldplay's show opener from a pontoon on the River Thames, and another from best international male The Weeknd. After being introduced by Jackie Weaver - of local council Zoom meeting fame - Chris Martin and co played their new single Higher Power with a little help from some holograms and pyrotechnics. Sir Elton John later appeared on tape too alongside Years & Years star Olly Alexander for a rendition of Pet Shop Boys track It's a Sin, title track of the latter's recent drama series. This video can not be played Dua Lipa is among the music stars readjusting to being back on a red carpet Before the event, US pop star Taylor Swift - who best international group-winners Haim described as ""the most incredible human being"" - was announced as the first female winner of the global icon award. Swift, who normally resides in Los Angeles, was there in-person to accept it and also praised the ""help and support we got from the NHS"" over the past year. Allow Twitter content?

In the only other award announced beforehand, young singer Griff was named as the winner of the rising star prize, and she demonstrated why with a career-making performance. Previous winners of the award include Adele, who went on to win a host of more senior Brit Awards in the years that followed. Another star in bloom, Arlo Parks, said it was ""a dream come true"" to win the breakthrough award and she sang - in front of a garden centre's worth of sunflowers - like she had been doing it forever. The event finished with a collaboration between Rag 'n' Bone Man, a virtual Pink, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Choir. Before teeing them up, comedian Jack Whitehall, hosting the awards for a fourth time, gave ""a massive big up to the key workers here tonight, and across the country"". ""We will never be able to thank you guys enough,"" he said.

US motorists urged not to hoard fuelSome petrol stations run out of fuel in the US southeast as the Colonial Pipeline stays down.Business,"This video can not be played How did a cyber-attack lead to US petrol queues? US motorists have been urged to not hoard fuel as supplies tighten due to a major pipeline remaining shut after a cyber-attack. Some drivers in the south east were seen stocking up as petrol stations began running dry and prices rose. The average price for petrol was the highest on Tuesday since November 2014, at $2.98 (Â£2.11) per gallon, the American Automobile Association said. North Carolina, Virginia and Florida have declared a state of emergency. But US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no need for motorists to hoard petrol. Ms Granholm said there was not a shortage but a supply ""crunch"" in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and southern Virginia, regions that typically rely on Colonial for fuel. A ransomware cyber-attack on Friday forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down the main part of its network. The operator has forecast that it will not substantially restore operations of the 5,500-mile (8,900km) pipeline network that supplies nearly half of the East Coast's fuel until the end of the week. The FBI hasaccused a criminal gang called DarkSide,externalof the ransomware attack. The gang is believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe and avoids targeting computers that use languages from former Soviet republics, cyber experts said. Ransomware is a type of malware designed to lock computers by encrypting data and demanding payment to regain access. Russia's embassy in the US rejected speculation that the country's government was behind the attack. President Joe Biden a day earlier said there was no evidence so far that Russia was responsible. If the general public or politicians ever needed proof of how devastating cyber-attacks can be, this hack will more than suffice: chaos at the pumps, states of emergency declared and the White House calling for calm. And this is just the stuff we're being told about. In Colonial Pipeline's latest press update, we're given hints about the mayhem inside the company. With high-tech sensors and safety systems taken offline, the firm says it's hired dozens of staff to walk or drive the 5,000-mile length of the pipeline every day. It's also deployed helicopters to check on the pipes and a growing fleet of delivery trucks. Another clue to the chaos is that the company's website has been periodically taken offline. Colonial says this is a separate problem, but tellingly it has now blocked all traffic from outside of the US. Even the hackers themselves seemsurprised by the damagethey've caused. According to new research from cyber-security company FireEye, the hackers known as Darkside launched their global crime spree in August last year, raking in millions from organisations in more than 15 countries. But this hack seems like it may have crossed some sort of line even for these hardened criminals. The true test of their morals, though, will depend on whether or not they will continue the extort the company or help it recover. More than 7% of petrol stations in Virginia and 5% in North Carolina were out of fuel on Tuesday as demand jumped 20%, tracking firm GasBuddy said. Colonial hack: How did cyber-attackers shut off pipeline? US fuel pipeline hackers 'didn't mean to create problems' On Tuesday, the government stepped in to issue an emergency fuel waiver lasting one week, designed to help alleviate any shortages. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the move, which relaxes some rules usually applied to fuel, would run until 18 May in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC. In addition, Georgia suspended sales tax on petrol until Saturday. On Monday North Carolinadeclared a state of emergency,externaland temporarily suspended vehicle fuel regulations ""to ensure adequate fuel supply supplies throughout the state"". While the pipeline outage is having short-term consequences in some regions, some experts believe the longer term impact will be small. ""Markets will go crazy, but two weeks later no one knows it happened,"" said Chuck Watson, director of research at Enki, which studies the economic effects of natural and other disasters. Fuel prices were expected to rise with the start of the summer driving season, although the US Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that theongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,externalwould ""significantly affect petroleum markets in the summer of 2021"". The pipeline shutdown contributed to the rise in fuel prices, the AAA said. ""We might see the delivery challenges due to the attack add a few cents to the expected increase in the national average,"" a spokesperson added.

Firms could face fines over harmful online contentThe Online Safety Bill threatens media giants with big fines - but aims to protect political debate.Technology,"The Online Safety Bill is designed to protect children and adults Social media firms will have to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines under new legislation. The government's Online Safety Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech, comes with a promise of protecting debate. It is ""especially"" geared at keeping children safe and says ""democratically important"" content should be preserved. But campaigners say the plans will lead to censorship, while others warn fines do not go far enough. Online harms bill: Warning over unacceptable delay Online harms law to let regulator block apps in the UK The draft legislation, previously known as the Online Harms Bill, has been two years in the making. It covers a huge range of content to which children might fall victim - including grooming, revenge porn, hate speech, images of child abuse and posts relating to suicide and eating disorders. But it goes much further, taking in terrorism, disinformation, racist abuse and pornography, too. Late additions to the bill include provisions to tackle online scams, such as romance fraud and fake investment opportunities. It will not include fraud via advertising, emails or cloned websites. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the ""ground-breaking laws"" would usher in ""a new age of accountability for tech"". And Home Secretary Priti Patel added the scam provisions would help fight ""ruthless criminals who defraud millions of people"". New details published about the government's Online Safety Bill again emphasise its commitments to enforce social media sites to better protect users from online harm. That includes child sexual exploitation, racist abuse, terrorism - and harmful disinformation on social media. I've spent the past year investigating the very real-world harm myths and conspiracy theories shared online - about the pandemic, vaccines, and elections - can cause offline. Under the proposals, social media sites will be required to act on harmful content like this - even when legal. Otherwise, they'll find themselves at risk of fines or even criminal action from regulator Ofcom. The line between free speech and harm posed by misleading posts online has been a tricky one to tread for tech companies - and with a nod to the on-going debate, the bill highlights the importance of freedom of expression on social media. While more concrete plans will be welcomed by critics of the social media giants, the government has come under fire for repeated delays to this legislation. But those who I've interviewed - who have already been impacted by online conspiracies - would argue this comes too late to protect them and their loved ones. The government has added a new duty of care for social-media sites to protect content defined as ""democratically important"". This includes content promoting or opposing government policy or a political party ahead of a vote, election or referendum. Context will also need to be taken into account when moderating political content. While content on news publishers' websites is not part of the legislation, articles shared on social media are. Social-media firms should offer a fast-track appeals process if journalistic content is removed, both from professional and ""citizen"" journalists, it says. But campaigners remain unhappy. Ruth Smeeth, the chief executive of the Index on Censorship who has personal experience of online abuse, described the bill as a ""censor's charter... outsourced to Silicon Valley"". The former Labour MP added that ""targeting the platforms rather than the perpetrators of hate seems a strange proposed solution"". Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, warned the idea that speech was ""inherently harmful"" and needed to be controlled by private companies was ""very dangerous"". The government said companies would need to ""put in place safeguards for freedom of expression"" and have effective routes for users to appeal. Users will also be able to appeal directly to Ofcom. Ofcom will issue codes of practice outlining the systems and processes that companies need to adopt in order to be compliant. The government has already published codes on terrorism and child sexual exploitation because of their serious nature. The largest and most popular social-media sites - described as category-one services - will need to state explicitly in their terms and conditions how they will address so-called legal harms. Ofcom will be able to issue fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of global turnover, whichever is higher, if firms fail to comply with the new rules. It will also have the power to block access to sites in the UK, the government said. The death of Molly Russell prompted calls for tougher rules to be imposed on online services used by teenagers Some campaigners do not think so. Tech entrepreneur Belinda Parmar said: ""The ambition is great. The regulator is going to have teeth, but no codes of practice for non-legal harms have yet been published, and it is all very vague."" Others have said fines do not go far enough, including the NSPCC which has called for the senior managers of tech firms to be made criminally liable for harmful content. Labour called the proposals ""watered down and incomplete"" and said the new rules would do ""very little"" to ensure children are safe online. The government has reserved the powers for Ofcom to pursue criminal action ""if tech companies fail to live up to their new responsibilities"". A review will take place two years after the new regime is operational. Ian Russell, father of Molly, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing thousands of posts about suicide and self-harm on social media, said he hoped the new law would ""focus the minds of the tech platforms"" to change their corporate culture and to reduce online harms. There has been frustration that the legislation, first conceived by Theresa May's government back in April 2019, has taken a long time to come to fruition. The bill will now be examined by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, whose chairman, Julian Knight, said it would be pressing for the legislation ""to be given top priority"".
