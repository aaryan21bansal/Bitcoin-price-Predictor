Hunt sets out no-deal pledge of Â£6bn for farmers,"This video can not be played Hunt: We must be clear about the facts of no deal Jeremy Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there is a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU. The Tory leadership contender said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September and then give the EU three weeks. He vowed to abandon talks after that if there was no ""immediate prospect"" of progress and move to a no-deal footing. His rival Boris Johnson has vowed to leave ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Compare the leadership candidates Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? Hunt's tax plans 'could cost up to Â£65bn' Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' If successful, Mr Hunt said he would ""engage"" with fellow EU leaders during August, and task a new negotiating team with producing an ""alternative exit deal"" - including ideas to solve the Irish border issue - to be published by the end of the month. At the same time, he said preparations for no deal would continue in earnest, and all leave for civil servants at government departments would be cancelled unless he received guarantees that no-deal planning was ""on time and on track"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the timeline Mr Hunt was setting out was very tight - especially given the notice the government's fiscal watchdog, the OBR, usually needs to prepare for a Budget.

The foreign secretary also warned MPs against attempting to block a no-deal Brexit, warning it could make it harder to get a new agreement by giving the EU ""misplaced confidence that we'll give ground"". He added that detailed preparation plans for no deal were needed to make it a ""credible threat"" to the EU, and give the UK ""leverage"" in the talks. In a direct challenge to his leadership rival, he said the chances of a no-deal Brexit were ""far from"" the million to one odds recently quoted by Boris Johnson, and it would not be possible to deliver it ""on a wing and a prayer"". A no-deal exit on 31 October remains the default position in UK law after MPs rejected the agreement Theresa May agreed with Brussels three times. If that does happen, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU under the basic World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Under these rules, the tariffs - the taxes on imported and exported goods - will be different to what the UK currently trades under, which means the cost to farmers to export products could change or they could be affected by competition from abroad. TheNational Farmers Union has said,externalBritish farming will be ""damaged"" if that happens. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: Who is the Conservative leadership contender? In a speech in London, Mr Hunt said a government led by him would cover the costs of the tariffs that would be imposed on the exports of the farming and fishing industries. He promised to create a temporary ""no deal relief programme"" - designed to be similar toUS President Donald Trump's promise of Â£16bnfor farmers affected by Chinese tariffs. What is no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? ""If you're a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fisherman in Peterhead I have a simple message for you,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I will mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short-term difficulties. ""If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now."" Farmers are worried about a no-deal Brexit, and this Â£6bn pledge comes on top of the undertaking by the government to pay farming subsidies at EU levels until 2022. Beef and lamb exports, for example, would face 40% tariffs in the case of no deal, and that would be after the EU had approved the UK as an exporter of animal products, which the National Farmers Union (NFU) says could take a minimum of six months. The UK exports about Â£14bn of agri-foods to the EU a year, so Jeremy Hunt's pledge would cover a lot of disruption but not the ""devastation"" that the NFU is warning of. Meanwhile, he would have to take care that this new regime did not fall foul of WTO rules on either state aid or export subsidies. Mr Johnson also promised to support the rural community after Brexit during a meeting with farmers in Cumbria last week, insisting farmers ""should be assured that we will support the rural community, with price support, efficiency payments, whatever"". Meanwhile, one of his leading backers, Health SecretaryMatt Hancock, told the Times,externalthe days of public sector ""pay freezes"" under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Mr Hancock said: ""People in the public sector need to be properly rewarded for the brilliant job they do."" ""Now that there's money available, we need to show the public sector some love,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Chris Mason's guide to the political life of Boris Johnson But during a campaign visit in Kent on Monday, Mr Johnson declined to make a detailed pledge on public sector pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He also defended his spending promises during the campaign so far, insisting he had a ""very carefully costed programme"". Analysis: Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It does all raise the question - where on earth is the cash for all these pledges going to come from? Have Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt discovered the proverbial ""magic money tree""? No, instead they're looking to dip into the chancellor's back pocket. Philip Hammond has suggested he has Â£26bn of what is called ""headroom"" in his current fiscal forecasts - basically, scope to borrow that much more - and Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt are saying they'd do just that. To many Tories this sits at odds with the thrust of Tory thinking. The other thing which makes the spending pledges slightly more dubious is that Mr Hammond says, ""Ok, I've got this headroom - but if we come out with no deal then all the money is going to have to be put into propping up the economy and getting us through that."" Both leadership contenders have unveiled plans to cut taxes and spend more, designed to win support for their candidacies, butquestions have been raised about how they would pay for the pledges. Earlier in the campaign, Mr Johnson said he wantedto raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax,predicting this would stimulate the economy, and increase government revenues. He has said he would partially fund some of his plans from ""fiscal headroom"" carved out by current Chancellor Philip Hammond in his current spending plans. This amount - estimated at Â£26.6bn at the spring statement - is an additional amount the UK could borrow without breaking self-imposed limits on government borrowing. The figure is based on projections that assume the UK left the European Union with a deal, but Mr Hammondhas warnedthat handling a no-deal exit would absorb that potential cash. ""Either we leave with no deal or we preserve our future fiscal space - we cannot do both"", he said last month, and on Monday, he reiterated that message. Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Party urges student finance shake-up,"Mr Farage said he was prepared to meet Boris Johnson in the ""de-militarised zone"" The Brexit Party has pledged to scrap all interest paid on student tuition fees as it steps up its preparations for a snap general election. Leader Nigel Farage told a rally in Birmingham rates of up to 6% on loans were ""outrageous"" and ""close to usury"". The party suggested it would go further and reimburse graduates for ""historic"" interest payments made on their loans. The party also unveiled the first 100 candidates selected to represent the party in the next general election. In anticipation of a snap poll this autumn, it said it hoped to have 650 candidates in place by the time the new Conservative leader is chosen at the end of July. The Brexit Party, which was launched by Mr Farage three months ago, topped the polls in May's European elections - getting 29 MEPs elected to Brussels. Mr Farage told activists at the Big Vision rally that his party should ""not be ashamed of being called an one-issue party"" by its rivals when that policy was delivering on the biggest democratic vote in the country's history. However, he told supporters that the party must not rest on its laurels after its electoral success and had to develop other policies as well as on Brexit. Encouraging party members to contribute their ideas, Mr Farage said that instead of a single party conference in September, it would be holding 11 regional rallies. By leaving the EU without a deal, axing HS2 and halving the overseas aid budget, Mr Farage claimed the party would free up to Â£200bn to spend on economic development outside London. The party would also demonstrate how ""passionate"" it was about helping young people by reducing the financial burden on graduates leaving university. Mr Farage said the current system in England and Wales, where interest charges begin to build up on loans as soon as a student begins at university and about Â£6,000 can be owed before a student even graduates, was ""unfair"" and young people deserved better. ""No wonder so many people in their middle to late 20s who want to buy houses, perhaps start families, feel financially they cannot do it,"" he said. ""Because they are paying interest rates which in the old days we would have called usury... It is outrageous, it is unfair and it has to end. ""We will use that Â£200bn to wipe away the interest on those debts, I suspect to the great relief of millions of young people in this country."" Earlier, Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice suggested the party would go further and ""cancel all of the historic interest that has been charged on student loans to date"". ""It is a serious pledge we are making to young people. We think it will be a much fairer system and the country can afford it."" A recent independent review of student financedid not recommend specific changes to interest charges while advocating a lowering in the maximum level of fees to Â£7,500. Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt has said any graduate who launches a start-up employing more than 10 people for five years should have all their loan repayments waived.

EU leaders split over top job in summit talks,"Rivals for the presidency, Margrethe Vestager (liberal, Danish); Frans Timmermans (centre-left, Dutch); Manfred Weber (centre-right, German) EU leaders meeting in Brussels remain divided over who should get the EU's top jobs, and talks have been suspended until Tuesday. They are arguing mainly over a successor to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They had hoped to get a deal on Sunday night. Diplomats say summit chair Donald Tusk proposed Dutch centre-left politician Frans Timmermans to succeed Mr Juncker. Centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva would replace Mr Tusk. Late on Sunday the summit was suspended so that Mr Tusk could hold bilateral talks, seeking a breakthrough. Talks then resumed over breakfast on Monday but were later suspended until 11:00 (09:00 GMT) Tuesday. The talks went on late into the night, testing the stamina of journalists Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said choosing the candidates was now more complicated because the May European elections had ended the traditional centre-left and centre-right dominance of EU politics. ""When you have not just two partners, but three or four, the issue is not clearly defined,"" Mrs Merkel told reporters, admitting that the disagreement ""looks bad"". ""But a compromise must be found - historically it's immaterial if this takes a bit longer."" The May elections saw big gains for the liberals - including Mr Macron's alliance - and Greens, as well as for nationalists. But no group has a majority. What are the clear trends from EU elections? President Macron told reporters: ""we must learn from this setback - we're projecting an image of Europe which isn't serious, and we need better preparation for these meetings"". He lamented that ""what's lacking is a feeling and duty to defend Europe as a whole"". The rare Sunday summit was called because EU leaders failed on 20 June to agree on candidates for the Commission president's job and other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk); High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini); European Parliament president and European Central Bank president. This video can not be played Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins calls for national and gender balance Ms Georgieva was proposed to succeed Mr Tusk. She is an economist and ex-EU Commissioner, who has been chief executive of the World Bank since 2017. Mr Juncker's successor to run the Commission will be responsible for proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. But Mr Timmermans, currently a deputy to Mr Juncker, faces stiff opposition from eastern European states and centre-right leaders from the EU's biggest political group, the European People's Party (EPP). In the proposed compromise, the EPP's candidate to head the Commission, Germany's Manfred Weber, would instead become European Parliament president. He might split the five-year term with liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt. The deal would put a liberal in charge of EU foreign policy, either Danish EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager or Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. All of the EU's top jobs are changing hands this year, after the May elections. The BBC's Adam Fleming in Brussels writes: The first priority for EU leaders (and reporters) is to get some sleep after more than 17 hours of debating, haggling, guessing, fighting and fruitlessly searching for compromise. The next is to agree a package of candidates for the top jobs before the European Parliament presses ahead and elects its president on Wednesday, which would reduce the national leaders' room for manoeuvre, by allocating one of the prizes. Of course the deadlock will be broken at some point - there will be a candidate for the job of Commission president eventually, and it probably won't even be a surprise. Old hands say this is nothing new. But plenty of people have started to ask whether this way of making decisions is sustainable, in a fragmented EU where no single person, party, institution or ideology has the power to make things happen. The choices have to take account of the elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The European Parliament wants the leaders to stick to the ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) procedure launched in 2014, under which those nominated by the most successful parties in the elections get the top posts. But President Macron is among those opposing the EPP's Manfred Weber and the ""Spitzenkandidat"" process. This video can not be played Who's in the running for Juncker's post and other EU top jobs? Politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania meanwhile dislike the way Mr Timmermans, a veteran of Brussels politics, hasenforced the EU rule of law policy. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? Hungary's government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs tweeted,externalthat appointing Mr Timmermans to the top EU job was ""completely unacceptable"". The top EU appointments - especially for Commission chief - sharpen not only national rivalries but also those between the European Council and the European Parliament, which is the only directly elected EU institution. Mr Macron stressed the need to nominate two men and two women for the four key posts. The fifth - parliament president - is mainly in the hands of MEPs. The EU's Donald Tusk and Federica Mogherini will both have left by December The EU treaties say the government leaders - the European Council - have to nominate a Commission president, then MEPs vote on that candidate. The choice is made by qualified majority - that is: if 72% of member states vote in favour (21 out of the 28) and those states represent at least 65% of the total EU population The pressure is on: at their 15-18 July session, MEPs are to vote on the EU leaders' nominee, who is to take office on 1 November. The European Council president is to be elected by the EU leaders by qualified majority, and should take office on 1 December. He/she chairs EU summits and steers the bloc's broad strategy, while the Commission deals with the fine details. The High Representative for foreign policy runs the EU External Action Service (EEAS), dealing with major challenges such as Iran's nuclear programme, Kosovo and EU interventions in Africa. A favourite to become ECB president, taking over from Mario Draghi, is Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank. The ECB had to calm markets during the eurozone crisis and manage Greece's severe debt problems. The bank has enormous influence, given continuing concern about the euro. The European Parliament president steers MEPs' debates and their votes on most EU legislation. 'My job's hell': Who'll be next EC president?

Tory leadership rivals pledge to safeguard union Hunt 'could withhold part of EU divorce bill' Hunt 'would give Johnson cabinet job' Mr Hunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he would also use the ""war chest"" built up by Chancellor Philip Hammond but conceded some of his spending priorities would ""have to wait"" if the UK left without a deal - as the money would be needed to support businesses affected. The 160,000 Conservative Party members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. The issue of when the UK leaves the EU remains a key dividing line in the contest. Asked to guarantee that Brexit would happen by the end of 2019, Mr Hunt insisted the UK would leave sooner under his leadership as he was best placed to get an improved deal that could break the impasse in Parliament. While a no-deal Brexit must be a last-resort, he said the UK would make a success of it and no-one should doubt his willingness to go down that route if necessary. Mr Johnson said the contest was far from over ""The difference between me and Boris is not as big as people are saying,"" he said. ""At the beginning of October, if there is no prospect of a deal that can get through parliament, then I will leave at the end of October because that is our democratic promise to the British people."" Mr Johnson said he would take ""personal responsibility"" for ensuring the UK leaves by 31 October, with or without a deal, as the current ""drift and dither"" could not continue. Asked whether he was willing to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit, he said he did not ""like the idea"" but MPs must accept ""responsibility"" given the grave situation. But Tory MP Guto Bebb said neither candidates' Brexit politics would command legitimacy unless the public were given their say in another referendum. The candidates continue to be questioned on the affordability of their tax and spending plans. Mr Hunt claimed the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank had got its figures wrong after it said his plans would ""exacerbate"" the pressures on the public finances. Earlier in the Tory leadership race, Mr Hammond wrote to all the contenders to say the next prime minister would potentially have an extra Â£15bn in ""available borrowing capacity"" to spend in 2020-21, rising to Â£25bn in 2023-24, while keeping within the existing fiscal rules. But he said these sums were dependent on avoiding a no-deal Brexit and warned them against endangering the Tories' ""hard-won reputation for fiscal and economic competence"" by abandoning debt and deficit targets. Mr Hunt said he agreed with his colleague and greater prudence would be required if the UK ended up leaving without a deal. ""If we had a no-deal Brexit, some of these spending commitments would have to wait because you would need to divert money to support businesses up and down the country. ""They would take longer because you would not have that money at your fingertips."" But the foreign secretary said he was still committed, whatever the Brexit outcome, to cutting corporation tax from its current rate of 19% to 12.5%. ""It is not the tax cut people are talking about on the doorstep but it is the one which would fire up the economy in a way that would be helpful in a no-deal context,"" he said. Mr Johnson, whose pledge to reduce the tax burdenfor those earning up to Â£80,000has caused controversy, insisted his immediate focus was on ensuring those at the bottom end of the income scale paid less or no national insurance (NI) altogether. Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? ""I think we should be looking at lifting people on low incomes out of tax, lifting the thresholds for national insurance and I would remind you that that's where my priority is,"" he said. ""When I was mayor of London we led the way, for instance, with the London living wage and I think lifting NI contribution thresholds would be another good thing to do."" Mr Johnson said he would use the existing ""headroom"" in the public finances to increase investment in special needs education as part of a Â£4.6bn boost to overall school funding. Asked how this would be paid for, he replied: ""I'm prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility and keep going with the general trajectory of ensuring that this country pays its way and lives within its means. ""But you can do that with some sensible tax cuts that will stimulate growth, stimulate enterprise, get more revenue in."" Do you have any questions about Brexit?

Hunt sets out no-deal pledge of Â£6bn for farmersTory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt compares the Brexit plans to the bailout for banks in 2008.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Hunt: We must be clear about the facts of no deal Jeremy Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there is a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU. The Tory leadership contender said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September and then give the EU three weeks. He vowed to abandon talks after that if there was no ""immediate prospect"" of progress and move to a no-deal footing. His rival Boris Johnson has vowed to leave ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Compare the leadership candidates Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? Hunt's tax plans 'could cost up to Â£65bn' Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' If successful, Mr Hunt said he would ""engage"" with fellow EU leaders during August, and task a new negotiating team with producing an ""alternative exit deal"" - including ideas to solve the Irish border issue - to be published by the end of the month. At the same time, he said preparations for no deal would continue in earnest, and all leave for civil servants at government departments would be cancelled unless he received guarantees that no-deal planning was ""on time and on track"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the timeline Mr Hunt was setting out was very tight - especially given the notice the government's fiscal watchdog, the OBR, usually needs to prepare for a Budget.

The foreign secretary also warned MPs against attempting to block a no-deal Brexit, warning it could make it harder to get a new agreement by giving the EU ""misplaced confidence that we'll give ground"". He added that detailed preparation plans for no deal were needed to make it a ""credible threat"" to the EU, and give the UK ""leverage"" in the talks. In a direct challenge to his leadership rival, he said the chances of a no-deal Brexit were ""far from"" the million to one odds recently quoted by Boris Johnson, and it would not be possible to deliver it ""on a wing and a prayer"". A no-deal exit on 31 October remains the default position in UK law after MPs rejected the agreement Theresa May agreed with Brussels three times. If that does happen, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU under the basic World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Under these rules, the tariffs - the taxes on imported and exported goods - will be different to what the UK currently trades under, which means the cost to farmers to export products could change or they could be affected by competition from abroad. TheNational Farmers Union has said,externalBritish farming will be ""damaged"" if that happens. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: Who is the Conservative leadership contender? In a speech in London, Mr Hunt said a government led by him would cover the costs of the tariffs that would be imposed on the exports of the farming and fishing industries. He promised to create a temporary ""no deal relief programme"" - designed to be similar toUS President Donald Trump's promise of Â£16bnfor farmers affected by Chinese tariffs. What is no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? ""If you're a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fisherman in Peterhead I have a simple message for you,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I will mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short-term difficulties. ""If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now."" Farmers are worried about a no-deal Brexit, and this Â£6bn pledge comes on top of the undertaking by the government to pay farming subsidies at EU levels until 2022. Beef and lamb exports, for example, would face 40% tariffs in the case of no deal, and that would be after the EU had approved the UK as an exporter of animal products, which the National Farmers Union (NFU) says could take a minimum of six months. The UK exports about Â£14bn of agri-foods to the EU a year, so Jeremy Hunt's pledge would cover a lot of disruption but not the ""devastation"" that the NFU is warning of. Meanwhile, he would have to take care that this new regime did not fall foul of WTO rules on either state aid or export subsidies. Mr Johnson also promised to support the rural community after Brexit during a meeting with farmers in Cumbria last week, insisting farmers ""should be assured that we will support the rural community, with price support, efficiency payments, whatever"". Meanwhile, one of his leading backers, Health SecretaryMatt Hancock, told the Times,externalthe days of public sector ""pay freezes"" under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Mr Hancock said: ""People in the public sector need to be properly rewarded for the brilliant job they do."" ""Now that there's money available, we need to show the public sector some love,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Chris Mason's guide to the political life of Boris Johnson But during a campaign visit in Kent on Monday, Mr Johnson declined to make a detailed pledge on public sector pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He also defended his spending promises during the campaign so far, insisting he had a ""very carefully costed programme"". Analysis: Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It does all raise the question - where on earth is the cash for all these pledges going to come from? Have Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt discovered the proverbial ""magic money tree""? No, instead they're looking to dip into the chancellor's back pocket. Philip Hammond has suggested he has Â£26bn of what is called ""headroom"" in his current fiscal forecasts - basically, scope to borrow that much more - and Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt are saying they'd do just that. To many Tories this sits at odds with the thrust of Tory thinking. The other thing which makes the spending pledges slightly more dubious is that Mr Hammond says, ""Ok, I've got this headroom - but if we come out with no deal then all the money is going to have to be put into propping up the economy and getting us through that."" Both leadership contenders have unveiled plans to cut taxes and spend more, designed to win support for their candidacies, butquestions have been raised about how they would pay for the pledges. Earlier in the campaign, Mr Johnson said he wantedto raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax,predicting this would stimulate the economy, and increase government revenues. He has said he would partially fund some of his plans from ""fiscal headroom"" carved out by current Chancellor Philip Hammond in his current spending plans. This amount - estimated at Â£26.6bn at the spring statement - is an additional amount the UK could borrow without breaking self-imposed limits on government borrowing. The figure is based on projections that assume the UK left the European Union with a deal, but Mr Hammondhas warnedthat handling a no-deal exit would absorb that potential cash. ""Either we leave with no deal or we preserve our future fiscal space - we cannot do both"", he said last month, and on Monday, he reiterated that message. Allow Twitter content?

Sources close to Mr Hunt have also suggested he would use this ""headroom"" to partially fund hispledge to boost defence spendingby Â£15bn over the next five years. But economist Paul Johnson, from think thank the Institute for Fiscal Studies,pointed out,externalthat the Â£26.6bn is ""a one-year target so can't fund permanent tax cuts/spending increases"". Speaking on Sunday, Mr Johnson said he would be prepared to borrow more to finance ""great objectives"" in his spending plan, whilst keeping ""fiscal responsibility"". He told Sky News there was up to Â£25bn ""available"" in the short term, due to the improved state of the public finances, which ""we intend to use"" on education, policing and broadband rather than reducing the deficit.

"Brewers 'let down' by alcohol lawsMany in the NI hospitality industry are seeking ""urgent action"" to liberalise alcohol legislation.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Alcohol licensing laws ""need to change"" It's going to be a long, hot summer for alcohol brewers in Northern Ireland who say they feel let down by ""restrictive"" alcohol licensing legislation. The current law means local alcohol producers cannot allow their product to be sampled or sold where they are made, because breweries are not allowed to apply for a licence to sell alcohol. There are certain types of establishment - including pubs, restaurants, hotels and indoor arenas - which are allowed to apply for a licence, which is needed to sell alcohol to the public. But breweries are not included on this list. Major political parties in Northern Ireland have pledged commitment to the liberalisation of laws, but with the lack of devolved government, change does not look likely anytime soon. NI alcohol licensing laws 'horrendous' In May, the Department for Communities concluded, following a public consultation, that changing the laws to allow the supply of alcohol at ""special events"" would be beneficial to the economy. The department considered that the move would benefit the hospitality and tourism sectors in Northern Ireland, particularly ahead of the 148th Open in Portrush in July. However, many in the hospitality industry complained this move did not go far enough. William Mayne, 26, is the owner and founder of Bullhouse brewery William Mayne, who gave up an office job two years ago to start a brewery business, sees the current restrictions in alcohol licensing laws as problematic. ""The current act is based on regulations from 1902 and you can feel that reflected in legislation,"" the Newtownards man told BBC News NI. ""Breweries aren't on the list of businesses allowed to have an alcohol licence. There is a restriction on the amount of licensed pubs that are allowed in Northern Ireland. ""For you to get a licence, you have to buy one off someone who is closing down their pub which then puts big monetary value on it. ""Most pubs cannot afford a licence, so they get tied into contract with big multinational brewers, but then they can only sell their product on the bar, meaning access to our markets are severely restricted."" This means smaller brewers find it difficult to sell their products through pubs and are completely barred from selling them from their own business premises. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two and half years A bill which would have led to changes in alcohol licensing lawwas introduced in the Stormont assembly in 2016. But the assembly collapsed in January 2017amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Northern Ireland has now been without a devolved government for more than two-and-a-half years. Mr Mayne has been working alongside other Northern Ireland businesses to lobby the Department for Communities to push through change. ""With the Open, there was talk of licensing being amended, but the Department for Communities has been very reluctant to put any legislation on the table,"" he said. ""It looks unlikely that breweries will be added to licensing lists, so we feel let down by the department and legislation because Northern Ireland is not a competitive market place."" For Matthew Dick, of Boundary Brewery in east Belfast, the liberalisation of alcohol licensing laws would be ""life changing"". ""If the laws changed tomorrow, we would be able to triple our work force,"" he said. ""Our turnover would increase six or seven times, we could employ more people and pay our current staff more."" After launching a campaign calling on the Department for Communities to push through urgent reform of alcohol licensing laws, Hospitality Ulster said it had received cross-party support for change. ""We have now received written confirmation from the five main political parties that legislation will be a priority on the restoration of the assembly,"" said Hospitality Ulster's chief executive, Colin Neill. ""The political parties are now on record with their commitment and we look forward to swift and effective legislative progress. ""It remains in our interest that Stormont gets back up and running."" In a letter to Hospitality Ulster, UUP leader Robin Swann said his party knew alcohol licensing laws needed to be modernised. ""The UUP remain committed to supporting the hospitality and tourism industry and are committed to introducing a new bill for the modernisation of licensing laws within six months of a new assembly being established,"" said the letter.

EU leaders gather to decide who gets top jobs,"Rivals for the presidency, Margrethe Vestager (liberal, Danish); Frans Timmermans (centre-left, Dutch); Manfred Weber (centre-right, German) EU leaders meeting in Brussels remain divided over who should get the EU's top jobs, and talks have been suspended until Tuesday. They are arguing mainly over a successor to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They had hoped to get a deal on Sunday night. Diplomats say summit chair Donald Tusk proposed Dutch centre-left politician Frans Timmermans to succeed Mr Juncker. Centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva would replace Mr Tusk. Late on Sunday the summit was suspended so that Mr Tusk could hold bilateral talks, seeking a breakthrough. Talks then resumed over breakfast on Monday but were later suspended until 11:00 (09:00 GMT) Tuesday. The talks went on late into the night, testing the stamina of journalists Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said choosing the candidates was now more complicated because the May European elections had ended the traditional centre-left and centre-right dominance of EU politics. ""When you have not just two partners, but three or four, the issue is not clearly defined,"" Mrs Merkel told reporters, admitting that the disagreement ""looks bad"". ""But a compromise must be found - historically it's immaterial if this takes a bit longer."" The May elections saw big gains for the liberals - including Mr Macron's alliance - and Greens, as well as for nationalists. But no group has a majority. What are the clear trends from EU elections? President Macron told reporters: ""we must learn from this setback - we're projecting an image of Europe which isn't serious, and we need better preparation for these meetings"". He lamented that ""what's lacking is a feeling and duty to defend Europe as a whole"". The rare Sunday summit was called because EU leaders failed on 20 June to agree on candidates for the Commission president's job and other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk); High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini); European Parliament president and European Central Bank president. This video can not be played Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins calls for national and gender balance Ms Georgieva was proposed to succeed Mr Tusk. She is an economist and ex-EU Commissioner, who has been chief executive of the World Bank since 2017. Mr Juncker's successor to run the Commission will be responsible for proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. But Mr Timmermans, currently a deputy to Mr Juncker, faces stiff opposition from eastern European states and centre-right leaders from the EU's biggest political group, the European People's Party (EPP). In the proposed compromise, the EPP's candidate to head the Commission, Germany's Manfred Weber, would instead become European Parliament president. He might split the five-year term with liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt. The deal would put a liberal in charge of EU foreign policy, either Danish EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager or Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. All of the EU's top jobs are changing hands this year, after the May elections. The BBC's Adam Fleming in Brussels writes: The first priority for EU leaders (and reporters) is to get some sleep after more than 17 hours of debating, haggling, guessing, fighting and fruitlessly searching for compromise. The next is to agree a package of candidates for the top jobs before the European Parliament presses ahead and elects its president on Wednesday, which would reduce the national leaders' room for manoeuvre, by allocating one of the prizes. Of course the deadlock will be broken at some point - there will be a candidate for the job of Commission president eventually, and it probably won't even be a surprise. Old hands say this is nothing new. But plenty of people have started to ask whether this way of making decisions is sustainable, in a fragmented EU where no single person, party, institution or ideology has the power to make things happen. The choices have to take account of the elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The European Parliament wants the leaders to stick to the ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) procedure launched in 2014, under which those nominated by the most successful parties in the elections get the top posts. But President Macron is among those opposing the EPP's Manfred Weber and the ""Spitzenkandidat"" process. This video can not be played Who's in the running for Juncker's post and other EU top jobs? Politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania meanwhile dislike the way Mr Timmermans, a veteran of Brussels politics, hasenforced the EU rule of law policy. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? Hungary's government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs tweeted,externalthat appointing Mr Timmermans to the top EU job was ""completely unacceptable"". The top EU appointments - especially for Commission chief - sharpen not only national rivalries but also those between the European Council and the European Parliament, which is the only directly elected EU institution. Mr Macron stressed the need to nominate two men and two women for the four key posts. The fifth - parliament president - is mainly in the hands of MEPs. The EU's Donald Tusk and Federica Mogherini will both have left by December The EU treaties say the government leaders - the European Council - have to nominate a Commission president, then MEPs vote on that candidate. The choice is made by qualified majority - that is: if 72% of member states vote in favour (21 out of the 28) and those states represent at least 65% of the total EU population The pressure is on: at their 15-18 July session, MEPs are to vote on the EU leaders' nominee, who is to take office on 1 November. The European Council president is to be elected by the EU leaders by qualified majority, and should take office on 1 December. He/she chairs EU summits and steers the bloc's broad strategy, while the Commission deals with the fine details. The High Representative for foreign policy runs the EU External Action Service (EEAS), dealing with major challenges such as Iran's nuclear programme, Kosovo and EU interventions in Africa. A favourite to become ECB president, taking over from Mario Draghi, is Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank. The ECB had to calm markets during the eurozone crisis and manage Greece's severe debt problems. The bank has enormous influence, given continuing concern about the euro. The European Parliament president steers MEPs' debates and their votes on most EU legislation. 'My job's hell': Who'll be next EC president?

Hunt would back no-deal Brexit with 'heavy heart',"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he would leave the EU without a deal, but find support for companies affected Jeremy Hunt has said he would back a no-deal Brexit with a ""heavy heart"" but would, unlike Tory rival Boris Johnson, not commit to a deadline for leaving. He told the BBC leaving the EU was a ""democratic promise"" that must be kept, whatever the economic repercussions. But he said the quickest way to leave was via a new deal and guaranteeing a specific exit date was a ""fake debate"". The leadership candidates have also defended their plans for more spending on public services and tax cuts. Mr Johnson, who is the frontrunner in the race to be the new Conservative leader, and the UK's next prime minister, told Sky News he would be prepared to borrow more to spend on vital national infrastructure. He told the Sophy Ridge programme there was up to Â£25bn ""available"" in the short term, due to the improved state of the public finances, which ""we intend to use"" on education, policing and broadband rather than reducing the deficit. Tory leadership rivals pledge to safeguard union Hunt 'could withhold part of EU divorce bill' Hunt 'would give Johnson cabinet job' Mr Hunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he would also use the ""war chest"" built up by Chancellor Philip Hammond but conceded some of his spending priorities would ""have to wait"" if the UK left without a deal - as the money would be needed to support businesses affected. The 160,000 Conservative Party members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. The issue of when the UK leaves the EU remains a key dividing line in the contest. Asked to guarantee that Brexit would happen by the end of 2019, Mr Hunt insisted the UK would leave sooner under his leadership as he was best placed to get an improved deal that could break the impasse in Parliament. While a no-deal Brexit must be a last-resort, he said the UK would make a success of it and no-one should doubt his willingness to go down that route if necessary. Mr Johnson said the contest was far from over ""The difference between me and Boris is not as big as people are saying,"" he said. ""At the beginning of October, if there is no prospect of a deal that can get through parliament, then I will leave at the end of October because that is our democratic promise to the British people."" Mr Johnson said he would take ""personal responsibility"" for ensuring the UK leaves by 31 October, with or without a deal, as the current ""drift and dither"" could not continue. Asked whether he was willing to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit, he said he did not ""like the idea"" but MPs must accept ""responsibility"" given the grave situation. But Tory MP Guto Bebb said neither candidates' Brexit politics would command legitimacy unless the public were given their say in another referendum. The candidates continue to be questioned on the affordability of their tax and spending plans. Mr Hunt claimed the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank had got its figures wrong after it said his plans would ""exacerbate"" the pressures on the public finances. Earlier in the Tory leadership race, Mr Hammond wrote to all the contenders to say the next prime minister would potentially have an extra Â£15bn in ""available borrowing capacity"" to spend in 2020-21, rising to Â£25bn in 2023-24, while keeping within the existing fiscal rules. But he said these sums were dependent on avoiding a no-deal Brexit and warned them against endangering the Tories' ""hard-won reputation for fiscal and economic competence"" by abandoning debt and deficit targets. Mr Hunt said he agreed with his colleague and greater prudence would be required if the UK ended up leaving without a deal. ""If we had a no-deal Brexit, some of these spending commitments would have to wait because you would need to divert money to support businesses up and down the country. ""They would take longer because you would not have that money at your fingertips."" But the foreign secretary said he was still committed, whatever the Brexit outcome, to cutting corporation tax from its current rate of 19% to 12.5%. ""It is not the tax cut people are talking about on the doorstep but it is the one which would fire up the economy in a way that would be helpful in a no-deal context,"" he said. Mr Johnson, whose pledge to reduce the tax burdenfor those earning up to Â£80,000has caused controversy, insisted his immediate focus was on ensuring those at the bottom end of the income scale paid less or no national insurance (NI) altogether. Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? ""I think we should be looking at lifting people on low incomes out of tax, lifting the thresholds for national insurance and I would remind you that that's where my priority is,"" he said. ""When I was mayor of London we led the way, for instance, with the London living wage and I think lifting NI contribution thresholds would be another good thing to do."" Mr Johnson said he would use the existing ""headroom"" in the public finances to increase investment in special needs education as part of a Â£4.6bn boost to overall school funding. Asked how this would be paid for, he replied: ""I'm prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility and keep going with the general trajectory of ensuring that this country pays its way and lives within its means. ""But you can do that with some sensible tax cuts that will stimulate growth, stimulate enterprise, get more revenue in."" Do you have any questions about Brexit?

'Those of us who are blessed must pay more tax'A member of one of America's richest families tells the BBC why paying more tax is her moral duty.,"Liesel Pritzker Simmons and husband Ian Simmons run an investment firm focussing on social enterprises Liesel Pritzker Simmons is fabulously wealthy. But this member of one of America's richest families is also uneasy about it. ""It's time for us who are blessed with unusual financial success or luck to contribute more to our common good and common future,"" she told the BBC. ""The best way that we in this fortunate bubble can contribute is that we want to be taxed more."" Ms Pritzker Simmons accepts it's a rather unorthodox view. Butthis week she, and 17 other super-rich individuals, set out their reasons in an open letter,external. America's economic and social ills have created a crisis for the young, the poor, and the environment, they said. We don't have all the answers, but we can help: Impose a wealth tax on us - it's our moral and patriotic duty to hand over a bigger slice of our fortunes. With her husband Ian, an heir to a family fortune himself, they discussed going public with people they knew held similar concerns. Investor George Soros, Facebook's co-founder Chris Hughes, and Disney heiress Abigail Disney, were among those signing up. ""There could have been more"", Mr Simmons said. ""We just wanted to pull in enough names to get the conversation going."" They are not wedded to a particular proposal, but one suggestion was this: Add a tax of two cents per dollar on assets after a $50m exemption, and one cent per dollar tax on assets above $1bn. It would generate nearly $3tn in revenue over ten years, they said. Newspaper columnists and Twitter's angry brigade came out in force to criticise and mock this ""billionaires club with a conscience"" and bunch of privileged misguided do-gooders. ""This is an uncomfortable conversation. We recognise that,"" said Ms Pritzker Simmons, whose family built their fortune on the Hyatt hotel group. She's no desire to become a campaigning figurehead. Nor are any of them after a ""pat on the back"". Anyway, she's had her share of headlines already, starting as a celebrated child actor in the Oscar-nominated A Little Princess and then as the daughter to Harrison Ford's US President in Air Force One. (A young Jodie Foster, he called her). There was then a bitter court battle in which she successfully sued the family estate over her inheritance, reportedly securing $500m. Now 35 years old, she describes herself as ""quite a private person"", running an investment firm with her husband that focuses on social and environmental enterprises. So why go public now? The idea of a wealth tax is gaining credence in the Democratic Party, and with the presidential debates underway it was felt now was the time to intervene. Ms Pritzker Simmons said: ""We just wanted to go on the record and say: please don't be timid about tax reform because you're afraid that this class of people is going to get upset. ""There's a healthy group of us who absolutely are in favour of it [a wealth tax], and we wanted to make that really clear to politicians and future politicians, as well as the American people."" US super-rich call for wealth tax US economy under Trump: Is it the greatest in history? In recent years, members of the mega-rich class have individually voiced worries about the wealth imbalance, including Warren Buffett. But the signatories hope their letter will prompt a group momentum. Already the Swiss-born US-based billionaire Hansjoerg Wyss has added his name to the letter, and the property and insurance magnate Eli Broadhas written of his support.,external But they are not going unchallenged. Conservative US television talk show host Laura Ingraham was among the first out the blocks with a tweet that summed up the counter-view of many. ""If these billionaires think they pay too little in taxes, why not just send more money to the IRS? Or are they not smart enough to figure that out?"" she tweeted her near-three million followers. That misses the point, says Mr Simmons, 44. Writing a cheque to the Treasury is just philanthropy, and you can't address the challenges facing society based on the whim of rich people giving money away. A young Liesel Matthews (her stage name) with Air Force One co-stars Harrison Ford and Wendy Crewson ""I don't think philanthropy is going to fix systemic wealth inequality, and nor do most economists who study inequality,"" he said. He's not dismissing philanthropy. He and his wife do their bit. ""But the good intentions of the few are not a substitute for good rules for everyone. Having a few of us write a few more cheques to the Treasury is not going to create universal childcare or take a revolutionary approach to the climate crisis or retire student debt."" Nor do they want the extra money ring-fenced for specific projects. ""It's up to our government - that's what tax is for,"" Ms Pritzker Simmons said. ""There are things that I personally care about, but [ring-fencing] betrays the purpose of a tax that benefits everybody."" She's convinced they're tapping into a new mood among voters: ""We've watched a couple of generations of trickle-down economics, and it's not working. There is a change in mood, but it's based on solid data that shows things are not working."" Donald Trump - who once proposed a one-off wealth tax to tackle America's debt - points to Wall Street's record-breaking stock markets as evidence things are, in fact, working. ""It's not a very compelling argument to the half of Americans who have absolutely no exposure to the stock market,"" she said. She says voters - Republican and Democrat - are increasingly demanding action, which is why people who say Congress would never pass a wealth tax are wrong. And while the rich can hide or undervalue assets, that's not an argument for doing nothing. As she puts it: ""Are you really going to leave 50 cents on the table because you can't get the dollar."" America's top tier is not going to suffer after paying a bit more into the system, she said. ""We will continue to have an incredibly fortunate life. If this [a wealth tax] is considered a hardship, then I think we're pretty lucky.""

"EU leaders gather to decide who gets top jobsThe key posts need to be decided, with centre-left Frans Timmermans tipped to head the Commission.Europe","Rivals for the presidency, Margrethe Vestager (liberal, Danish); Frans Timmermans (centre-left, Dutch); Manfred Weber (centre-right, German) EU leaders meeting in Brussels remain divided over who should get the EU's top jobs, and talks have been suspended until Tuesday. They are arguing mainly over a successor to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They had hoped to get a deal on Sunday night. Diplomats say summit chair Donald Tusk proposed Dutch centre-left politician Frans Timmermans to succeed Mr Juncker. Centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva would replace Mr Tusk. Late on Sunday the summit was suspended so that Mr Tusk could hold bilateral talks, seeking a breakthrough. Talks then resumed over breakfast on Monday but were later suspended until 11:00 (09:00 GMT) Tuesday. The talks went on late into the night, testing the stamina of journalists Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said choosing the candidates was now more complicated because the May European elections had ended the traditional centre-left and centre-right dominance of EU politics. ""When you have not just two partners, but three or four, the issue is not clearly defined,"" Mrs Merkel told reporters, admitting that the disagreement ""looks bad"". ""But a compromise must be found - historically it's immaterial if this takes a bit longer."" The May elections saw big gains for the liberals - including Mr Macron's alliance - and Greens, as well as for nationalists. But no group has a majority. What are the clear trends from EU elections? President Macron told reporters: ""we must learn from this setback - we're projecting an image of Europe which isn't serious, and we need better preparation for these meetings"". He lamented that ""what's lacking is a feeling and duty to defend Europe as a whole"". The rare Sunday summit was called because EU leaders failed on 20 June to agree on candidates for the Commission president's job and other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk); High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini); European Parliament president and European Central Bank president. This video can not be played Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins calls for national and gender balance Ms Georgieva was proposed to succeed Mr Tusk. She is an economist and ex-EU Commissioner, who has been chief executive of the World Bank since 2017. Mr Juncker's successor to run the Commission will be responsible for proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. But Mr Timmermans, currently a deputy to Mr Juncker, faces stiff opposition from eastern European states and centre-right leaders from the EU's biggest political group, the European People's Party (EPP). In the proposed compromise, the EPP's candidate to head the Commission, Germany's Manfred Weber, would instead become European Parliament president. He might split the five-year term with liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt. The deal would put a liberal in charge of EU foreign policy, either Danish EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager or Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. All of the EU's top jobs are changing hands this year, after the May elections. The BBC's Adam Fleming in Brussels writes: The first priority for EU leaders (and reporters) is to get some sleep after more than 17 hours of debating, haggling, guessing, fighting and fruitlessly searching for compromise. The next is to agree a package of candidates for the top jobs before the European Parliament presses ahead and elects its president on Wednesday, which would reduce the national leaders' room for manoeuvre, by allocating one of the prizes. Of course the deadlock will be broken at some point - there will be a candidate for the job of Commission president eventually, and it probably won't even be a surprise. Old hands say this is nothing new. But plenty of people have started to ask whether this way of making decisions is sustainable, in a fragmented EU where no single person, party, institution or ideology has the power to make things happen. The choices have to take account of the elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The European Parliament wants the leaders to stick to the ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) procedure launched in 2014, under which those nominated by the most successful parties in the elections get the top posts. But President Macron is among those opposing the EPP's Manfred Weber and the ""Spitzenkandidat"" process. This video can not be played Who's in the running for Juncker's post and other EU top jobs? Politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania meanwhile dislike the way Mr Timmermans, a veteran of Brussels politics, hasenforced the EU rule of law policy. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? Hungary's government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs tweeted,externalthat appointing Mr Timmermans to the top EU job was ""completely unacceptable"". The top EU appointments - especially for Commission chief - sharpen not only national rivalries but also those between the European Council and the European Parliament, which is the only directly elected EU institution. Mr Macron stressed the need to nominate two men and two women for the four key posts. The fifth - parliament president - is mainly in the hands of MEPs. The EU's Donald Tusk and Federica Mogherini will both have left by December The EU treaties say the government leaders - the European Council - have to nominate a Commission president, then MEPs vote on that candidate. The choice is made by qualified majority - that is: if 72% of member states vote in favour (21 out of the 28) and those states represent at least 65% of the total EU population The pressure is on: at their 15-18 July session, MEPs are to vote on the EU leaders' nominee, who is to take office on 1 November. The European Council president is to be elected by the EU leaders by qualified majority, and should take office on 1 December. He/she chairs EU summits and steers the bloc's broad strategy, while the Commission deals with the fine details. The High Representative for foreign policy runs the EU External Action Service (EEAS), dealing with major challenges such as Iran's nuclear programme, Kosovo and EU interventions in Africa. A favourite to become ECB president, taking over from Mario Draghi, is Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank. The ECB had to calm markets during the eurozone crisis and manage Greece's severe debt problems. The bank has enormous influence, given continuing concern about the euro. The European Parliament president steers MEPs' debates and their votes on most EU legislation. 'My job's hell': Who'll be next EC president?

Should bike-sharing schemes provide helmets?,"Medics told Mr Edwards his helmet ""undoubtedly"" saved his life Bike-sharing schemes should provide helmets, according to a cyclist who survived a potentially fatal accident. Carl Edwards, of Treorchy, was told by medics he would have been killed had his helmet not taken the full impact of his fall when he was hit by a car. Three-quarters of all fatal or serious cyclist accidents happen in urban areas, where schemes such as nextbike and Santander Cycles are popular. However wearing a helmet while cycling is not a legal requirement. Changing that rule has become divisive in cycling. Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas, who launches the defence of his title next month, hasbacked calls to make helmets compulsory. Olympic gold medallist Geraint Thomas said cycling in some cities ""looks crazy"" And the importance of a helmet was brought home for Mr Edwards, of Treorchy, Rhondda. He was enjoying a cycle on Father's Day - 16 June - when he was hit by a car on a roundabout, ""thrown into the air"" and knocked unconscious after landing on the back of his head. The 50-year-old grandfather chipped a bone in his neck and suffered severe bruising to his lung, shoulder, hip and thigh, though regards himself ""lucky"". ""The medics in the air ambulance and the doctors at the hospital all said, if it wasn't for the helmet, I would be dead,"" he said. Paper bike helmet wins Dyson award How much room do cyclists need? 'A helmet saved my life' ""There was no question about it because the helmet took the full impact. ""I've always worn a helmet but it's only when something like that happens that you fully realise how valuable they are. ""I know it could have been so much worse."" Do the health and environmental benefits of promoting cycling outweigh the risk of putting people off with legislation? Nearly 4,000 cyclists were killed or seriously injured in the UK in 2017, latestfigures from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents,external(RoSPA) show. Studies show more than 70% of fatalities had moderate or serious head injuries. Most serious accidents happen in towns and cities where bike-sharing schemes have helped boost cyclist numbers. Nextbike has been so successful in Cardiff that it has announcedplans to double its network,externalwith 500 more bikes and 38 new docking stations. ""It's great that these schemes are getting so many people on bikes, because it cuts down on pollution and traffic. But I'm fed up with seeing people not wearing helmets, especially kids,"" said Mr Edwards. ""Twenty years ago helmets looked like a bucket with a strap and weren't cool. But now they're far more streamlined, better fitted and nicer designs. And they're not that expensive when it comes to potentially saving your life. ""I wouldn't mind seeing cyclists fined for not wearing them."" More than 10,000 journeys are made every week in Cardiff and Swansea on nextbike Bike-sharing companies say the logistics of providing helmets would be hugely problematic due to maintenance, loss or theft and the different needs of riders. At the moment, they are not legally obliged to do so. The British Medical Association (BMA) also supports making helmets compulsory but reserve the right to review the decision based on the evidence. While more than 18,000 cyclists were hurt in 2017, Cycling UK insists cycling remains relatively safe. Compulsory cycle helmets - what's the proof? Cyclists face tougher road safety laws It said: ""The risks of cycling are not exceptionally high and are very small relative to the health benefits. You are in fact as unlikely to be killed in a mile of cycling as in a mile of walking."" For example, of the 5,700 head injury cases among children (under 15) at UK hospitals in 2016, less than 1% were cyclists compared with 5% who were pedestrians. Cycling charities say more should be done to educate motorists and cyclists, improve and increase cycle lanes and provide safety in numbers for cyclists. Despite the protection provided, helmet wearing isn't a legal requirement in the UK. However riders are recommended to wear one by the Highway Code. The effectiveness of helmets depends on many factors such as speed, type of collision and impact Yes - but they don't make you immune to injury. The most recent andextensive overview of case-control studies,externalof the protective effect of cycle helmets was in 2016 by the Road Safety Institute in Holland. In these studies, 64,000 cycling casualties with and without helmets were compared. They estimate that the risk of severe head injury decreases by 69% and the risk of fatal head injury by 65%. However helmets offer little, if no, protection to the face and jaw and their effectiveness is still being questioned in accidents involving high speeds. The effectiveness of the helmet also depends on the type of collision and the surface that the helmet makes contact with. Plus, they do not prevent accidents happening in the first place. 2018 saw a record 10.5 million journeys taken on bike-share schemes in London More than half a million journeys have been taken in Wales on nextbike since the scheme began in May 2018. More than 57,000 people have registered in Cardiff and Swansea covering 445,000 miles (715,000 km), while nextbike has 237,081 members in 13 cities across the UK in 13 cities, including Glasgow, Belfast and Birmingham. The company says it takes rider safety ""very seriously"", strongly encourages the use of helmets and runs classes for new riders. Managing director Krysia Solheim said: ""Currently, UK regulation does not require the use of a helmet while riding a bike and so, instead, we seek to educate users on cycling safety through our website, but leave the decision about whether or not to wear a helmet down to the individual."" Last year Santander Cycles had a record 10.5 million journeys in London. Santander Cycles urges riders to stay safe by wearing bright clothes during the day and reflective clothing/accessories at night and to ""consider"" wearing a helmet. Charities say more should be done to make safe-cycle lanes in cities, rather than make helmets compulsory Charities are united in their opposition to making helmets compulsory due to concerns it will put people off cycling. They say the health and environmental benefits of physical activity out-weigh the risk of injury from cycling. Nick Lloyd, RoSPA acting head of road safety, said: ""We strongly support cycling and initiatives such a cycle-hire schemes (but) whilst we encourage people to wear a helmet, we would not wish this to be mandated as it might discourage people from cycling. ""A helmet will offer protection from head injury, especially when the speed and forces involved are low. However, it is important to provide segregated cycling facilities where possible to reduce the incidence of vehicle collision from happening."" Cycling UK believes there is ""no justification"",externalfor making helmet-wearing compulsory and says the effectiveness of helmets ""is far from clear"". Sustrans also said evidence is ""inconclusive"" as to whether helmets make cycling safer. It added: ""What does make cycling safe is changing the layout of roads, streets and public space to make them safer for people to get about by bike. ""Given the concerns about obesity and the deaths related to physical inactivity, making it compulsory for people to wear helmets provides a deterrent to people wanting to cycle and also sends the message that travel by bike is dangerous."" Helmets are compulsory in Australia - but has seen a decline in cycling numbers in some parts Australia was the first country in the world to make it compulsory to wear helmets while cycling, in 1990. Countries such as New Zealand, South Africa and certain states in USA and Canada followed while others, such as France, make it mandatory for children. However the rule was over-turned in Italy and blocked in Poland. Campaigners often point to a fall in cycling rates in places such as Australia and Seattle, where it is compulsory, to argue against legislation.

Sri Lanka hires first two hangmen in 43 years,"Protests took place outside the Welikada prison on Friday Sri Lanka has recruited two hangmen as it prepares to carry out four executions - the first in 43 years. It follows the president's announcement that four prisoners convicted of drug offences are to face the death penalty. The hanging will end a moratorium on capital punishment that has been in place since 1976. Over 100 candidates responded to an advert posted in February for executioners with ""strong moral character"". They needed to be Sri Lankan, male, aged 18-45 and possess ""mental strength"". State-owned media Daily News said two Americans and two women had also applied. A prisons spokesman said the two successful candidates needed to go through final training which would take about two weeks. Sri Lanka advertises for 'moral' hangmen Sri Lankan hangman resigns in shock Sri Lanka hires new hangmen The last hangman resigned five years ago after seeing the gallows and going into shock. Another was hired last year but did not show up to work. In Sri Lanka, rape, drug trafficking and murder are punishable by the death penalty but no executions have taken place since 1976. President Maithripala Sirisena said capital punishment was being reinstated to clamp down on the drugs trade in Sri Lanka. Political analysts say the move will boost his popularity in the lead-up to an election due to take place by the end of the year. Protesters accuse the president of using capital punishment to garner popularity among voters ""I have signed the death warrants of four,"" President Sirisena said. ""They have not been told yet. We don't want to announce the names yet because that could lead to unrest in prisons."" He said there were 200,000 drug addicts in the country and 60% of prisoners were in jail due to drugs charges. Along with the UK, France and Norway,the EU has condemned Sri Lanka's decision,externalto revive capital punishment. ""The death penalty is a cruel, inhuman and a degrading punishment, and the EU unequivocally opposes its use in all circumstances and all cases,"" the EU statement said. ""While the Sri Lankan authorities have cited the need to address drug-related offences, studies show that the death penalty fails to act as a deterrent to crime."" Amnesty International said it was ""shocked"" and ""outraged"" by the president's announcement and argued that executions for drug-related offences were unlawful because they did not meet the threshold for ""most serious crimes"", such as intentional killing. ""At a time when other countries have come to the realisation that their drug control policies are in need of reform, and are taking steps to reduce the use of the death penalty, Sri Lanka is bucking the trend,"" said Biraj Patnaik, AI's South Asia director. ""This will be devastating to the country's international reputation and we hope that President Sirisena will reconsider his decision,"" he added.

Network Rail bids for part of British Steel,"Network Rail is looking to buy part of British Steel, as bidders have until the end of Sunday to put in offers for all or part of the troubled firm. The railway infrastructure company has bid for British Steel's rail services business. State-owned Network Rail wants to take over the division responsible for the welding, finishing and storing of rails for the UK's train network. British Steel was placed in compulsory liquidation in May. Its collapse came after rescue talks between the government and former owner Greybull Capital, which was seeking a further loan of up to Â£75m, were unsuccessful. ""We have made an indicative offer for some railway critical assets although our overwhelming preference is that a purchaser for the entire business is found. We are very clear that our offer will not undermine that,"" said a Network Rail spokesman. ""Our role is to safely run the railway for the millions of people who rely on it every day and we are exploring all options to make sure we can continue to do that."" They added: ""We continue to support British Steel, working with the liquidator and any new owner of the company."" The move by Network Rail, as first reported in the Sunday Telegraph, is just one of about 10 bids likely to be submitted to the Official Receiver, which took control of British Steel last month. Network Rail owns and operates the UK's railway network, including 20,000 miles of track, and buys 100,000 tonnes of rails from British Steel each year. The UK government and the receiver are keen to sell British Steel in its entirety to one buyer, A closure of British Steel could jeopardise 25,000 jobs, including 5,000 employed by the firm in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and 20,000 in the supply chain. There are a further 800 workers on Teesside and in north-eastern England. Should a buyer not be found, the firm would be wound up. However, any further bids received next week could be considered. British Steel has been facing a tough global steel market, especially in competition to China, but it attributed its current woes to Brexit and tension between the US and China. It said it struggled with the weak pound, which took a dive after the Brexit referendum. It was also hit by an EU decision to suspend access to free carbon permits until a Brexit withdrawal deal can be hammered out. British Steel was given a Â£100m loan from the government to pay off an EU carbon bill in April.

Hunt 'could withhold part of EU divorce bill',"Prime ministerial hopeful Jeremy Hunt has said he would consider withholding some of the UK's Â£39bn EU ""divorce bill"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The foreign secretary told the Sunday Times he would not hand over ""a penny more than is legally required of us"". His leadership rival Boris Johnson told Sky's Sophy Ridge he would ""suspend"" the money until the UK got a new deal. He said he believed the EU would give ground to the UK as it had a ""powerful incentive"" to avoid a no-deal exit. With less than a month to go before the new Tory leader is elected, the two contenders have also been setting out details of their proposed new Brexit negotiating teams amid reports that Olly Robins, Theresa May's chief negotiator, is planning to stand down this summer. On the issue of the UK's ""divorce bill"", Mr Hunttold the Sunday Times,external""anyone who thinks I am going to write a blank cheque to the European Union is sorely mistaken"". ""As a businessman I always paid my bills. That being said, if we leave without a deal I will not hand over a penny more than is legally required of us."" Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn? Hunt 'would give Johnson cabinet job' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates The Institute for Government (IFG) think tank previously saidrefusing to pay could lead the EU to launch a legal challenge. But aHouse of Lords report,externalinto Brexit and the EU budget stated: ""While the legal advice we have received differed, the stronger argument suggests that the UK will not be strictly obliged, as a matter of law, to render any payments at all after leaving."" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says Mr Hunt knows that his voting to remain in the EU has not endeared him to some sections of the Conservative membership and is attempting to reassure them of his commitment to Brexit. Earlier this month, Mr Johnsontold the Sunday Times,externalhe would ""retain"" the financial settlement demanded by the EU until he had struck a deal more favourable thanTheresa May's Withdrawal Agreement,external, which has been rejected three times by MPs. Hunt: Next PM must be trustworthy Johnson defends Brexit plan and 'row' silence In his Sky interview, Mr Johnson said the ""drift and dither"" of the past three years could not continue and he would take personal responsibility for ""leading us out of this mess and getting Brexit done"" by the revised deadline of 31 October. Asked whether he would be willing to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit, he said he did not ""like the idea"" and was ""not remotely attracted to it"". But he said MPs ""have got to understand it's their responsibility to get this thing done"". Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson are taking part in 15 hustings across the country as Conservative Party members decide on their party's next leader - and the next UK prime minister. The 160,000 members will begin voting next week and the winner is expected to be announced on 23 July. Stephen Harper was prime minister of Canada for nearly 10 years before losing an election to Justin Trudeau in 2015 Mr Hunt's campaign team said he was in talks with the former Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, who he hopes could help to draw up plans for a deal similar to Canada's free trade agreement with the EU. In response, Mr Harper tweeted that he was willing to help whoever won the contest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brewers 'let down' by alcohol laws,"This video can not be played Alcohol licensing laws ""need to change"" It's going to be a long, hot summer for alcohol brewers in Northern Ireland who say they feel let down by ""restrictive"" alcohol licensing legislation. The current law means local alcohol producers cannot allow their product to be sampled or sold where they are made, because breweries are not allowed to apply for a licence to sell alcohol. There are certain types of establishment - including pubs, restaurants, hotels and indoor arenas - which are allowed to apply for a licence, which is needed to sell alcohol to the public. But breweries are not included on this list. Major political parties in Northern Ireland have pledged commitment to the liberalisation of laws, but with the lack of devolved government, change does not look likely anytime soon. NI alcohol licensing laws 'horrendous' In May, the Department for Communities concluded, following a public consultation, that changing the laws to allow the supply of alcohol at ""special events"" would be beneficial to the economy. The department considered that the move would benefit the hospitality and tourism sectors in Northern Ireland, particularly ahead of the 148th Open in Portrush in July. However, many in the hospitality industry complained this move did not go far enough. William Mayne, 26, is the owner and founder of Bullhouse brewery William Mayne, who gave up an office job two years ago to start a brewery business, sees the current restrictions in alcohol licensing laws as problematic. ""The current act is based on regulations from 1902 and you can feel that reflected in legislation,"" the Newtownards man told BBC News NI. ""Breweries aren't on the list of businesses allowed to have an alcohol licence. There is a restriction on the amount of licensed pubs that are allowed in Northern Ireland. ""For you to get a licence, you have to buy one off someone who is closing down their pub which then puts big monetary value on it. ""Most pubs cannot afford a licence, so they get tied into contract with big multinational brewers, but then they can only sell their product on the bar, meaning access to our markets are severely restricted."" This means smaller brewers find it difficult to sell their products through pubs and are completely barred from selling them from their own business premises. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two and half years A bill which would have led to changes in alcohol licensing lawwas introduced in the Stormont assembly in 2016. But the assembly collapsed in January 2017amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Northern Ireland has now been without a devolved government for more than two-and-a-half years. Mr Mayne has been working alongside other Northern Ireland businesses to lobby the Department for Communities to push through change. ""With the Open, there was talk of licensing being amended, but the Department for Communities has been very reluctant to put any legislation on the table,"" he said. ""It looks unlikely that breweries will be added to licensing lists, so we feel let down by the department and legislation because Northern Ireland is not a competitive market place."" For Matthew Dick, of Boundary Brewery in east Belfast, the liberalisation of alcohol licensing laws would be ""life changing"". ""If the laws changed tomorrow, we would be able to triple our work force,"" he said. ""Our turnover would increase six or seven times, we could employ more people and pay our current staff more."" After launching a campaign calling on the Department for Communities to push through urgent reform of alcohol licensing laws, Hospitality Ulster said it had received cross-party support for change. ""We have now received written confirmation from the five main political parties that legislation will be a priority on the restoration of the assembly,"" said Hospitality Ulster's chief executive, Colin Neill. ""The political parties are now on record with their commitment and we look forward to swift and effective legislative progress. ""It remains in our interest that Stormont gets back up and running."" In a letter to Hospitality Ulster, UUP leader Robin Swann said his party knew alcohol licensing laws needed to be modernised. ""The UUP remain committed to supporting the hospitality and tourism industry and are committed to introducing a new bill for the modernisation of licensing laws within six months of a new assembly being established,"" said the letter.

'Those of us who are blessed must pay more tax'A member of one of America's richest families tells the BBC why paying more tax is her moral duty.Business,"Liesel Pritzker Simmons and husband Ian Simmons run an investment firm focussing on social enterprises Liesel Pritzker Simmons is fabulously wealthy. But this member of one of America's richest families is also uneasy about it. ""It's time for us who are blessed with unusual financial success or luck to contribute more to our common good and common future,"" she told the BBC. ""The best way that we in this fortunate bubble can contribute is that we want to be taxed more."" Ms Pritzker Simmons accepts it's a rather unorthodox view. Butthis week she, and 17 other super-rich individuals, set out their reasons in an open letter,external. America's economic and social ills have created a crisis for the young, the poor, and the environment, they said. We don't have all the answers, but we can help: Impose a wealth tax on us - it's our moral and patriotic duty to hand over a bigger slice of our fortunes. With her husband Ian, an heir to a family fortune himself, they discussed going public with people they knew held similar concerns. Investor George Soros, Facebook's co-founder Chris Hughes, and Disney heiress Abigail Disney, were among those signing up. ""There could have been more"", Mr Simmons said. ""We just wanted to pull in enough names to get the conversation going."" They are not wedded to a particular proposal, but one suggestion was this: Add a tax of two cents per dollar on assets after a $50m exemption, and one cent per dollar tax on assets above $1bn. It would generate nearly $3tn in revenue over ten years, they said. Newspaper columnists and Twitter's angry brigade came out in force to criticise and mock this ""billionaires club with a conscience"" and bunch of privileged misguided do-gooders. ""This is an uncomfortable conversation. We recognise that,"" said Ms Pritzker Simmons, whose family built their fortune on the Hyatt hotel group. She's no desire to become a campaigning figurehead. Nor are any of them after a ""pat on the back"". Anyway, she's had her share of headlines already, starting as a celebrated child actor in the Oscar-nominated A Little Princess and then as the daughter to Harrison Ford's US President in Air Force One. (A young Jodie Foster, he called her). There was then a bitter court battle in which she successfully sued the family estate over her inheritance, reportedly securing $500m. Now 35 years old, she describes herself as ""quite a private person"", running an investment firm with her husband that focuses on social and environmental enterprises. So why go public now? The idea of a wealth tax is gaining credence in the Democratic Party, and with the presidential debates underway it was felt now was the time to intervene. Ms Pritzker Simmons said: ""We just wanted to go on the record and say: please don't be timid about tax reform because you're afraid that this class of people is going to get upset. ""There's a healthy group of us who absolutely are in favour of it [a wealth tax], and we wanted to make that really clear to politicians and future politicians, as well as the American people."" US super-rich call for wealth tax US economy under Trump: Is it the greatest in history? In recent years, members of the mega-rich class have individually voiced worries about the wealth imbalance, including Warren Buffett. But the signatories hope their letter will prompt a group momentum. Already the Swiss-born US-based billionaire Hansjoerg Wyss has added his name to the letter, and the property and insurance magnate Eli Broadhas written of his support.,external But they are not going unchallenged. Conservative US television talk show host Laura Ingraham was among the first out the blocks with a tweet that summed up the counter-view of many. ""If these billionaires think they pay too little in taxes, why not just send more money to the IRS? Or are they not smart enough to figure that out?"" she tweeted her near-three million followers. That misses the point, says Mr Simmons, 44. Writing a cheque to the Treasury is just philanthropy, and you can't address the challenges facing society based on the whim of rich people giving money away. A young Liesel Matthews (her stage name) with Air Force One co-stars Harrison Ford and Wendy Crewson ""I don't think philanthropy is going to fix systemic wealth inequality, and nor do most economists who study inequality,"" he said. He's not dismissing philanthropy. He and his wife do their bit. ""But the good intentions of the few are not a substitute for good rules for everyone. Having a few of us write a few more cheques to the Treasury is not going to create universal childcare or take a revolutionary approach to the climate crisis or retire student debt."" Nor do they want the extra money ring-fenced for specific projects. ""It's up to our government - that's what tax is for,"" Ms Pritzker Simmons said. ""There are things that I personally care about, but [ring-fencing] betrays the purpose of a tax that benefits everybody."" She's convinced they're tapping into a new mood among voters: ""We've watched a couple of generations of trickle-down economics, and it's not working. There is a change in mood, but it's based on solid data that shows things are not working."" Donald Trump - who once proposed a one-off wealth tax to tackle America's debt - points to Wall Street's record-breaking stock markets as evidence things are, in fact, working. ""It's not a very compelling argument to the half of Americans who have absolutely no exposure to the stock market,"" she said. She says voters - Republican and Democrat - are increasingly demanding action, which is why people who say Congress would never pass a wealth tax are wrong. And while the rich can hide or undervalue assets, that's not an argument for doing nothing. As she puts it: ""Are you really going to leave 50 cents on the table because you can't get the dollar."" America's top tier is not going to suffer after paying a bit more into the system, she said. ""We will continue to have an incredibly fortunate life. If this [a wealth tax] is considered a hardship, then I think we're pretty lucky.""

Thousands protest against lifting Madrid car ban,"This video can not be played Protesters gathered in Madrid, furious at the suspension of an anti-pollution plan Thousands of protesters flooded the streets of Madrid on Saturday to oppose the newly elected conservative mayor's decision to reverse car pollution restrictions. The People's Party-run city hall has provoked an outcry by suspending a ban on most petrol and diesel cars in Madrid's centre. The policy aimed to ensure the city complied with the EU's clean air rules. Fines were levied on drivers who broke the rules. Madrid bans old cars to reduce emissions Air pollution: Half a million early deaths in Europe Ryanair 'one of Europe's top polluters' But PP mayor JosÃ© Luis MartÃ­nez-Almeida, who took office on 15 June, has shelved the scheme, introduced last November by Madrid's former left-wing mayor. The new mayor has been backed by other parties, including centrist Ciudadanos and the far-right VOX. They oppose the plan, known as ""Madrid Central"". In heatwave conditions, demonstrators thronged the streets of the Spanish capital on Saturday, calling on the mayor to reinstate the ban. Madrid's People's Party-run government has suspended the ""Madrid Central"" plan Protesters held up placards at the march in Madrid's city centre Some protesters chanted, ""yes we can, I do want Madrid central"". Others waved placards and banners, including one containing the message ""I want to breathe free"". Mariano SÃ¡nchez Bayle, a retired paediatrician, told Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s he was marching to ""defend the population"" from pollution. ""Pollution is one of the most important health problems now,"" he said.

Madrid's scheme mirrored those of other European cities such as London, Stockholm and Milan, whose governments are ramping up anti-pollution efforts as evidence of the harmful effects of vehicle emissions grows. Under the plan, certain petrol and diesel cars were prohibited from entering a restricted area of around five sq km (two sq miles). Drivers were fined â¬90 (Â£80) if they did so. Research by environmental groups suggests the plan has reduced air pollution levels to historic lows. A report by Ecologists in Action found that in May levels of nitrogen dioxide - a pollutant emitted by vehicles - reached the lowest level since records began in 2010. But despite the reported success of the scheme, Mr MartÃ­nez-Almeida vowed to reverse the restrictions after his election win. From 1 July, the restrictions will be lifted while Mr MartÃ­nez-Almeida's government reviews the plan to make it ""compatible with citizens' mobility needs"".

All you need to know before the Austrian GP,"Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix starts at 14:10 BST. Follow all the build-up and action with the BBC both online and on Radio 5 Live, starting with our live page from 12:30 For those who may be tiring of Mercedes' domination of Formula 1 this year, the Austrian Grand Prix will come as welcome relief. The world champions have been struggling a little all weekend - it's all relative, of course; Lewis Hamilton still qualified second - and three cars from three different teams start in the top three places on the grid. That is, as Hamilton said, ""cool"", especially with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, arguably the two most exciting members of F1's new generation, starting on the front row. Verstappen was bumped up to second, alongside Leclerc, after Hamilton was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen in first qualifying, which drops him to fourth, for arcane reasons we don't need to go into here. That will make Hamilton's life considerably more difficult as he seeks a seventh win in nine races - and Mercedes' as they look for a ninth in a row. For everyone else, it simply adds to the promise of what could be the closest and most competitive race of the season so far. Hamilton held his hands up for the penalty once it was announced, and it was clear from the way he talked before the investigation that he expected it was coming. ""I'm excited to get out there and race with these guys; they're both so talented,"" he said, before adding: ""If I get to start the race with those guys, I think it will be quite a fun race."" Indeed. Leclerc versus Verstappen versus Hamilton versus his team-mate Valtteri Bottas. Finally, nine races into the season, F1 has the battle everyone wanted to see before it started. Leclerc on pole as Hamilton demoted Relive the qualifying hour at the Red Bull Ring Ferrari have looked strong all weekend with Leclerc their main contender. His team-mate Sebastian Vettel was generally a couple of tenths behind the 21-year-old run-for-run, even before a problem with an engine air line forced the German out of final qualifying and consigned him to ninth on the grid. Ferrari's competitiveness in Austria is down to their prodigious straight-line speed, a combination of the most powerful engine in F1 and a slippery car. Hamilton lost 0.3secs to Leclerc on the straights, Bottas 0.6secs; the difference accounted for by Hamilton getting a tow. But they have also stepped up their cornering performance this weekend, with some aerodynamic revisions in the nose area to add to a new front wing introduced at the previous race in France. On top of that, Leclerc looks like he might have turned a bit of a corner in terms of his personal performance in the last couple of races. He has been quick all season, and should have won in Bahrain in March but for an engine problem that dropped him behind the Mercedes in the closing laps. After that, he was a little error-prone in qualifying. But he looked at that, and changes to his approach in France look to have moved him forward. ""I've changed a little bit the approach from Paul Ricard and I really felt I did a step forward,"" Leclerc said. ""Austria is also my favourite track, so it might fit a little bit better to my driving style but overall, I think, since Paul Ricard, I did a step forward."" If Leclerc could convert this pole into a win, it would be a popular victory. Everyone recognises his talent and potential, and many felt for him not only in Bahrain, where victory slipped through his fingers, but also in Baku, where he again looked the form man, only to crash away his chances in qualifying. Leclerc was fastest in both second and final practice before delivering his second pole of the season But while the Ferrari is the fastest car this weekend, and has a significant advantage on the straights, this race is a long way from a foregone conclusion. Ferrari have chosen a different tyre strategy from Mercedes and Red Bull, and Leclerc will start on the soft tyre while Verstappen, Bottas and Hamilton are on the medium. Leclerc said he was happy with the strategy, but Mercedes feel it's a mistake. ""If we're on a different tyre, maybe we will be able to offset each other [on pit-stop timing],"" Hamilton said. ""Them starting on that tyre would tend to think they are going for a two-stop most likely, unless that tyre goes a lot further than we anticipate. I don't have the numbers but on the medium tyre hopefully we will able to go longer. It will be interesting."" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was even more clear-cut about it. ""Charles starting on the soft is a risky strategy,"" he said, ""because it is either a two-stop if things go bad or you're being very compromised towards the end of your first stint. Whereas Red Bull and Mercedes on the medium are in a better place in terms of the strategies available to us. In summary, I'd rather be on the medium than the soft."" If it turns out Ferrari have made a strategy error, it would not be the first time. But on the other hand, these things are often made into bigger things pre-race than they turn out to be during it. Either way, it simply adds to the intrigue. It's mid-summer, so it's no surprise that F1's traditional driver-market 'silly season' has moved into full swing this weekend. The hot topic at Red Bull's home track has been the future of Max Verstappen, the state of his contract, and the likelihood of him leaving for greener pastures - most particularly Mercedes. Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2020, but there is a performance clause that could potentially allow him to be free at the end of this season. The clause centres on his championship position at a certain point in the year, although the details of what position he needs to be in, and when, are murky. Verstappen won in Austria a year ago and looks a genuine threat to Leclerc's victory hopes on Sunday Anyway, Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko has admitted he is worried that Verstappen might be tempted away by Mercedes. The prospect of a Hamilton-Verstappen 'super-team' is a mouth-watering one for neutrals, perhaps less so for Wolff. It is far from clear he would want the headache of sticking Verstappen in alongside Hamilton and waiting for the nuclear explosion that would inevitably occur one way or another. Both drivers were asked about it after qualifying. Hamilton said: ""People are always making up stuff. It's the first I've heard of it. I think the team's pretty happy with Valtteri and me. So I do know Max is definitely interested in opportunities. I don't know. Maybe. If there is [a chance], then great."" Turning to Verstappen, he added: ""I don't mind driving with you. I'll drive against whoever."" For his part, Verstappen said: ""I guess there's people who know more than me!"" Wolff has to decide whether to stick with Bottas, promote reserve driver Esteban Ocon, who lost his place at what is now Racing Point at the end of last season, or entertain the possibility of something else. He rates Verstappen, but that's not the same as wanting him to be in the team next year, for a number of potential reasons. Wolff said: ""I haven't spoken to Max and I would like to continue like I have done it in the past, first to evaluate our current line-up and to discuss with the drivers what their views are before really entering into a proper discussion with anyone else. ""That is valid to any driver who can possibly bring something to the game at Mercedes. We have exciting junior drivers that merit to be in F1, Esteban being the one who fell through the chairs last year. And putting that puzzle into place is something I'd like to do over the summer."" As for Verstappen, his preference is to stay at Red Bull-Honda and make work a partnership that he believes has great potential, and is only in its first season. But of course he is not in F1 to scrape around for lower podium positions or worse, as he has for most of this season so far. No decisions have been made, and this topic will be around for some weeks yet. Norris said he was happy McLaren had maintained their pace from the French Grand Prix Lando Norris is such a laid-back and down-to-earth character that he sounded almost disappointed with qualifying sixth, which has now become fifth following a penalty for Haas driver Kevin Magnussen. The equivocation? It was that he had not found the 0.028 seconds he would have needed to beat Magnussen on track. ""The thing that makes me happy is when we know we have accomplish everything we could have done,"" he said. ""The team gave me a good car this weekend. I was happy. The only thing that could have made it even better was beating Magnussen. ""It was 0.02secs and there was 0.02secs in my driving, which let me down little bit. ""I guess I'm a little self-critical sometimes but I don't think that's a bad thing."" Jolyon Palmer column: Norris living up to future champion billing Norris entered F1 this year amid high expectations, and he is very much delivering - as is his fellow Briton George Russell in rather more trying circumstances at Williams. McLaren are impressed - like everyone else. ""The most important thing is raw speed,"" said McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl, asked to sum up the impact Norris has made so far. ""It is the basis for every successful driver and he has shown from the first race onwards that he had this speed. ""If you go in your first ever F1 qualifying and you score P8, as he did in Melbourne, and then do it more and more often, and showing great speed and great handling of the races, this environment, is impressive. ""He will have a great career in F1 and I am looking forward to having some good years with him at McLaren.""

Who will choose the next PM?,"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

"US and China agree to restart trade talksThe US agrees a pause in hostilities with China on trade, and makes a concession over tech firm Huawei.World","This video can not be played Trump on China, including a change of US policy on the tech giant Huawei The US and China have agreed to resume trade talks, easing a long row that has contributed to a global economic slowdown. US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping reached agreement at the G20 summit in Japan. Mr Trump also said he would allow US companies to continue to sell to the Chinese tech giant Huawei, in a move seen as a significant concession. Mr Trump had threatened additional trade sanctions on China. However, after the meeting on the sidelines of the main G20 summit in Osaka, he confirmed that the US would not be adding tariffs on $300bn (Â£236bn) worth of Chinese imports. He also said he would continue to negotiate with Beijing ""for the time being"". A quick guide to the US-China trade war Who loses out in the US-China trade war? G20 summit: UK calls for global climate action And at a subsequent press conference, the US president declared that US technology companies could again sell to China's Huawei - effectively reversing a ban imposed last month by the US commerce department. President Trump has positioned his trade talks with Xi Jinping as a win for the US - but he may have also given Beijing exactly what it wants on Huawei. It is still not clear whether what Mr Trump has announced is a complete reversal - but if it is, it would be a significant concession by the US on a company that Washington has said is a threat to national security. The resumption of talks and pressing the pause button on more tariffs will be seen in the short term as positive for markets and American businesses. Those have already complained about the cost of further tariffs saying that if they had gone ahead - American consumers would have ended up paying something like $12bn more in higher prices Chinese businesses have been suffering too - the trade war has hit investment plans, business confidence, and exports in the world's second largest economy. But pressing pause doesn't mean the trade war is over. Tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods are still in place. And the two sides still have much to agree on. Washington wants Beijing to fundamentally change the way China's economy has grown over the past four decades - get rid of subsidies to state owned companies, open up the domestic market and most importantly, hold China to account if it fails to deliver on any of these commitments. But Beijing has already publicly said that it won't budge on issues of principle or bow to US pressure. How the two sides close that gap will be the real test of any trade truce. For now - it is a positive thing that they're talking again. But talking can only take you so far. This video can not be played Who really pays in a tariff war? The US and China have been fighting a damaging trade war over the past year. Mr Trump accused China of stealing intellectual property and forcing US firms to share trade secrets in order to do business in China, which in turn said US demands for business reform were unreasonable. The feud escalated in the months leading up to the summit, after talks between the two countries collapsed in May. The truce signals a pause in hostilities rather than a resolution of the dispute, which has caused market turbulence and hit global growth. Mr Trump said his meeting with Mr Xi was ""excellent, as good as it was going to be,"" adding: ""We discussed a lot of things and we're right back on track and we'll see what happens."" China's state news agency Xinhua quoted Mr Xi as saying: ""China and the US have highly integrated interests and extensive co-operation areas and they should not fall into so-called traps of conflict and confrontation."" This video can not be played Trade war squeezes California's wine country Washington has publicly said the firm's technology poses a national security risk, although Mr Trump has also linked the issue to the trade dispute. How damaging is the Huawei row? US Huawei supplier resumes some shipments Last month, the US banned Huawei from buying US goods without a licence - including from Google, which is crucial to many of its products. The ban could cost the firm $30bn (Â£24bn) in revenue this year. This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Some analysts see the ban as an attempt by the US to contain a powerful Chinese firm. Mr Trump's decision to allow US companies to continue to sell to Huawei ""where there's no great national security problem"" could be a substantial concession, although exactly how this will play out remains unclear. Mr Trump said the Huawei situation would be dealt with ""at the very end"" of trade talks. The G20 family photo - with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman central The next summit is due to be held in Saudi Arabia in November 2020. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has continued to face questions in Osaka over the murder in Istanbul last year of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the matter is likely to rumble on. All you need to know about Khashoggi's death The UK's Theresa May and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan are among those still pressing the issue, although Mr Trump says ""no-one blames"" the crown prince.

Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the House of Commons that in the case of a no-deal Brexit: ""We would of course have available the Â£39bn in the withdrawal agreement to help deal with any consequences."" He was referring to the UK's ""divorce bill"" from the European Union (EU). Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked Mr Johnson if he would ""acknowledge that the Â£39bn is now Â£33bn"". Mr Corbyn is right -the latest estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR),externalsays that, as a result of the delay to the Brexit date, a chunk of the money has already been paid, and that the current bill would be about Â£33bn. This is the money the UK agreed to pay the EU after leaving. Officially it is called the financial settlement (unofficially, the ""divorce bill"")and was negotiated as part of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement,external. The withdrawal agreement was the deal that would have seen the UK leave the EU on 29 March, and then enter a transition period until 31 December 2020. During this period, the UK-EU trading relationship would have stayed the same - allowing both sides to try to sort out a future trade deal. Although no longer an EU member,the UK would have paid into the EU budgetas it does now (and receive funding back). But the deal was rejected three times by MPs at Westminster and Brexit was delayed until 31 October. The withdrawal agreement (agreed in November 2018) set out calculations, rather than a figure, for how much the UK would need to pay to settle all of its obligations. That is why there has not been an official figure for it. The OBR estimated it would be Â£38bn, while the government had said between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. The biggest part of the bill was the UK contributions to the 2019 and 2020 EU budgets. The UK puts about Â£9bn a year into the budget, once you have deducted the rebate and money returned to the UK to be spent on public sector projects. As Brexit was delayed from 29 March to 31 October, some of that money has been paid as part of the UK's normal membership contributions, which means it is no longer part of the ""divorce bill"". The OBR estimates that the bill is now Â£33bn. Boris Johnson: What is his Brexit plan? Reality Check: Will we send money to Brussels after Brexit? Some of the rest of the payment would come from contributions towards EU budget commitments made while the UK was still a member of the EU, which have not yet been paid. The UK would also contribute towards EU staff pensions incurred before Brexit. The UK would receive some money back: the Â£3bn of capital it had paid into the European Investment Bank, as well as a small amount of capital paid into the European Central Bank. The OBR expects that most of the money - around three-quarters of the total  - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. Mr Johnson has suggested withholding the money - using it as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with the EU, or injecting it into the UK economy to try to avert the effects of a no-deal Brexit. This could have legal and other consequences. The Institute for Government think tank says refusing to pay could lead to a legal challenge. It says: ""The EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration, both located in The Hague."" But a House of Lords report into Brexit and the EU budget, published in 2017,,externalstated: ""While the legal advice we have received differed, the stronger argument suggests that the UK will not be strictly obliged, as a matter of law, to render any payments at all after leaving."" Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at University of Cambridge, says that because such a situation has never arisen before, ""no-one is quite sure what might happen"". When it comes to future talks with the EU - such as negotiating a free trade agreement - withholding the money would sour relations. The EU has said consistently that it will only begin trade negotiations once the issue of financial obligations, citizens' rights and the Irish border have been resolved.
