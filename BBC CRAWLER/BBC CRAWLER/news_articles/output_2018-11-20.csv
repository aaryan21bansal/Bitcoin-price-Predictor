Gang 'demanded ÃÂ£20k to leave brewery',"Patrick Ward denies he was one of the offenders caught on CCTV stealing items at the brewery The leader of a 100-strong group of travellers who illegally occupied a brewery demanded ""twenty grand or the place is ours"", a court was told. A convoy of 25 vehicles set up camp at Thwaites Brewery in Blackburn on 26 May, Preston Crown Court heard. Thomas Ward, 43, of Leigh, Wigan, has pleaded guilty to blackmailing, conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. The group later went on the rampage causing extensive damage, jurors heard. Jurors heard Thomas Ward, of Aspull Common, told the brewery he wanted Â£20,000 to leave within the hour after gate locks were broken at the site in Lancashire. After some negotiation, Mr Ward agreed to take payment for his demand at noon the next day - 27 May - provided no damage was caused. But prosecutors say travellers went on a wrecking spree and ransacked the office building later that afternoon after Mr Ward became convinced he had been duped. Staff and police finally gained full access to the brewery two days later and Thwaites chief executive Richard Bailey said he was greeted by a scene of ""utter devastation"", with damage estimated at Â£300,000, the court heard. The presence of the travellers at the site led to 1,700 pints of beer being poured away in case of contamination. John Ward has admitted conspiracy offences Mr Ward has pleaded guilty to blackmail and conspiracy offences while his co-accused John Ward, 33, also of Aspull Common, and a 17-year-old male, who cannot be named because of his age, also admitted the conspiracy offences. A fourth defendant, Patrick Ward, 32, of Aspull Common, who has pleaded not guilty to the same conspiracy offences, is on trial in his absence. The court heard CCTV - which also showed young children playing in the yard - stopped recording when the power was cut on site shortly before 18:00 on 27 May. Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, said Patrick Ward from Aspull Common was one of the offenders caught on CCTV stealing items at the brewery. Jurors were told he denies it was him, although he accepts he was in the area at nearby Morrison's supermarket and Gala Bingo on the same day. The trial continues.

Asylum seekers in 'vermin-infested' housing,"In one house, water would ""cascade"" from the upstairs bathroom into the kitchen, where part of the ceiling was missing Less than a quarter of state-run accommodation for asylum seekers in the UK is compliant with standards, amuch-delayed report has found.,external The Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration cited evidence of damp, dirty and vermin-infested properties. Some of the accommodation was found to be unsuitable for vulnerable groups, including survivors of torture or domestic violence. The Home Office said it was ""committed to improving"" the service. Chief inspector David Bolt, who sent his report to ministers four months ago, also criticised the government for failing to have a ""grip"" on the number of pregnant asylum seekers or those who had just given birth. Refugees seeking asylum in the UK are eligible for financial support or help with housing from the Home Office, if they can prove they are destitute. Accommodation for asylum seekers is managed in six regions by three private providers operating under a Home Office contract. Mr Bolt said the inspection ""proved more challenging than most"" because of ""several reasons, not least the difficulty of extracting evidence from the Home Office."" ""My report is likely to please no-one,"" he added. ""It is clear from the Home Office's response to the draft report that this topic touches a nerve."" According to the report, Home Office contract officers - whose job it is to check accommodation meets the requirement of the contract - inspected 8,313 properties in 22 months and declared 3,567 (43%) as ""not fit for purpose"" or needing ""urgent"" repairs. Only 24% were found to be ""compliant"" with standards. Inside a mother and baby unit there were blocked drains, an infestation of rodents, damp and mould The chief inspector said much of the evidence focused on ""poor property standards"" with ""frequent"" references to defects, damp, dirt and vermin. Examples included: The ventilation in one flat so bad that a three-year-old boy began suffering health problems ""Blocked drains, an infestation of rodents, damp and mould"" in a mother and baby unit for seven women with children under the age of two Young people with high levels of trauma being placed in houses shared with older men with alcohol and drug problems In some cases, asylum cases were told not to touch fixtures - meaning one new mother waited a month for someone to put together a cot, and others waited a fortnight for a light bulb to be changed. Some of the housing was assessed as unsuitable for vulnerable groups, including survivors of torture and victims of domestic violence. A three-year-old boy, who lived with his parents in a basement flat, developed health problems after poor ventilation, leaking water and damp Some asylum seekers saved up from their weekly allowance to buy a vacuum cleaner, or scrubbed the dirt from carpets when they first moved in Mr Bolt also expressed concern about the way information on pregnant women and new mothers was recorded and shared. He said: ""An overall grip on the numbers and distribution of pregnant and post-partum women within the asylum accommodation system is not a 'nice to have', but is essential to a proper understanding of whether the present policies and practices are meeting the needs of this particularly vulnerable group."" The report concluded that the Home Office was ""too accepting"" of the limitations of the current contracts, which are due to be replaced or renewed in September 2019, saying there was ""much more"" that the department should do to bring about improvements. ""The system will always rely on collaboration, but it is the Home Office that holds most of the keys,"" said Mr Bolt. What is it like when an asylum centre opens near you? Reality Check: Where have the Syrian refugees gone? Scrap 'tens of thousands' target, MPs urge The Home Office said: ""Our comprehensive action plan will support customers in raising issues with their accommodation and ensure vulnerable people receive a more tailored service. ""In addition, we have restructured our routine inspections so that our approach to managing the contracts and accommodation standards is more consistent nationally."" The head of advocacy at the Refugee Council, Andy Hewett, said the charity was ""deeply concerned"" by some of the report's findings, but said they were not new ""by any stretch"". And Gary Christie, head of policy at the Scottish Refugee Council, said they have dealt with many issues around poor standards of housing for asylum seekers. ""One recent case involved a young mother and her daughter,"" he said. ""Whilst her flat was overall in a satisfactory state, the close was filthy, ridden with litter, and urine-filled with a disgusting odour. ""It had a standing sofa that blocked entry to the backdoor, rubbish bins and safe exit in the event of a fire. There was race hate graffiti on a wall."" Earlier on Tuesday, the Home Affairs Select Committee heard from regional representatives across the UK as part of a new inquiry examining asylum accommodation contracts. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told MPs the current arrangements were ""not fair to the people arriving needing support, not fair to the host communities, not fair to the local authorities"". ""The only people the current arrangements work for are the Home Office and the contract providers,"" he said. What is it like when an asylum centre opens near you?

Grenfell fire spread in just 10 minutes,"The advice for Grenfell Tower residents to stay in their flats should have been reconsidered once the fire reached the outside, which took just 10 minutes. The Grenfell Inquiry heard the small kitchen fire broke out through a uPVC window fitting, igniting the cladding. Professor Jose Torero, a fire safety expert, said from that moment ""the stay-put strategy was compromised"" and evacuation should have been considered. The disaster, in west London on 14 June 2017, killed 72 people. Prof Torero's report for the inquiry said the blaze probably set fire to one of the flammable components of the cladding 11 minutes after the fire started. That was before firefighters had entered the fourth-floor flat 16. â¢ The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast Why was 'stay put' advice disastrous? 'Catastrophic' safety failures at Grenfell Flames then spread up the east side of the building, as showed in a video montage played at the inquiry. ""Analysis indicates that a relatively minor, localised fire compromised the uPVC window fittings and ignited one of the flammable components of the cladding by direct flame/plume impingement,"" Prof Torero wrote. ""From this point forward, the stay-put strategy was compromised and evacuation of occupants was an option to consider."" Images from the kitchen of flat 16 show the positioning of the kitchen appliances and the window He said such a kitchen fire in a high-rise residential building was an ""inevitable and perfectly foreseeable event"" but should have been contained. ""Fires are common events, but fires that create significant damage are rare events,"" he said. ""The building is required to respond and deliver... so that a fire of this nature does not progress beyond a kitchen."" Prof Torero - who is John L. Bryan chair at the Department of Fire Protection Engineering and the director of the Centre for Disaster Resilience at the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Maryland, in the US - said there was a high probability of any fire starting near a window at Grenfell Tower spreading to the cladding.

By 1.11am, it would have been obvious to firefighters that the outside of the building was burning. 'No one should have lived there' Five things firefighters told us about the fire Kate Grange QC, counsel for the inquiry, asked: ""Would you agree that once compartmentation is breached, evacuation is necessary to secure the fire safety of those in the building?"" Prof Torero confirmed that was the case, and indeed the only viable option at that point. The London Fire Brigade did not change its advice to stay put until 2.47am. Only 36 people managed to escape after that point. The inquiry has previously heardthat the advice to stay put should have worked if ""the building have done what it was supposed to have done"".

Saudi Arabia 'tortured women activists',"Several activists were arrested in May as Saudi Arabia prepared to give women the right to drive Saudi Arabia tortured and sexually harassed human rights activists, including several women, human rights groups have alleged. Prisoners in the kingdom's Dhahban Prison have allegedly been electrocuted and flogged. Saudi Arabia arrested several women's rights activists earlier this year and influential clerics and intellectuals have also been detained. The BBC has approached the Saudi authorities for comment. However, a Saudi official told the Wall Street Journal the kingdom ""does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture"". Saudi women's rights crackdown widens Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch issued statements on Tuesday detailing alleged torture of detained prisoners. Activists were left unable to walk or stand properly after electrocution and flogging,external, an Amnesty International release said, with one woman reportedly sexually harassed by interrogators in face masks. Human Rights Watch's release also speaks of electrocution,external, as well as whipping and ""forcible hugging and kissing"" of at least three detained women. Aziza al-Yousef is reportedly one of the women's rights activists being held King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were praised last year for launching a modernisation drive, including the lifting of a ban on women driving. But critics say that has been accompanied with a crackdown on dissent, and the country is also facing an international outcry over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing on rogue agents but denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. However, the CIA reportedly believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. On Tuesday,US President Donald Trump issued a statement defending ties with Saudi Arabia, despite saying the Crown Prince ""could very well"" have known about the assassination.

Critics attack Russian Interpol candidate,"Russian Alexander Prokopchuk is the frontrunner to become the next Interpol chief A Russian official is expected to become the new head of Interpol, despite concerns that Moscow has used the agency to target its opponents. Alexander Prokopchuk, a veteran of the country's interior ministry, is favourite to be elected president at a meeting of Interpol's annual congress. He is currently one of four vice-presidents of Interpol. The election follows the disappearance of Interpol's former president Meng Hongwei in September. China has since confirmed he has been detained and is being investigated for allegedly taking bribes. Representatives from Interpol's 194 member states are meeting in Dubai for the vote. They will decide between Mr Prokopchuk and another vice-president, South Korea's Kim Jong Yang, but the Russian is considered the favourite. Although the role of president is largely ceremonial, it still wields influence and the election of Mr Prokopchuk would be seen as a major success for Russia. But there is growing criticism of his candidacy from human rights groups and officials from other countries who fear his election could lead to an escalation in Russia's attempts to pursue its critics. Mr Prokopchuk has been accused of abusing Interpol's so-called red notice system - international arrest warrants - to target critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while serving as Interpol's Moscow bureau chief. One group of US senators said electing him would be ""akin to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse"", while a prominent Kremlin critic said it would be like ""putting the mafia in charge"". The UK says it is backing Kim Jong Yang, and has been urged by some British MPs to consider withdrawing from Interpol if Mr Prokopchuk is elected. ""Putting a senior representative of one of the most criminalised governments on Earth in charge of Interpol makes a mockery of the organisation in principle,"" said Conservative lawmaker Bob Seely. Lithuania, which regained its independence from Russia during the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a member of both Nato and the European Union, has threatened to leave Interpol if Mr Prokopchuk is elected.

The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time,"Nearly one in five local hospital services are consistently failing to hit any of their key waiting-time targets, BBC analysis shows. Twenty-nine hospital trusts and boards out of 157 have not hit a single target for a whole year. Northern Ireland is struggling the most - all five trusts have failed their key targets for A&E, cancer and routine operations every time in 2017-18. NHS leaders said the NHS was facing a very difficult winter.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the NHS was going into the coming months ""on the back foot"". She said research by the RCN showed hospitals were facing a shortage of both beds and staff - with images of ""patients waiting on trolleys in corridors"" becoming all too common. The health departments in each nation have said they are committed to improving waiting times. In Scotland and Wales, specific programmes have been launched to speed up progress. Northern Ireland's Health and Social Care Board conceded ""the waiting times experienced by many patients continue to be unacceptable"". The Department of Health and Social Care in England praised ""hard-working staff"" and said the extra money being provided to the health service in the coming years would put it on a ""sustainable footing"". Carol Johns has been battling to get her mother, Maria King, treatment since the spring. Ms King, 84, has been experiencing painful and swollen feet, which has left her struggling to walk and has disturbed her sleep. Her daughter said she had experienced delay after delay in trying to get scans and appointments with doctors. One appointment had to be cancelled because the hospital said it did not have enough doctors. She has even tried to get treatment at other hospitals further away from her home in the Midlands and paid for a scan to be done privately. But her mother is still waiting. ""I am very frustrated. My mother has not got the quality of life she did. She is suffering."" It depends on where you live in the UK. In each UK nation, patients are meant to be seen within four hours of arrival at A&E - and by seen, the NHS means either admitted into hospital for further treatment or treated and discharged. For cancer, each nation expects patients to start their treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral, although there are differences in the way each nation measures that. The biggest variation in the way performance is judged is seen in the waiting times for non-emergency treatments, such as knee and hip replacements. In England and Scotland, patients are meant to be seen within 18 weeks, while in Wales it is 26 weeks. Northern Ireland has a different system in that it only measures part of the patient's wait - once they are under the care of a hospital doctor rather than when they are referred by a GP. It means their wait for tests and scans is not counted in the 13-week wait target. Another way of looking at performance is to judge it on a nation-level rather than by local hospital service. If you do that performance has sunk to its worst level in recent times. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have failed to hit any of the three targets for more than a year. It is the first time this has happened across the UK since targets started to be introduced more than a decade ago. The last time any target was met on a national level was in August 2017 in Scotland. In Wales, none of its three key targets has been hit for at least five years. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents managers, said it was clear the system was facing ""significant strain"". In England, 16 hospital trusts out of 131 missed all their monthly targets. They were: Bradford Teaching Hospitals Taunton and Somerset Guy's and St Thomas' Northern Lincolnshire & Goole Plymouth Hospitals The Royal Wolverhampton Mid Essex Hospital Services Leeds Teaching Hospitals University College London Hospitals East Kent Hospitals Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals United Lincolnshire Hospitals Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells East and North Hertfordshire Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals In Northern Ireland, all five trusts have failed to hit a single target in the past 12 months. They were: Belfast South Eastern Northern Southern Western In Scotland, three out of 14 health boards missed all their targets. They were: Forth Valley Greater Glasgow and Clyde Lothian In Wales, five out of seven health boards missed all their targets. They were: Cardiff and Vale Cwm Taf Aneurin Bevan Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Betsi Cadwaladr A combination of rising demand and the need to prioritise emergency patients has been blamed by the NHS trusts which are struggling the most. Plymouth Hospitals chief operating officer Kevin Baber said staff were working hard, but were struggling with the ""ever increasing demand"". He said headway was being made in some areas. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells said it had had to prioritise emergency patients over the past year - and that had meant others were having to wait longer. And Gwen Nuttall, from the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said meeting targets ""will always be a challenge"" in the current climate. ""Our hospitals, along with others regionally and nationally, are incredibly busy,"" she added.

Trump backs Saudi Arabia despite murder,"This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? US President Donald Trump has strongly defended ties with Saudi Arabia despite international condemnation of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder. The kingdom is a ""steadfast partner"" that has agreed to invest ""a record amount of money"" in the US, Mr Trump said in a statement. The president acknowledged Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ""could very well"" have known about Khashoggi's murder. ""In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" he added. Mr Khashoggi was murdered on 2 October on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The journalist who vanished into a consulate The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing on rogue agentsbut denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. US media have reported thatthe CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. Mr Trump's statement said: ""[It] could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" Later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that the CIA had not made a ""100%"" determination on the killing. In an interview on Sunday,the president told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it ""a suffering tape"". By the BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Riyadh For Saudis, and especially Saudi leaders, there will be a sigh of relief. But, it's also what they expected, and what they've always said about President Trump - he will be a true friend of the Kingdom. Both sides want to draw a line under this major crisis - and global outcry. But as Mr Trump acknowledged, and Saudis know, it won't go away. Not for many in the US Congress, as well as for many others, including countries who will continue to call for greater clarity. Many Saudis say they don't believe their country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, would have ordered such a despicable act. Many, who'd long been hoping to see their country move forward, have been shaken by this shocking murder, and regret it will cast a dark shadow for many years to come. In the words of one prominent Saudi: ""It has brought Saudi Arabia ten steps back."" Meanwhile, Lindsey Graham, a senator from Mr Trump's Republican Party, has predicted strong bipartisan support in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia ""including appropriate members of the royal family"".

""The world is a very dangerous place!"", Mr Trump states, before holding up Saudi Arabia as an ally of the US against Iran. The kingdom spent ""billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism"" whereas Iran has ""killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East"", it says. Mike Pompeo backed Mr Trump, saying ""it's a mean, nasty world out there"" The statement also stresses Saudi investment pledges and arms purchases. ""If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries,"" it adds. While admitting the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was ""terrible"", Mr Trump wrote that ""we may never know all of the facts"" about his death. ""The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region."" Mr Trump later said he would meet Mohammed bin Salman at a G20 meeting in Argentina next week if the crown prince attended. Khashoggi murder: Is Saudi crown prince finished? Saudi Arabia 'tortured female activists' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has backed his president, saying after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu that ""it's a mean, nasty world out there"" and that Mr Trump was ""obliged to adopt policies that further America's national security"". Mr Cavusoglu said that co-operation with Saudi Arabia on the issue was ""not where we want it"". In a statement, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she was shocked the president was not going to punish Mohammed bin Salman over the ""premeditated murder"" of Khashoggi. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter, Washington Donald Trump is a different kind of president, and nowhere is that more clear than in his foreign policy, exclamation points and all. His release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, and not just its blunt language. The president quickly tries to change the subject to Iran. He dismisses reports that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder with a maybe-he-did, maybe-he-didn't shrug. He cites the economic impact of $450bn in investment and arms sales to the Saudis, although much of that is little more than paper promises. Perhaps most jarring is his casual observation that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi - a permanent US resident - as an ""enemy of the state"" with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr Trump has distilled his ""America First"" worldview down to its very essence. Morality and global leadership take a back seat to perceived US economic and military security. Read more from Anthony What the take-away will be in the Middle East and beyond is a serious issue, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus. US policy in the region is so closely aligned with that of two key individuals - Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - that it is increasingly hard to see how the US can play a role as an independent arbiter, our correspondent says. Mr Trump's narrow, interests-based approach will further dismay Washington's allies in the West, he argues, reinforcing those in Moscow and Beijing who are already applying a ""Russia First"" and a ""China First"" approach in international affairs.

What Trump's words reveal,"""Statement from President Donald J Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia"" - the title of the White House release leaves little doubt about where he comes down on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With the US Central Intelligence Agency reportedly poised to conclude that senior members of the Saudi Arabian government were responsible for Khashoggi's death, Mr Trump's move could be viewed as an attempt to pre-empt that finding and clearly indicate that a strong US-Saudi alliance will continue undeterred. Each section of the exclamation-point-filled presidential statement (full transcript at foot of page) merits closer inspection. The world is a very dangerous place! Say what you want, the president knows how to write a good opening. In two lines, he offers a distillation of his foreign policy priorities - contrasting the supremacy of American interests with a dismal view of the rest of the world, where bad things often happen beyond US control. Iran states openly, and with great force, ""Death to America!"" and ""Death to Israel!"" Iran is considered ""the world's leading sponsor of terror"". Mr Trump very quickly pivots in his statement to talking about Iran and the destabilising role he says the nation plays in the region. They are the ones who denounce the US in the harshest of terms; they are the ones who have killed ""many Americans and other innocent people""; they are the ones who have supported Syria's Bashar Assad kill his own citizens. All this is the president's initial effort to set up a stark contrast with Saudi Arabia and put the death of one man - Khashoggi - up against the deaths of thousands. Trump backs Saudi Arabia despite murder On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. The Saudis have come under intense criticism for their involvement in the Yemeni civil war, including aerial bombardment that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. After condemning Iran, Mr Trump absolves the Saudis of responsibility for the humanitarian crisis that has ensued. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. One of the central tenets of Mr Trump's ""America first"" foreign policy is that the US has paid an economic price by having been taken advantage of by the rest of the world. In this next paragraph, the president gets to the nuts and bolts of why he views close relations with the Saudis not just as an issue of national security but of domestic prosperity, as well. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? The numbers he offers, however, don't hold up. While Mr Trump has cited the $450bn in total investment in the past but has never provided an accounting of where it comes from - and, in fact, there was no mention of that number during his  May 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis did agree to $110bn in military spending, although that's a combination of $14.5bn in previously announced purchases and promises of future orders that have yet to materialise. The Saudis could turn to China or Russia instead, but phantom purchases to either of them are worth as much as they are to the US. The journalist who vanished into a consulate The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an ""enemy of the state"" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that - this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. After contrasting Iran's malevolence with Saudi Arabia's noble intentions, and laying out what he sees as the economic and security benefits of US-Saudi relations, Mr Trump finally turns to the details of Khashoggi's murder, which he describes as a ""terrible"" and ""horrible"" crime. He says 17 Saudis are known to have been responsible, and they have been sanctioned, but after that he draws the line. In a remarkable passage, he notes that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi as an ""enemy of the state"" and (erroneously) as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. While he says that didn't influence his decision, he also doesn't refute them - and the mere mention of these accusations directed against a permanent resident of the US by the president lends them some credence. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't! Here we get to the heart of Mr Trump's statement supporting Saudi Arabia. Maybe Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder, maybe he didn't. Despite what Americans may hear in the coming days from the CIA, we may never know all the facts! It is, needless to say, extremely rare for a president to undercut his own intelligence community in such a dramatic way. Of course, Mr Trump has now done so on a number of occasions. In the end, he says, the US relationship with Saudi Arabia has to remain strong. The needs of the nation, in effect, outweigh the consequences of a crime against one man, however horrible. Such a view has prompted a fierce response from some in the US. Fred Ryan, publisher of the Washington Post, which employed Khashoggi as a columnist, called the statement ""a betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights and the expectation of trust and honesty in our strategic relationships"". Khashoggi murder: Is Saudi crown prince finished? I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. Mr Trump closes with what can be called the Trump Doctrine - that in a dangerous world, perceived humanitarian concerns must take a back seat to US economic and military security. Congress, he says, may want to go ""in a different direction"" - much as it did by imposing additional sanctions on Russia against the president's wishes in 2017. Mr Trump, however, sets very clear parameters for the kinds of measures he will ""consider"". The idea of prioritising pragmatic national interests - realpolitik, in the term coined by Ludwig von Rochau - is nothing new in US foreign policy, of course. From Richard Nixon's China diplomacy to George HW Bush's Gulf War, international relations is frequently an exercise in hard, often unpleasant choices. Rarely, however, are the cold calculations laid out as bluntly as Mr Trump has done time and time again with his ""America First"" foreign policy. Part of this may be a reaction to the rhetoric of idealism employed by two of his recent predecessors, George W Bush and Barack Obama. It may also be a reflection of the directness of Mr Trump the man. Whatever the explanation, the cloak of idealism and morality has been cast aside. Here is the White House statement in full. America First! The world is a very dangerous place! The country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq's fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, ""Death to America!"" and ""Death to Israel!"" Iran is considered ""the world's leading sponsor of terror."" On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States! The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body. Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an ""enemy of the state"" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that - this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't! That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world! I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels - so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!

The journalist who vanished,"Saudi Arabia blamed the killing of Jamal Khashoggi on a ""rogue operation"" Jamal Khashoggi - a well-known Saudi journalist - went into his country's consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to obtain a marriage document and disappeared. After more than two weeks of denials, Saudi Arabia eventually admitted that he had been killed within the consulate in what officials called a ""rogue operation"" and has vowed to punish ""those responsible"". Once an adviser to the royal family, Khashoggi had fallen sharply out of favour with the Saudi government and went into self-imposed exile last year. Here, we take a look at Khashoggi, his career and the events that led up to his disappearance. Born in Medina in 1958, he studied business administration in the US at Indiana State University. He then returned to Saudi Arabia and started his career as a journalist in the 1980s as a reporter for regional newspapers covering the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? There, he followed closely the rise of Osama Bin Laden, interviewing the late al-Qaeda leader several times during the 1980s and 1990s. From there his career covered other major events in the region, including the first Gulf War in Kuwait. He returned full-time to Saudi Arabia in the 1990s and in 1999 became the deputy editor of the English-language Arab News newspaper. Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since lunchtime on Tuesday In 2003 he became editor of the Al Watan newspaper but was fired just two months into his tenure for publishing stories that were critical of the Saudi clerical establishment. After his dismissal he moved to London and later Washington to serve as a media adviser to ambassador Prince Turki bin-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief. He returned to Al Watan in 2007 but left three years later after further controversy. Saudi critic in his own words Jamal Khashoggi gets blank column Following the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, he expressed support for Islamist groups that had gained power in several countries. In 2012 he was chosen to lead the Saudi-backed Alarab news channel - touted as a rival to the Qatari-funded Al Jazeera. But the Bahrain-based news channel stopped broadcasting less than 24 hours after its launch in 2015after inviting a prominent Bahraini opposition figure on to speak. Considered an authoritative voice on Saudi affairs, Khashoggi has also been a regular contributor on international news outlets. The journalist left Saudi Arabia for the US in summer 2017. In his debut September column for the Washington Post newspaper,he said that he and several others had gone into self-imposed exile because they feared being arrested,external. He said dozens of people had been detained in an apparent crackdown on dissidents under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been pioneering an ambitious economic and social reform program in the country. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia needs reform, but one-man rule is ""bad"" for the kingdom He also alleged the Saudi government had pressured the publisher of Arabic daily newspaper Al-Hayat to cancel his column and said he was told to stop tweeting to his 1.8 million followers after he cautioned against the country's ""overly enthusiastic embrace"" of then US President-elect Donald Trump in late 2016. ""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot. I want you to know that Saudi Arabia has not always been as it is now. We Saudis deserve better,"" he wrote. In his writing he accused the Saudi government of ignoring real extremists in its crackdown, andhe compared the crown prince to Russian leader Vladimir Putin,external. Khashoggi's most recent piece was published on 11 September, andthe Washington Post published a blank column on 5 October to highlight his disappearance. In his last column,he criticised Saudi involvement in the Yemen conflict,external. The journalist's fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz said she had waited outside for 11 hours, but he did not come out Mr Khashoggi was last seen in public when he went into the Istanbul consulate on 2 October to obtain official divorce documents so he could marry a Turkish woman he had become engaged to. His fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, waited outside for him for hours but he never emerged. She says he had to surrender his mobile phone while entering, and had told her to contact an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not return. Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training The Turkish authorities were quick to report he had been murdered and said they had evidence, including gruesome audio recordings, to back this up. For two weeks, Saudi Arabia insisted Khashoggi had left the building alive. But amid global outcry and pressure over the case, the authorities on 19 October said for the first time that he had been killed in a fight inside the consulate. The conflicting Saudi accounts over the incident have angered the kingdom's Western allies, and shaken their ties with the world's top oil exporter. Just three days before his disappearance,the BBC's Newshour programme interviewed Khashoggi off-air. In a released audio snippet, he said he did not think he'd be able to ever return to his native country. ""The people being arrested are not even being dissidents, they just have an independent mind,"" he said. ""I don't call myself an opposition: I always say I'm just a writer, I want a free environment to write and speak my mind and that's what I do in the Washington Post. ""They give me a platform to write freely and I wish I had that platform in my home."" He also criticised how the Saudi government was initiating reform. ""This serious transformation that is happening isn't discussed - the Prince supplies us every couple of weeks or couple of months with a huge multi-billion dollar project that wasn't discussed in the parliament, wasn't discussed in the newspapers and the people will just clap and say great... and things don't work that way.""

"Don't get stuck with May, Rees-Mogg warns","Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned fellow Tory MPs that if they don't ditch Theresa May now she will lead them into the next election, scheduled for 2022. Few Tories thought this was a ""good idea"", the Brexiteer MP suggested. Mr Rees-Mogg wants to oust the PM over her EU withdrawal agreement but has so far failed to get enough colleagues to back his call for a no confidence vote. Meanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to the Finance Bill after the DUP withdrew its backing. Labour said the government was ""falling apart in front of us"" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the bill to pass the Budget. They were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal What to look for in Brexit declaration Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment Mr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote. ""What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,"" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference. ""We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible."" He said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement. But he added: ""I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election. Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months. The PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and it will allow the country to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"". This video can not be played Sammy Wilson, DUP: ""The government had broken one of the fundamental agreements they had with us... we had to do something."" In other developments: Downing Street said at a meeting of the cabinet earlier, the first since a spate of Brexit resignations last week, ministers had discussed possible alternative arrangements to keep the border open, that could involve ""technological solutions"". In a sign of tension on the EU side, Spain has said it will not agree to the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without clarity over how talks on the future status of Gibraltar should be handled. Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Tory-DUP relationship 'broken over Europe' The importance of being unionist Downing Street said that,during talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the PM had emphasised that the draft Brexit terms would give Scottish businesses the ""clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters"". The SNP leader also met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier to discuss tactics ahead of the Commons vote. This video can not be played In full: Nicola Sturgeon interview with Laura Kuenssberg on Brexit Ms Sturgeon held a separate meeting with Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, who all back another EU referendum. She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she wanted to form a ""coalition of opposition"" to Mrs May's Brexit plans, and that momentum for another referendum was growing. She described her talks with Mr Corbyn as ""exploratory"" and said she did not know whether he would back a referendum. But she said they both agreed that the PM's Brexit deal is a bad one and that no-deal should not be the only alternative presented to MPs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A Labour spokesman said: ""They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May's botched Brexit deal and determination to work across Parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome."" As it stands, thereappears to be a majority in Parliament against the deal. Sturgeon has 'constructive' Corbyn talks Work with Plaid on Brexit, Labour urged And Mrs May is coming under growing pressure from the DUP, whose 10 MPs keep her government in power. This video can not be played Theresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: ""Don't just listen to the politicians."" The DUP abstained in Monday night's Budget votes as a warning shot over what they say are her broken promises on Brexit. After the DUP indicated they would abstain again on further votes on Tuesday, ministers accepted Labour and SNP amendments in order to avoid likely defeat. These will require the government to conduct a review into the public health impact of gaming, a report into the impact of Brexit on international tax enforcement and a review into the impact of tax avoidance measures on income inequality and child poverty. Under the terms of their House of Commons deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year's general election, the DUP is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence votes. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said their refusal to do so now was ""absolutely staggering"", adding that the Conservatives were ""in office but not in power"".

"M&S knickers display 'vomit-inducing'Women must have ""fancy little knickers"" while men must have ""outfits to impress"".Nottingham","Fran Bailey said the juxtaposition was ""grossly, grossly offensive"" Feminists have described a Marks & Spencer window display that suggests women must have ""fancy little knickers"" as sexist and ""vomit-inducing"". The display at the Nottingham store is juxtaposed with one which suggests men must have ""outfits to impress"". A campaigner altered the window so that it read ""full human rights"" instead of ""knickers"". M&S said the displays were part of a wider campaign that featured a variety of ""must-haves"". Another window display at the same Nottingham store is aimed at women and suggests they, too, must have ""outfits to impress"". Concern was raised whena photo was posted in a Facebook group,externalcalled Feminist Friends Nottingham. A campaigner altered the window so that it read ""full human rights"" instead of ""knickers"" Fran Bailey asked: ""Ok, M&S Nottingham, have we really not learned anything in the last 35 years? Or am I alone in finding this, their major window display, completely vomit inducing?"" Speaking to the BBC, she said the display had ""incensed"" her for two reasons and had put her off from shopping at M&S. ""I think M&S using the slogan 'must-have' over Christmas fripperies is very distasteful when true necessities are lacking for many working and non-working people; the true necessities being warmth, shelter and food,"" she said. ""I also feel very, very strongly about the representation of women as being preoccupied with fancy little knickers, whereas men are presented as powerful and needing to be impressive. ""I don't have a problem with people choosing to wear whatever they want to wear, I just feel like the juxtaposition is what's grossly, grossly offensive. ""We are surrounded by sexual images of both men and women. M&S are not by any means the only offenders but that particular window just epitomises everything that's wrong with current marketing and how far backwards we've gone."" The wider campaign includes an image of model David Gandy washing up M&S said its stores had various combinations of Christmas window displays, but the same two displays would appear next to one another at some other branches. The retailer said in a statement: ""M&S sells more underwear, in more shapes, sizes and styles, than any other retailer, especially at Christmas. ""We've highlighted one combination in our windows, which are part of a wider campaign that features a large variety of Must-Have Christmas moments, from David Gandy washing up in an M&S suit through to families snuggling up in our matching PJs."" A display at the same Nottingham store suggests women must also have ""outfits to impress"" One reply to the Facebook post alluded to a rape trial in which the defendant's lawyer suggested ateenage girl's choice of underwear suggested she had consented to sex. The battle of the Christmas adverts Meet @JohnLewis - the John Lewis that isn't the British retailer Big retailers unveil Christmas ads Latest news and updates from the East Midlands Another post, from a man, said the window display was ""far too provocative and rapey"". ""It is not the right sort of message especially during this current season when people drink more and their filters are thrown out of the window,"" he wrote. SiÃ¢n Steans took a photo of the display after it was altered by someone from the Nottingham Feminist Action Network. ""As a feminist and a mother to a young daughter I felt embarrassed that I had to yet again explain why women are depicted with so little respect,"" she said. ""When companies insist on men being fully clothed and women showcasing lingerie only, it sends a message about women's place in society as objects to titillate.""

Kuenssberg: The DUP's Brexit message to Theresa MayThe five Brexit questions everyone's asking GoogleBrexit dinner date: Big Brother contestant meets Lord WinstonWho has written no confidence letters?,"Forget for a moment the ""will they, won't they"" numbers game. Unless and until the head honcho of the Tories' backbench committee receives 48 letters there won't be a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. As far as we know tonight the total has not yet been reached. One of those who has submitted their letter told me in no uncertain terms ""where are the others?"" - frustrated that many of his colleagues seem to have promised to be part of the action, but reinforcements are yet to arrive. If and when that threat can more clearly be seen to have retreated, there's a lot to be said about the true power of backbench Brexiteers. But as of the time of writing we are not there yet and who knows, in a matter of hours, the putsch could suddenly be back on. Something very worrying however for Number 10 has just happened for real, more important in this moment than the potential threat from their own backbenches. The DUP, crucial to Theresa May holding on to power, has just abstained in votes on the finance bill. In other words, they decided not to back the prime minister on the Budget. Why? We know that the DUP is furious about the compromises that Number 10 has made to get their draft deal with the EU. And they want to show, loudly and clearly, that they are not on board. A senior DUP source has just told me tonight's votes were deliberately designed to ""send a message to Theresa May that if she wants to continue down the road of the withdrawal agreement and its effect on the Union then there will be repercussions in the Commons"". ""She could be leading them to a very bad place,"" they continued. ""Tory MPs need to realise that their jobs, their majorities, their careers depend on a good working relationship with the DUP and May doesn't appear to be listening."" Ouch. The DUP says this is not the end of the arrangement of so called ""confidence and supply"" agreement, where the government can formally rely on support from the Northern Irish unionists' 10 votes. But the fabric of that arrangement is certainly torn... And once faith is broken between the two, it's hard to see how it could be restored. Remember, there's a really straightforward reason why this matters so much. Theresa May does not have enough votes on her own to pass the Brexit deal. The partnership with the DUP was set up to try to make sure she could. If it collapses completely then her central task becomes yet more seemingly impossible, even if those 48 letters never come.

The five Brexit questions everyone's asking GoogleBrexit dinner date: Big Brother contestant meets Lord WinstonWho has written no confidence letters?,"We all do it - we don't quite understand something, so we reach for our phones and Google it. And Brexit is no different. Here we answer the five most-googled questions to do with Brexit over the past 24 hours. Don't worry, we promise to keep it simple. Brexit - short for ""British exit"" - is the process of the UK leaving the EU (European Union). The EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work. The UK had a referendum in June 2016 where it voted to leave the EU, which it's been part of for more than 40 years. But the exit didn't happen straight away - it's happening on 29 March 2019. Click here for more on Brexit This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) After Brexit was voted for, negotiations started between the UK and the EU. The negotiations are over the ""divorce"" deal. This is a withdrawal agreement which sets out how exactly we leave the EU - not what will happen after we leave. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May presentedthat deal.Here are some key points: Payment: The UK will pay Â£39bn to the EU to cover what it owes Transition period: Between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 nothing much changes to allow the UK and EU to strike a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust Immigration: EU citizens and their families can continue to move to the UK freely before 31 December 2020 Trade: There won't be any changes to trade in the transition period Northern Ireland: Neither the UK or the EU wants there to be a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (here's why). But in the deal, there's an agreement for a backstop. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement This has been one of the biggest sticking points of the whole thing. Neither the UK or the EU want a visible or ""hard"" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with guard posts and checks. So they've agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - that's just another word for a deal to make sure a hard border never happens. It would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. The backstop would only be introduced if a trade deal between the EU and the UK isn't sorted out during the transitional period. But this bit is controversial. Some people say it means the UK would still be tied to EU rules while others don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK. Click here for more on the backstop On 25 November, the prime minister will try and get European leaders to officially back the deal. If approved, she then has to take it to MPs for a vote in Parliament. That's expected to happen in December. At the moment it looks like her deal would be defeated. She doesn't have enough Conservative MPs to force it through and there are MPs from all parties who aren't happy with what's being suggested. Click here for Brexit in eight charts Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? There was a big rally in October demanding a second referendum Well, it is written into UK law that Brexit is going to happen. But some people arecalling fora second referendum (they call it a ""People's Vote""), which would basically ask the question: ""Do you want the UK to leave the EU, now we know what the deal is?"" If that happened, then Brexit could potentially be reversed - but Theresa May has repeatedly said there won't be another referendum.

Brexit dinner date: Big Brother contestant meets Lord WinstonWho has written no confidence letters?,"This video can not be played Watch the best bits of Prof Winston and Aisleyne's date What happens when two strong-minded individuals from opposite sides of the Brexit debate sit down for dinner? To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates. Former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace is pro-Leave. Labour peer and fertility expert Prof Lord Winston believes the UK would be much better remaining in the EU. They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting. But did they get on? Who are you?I'm Aisleyne. I work on TV but my main income is as a property developer. What are your views on Brexit?We need to be able to stand alone. We need to shut the borders because we're bursting at the seams financially and we need to fix our problems at home before we fix anyone else's problems. [Being in the EU] is like having a broken leg and trying to carry another person with a broken leg to the hospital. It's just not going to work. What was your initial impression of Prof Lord Winston?I thought: ""What a dapper gentleman, looking like Super Mario."" Aisleyne and Robert met for the first time How was your date?It was a pleasure to spend time with someone that's so educated and for me to still be able to hold a decent conversation and not feel out of my depth. I'm just in awe of him and all the work he's done with embryos - I saved him in my phone as ""Lord Embryo"". What did you talk about?The fact that he said all of his learned colleagues at [the hospital where he works] were already leaving the UK. That worried me a bit because I didn't think that was happening. I don't know if he was saying it for effect but he doesn't strike me as the type of person to lie. This video can not be played ""You're getting angry with me"". Aisleyne and Robert discuss trade Any common ground?Just the fact that we both loved [hip hop artists] Tupac and Biggie - and our fascination behind reproduction. Anything you didn't enjoy?When he thought I was patronising him [when saying: ""Thank you for your service,"" after he explained his work in the NHS]. He said: ""Don't patronise me,"" but it was really just a compliment, because I'd never want to hurt anyone's feelings. Did he convince you of anything?I still believe that we can stand alone and we do need to fix our problems but he has made me think that it needs to be a little bit more tailored. Before, I thought: ""[Let's just have a] hard Brexit,"" but he has made me realise the intricacies. Did you convince him of anything?Just that I was fabulous - I think he really did stop and listen to what I had to say, which was a huge compliment. Robert tried to ring his son, a Big Brother viewer, during the date Would you see him again?Yes - he took me to the House of Lords [since the blind date]. It was just fascinating. It was really eye-opening to see how the other half work. I just think he's an absolute delight and what a pleasure to now be friends with him - he's a really great person. Describe him in three words:Genius, kind, learned. Marks out of 10 for the date:I really want to say 10. I left feeling like I wanted to know more. I left feeling like I could hold a conversation with a lord. Watch the BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. And find out what happened when broadcaster June Sarpong met ex-Stig Perry McCarthy on Wednesday's Brexit blind date. Who are you?Robert Winston, professor of science and society at Imperial College in London, where I work on reproductive medicine. What are your views on Brexit?I voted Remain. I see myself as a European. I've always felt that. Recognising what had happened to Europe, really from 1618 onwards, the time of the Thirty Years' War, it seemed to me obvious that we actually need some form of better coalition between European countries. I think one of the very real reasons for wanting to be part of the union is to have a peaceful Europe, which has been highly successful. What was remarkable in the Brexit debate was this was seldom actually recognised. This video can not be played Robert tells Aisleyne: ""Don't patronise me"" How was your date?The food was OK. The soup was good but you can't really talk and eat soup. What did you talk about?The NHS, trade, Theresa May. Any common ground?Not much. What did you disagree about?Everything - one of the things that is always a problem in arguments, and I hear it in the House of Lords in debates, is when someone says: ""I believe that so-and-so should happen'. The trouble is when you are arguing with or against belief, there is an emotional compound to it. That is a big problem when you are looking mathematically and rationally and in a dispassionate way. That's the problem with Brexit - it has polarised communities and individuals in a way I don't think anyone expected. What did you learn about your date?I learned a whole lot of things. I didn't know about her background, I didn't know who she was -  I didn't know who I was meeting. Would you see her again?We are going to meet in five years' time, we've agreed - that's a firm commitment. And I took her to the House of Lords so she can see Parliament in action.

Prince talks of 'traumatic' 999 callouts,"This video can not be played Duke talks of being 'tipped over the edge' Prince William has told how ""very traumatic"" callouts involving children took him ""over the edge"" while he was working for the air ambulance. The Duke of Cambridge served as a pilot at the East Anglian Air Ambulance until last summer, after moving from the RAF. The prince, 36, said having his own children - George, Charlotte and Louis - deepened his feelings when sent to distressing jobs. ""I got very sad and very down about this particular family,"" he said. Prince William worked alongside doctors and paramedics providing emergency medical cover across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as Essex and Hertfordshire at night. ""I worked several times on very traumatic jobs involving children,"" he said. ""After I had my own children, I think the relation between the job and the personal life was what really took me over the edge, and I started feeling things that I have never felt before. ""Talking was really important, but even that wasn't quite enough for one particular incident for me."" This video can not be played Prince William has flown the charity's Cambridge-based helicopter Prince William, based at Cambridge Airport for two years, praised both the East Anglian Air Ambulance and the RAF for their good mental health practices.

UN environment chief quits in expenses row,"Erik Solheim was the executive director of UN Environment UN environment chief Erik Solheim has resigned amid a row over his travel expenses. A recent draft internal audit, obtained by Britain's Guardian newspaper and seen by the BBC, said he had incurred costs of $488,518 (Â£382,111) while travelling for 529 out of 668 days. It said this harmed the reputation of UN Environment - a body that highlights green issues and sustainability. There was ""no oversight or accountability"" to monitor this travel. Mr Solheim, a Norwegian former environment minister, says he has paid back the money where ""instances of oversight"" occurred. Report slams 'high flying' UN environment chief On Tuesday, Mr Solheim himself confirmed his resignation, Norway's NRK broadcaster reported. A formal UN announcement is expected shortly. By Matt McGrath, BBC environment correspondent Once news leaked about Erik Solheim's flights and expenses, he was on borrowed time at the UN. It wasn't solely because of the large sums involved - there was also an image problem. At a time when awareness of climate change has never been greater, the sight of the man dedicated to fighting global warming endlessly jet-setting around the world risked reputational damage to the UN. The auditor's report had also upset some European countries to such an extent that they had threatened to withhold millions of dollars in funding if he continued in post. While many in UN circles will be glad to see him go, some will miss the energy and greater visibility he brought to a once-lacklustre branch of the organisation. The amount spent on travel by UN Environment, a Kenya-based agency, doubled between 2014 and 2017. The report was particularly critical of the travel undertaken under Mr Solheim, UN Environment executive director since 2016. A total about $58m was spent in the two years since then. While all UN staff are expected to complete ""mission reports"" within two weeks of travel, the audit found that these were often missing. When they requested reports for 596 trips undertaken by 32 managers and staff,  210 mission reports were not provided, while around 200 others were only completed after the request was made. The audio was carried out by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). It says Mr Solheim's leave and travel were approved by a member of his office who reported directly to him - in contravention of UN rules. On one occasion, it says, ""he made an eight-hour trip from Washington DC for a weekend in Paris, before taking another flight to New York city.""

Parents 'not wholly to blame for child weight',"Pointing the finger of blame at parents for children's weight gain may be unfair, research suggests. It has been thought that parents' feeding patterns are a major factor in whether a child is under or overweight. But a study suggests parents adapt their feeding styles in line with a child's natural weight and size, which is largely genetically influenced. The study was carried out by researchers at King's College London and University College London (UCL). The research says that, since the onset of the childhood obesity crisis at the turn of the century, the spotlight has focused on environmental factors for the problem - in the hope of finding solutions. Parenting advice 'cuts child obesity' What does it mean if a child is 'severely obese'? ""Perhaps unsurprisingly, parental behaviours have received a great deal of attention,"" it says. ""Parents are widely considered to be the 'gatekeepers' to their children's food, and powerful shapers of their developing eating behaviour."" The study notes that two types of parental feeding styles, in particular, play a role in how parents regulate children's eating habits: restriction of food, which is thought to lead to weight gain because children overeat when the restriction is not there (the ""forbidden fruit"" effect) pressure to eat, which is thought to make children with low appetites anxious, and compromise weight gain But rather than dictate children's habits, the research suggests parents are ""responding to their child's emerging characteristics, not simply causing them"". The researchers assessed data, from the Twins Early Development Study, of 4,500 sets of twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996. They calculated a genetic score that sets out the likelihood of these individuals to have a higher or lower body mass index (BMI). They then matched this score against parents' feeding reports, setting out whether they used restriction or pressure. The study found those children with a higher genetic BMI score had higher reported rates of parental restriction and those with lower BMIs had higher rates of pressuring, suggesting parents were adjusting their strategies for each child. Even within families where non-identical twins differed in their genetic predisposition, parents were more restrictive with the twin who had a tendency to be of a higher weight and were more pressuring of the twin who tended to weigh less. Lead author, Saskia Selzam, from King's College London, says: ""Our findings suggest that parents develop their feeding practices in response to their child's natural tendency towards a higher or lower weight. ""The way a parent feeds their child may also influence their child's weight to some extent, but our results challenge the prevailing view that parental behaviour is the major influence on childhood weight."" Senior author, Dr Clare Llewellyn from UCL, adds: ""These results show that parents are not the 'full story' when it comes to a child's weight, and blaming parents for being too controlling about feeding may be unfair. ""But it is unclear whether these natural 'go to' strategies are helpful, harmful, or of no consequence to a child's weight in the long run."" Ms Selzam says parents clearly have an impact, but not only in establishing learnt eating behaviours. ""It doesn't mean that feeding strategies aren't important. ""But the main point is how parents influence their children's BMI genetically. ""A lot of studies suggest it must be the parents that cause the weight gain, but we are showing that it's more complex than that."" The researchers say further study is needed to  identify which feeding strategies are acceptable and how they work.

Man 'not party to daughter's killing'A father breaks down in tears at the suggestion he was party to his daughter's abuse and murder.Sussex,"Barrie Fellows had banned Nicola from Wild Park after dark A father has denied claims he was party to the sexual abuse and murder of his nine-year-old daughter and her friend near Brighton 32 years ago. Barrie Fellows was giving evidence at the Old Bailey where Russell Bishop, 52, formerly of Brighton, faces a second trial and denies both murders. He denied being party to his daughter being filmed in a pornographic video. His daughter Nicola and Karen Hadaway, also nine, were found dead in Wild Park, a day after they went missing. Bishop's defence team has cast suspicion on Mr Fellows, claiming police spent 32 years investigating the wrong man. Earlier in the trial, jurors were told that""only one person is sitting in the dock"". But the court heard the law allowed a defendant to ""point out facts, ask questions, to the jury that might suggest the possibility that another person exists who may have carried out these awful attacks"". Joel Bennathan QC, defending Bishop, cross-examined Mr Fellows, asking him: ""Were you party to Nicola being filmed in a pornographic video?"" He went on to ask him: ""Were you and another man watching a homemade pornographic film of your own infant daughter?"" And he asked him: ""Were you anything to do with her death?"" Mr Fellows, close to tears, replied ""no"", denying all three claims. He also denied a suggestion that there was a missing hour in his alibi on 9 October 1986, the day the girls went missing. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows became known as the Babes in the Wood Asked about past incidents of violence, Mr Fellows admitted giving Nicola a ""thick ear"" on one occasion and threatening to ""chop her fingers off"" when she was suspected of stealing at school. Asked about an incident in which his great-grandmother-in-law suffered a broken nose, Mr Fellows said: ""I swung around and did not see her."" Mr Fellows told jurors he took police to look around Wild Park after the girls went missing, because it was his daughter's ""favourite"" spot. Jurors heard he banned his daughter from the park after dark, telling her the ""bogeyman"" lived there. He denied knowing his daughter had a camp or ""secret den"" in the park, where the girls were found. Russell Bishop was cleared of murdering the girls in 1987 and faces a second trial Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said to Mr Fellows: ""What is being suggested, you are being accused of having killed Nicola. You are being accused of having killed Karen. ""You are being accused of having sexually abused your own daughter and Karen in that den, and having punched Nicola in the face, do you understand that?"" Mr Fellows was emotional as he said he understood. Mr Altman also asked the father how hard it was to identify his daughter's body. Starting to cry, Mr Fellows said it was difficult to talk about, adding: ""I walked in there and there was a sheet over my little girl up to the neck."" He said he had asked if he was allowed to give her her ""pocket money"" before putting 50p into her hand. The trial continues.

Mud dumped on grave on anniversary of death,"Mr Hegarty's family was greeted by the mound of mud on the anniversary of his death The family of a motorcyclist killed in a race said they were heartbroken after a mound of soil was left on his grave on the first anniversary of his death. Daniel Hegarty, 31, from Nottingham, suffered fatal injuries whenhe came off his bike at the Macau Grand Prixon 18 November 2017. The mud had been left ahead of a burial that was taking place later in the week. Bingham Town Council has since moved the earth and apologised to the family. The father-of-two was competing for Topgun Racing Honda, in China, when he crashed into barriers, losing his helmet and sustaining fatal injuries. He died before arriving at hospital. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Daniel Hegarty died following a crash during a race in China in 2017 Charley Johnson, a former partner of Mr Hegarty, said tributes which had been left to commemorate his life had been moved and a wooden board was propped close to his gravestone. She said there had been ""no apology"" at the time and ""no explanation"" as to why it had happened. ""It shouldn't have happened in the first place,"" she said.

Man 'not party to daughter's killing',"Barrie Fellows had banned Nicola from Wild Park after dark A father has denied claims he was party to the sexual abuse and murder of his nine-year-old daughter and her friend near Brighton 32 years ago. Barrie Fellows was giving evidence at the Old Bailey where Russell Bishop, 52, formerly of Brighton, faces a second trial and denies both murders. He denied being party to his daughter being filmed in a pornographic video. His daughter Nicola and Karen Hadaway, also nine, were found dead in Wild Park, a day after they went missing. Bishop's defence team has cast suspicion on Mr Fellows, claiming police spent 32 years investigating the wrong man. Earlier in the trial, jurors were told that""only one person is sitting in the dock"". But the court heard the law allowed a defendant to ""point out facts, ask questions, to the jury that might suggest the possibility that another person exists who may have carried out these awful attacks"". Joel Bennathan QC, defending Bishop, cross-examined Mr Fellows, asking him: ""Were you party to Nicola being filmed in a pornographic video?"" He went on to ask him: ""Were you and another man watching a homemade pornographic film of your own infant daughter?"" And he asked him: ""Were you anything to do with her death?"" Mr Fellows, close to tears, replied ""no"", denying all three claims. He also denied a suggestion that there was a missing hour in his alibi on 9 October 1986, the day the girls went missing. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows became known as the Babes in the Wood Asked about past incidents of violence, Mr Fellows admitted giving Nicola a ""thick ear"" on one occasion and threatening to ""chop her fingers off"" when she was suspected of stealing at school. Asked about an incident in which his great-grandmother-in-law suffered a broken nose, Mr Fellows said: ""I swung around and did not see her."" Mr Fellows told jurors he took police to look around Wild Park after the girls went missing, because it was his daughter's ""favourite"" spot. Jurors heard he banned his daughter from the park after dark, telling her the ""bogeyman"" lived there. He denied knowing his daughter had a camp or ""secret den"" in the park, where the girls were found. Russell Bishop was cleared of murdering the girls in 1987 and faces a second trial Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said to Mr Fellows: ""What is being suggested, you are being accused of having killed Nicola. You are being accused of having killed Karen. ""You are being accused of having sexually abused your own daughter and Karen in that den, and having punched Nicola in the face, do you understand that?"" Mr Fellows was emotional as he said he understood. Mr Altman also asked the father how hard it was to identify his daughter's body. Starting to cry, Mr Fellows said it was difficult to talk about, adding: ""I walked in there and there was a sheet over my little girl up to the neck."" He said he had asked if he was allowed to give her her ""pocket money"" before putting 50p into her hand. The trial continues.

Police apologise for 'genitalia' appeal,"North Yorkshire Police said its original appeal had ""too much detail"" Police have apologised for providing ""too much detail"" in a description of a man who performed a sex act in front of a woman in York. The North Yorkshire force had said it was looking for a ""fat, naked man"" and described his sexual organs explicitly after the incident onSunday afternoon. It said the appeal had ""caused upset to a number of people"". The details on its website have now been replaced with a ""more appropriately worded version"". More stories from around Yorkshire The revised wording, which was also posted to its Facebook page, removed the detailed description of the man's ""small penis"" and ""testicles that hang noticeably low"". It said officers in York were investigating ""a disturbing incident in which an overweight, naked man performed a sex act on himself in front of a woman student"". It happened at 13:15 GMT on 18 November as the 20-year-old was walking alone on Windmill Lane and on to a woodland cycle path in the direction of Hull Road. A force spokesman said patrols had been stepped up in the area to provide public reassurance. The suspect was also described as white, with a very pale complexion, aged between 35 and 45, about 5ft 10in (1.8m) tall with a fat build. Most of the people commenting on the revised Facebook appeal - which has drawn hundreds of comments - said they preferred the original.

Grenfell Tower fire spread in 10 minutes,"The advice for Grenfell Tower residents to stay in their flats should have been reconsidered once the fire reached the outside, which took just 10 minutes. The Grenfell Inquiry heard the small kitchen fire broke out through a uPVC window fitting, igniting the cladding. Professor Jose Torero, a fire safety expert, said from that moment ""the stay-put strategy was compromised"" and evacuation should have been considered. The disaster, in west London on 14 June 2017, killed 72 people. Prof Torero's report for the inquiry said the blaze probably set fire to one of the flammable components of the cladding 11 minutes after the fire started. That was before firefighters had entered the fourth-floor flat 16. â¢ The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast Why was 'stay put' advice disastrous? 'Catastrophic' safety failures at Grenfell Flames then spread up the east side of the building, as showed in a video montage played at the inquiry. ""Analysis indicates that a relatively minor, localised fire compromised the uPVC window fittings and ignited one of the flammable components of the cladding by direct flame/plume impingement,"" Prof Torero wrote. ""From this point forward, the stay-put strategy was compromised and evacuation of occupants was an option to consider."" Images from the kitchen of flat 16 show the positioning of the kitchen appliances and the window He said such a kitchen fire in a high-rise residential building was an ""inevitable and perfectly foreseeable event"" but should have been contained. ""Fires are common events, but fires that create significant damage are rare events,"" he said. ""The building is required to respond and deliver... so that a fire of this nature does not progress beyond a kitchen."" Prof Torero - who is John L. Bryan chair at the Department of Fire Protection Engineering and the director of the Centre for Disaster Resilience at the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Maryland, in the US - said there was a high probability of any fire starting near a window at Grenfell Tower spreading to the cladding. Compartmentation, a design feature dividing a building into different areas which is intended to stop fire spreading, had failed by 1.05am that day, he added. By 1.11am, it would have been obvious to firefighters that the outside of the building was burning.

Trump backs 'steadfast' Saudi Arabia,"This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? US President Donald Trump has strongly defended ties with Saudi Arabia despite international condemnation of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder. The kingdom is a ""steadfast partner"" that has agreed to invest ""a record amount of money"" in the US, Mr Trump said in a statement. The president acknowledged Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ""could very well"" have known about Khashoggi's murder. ""In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" he added. Mr Khashoggi was murdered on 2 October on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The journalist who vanished into a consulate The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing on rogue agentsbut denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. US media have reported thatthe CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. Mr Trump's statement said: ""[It] could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" Later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that the CIA had not made a ""100%"" determination on the killing. In an interview on Sunday,the president told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it ""a suffering tape"". By the BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Riyadh For Saudis, and especially Saudi leaders, there will be a sigh of relief. But, it's also what they expected, and what they've always said about President Trump - he will be a true friend of the Kingdom. Both sides want to draw a line under this major crisis - and global outcry. But as Mr Trump acknowledged, and Saudis know, it won't go away. Not for many in the US Congress, as well as for many others, including countries who will continue to call for greater clarity. Many Saudis say they don't believe their country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, would have ordered such a despicable act. Many, who'd long been hoping to see their country move forward, have been shaken by this shocking murder, and regret it will cast a dark shadow for many years to come. In the words of one prominent Saudi: ""It has brought Saudi Arabia ten steps back."" Meanwhile, Lindsey Graham, a senator from Mr Trump's Republican Party, has predicted strong bipartisan support in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia ""including appropriate members of the royal family"".

""The world is a very dangerous place!"", Mr Trump states, before holding up Saudi Arabia as an ally of the US against Iran. The kingdom spent ""billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism"" whereas Iran has ""killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East"", it says. Mike Pompeo backed Mr Trump, saying ""it's a mean, nasty world out there"" The statement also stresses Saudi investment pledges and arms purchases. ""If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries,"" it adds. While admitting the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was ""terrible"", Mr Trump wrote that ""we may never know all of the facts"" about his death. ""The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region."" Mr Trump later said he would meet Mohammed bin Salman at a G20 meeting in Argentina next week if the crown prince attended. Khashoggi murder: Is Saudi crown prince finished? Saudi Arabia 'tortured female activists' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has backed his president, saying after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu that ""it's a mean, nasty world out there"" and that Mr Trump was ""obliged to adopt policies that further America's national security"". Mr Cavusoglu said that co-operation with Saudi Arabia on the issue was ""not where we want it"". In a statement, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she was shocked the president was not going to punish Mohammed bin Salman over the ""premeditated murder"" of Khashoggi. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter, Washington Donald Trump is a different kind of president, and nowhere is that more clear than in his foreign policy, exclamation points and all. His release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, and not just its blunt language. The president quickly tries to change the subject to Iran. He dismisses reports that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder with a maybe-he-did, maybe-he-didn't shrug. He cites the economic impact of $450bn in investment and arms sales to the Saudis, although much of that is little more than paper promises. Perhaps most jarring is his casual observation that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi - a permanent US resident - as an ""enemy of the state"" with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr Trump has distilled his ""America First"" worldview down to its very essence. Morality and global leadership take a back seat to perceived US economic and military security. Read more from Anthony What the take-away will be in the Middle East and beyond is a serious issue, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus. US policy in the region is so closely aligned with that of two key individuals - Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - that it is increasingly hard to see how the US can play a role as an independent arbiter, our correspondent says. Mr Trump's narrow, interests-based approach will further dismay Washington's allies in the West, he argues, reinforcing those in Moscow and Beijing who are already applying a ""Russia First"" and a ""China First"" approach in international affairs. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted his disgust at the Trump statement, calling it disgraceful: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dozens die as Kabul bomber targets clerics,"This is one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent months A suicide bomb attack on a gathering of religious scholars in the Afghan capital, Kabul, has killed at least 50 people. At least 83 people were also wounded as the clerics met at the Uranus wedding hall, a large banqueting complex near the airport, to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. It is one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent months. No-one has yet claimed it was behind the blast. So-called Islamic State and the Taliban have carried out a string of attacks in recent years. But the Taliban has denied involvement and condemned the attack. Some 1,000 people were said to be in the complex at the time of the explosion. Basir Mujahid, a spokesman for Kabul police, said that ""Islamic scholars and their followers had gathered to recite verses from the holy Koran to observe the Eid Milad-un-Nabi festival"". The suicide bomber gained entry and headed for the centre of the gathering, where he detonated his explosives. Religious studies lecturer Mohammad Hanif said there was a deafening explosion and ""everyone in the halls was screaming for help"". Images from the scene showed ripped and blood-stained clothes, broken glass and overturned furniture. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as an ""unforgivable crime"" and declared Wednesday a day of national mourning. The Islamic State in Afghanistan group, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan, has claimed responsibility for most of the recent deadly attacks of this kind. It said it was behind two attacks in Kabul in Augustthat killed dozens of people. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Dozens of people were also killed across the countryas voters cast ballots in the nation's parliamentary elections in October. The Taliban have also continued attacks, although many of them target security forces. Who are the Taliban? There are some with the Taliban. This month,Taliban militants for the first time attended an international meeting, hosted by Russia, to discuss ending the decades-long conflict. The regularity of attacks continues to stretch security forces The US special envoy for Afghanistan has also been meeting Taliban officials in Qatar, but no agreement has so far been reached. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. The Islamic State group is another matter. Opposed by the Taliban and considered a major threat by Western powers, the Sunni militants aim to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war with Shias, who they consider apostates. The violence is not easing. Civilian deaths and injuries have hit record highs. Casualty figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009.

Tekashi 6ix9ine facing life in prisonNew charges relating to his involvement with a violent gang could land him in jail for 32 years.,"Tekashi 6ix9ine is facing jail time, again. This time, it's for his involvement with a violent US gang. The rapper was arrested on Sunday night and faces 32 years in jail for racketeering and other offences, according to a prosecuting US attorney. The sentence would be for life in prison and stems from his involvement with the Nine Trey Bloods. The Nine Trey Bloods are a New York gang and also known as TreyWay which Tekashi69has mentioned on Twitter.,external But now his involvement could cost him his freedom. ""In the history of the US, the one thing that seems to get someone locked up is racketeering, money-laundering or tax evasion,"" UK hip hop and culture writer, Jesse Bernard tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""This could be what takes him to prison."" The rapper scored his first UK hit in 2018 with his Nicki Minaj collaboration, Fefe Tekashi69 has evaded jail time on previous charges, including child sex offences in 2015, but experts believe the racketeering charges could mean a lengthy jail spell for the star. Racketeering is when people use criminal actions to repeatedly take money from others, and most likely associated with protection rackets. ""This defendant participated in multiple acts of violence,"" said assistant US attorney Michael Long at a court hearing on Monday night,reports Rolling Stone.,external It's an eventful week for Tekashi 6ix9ine, he's also releasing his debut album on Friday According to US reports, the new arrest relates to a five-year federal investigation and Tekashi69 is also facing a number of other charges including drug dealing, involvement in an armed robbery and a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Tekashi69's most recent arrest caps a turbulent year in which the rapper rose to international fame with a string of hit singles, but so did his legal history. In 2015he pleaded guilty to an incident involving a ""sexual performance""with a 13-year-old girl and is currently serving a four-year-probation sentence following legal problems that followed the case. He has previously spent time in jail for assault and drug offences. Jesse tells Newsbeat that society has been idolising men who engage in violent behaviour for centuries But none of Tekashi69's previous charges have stopped his fame from growing. He's even due to release his debut album later this week - which features both Kanye West and Nicki Minaj. But Jesse believes these collaborations are ""an industry thing"" and says record labels should spend more time considering the behaviour of the stars they sign. ""There's not enough vetting taking place, when these artists are being signed, maybe someone is turning a blind eye, who knows. But it's not just that,"" he says.

Three hurt at nuclear power plant,"The injured people are employees of power company EDF, which owns the plant in Heysham Three people have been injured in a serious incident at a nuclear power plant in Lancashire. Power company EDF, which owns Heysham 1 power station, said the employees were taken to hospital following an ""accidental steam release"". The BBC understands one person suffered burns, one a broken hip and the other a broken back. EDF said Monday night's incident was not related to the nuclear process and there was no danger to public safety. The casualties were said to be conscious and speaking when they were taken to hospital. Five fire crews attended the incident at 22:40 GMT and remained at the site for more than two hours as a precaution. A spokeswoman for EDF said a ""full investigation"" would now be carried out to determine the cause. ""It goes without saying that everyone's thoughts are with our three colleagues who have been injured,"" she said. ""We will be doing everything we can to support them and their families while they recover. ""There was no risk to the public during the incident which is now under control. Safety is our overriding priority and we will investigate how this happened.""

"Dozens die as Kabul bomber targets clericsThe suicide bomb attack kills 43 and wounds 83, as scholars marked the Prophet Muhammad's birthday.Asia","This is one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent months A suicide bomb attack on a gathering of religious scholars in the Afghan capital, Kabul, has killed at least 50 people. At least 83 people were also wounded as the clerics met at the Uranus wedding hall, a large banqueting complex near the airport, to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. It is one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent months. No-one has yet claimed it was behind the blast. So-called Islamic State and the Taliban have carried out a string of attacks in recent years. But the Taliban has denied involvement and condemned the attack. Some 1,000 people were said to be in the complex at the time of the explosion. Basir Mujahid, a spokesman for Kabul police, said that ""Islamic scholars and their followers had gathered to recite verses from the holy Koran to observe the Eid Milad-un-Nabi festival"". The suicide bomber gained entry and headed for the centre of the gathering, where he detonated his explosives. Religious studies lecturer Mohammad Hanif said there was a deafening explosion and ""everyone in the halls was screaming for help"". Images from the scene showed ripped and blood-stained clothes, broken glass and overturned furniture. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as an ""unforgivable crime"" and declared Wednesday a day of national mourning. The Islamic State in Afghanistan group, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan, has claimed responsibility for most of the recent deadly attacks of this kind. It said it was behind two attacks in Kabul in Augustthat killed dozens of people. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Dozens of people were also killed across the countryas voters cast ballots in the nation's parliamentary elections in October. The Taliban have also continued attacks, although many of them target security forces. Who are the Taliban? There are some with the Taliban. This month,Taliban militants for the first time attended an international meeting, hosted by Russia, to discuss ending the decades-long conflict. The regularity of attacks continues to stretch security forces The US special envoy for Afghanistan has also been meeting Taliban officials in Qatar, but no agreement has so far been reached. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. The Islamic State group is another matter. Opposed by the Taliban and considered a major threat by Western powers, the Sunni militants aim to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war with Shias, who they consider apostates. The violence is not easing. Civilian deaths and injuries have hit record highs. Casualty figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009.

BBC consultation on over-75s licence fee,"Free TV licences for over 75s are the subject of the consultation The BBC is launching a consultation period to decide how licence fees for over-75s should be paid for. They are currently financed by a government-funded scheme, which is due to end in 2020. It is expected the cost of free licences to the over-75s will total Â£745m - a fifth of the BBC's current budget by 2021/22. The consultation period is running for 12 weeks from 20 November until 12 February. In a speech to the BBC, Director General Tony Hall said there were ""important issues to get right"". Lord Hall added: ""While the costs of the schemes are rising, so is the need for our programmes and content. We are looking at options for reform, what's fair, what's feasible,"" he said. BBC licence fees: Who should pay? Free TV licence recipients 'richer' It was also outlined that the cost of taking on the scheme would be the equivalent of what is spent today on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, CBBC and CBeebies. The public can read and respond to the consultation inEnglishhere or inWelshhere. Four options were set out in areport,,externalcommissioned by the BBC, produced by Frontier Economics. They consisted of: The report estimates that residual costs to shut down the concession would cost Â£72m - or 10% of the cost of continuing with it. When the government introduced the free licence fee for over-75s in 2000, it was argued the benefits would (largely) go to poorer households. However, that argument has weakened with the improvement in living standards for the over-75s. A 50% concession is in line with what's currently being offered to those with visual impairments. Lord Hall has announced the public consultation on the future of free TV licences for the over-75s It estimates the cost to the BBC would be around Â£400m in 2021/22, which is 56% of the cost of reinstating the current concession - the extra 6% is due to admin. Raise age threshold to 77 Aligns with increased longevity and reforms to state pension age but retains an arbitrary threshold. The report estimates that it would cost Â£645m which is 87% of the cost of reinstating the current concession in 2021/22. They note the vast majority of households containing someone older than 75 also contain someone over the age of 77 so relatively few households would lose out. Raise age threshold to 80 This would align with other pensioner benefits that begin at 80 such as the over-80s increase in winter fuel payments. The estimated cost is Â£481m - that's 65% of the cost of reinstating the current situation. People over the age of 80 are more likely to live alone so this could help to target the concession  at those who are most reliant on television for company. Link free TV licences to over-75s who get pension credit Pension credit is a government-defined measure of need - so this would improve targeting of those at need of a free TV licence. It's estimated this would cost Â£209m or 28% of the cost of keeping the current concession. Link free TV licences to anyone receiving pension credit regardless of age Improves targeting and would align with other benefits. The estimated cost to the BBC is Â£327m -  44% as much as that of reinstating the current concession.

Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment,"This video can not be played Theresa May: EU nationals won't be able to 'jump the queue' after Brexit Theresa May is facing a backlash after she said EU workers would no longer be able to ""jump the queue"" after Brexit. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's words were ""disgraceful"" and EU citizens living in the UK said they would fuel hate crimes against them. The comments came in a speech to business leaders on Monday, in which she vowed to end EU free movement after Brexit. Downing Street said EU citizens made an ""important contribution"" to the UK. Live updates: Theresa May and Brexit developments May seeks business backing for Brexit plan The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The government says it wants the estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU nations already living in the UK to stay after Brexit but they will have to apply for leave to remain. But Mrs May used her speech to the CBI to highlight the fact that the proposed EU withdrawal agreement will bring an ""end to free movement, once and for all"". The government has yet to set out details of what this will mean in practice in the longer term, but Mrs May has said at some point in the future, after the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU kicks in, that EU citizens will be treated the same as those arriving from outside the EU. ""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi,"" said Mrs May in her speech. ""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the prime minister's language was ""offensive"" and ""disgraceful"". ""That the case for Brexit has been reduced to such a miserable and self-defeating bottom line is depressing in the extreme. Let's lift our sights higher than this. ""Actually, the more I think about it, the more offensive 'jump the queue' is as a description of a reciprocal right of free movement. Really disgraceful."" The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt also criticised Mrs May. ""EU citizens living, working, contributing to UK communities, didn't 'jump the queue' and neither did UK nationals in Europe,"" he said. ""They were exercising rights which provided freedom and opportunities. We will fight to ensure these continue in the future, especially after any transition."" EU citizens living in the UK took to social media to accuse the prime minister of using them as scapegoats to shore up support for her Brexit agreement. Allow Twitter content?

Citizens rights campaigner and professor of history at Northumbria University Tanja Bueltmann said the PM's ""despicable"" comments were a ""punch in the face"" for EU citizens like her who had made their home in the UK. ""We are your neighbours, colleagues, friends and family; your doctors, hairdressers and teachers,""she said in a Huffington Post article,external. Mrs May's words ""essentially cast us as unwanted queue-jumpers, cheats and people without skills and talents undeserving to be here, in our own home,"" she added. She accused the prime minister of trying to set one group against another - and said her words would mean EU citizens would have to ""brace themselves for yet more hate over the coming months"". ""The press called May's speech her Brexit fightback. It is not. But it is a fight on the back of EU citizens. In less than a week, May reduced us from 'valued citizens' to 'queue-jumpers.'"" Mike Galsworthy, a director of anti-Brexit campaign Scientists4EU, accused the prime minister of playing a ""cynical"" blame game to sell her Brexit agreement, in a video message on Twitter.

""EU citizens already contributing to the UK didn't get here by jumping the queue, they got here by being the best person for that job,"" said Mr Galsworthy. Any hurdles faced by workers from outside the EU, such as visa and financial stipulations, had been placed there by the UK government, he added. The prime minister's official spokesman, when asked whether Mrs May regarded EU nationals currently working in the NHS and other public services as having ""jumped the queue"", said: ""We have always been clear of the important contribution which EU citizens make to our economy and to public services. ""The point the prime minister is making is that we wish to have a global system where people's skills are the basis on which they are able to work in the UK. ""At the moment, we have two systems in place - one for people coming to the UK from outside the EU and one for people coming under the rules of free movement. ""It's a fact that people coming under the system of free movement don't need a visa and those from outside the EU do."" The spokesman said an immigration white paper setting out the proposed new system was due to be published ""shortly"".

M&S knickers display 'vomit-inducing',"Fran Bailey said the juxtaposition was ""grossly, grossly offensive"" Feminists have described a Marks & Spencer window display that suggests women must have ""fancy little knickers"" as sexist and ""vomit-inducing"". The display at the Nottingham store is juxtaposed with one which suggests men must have ""outfits to impress"". A campaigner altered the window so that it read ""full human rights"" instead of ""knickers"". M&S said the displays were part of a wider campaign that featured a variety of ""must-haves"". Another window display at the same Nottingham store is aimed at women and suggests they, too, must have ""outfits to impress"". Concern was raised whena photo was posted in a Facebook group,externalcalled Feminist Friends Nottingham. A campaigner altered the window so that it read ""full human rights"" instead of ""knickers"" Fran Bailey asked: ""Ok, M&S Nottingham, have we really not learned anything in the last 35 years? Or am I alone in finding this, their major window display, completely vomit inducing?"" Speaking to the BBC, she said the display had ""incensed"" her for two reasons and had put her off from shopping at M&S. ""I think M&S using the slogan 'must-have' over Christmas fripperies is very distasteful when true necessities are lacking for many working and non-working people; the true necessities being warmth, shelter and food,"" she said. ""I also feel very, very strongly about the representation of women as being preoccupied with fancy little knickers, whereas men are presented as powerful and needing to be impressive. ""I don't have a problem with people choosing to wear whatever they want to wear, I just feel like the juxtaposition is what's grossly, grossly offensive. ""We are surrounded by sexual images of both men and women. M&S are not by any means the only offenders but that particular window just epitomises everything that's wrong with current marketing and how far backwards we've gone."" The wider campaign includes an image of model David Gandy washing up M&S said its stores had various combinations of Christmas window displays, but the same two displays would appear next to one another at some other branches. The retailer said in a statement: ""M&S sells more underwear, in more shapes, sizes and styles, than any other retailer, especially at Christmas. ""We've highlighted one combination in our windows, which are part of a wider campaign that features a large variety of Must-Have Christmas moments, from David Gandy washing up in an M&S suit through to families snuggling up in our matching PJs."" A display at the same Nottingham store suggests women must also have ""outfits to impress"" One reply to the Facebook post alluded to a rape trial in which the defendant's lawyer suggested ateenage girl's choice of underwear suggested she had consented to sex. The battle of the Christmas adverts Meet @JohnLewis - the John Lewis that isn't the British retailer Big retailers unveil Christmas ads Latest news and updates from the East Midlands Another post, from a man, said the window display was ""far too provocative and rapey"". ""It is not the right sort of message especially during this current season when people drink more and their filters are thrown out of the window,"" he wrote. SiÃ¢n Steans took a photo of the display after it was altered by someone from the Nottingham Feminist Action Network. ""As a feminist and a mother to a young daughter I felt embarrassed that I had to yet again explain why women are depicted with so little respect,"" she said. ""When companies insist on men being fully clothed and women showcasing lingerie only, it sends a message about women's place in society as objects to titillate."" Outrage grew when the photo was shared on Twitter by FiLiA, which describes itself as ""The Largest Annual Feminist Conference in the UK"". Allow Twitter content?

Tekashi 6ix9ine facing life in prison,"Tekashi 6ix9ine is facing jail time, again. This time, it's for his involvement with a violent US gang. The rapper was arrested on Sunday night and faces 32 years in jail for racketeering and other offences, according to a prosecuting US attorney. The sentence would be for life in prison and stems from his involvement with the Nine Trey Bloods. The Nine Trey Bloods are a New York gang and also known as TreyWay which Tekashi69has mentioned on Twitter.,external But now his involvement could cost him his freedom. ""In the history of the US, the one thing that seems to get someone locked up is racketeering, money-laundering or tax evasion,"" UK hip hop and culture writer, Jesse Bernard tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""This could be what takes him to prison."" The rapper scored his first UK hit in 2018 with his Nicki Minaj collaboration, Fefe Tekashi69 has evaded jail time on previous charges, including child sex offences in 2015, but experts believe the racketeering charges could mean a lengthy jail spell for the star. Racketeering is when people use criminal actions to repeatedly take money from others, and most likely associated with protection rackets. ""This defendant participated in multiple acts of violence,"" said assistant US attorney Michael Long at a court hearing on Monday night,reports Rolling Stone.,external It's an eventful week for Tekashi 6ix9ine, he's also releasing his debut album on Friday According to US reports, the new arrest relates to a five-year federal investigation and Tekashi69 is also facing a number of other charges including drug dealing, involvement in an armed robbery and a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Tekashi69's most recent arrest caps a turbulent year in which the rapper rose to international fame with a string of hit singles, but so did his legal history. In 2015he pleaded guilty to an incident involving a ""sexual performance""with a 13-year-old girl and is currently serving a four-year-probation sentence following legal problems that followed the case. He has previously spent time in jail for assault and drug offences. Jesse tells Newsbeat that society has been idolising men who engage in violent behaviour for centuries But none of Tekashi69's previous charges have stopped his fame from growing. He's even due to release his debut album later this week - which features both Kanye West and Nicki Minaj. But Jesse believes these collaborations are ""an industry thing"" and says record labels should spend more time considering the behaviour of the stars they sign. ""There's not enough vetting taking place, when these artists are being signed, maybe someone is turning a blind eye, who knows. But it's not just that,"" he says. ""There does need to be more vetting because when the mainstream itself is becoming littered with these conveyor-belt artists that really don't have much longevity.""

WW1 mural row student leader steps down,"Emily Dawes apologised after sending the initial tweet A student leader who sparked outrage by saying a mural dedicated to soldiers in World War One should be painted over has resigned. The artwork, in the University of Southampton Senate Room, shows a degree being given to an unknown soldier. Union president Emily Dawesfaced a backlash onlineafter saying the ""mural of white men"" would be taken down or daubed over. She said she ""acted impulsively"" and would step down with immediate effect. The artwork was painted in 1916 as a tribute to soldiers who could not complete their studies On 24 October Ms Dawes tweeted: ""Mark my words - we're taking down the mural of white men in the uni Senate room, even if I have to paint over it myself."" The mural, painted by Sir William Rothenstein in 1916, was completed as a tribute to students who were killed in World War One and were unable to collect their degrees. Ms Dawes later apologised, but a petition calling for her to resign from her post was signed more than 21,000 times. In a statement released through the Students' Union she said she had ""decided it is best"" to stand down from the role. Emily Dawes' original tweet - since deleted - sparked a social media backlash She said: ""I sincerely apologise for the offence and disrespect caused by my earlier comments which were misinformed. ""I acted impulsively and as such fully accept how careless and hurtful my words were."" In a statement, the university said: ""We respect Emily's decision and will continue to provide her with support."" Southampton Itchen MP Royston Smith was among those initially critical of Ms Dawes. He said it was ""in poor taste"" to ""disregard the heroic sacrifice of soldiers who sought to defend the very freedoms, including free speech, which [Ms Dawes] has chosen to exercise"". More than 1,000 people replied to Ms Dawes' post on Twitter, with some describing the comments as ""ignorant"" and showing ""contempt for our brave soldiers"". The artwork was unveiled in the university's Senate Room in 2014 as part of a series of events to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of World War One.

Whale 'had 115 plastic cups' in stomach,"Items found inside the whale included drinking cups, plastic bottles, plastic bags and flip-flops A dead sperm whale that washed ashore in a national park in Indonesia had nearly 6kg (13 lbs) of plastic waste in its stomach, park officials say. Items found included 115 drinking cups, four plastic bottles, 25 plastic bags and two flip-flops. The carcass of the 9.5m (31ft) mammal was found in waters near Kapota Island in the Wakatobi National Park late on Monday. The discovery has caused consternation among environmentalists. ""Although we have not been able to deduce the cause of death, the facts that we see are truly awful,"" Dwi Suprapti, a marine species conservation co-ordinator at WWF Indonesia, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Plastic pollution: Images of a global problem Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Single-use plastics ban backed by European MPs It was not possible to say whether the plastic had caused the whale's death because of its advanced state of decay, she added.

Ivanka used own email for White House business,"Ms Trump reportedly stopped using her personal email for official work after being told the rules Ivanka Trump used a personal email account to send hundreds of messages discussing official White House business last year, officials confirm. A review into her emails revealed she had used her private address to contact government officials. Ms Trump sent the emails before she was briefed on the rules, her lawyer says. In 2016, her father Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of putting the US ""in danger"" over her use of a private email while secretary of state. Ivanka Trump and Kushner income revealed Kushner security clearance restored Ivanka accused of tweeting 'fake' Chinese proverb On Monday,the Washington Post reported,externalthat while Ms Trump's emails contained mostly logistical and personal information, some may still have been in violation of federal records rules. A Trump administration official told CBS News that Ms Trump's emails did not contain classified information, and what had occurred was basically a lack of understanding of the rules. Ms Trump stopped using her personal address for government correspondence after she was informed that she should not be doing so, the official said. However, Austin Evers, from a group called American Oversight, which submitted the freedom of information request that led to the discovery of Ms Trump's use of personal email last year, said the ""president's family is not above the law"". ""There are serious questions that Congress should immediately investigate,""Mr Evers said in a statement,external. ""Did Ivanka Trump turn over all of her emails for preservation as required by law? Was she sending classified information over a private system?"" he added. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ms Trump's counsel Abbe Lowell, said in a statement to US media: ""Ms Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family."" He added that Ms Trump did not create a private server and never transmitted any classified information. ""The account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules."" During his presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump said that Mrs Clinton's use of a private server to send official emails while in her post as secretary of state in 2009 was a scandal ""bigger than Watergate"". He repeatedly criticised her conduct, calling her actions ""illegal"" and a threat to the security of the US. This video can not be played President Trump insists Ivanka's emails are 'not like Hillary's' At the time of his campaign, Mr Trump frequently encouraged crowds at rallies to chant ""lock her up"" and threatened to imprison Mrs Clinton over the saga. He also called on Russia to help locate some 30,000 emails that Mrs Clinton had not turned over to investigators after she, or her lawyers, determined it was unnecessary as they were personal messages. Before becoming secretary of state, Mrs Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office. She did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government. She said it was for convenience. Hillary Clinton emails - what's it all about? An FBI investigation concluded that Mrs Clinton should not face charges, but said she and her aides had been ""extremely careless"" in their handling of classified information. It is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business. However, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation. If this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information. There are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts.

Three jailed over husband murder plots,"Ray Weatherall was shot in the face in one of the murder attempts A wife, her lover and his daughter have been jailed for life over a plot to kill her terminally ill husband. Ray Weatherall survived a poisoning, being shot in the face, and a swimming pool heater explosion which left him with second degree burns. His wife Hayley Weatherall, 32, also planned to kill him using sleeping tablets and insulin. She was told she will spend a minimum of 15 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to murder. Her lover Glenn Pollard, 49, and his daughter Heather, 20, of Church Lane in West Stourmouth, Canterbury, were also convicted of the same charge at Maidstone Crown Court. They were told by Judge Adele Williams they would serve at least 17 years and 15 years in prison respectively. Hayley Weatherall, Glenn Pollard and Heather Pollard were all given life sentences for their parts in the plots to kill Ray Weatherall The judge said: ""This was cruelty of a high degree. Cold, calculated and chilling cruelty. ""You conspired to murder a man because you believed he stood in your way. ""Each of you plotted and planned to kill him with determination and persistence."" In 2015, Mr Weatherall, 53, was told he had terminal brain cancer and just 18 months to live. In 2017, he was told his tumours were stable and his condition has not deteriorated. Jurors were told his wife, from Ash near Canterbury, had been having an affair with Pollard, who was her husband's best friend, and they planned to have a new life together. They concocted a series of plots on Mr Weatherall's life, including the swimming pool explosion and the poison plan. Glenn Pollard had also planned to push Mr Weatherall overboard during a fishing trip on a boat they co-owned. On 29 November last year, Mr Weatherall was shot in the face at Sandwich Marina, but survived when the bullet hit his right cheekbone. Ray Weatherall survived being shot in the face when the bullet lodged in his cheekbone Kent Police said as well as finding mobile phones, cameras and camouflaged clothing, a number of registered firearms were discovered. A spokesman said: ""The phones and electrical devices were analysed and hundreds of messages were discovered between Glenn and Heather Pollard. ""They exchanged ideas about killing methods and aired concerns about keeping their messages a secret."" He said a ""catalogue of web pages"" had been viewed in a search for ways to poison and kill their victim without being caught. PC Paul Wilson said: ""This has been a very complex case and extremely difficult for the victim, who is quite frankly lucky to be alive. ""He's had to come to terms with the fact that three people close to him who he cared about were so intent on hurting him. ""They've also put him through further distress with a long and upsetting trial that has revealed all the despicable actions of these three individuals.""

Deadly blast hits Kabul clerics' meeting,"This is one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent months A suicide bomb attack on a gathering of religious scholars in the Afghan capital, Kabul, has killed at least 50 people. At least 83 people were also wounded as the clerics met at the Uranus wedding hall, a large banqueting complex near the airport, to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. It is one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul in recent months. No-one has yet claimed it was behind the blast. So-called Islamic State and the Taliban have carried out a string of attacks in recent years. But the Taliban has denied involvement and condemned the attack. Some 1,000 people were said to be in the complex at the time of the explosion. Basir Mujahid, a spokesman for Kabul police, said that ""Islamic scholars and their followers had gathered to recite verses from the holy Koran to observe the Eid Milad-un-Nabi festival"". The suicide bomber gained entry and headed for the centre of the gathering, where he detonated his explosives. Religious studies lecturer Mohammad Hanif said there was a deafening explosion and ""everyone in the halls was screaming for help"". Images from the scene showed ripped and blood-stained clothes, broken glass and overturned furniture. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as an ""unforgivable crime"" and declared Wednesday a day of national mourning. The Islamic State in Afghanistan group, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan, has claimed responsibility for most of the recent deadly attacks of this kind. It said it was behind two attacks in Kabul in Augustthat killed dozens of people. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Dozens of people were also killed across the countryas voters cast ballots in the nation's parliamentary elections in October. The Taliban have also continued attacks, although many of them target security forces. Who are the Taliban? There are some with the Taliban. This month,Taliban militants for the first time attended an international meeting, hosted by Russia, to discuss ending the decades-long conflict. The regularity of attacks continues to stretch security forces The US special envoy for Afghanistan has also been meeting Taliban officials in Qatar, but no agreement has so far been reached. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. The Islamic State group is another matter. Opposed by the Taliban and considered a major threat by Western powers, the Sunni militants aim to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war with Shias, who they consider apostates. The violence is not easing. Civilian deaths and injuries have hit record highs. Casualty figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009.

Judge halts Trump's asylum ban,"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan A US federal judge has blocked an order issued by President Trump to deny the possibility of asylum to migrants crossing the southern border illegally. US District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco issued the temporary restraining order after hearing arguments by civil rights groups. Mr Trump signed the order earlier this month as thousands of migrants made their way towards the US border. He cited national interest concerns but was opposed by civil rights groups. What is the migrant caravan? A river of people: The caravan in pictures Fake news follows migrant caravan Migrants from across Central America have been travelling north for weeks towards the US-Mexico border. Mr Trump has described the group as a ""large caravan of people"". They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. In the run-up to the US mid-term elections, President Trump said many of the migrants were criminals, called the caravan an invasion, and ordered troops to the border. He also repeatedly suggested it was politically motivated. About 3,000 members of the caravan have so far arrived in Tijuana Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman and Justice Department spokesman Steven Stafford called the asylum system ""broken"" in a joint statement, noting their departments will continue ""to defend"" the policy. They said the current system is ""being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year"", and supported Mr Trump's actions as ""legitimate and well-reasoned"". ""It is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled."" Judge Tigar, in his ruling, said current legislation made it clear that any foreigner arriving in the US ""whether or not at a designated port of arrival"" could apply for asylum. He said Mr Trump's proclamation on 9 November was an ""extreme departure"" from prior practice. ""Whatever the scope of the president's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,"" Judge Tigar added. He was responding in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Center for Constitutional Rights. They argued that Mr Trump's ruling was illegal. The judge's restraining order comes into immediate effect and remains in place until a court hearing in December to decide on the case. The proclamation on 9 November says that anyone who wants to claim asylum in the US has to come in through official points of entry - and their cases will not be heard if they enter illegally. The ban was to last 90 days or until the US reached an agreement with Mexico to turn back asylum-seekers. Under US law, there is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants if they say they fear violence in their home countries - regardless of how they have entered the country. But the Trump administration invoked the same executive power he used to justify histravel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations last year. It said the president had the power to ""suspend the entry of all aliens"" and to impose ""any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate on them"" if they were judged to be ""detrimental"" to US interests under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A statement at the time,externalsaid: ""We are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility."" There has been no response yet to the San Francisco ruling. The US website Politico reports that 5,800 troops sent to bolster defences on the border will be home for Christmas. It quotes Army Lt Gen Jeffrey Buchanan as saying they have an ""end date"" of 15 December. The decision to send troops came at the height of President Trump's dire warnings about the caravan during campaigning for the mid-term elections - and he was accused of deploying active troops for political purposes. About 3,000 members of the caravan have so far arrived in Tijuana, the Mexican city bordering the US. The city's authorities expect numbers to reach 10,000 in coming weeks. The US temporarily closed the San Ysidro border point, its busiest crossing with Mexico, on Monday to install new movable wire-topped barriers. Claiming asylum is a long and difficult process, and people need to prove they are fleeing, or fear prosecution or torture in their country. Economic migrants do not qualify for asylum. Most of them go through a process called ""credible fear"", in which an asylum officer examines their case. If the fear is determined to be credible, the individuals are referred to immigration courts. In negative cases, they are ordered to be removed. Between October 2016 and September 2017, officials found60,566 people to have credible fear,externalamong 79,710 cases, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Many of them remain detained during the process. After that, it can take years until a decision is reached.In March, the USCIS had 318,624 pending cases,external. Some 20,455 people were given asylum in 2016,,externalaccording to the Department of Homeland Security.

Anne - best known for her role on The Chase as The Governess - revealed she didn't get diagnosed until she was 45 in 2003. Eleven-year-old Joseph is one of the people who's been inspired by Anne. ""Watching you makes me see that other people can have autism too and maybe I can have a cool job like you when I am older,"" he wrote in letter posted to Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

""I've always been kind of a bit embarrassed about having Asperger's and it's quite a private thing for myself so I wasn't going to go up to all the girls that I was trying to chat to and be like 'oh by the way, I have Asperger's'. ""I'm alright with maintaining friendships - I just get a lot of social anxiety, I can come across as quite bubbly but a lot of the time I just prefer being by myself instead of around people."" ""A lot of people don't want to say they have it because a lot of people aren't very educated on it so seeing someone like Anne saying it does a lot for the cause"". Viewers can expect to see Anne in the thick of the action again tonight as she takes on the latest bushtucker trial. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

How to check if Black Friday is cheaper,"It's time for that seasonal debate once again: Are so-called Black Friday bargains all they are cracked up to be? Research from the consumer group Which? suggests that most products are actually cheaper at other times of year. But the website Trusted Reviews said that Black Friday can indeed be the best time to buy many products, particularly tech items. As a result it is advising consumers to download their own price-trackers. Such trackers can show the history of prices charged, and whether they have been hiked shortly before the promotional period, to make any reduction look larger. Black Friday 2017: Online the winner Black Friday 2017: Deals not all they seem Which? tracked the prices of 94 popular products for six months before and after Black Friday last year. It said that the ""overwhelming majority"" - some 87% of those goods - were cheaper at other times of year. Its analysis covered retailers including Currys PC World, Amazon, John Lewis and Argos. Most goods came down in price in the six months after Black Friday 2017. For example: An LG 60 inch TV was advertised at Â£799 by Amazon on Black Friday. By the end of December it was Â£150 cheaper A Sony Cybershot camera was on sale at Â£189 at Currys PC World on Black Friday.  Later it was Â£10 cheaper A Fitbit Alta activity tracker was advertised by John Lewis at Â£99.99 on Black Friday. By March this had been reduced to Â£39.99 Trusted Reviews said it had found many items which had their lowest price on Black Friday 2017. These included: The Dyson V6 animal wireless vacuum cleaner. It cost Â£179.99 on Black Friday 2017, its lowest ever price and a 45% reduction Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones. They cost Â£159 last Black Friday, a 32% price reduction, and the lowest price until March 2018. ""While amazing deals are available before Black Friday, not every deal is always as good as it seems,"" said Nick Merritt, editor in chief of Trusted Reviews. ""That's why it's so important people find a trusted source of impartial information before taking the plunge. Doing so could save you hundreds of pounds."" One way of establishing whether you are getting a bargain or not is to download a price-tracker. This will give you a full history of how much has been charged for any particular item in the past.

Stress 'damages many people's sex life',"The stress of modern living is taking a toll on people's sex lives, a psychosexual therapist has said. ABBC Radio 5 Liveonline survey questioned 2,066 UK adults about their attitudes to sex and relationships. Stress was rated as a problem in the bedroom by more people than any other factor (45%). Relate therapist Ellen Brady said: ""We're seeing an awful lot of clients with anxiety issues - anxiety and sex just doesn't sit together at all."" Other factors highlighted by respondents as having a negative impact on sex included physical health problems, mental health issues, and having children. ComRes interviewed 2,066 British adults online between 7/8 November 2018. The data were weighted to be representative of all British adults by age, gender, region and social grade. Only 10% of respondents highlighted social media as a problem. However, Ms Brady said it probably had a bigger impact than most realised. ""There's not the basic connection happening in couples, they're not even making eye contact or talking to each other, so it's no wonder when they get to bed that sex is difficult."" Overall, half of those questioned said they were satisfied with their sex lives (50% of men and 53% of women). However, 38% of men and a quarter of women said they were not satisfied with their sex lives. The survey suggested 58% of people are generally confident about their sexual performance. The survey suggested men and women take a different view on cheating. Three-quarters of women said they considered a partner paying for an online experience (such as cyber sex) and kissing someone other than their partner to be cheating. But only half of men said the same. Nine in 10 UK adults (91%) said that having sex with someone other than their partner was cheating, but only two in five (40%) said browsing on a dating app was being unfaithful. So how can you improve your sex life? Ms Brady from Relate suggests putting a temporary ban on sex, and starting again: ""Ban sex, because whatever you've been doing sexually it's gone wrong, so you want to wipe it out and start again, and just reconnect emotionally and in terms of intimacy."" ""There's a big gender divide on that one, because women very often want to buy into emotional intimacy and kisses and cuddles and quite often men don't see that as a priority, they see sex as the priority. ""However in my experience it doesn't take very long for men to actually realise that that's what they want too... and of course it leads them on to sex anyway because that creates the right conditions for sex to happen."" BBC Radio 5 Live is hosting aSex Takeover, a day of programming focused on our sexual behaviour, relationships and attitudes, on 20 November 2018.

"Three hurt at nuclear power plantThe EDF employees are taken to hospital after an ""accidental steam release"" at the Lancashire plant.Lancashire","The injured people are employees of power company EDF, which owns the plant in Heysham Three people have been injured in a serious incident at a nuclear power plant in Lancashire. Power company EDF, which owns Heysham 1 power station, said the employees were taken to hospital following an ""accidental steam release"". The BBC understands one person suffered burns, one a broken hip and the other a broken back. EDF said Monday night's incident was not related to the nuclear process and there was no danger to public safety. The casualties were said to be conscious and speaking when they were taken to hospital. Five fire crews attended the incident at 22:40 GMT and remained at the site for more than two hours as a precaution. A spokeswoman for EDF said a ""full investigation"" would now be carried out to determine the cause. ""It goes without saying that everyone's thoughts are with our three colleagues who have been injured,"" she said. ""We will be doing everything we can to support them and their families while they recover. ""There was no risk to the public during the incident which is now under control.

Boots travel insurer faces investigationA firm called Travel Insurance Facilities is being accused of denying proper care to policyholders.Business,"A firm that claims to be one of the biggest travel insurance providers in the UK is facing two investigations into its conduct. Travel Insurance Facilities (TIF) - which sells through the High Street chain Boots - is being accused of failing to provide proper care to policyholders. According to an investigation in The Times newspaper,external, some patients were left stranded abroad. However, TIF denies any misconduct. A spokesperson for the company said the allegations were ""extremely damaging, and not in the public interest"". TIF said it had taken steps to begin legal proceedings against the newspaper. The General Medical Council (GMC) is investigating two doctors who work for the firm. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is also examining allegations against the company, after it was handed a 40,000 word dossier of complaints. Those complaints contain claims that TIF habitually tried to delay or avoid making payouts. Nicholas Kingsbury, whose father died of sepsis in Ethiopia, claimed that TIF refused to evacuate him. ""My father bought Boots cover, but was left to die in a hospital that didn't even have a defibrillator,"" he told the Times. ""Every McDonald's in Britain has one."" He said that TIF had decided that what his father needed was ""peace and quiet"". The Times also reported a case of a 72 year-old man called Martin Blake, who paid Â£22,000 to fly home from Spain after suffering from a heart attack. According to the Times, TIF had refused to evacuate him. He died in hospital in Wrexham a few days after his return. Jacqui Skeel, from the Isle of Wight, told the BBC how she battled with TIF following a ski-ing accident in Bulgaria earlier this year. After fracturing a pubic bone, she was taken to a local hospital which had no running hot water, and poor sanitation. She said she phoned the company over 50 times to try and get transferred, but it was six days before she was taken to better facilities. ""They never responded to our calls,"" she said. ""I was left in there, in horrible conditions. At times I felt like I was in prison."" She has now filed a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman about the way she was treated. TIF also offers skiing insurance In a statement released to the BBC, a spokesperson for TIF said,  ""When people fall ill abroad, naturally their first instinct is to want to come home. However this may not be best for them in medical terms to achieve the most optimal recovery. Our focus is on the best clinical outcome based on expert advice, clinical fact, aviation medicine and our experience transporting unwell holidaymakers across the globe."" The company said it strongly refuted any suggestion that financial considerations influenced its decisions. TIF was founded in 1996 in Kent, and trades under brands including Alpha Travel Insurance, Get Going, Holidaysafe and Ski Club Travel Insurance. However, it is not a member of the Association of British Insurers (ABI). ""Travel insurers will act as quickly as possible to arrange and pay for the right treatment at the right medical facility and, if needed, arrange and pay for any emergency repatriation back to the UK,"" said a spokesperson for the ABI. ""Last year ABI members supported 159,000 travellers requiring medical treatment overseas, paying out Â£200m to cover medical bills.""

Police 'could let violent suspects go',"This video can not be played Footage of the attack on officers was widely shared Violent suspects could be released by police if officers do not get ""backed up"" by members of the public, a federation leader has warned. Ken Marsh spoke out after a video of officers being attacked was shared widely on social media. Several cars can be seen driving past the encounter without stopping. Met Police Federation chairman Mr Marsh said: ""We don't come to work to get assaulted, and if we're not going to be backed up...then what is the point?"" However, Mr Marsh added this did not mean he was asking members of the public ""to suddenly jump in to assist police officers, because we are highly trained in what we do"". Ken Marsh said police officers ""don't come to work to get assaulted"" The video, taken in Merton, south London, on Saturday, shows a man aim a flying kick at a female officer, who is left clutching her head just yards away from a passing bus. Another male officer is dragged across the road as he tries to stop a second suspect from running away. The male officer suffered cuts and the female officer was left with head injuries. Two other suspects are wanted by police. A 20-year-old man has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm and assaulting an officer. A member of the public wearing a motorcycle helmet helped the male officer, but several cars went past without stopping. Talking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Marsh said: ""If the public now think it's OK to stand and film and mock my colleagues...then we are in very dangerous grounds. ""What I'm trying to get across is the simple fact that society has changed so much lately that it seems to be OK [to be] more interested in mocking us and filming us."" He added: ""We're going to come to a point where we're going to start pushing messages out to our colleagues: 'Risk-assess it dynamically and, if you think you can't detain a person, just let them go'."" The Met Police said the public should only intervene if they can safely do so A former Met officer, who left the force in 2014, said officers were attacked on a daily basis. Mark - not his real name - told BBC 5 Live Breakfast: ""I knew officers that were stabbed, punched, kicked, spat at [or] scratched so that they bled as a relatively regular occurrence."" ""I think a lot of it goes massively unreported,"" he added. Assaulting an on-duty police officer is an individual offence which can result in up to six months in custody. In 2017-18, there were 26,295 assaults on police officers in England and Wales. The Home Office comes to this figure by combining cases of assault with and without injury. The overall number of police officers is 122,000. There has been a general upward trend since the year ending March 2015, about the same time violent and knife crime began increasing after years of decline. Statistics on assaults on police with injury were only added to crime statistics this year, but those without injury go back to the early 2000s when the numbers were regularly about 20,000 a year. Assistant commissioner Steve House of the Met Police said: ""Whilst officers should never expect to be attacked as part of their job, a core part of officer safety training is ensuring they know how to respond to volatile situations. ""This training is substantial and delivered in accordance with national guidelines and we regularly review it to make sure it is fit for purpose. ""Officers are also issued with personal protective equipment to help protect them and the public. ""I am mindful that members of the public do not have access to such items and while any officer would be grateful for the public to assist them with a difficult arrest, they should only intervene if they can safely do so.""

Deadly hospital shooting in Chicago,"This video can not be played Eyewitness at the cancer centre: ""I was in the gunfire and had to duck down"" A doctor, a newly graduated pharmacist and a police officer were killed after a gunman opened fire at a hospital in Chicago, police say. The gunman was seen arguing with the doctor, Tamara O'Neal, who he had been in a relationship with, before shooting her and turning his gun on others. The shooter, named as Juan Lopez, 32, also died but it is not clear if he was killed by police or took his own life. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the attack ""tears at the soul of our city"". America's gun culture in 10 charts Four dates that explain US gun debate ""It is the face and a consequence of evil,"" he said, adding that the three victims were ""all going about their day, all doing what they loved"". The shootings began with a row in the Mercy Hospital car park between the gunman and Dr O'Neal at about 15:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Monday. When a friend of the doctor's tried to intervene ""the offender lifted up his shirt and displayed a handgun"", Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. This video can not be played Police officers line streets in Chicago to honour their colleague As the friend ran for help, gunfire broke out, witnesses said. One witness, James Gray, told reporters he saw Dr O'Neal fall to the ground and then the gunman ""stood over her and shot her three more times"". When police arrived, the gunman then moved into the hospital, shooting at random and killing pharmacist Dayna Less who was getting off an escalator at the time. In an exchange of fire with the gunman, police officer Samuel Jimenez was killed. A second police officer avoided injury after a bullet fired in his direction became lodged in his gun in his holster. Coins stop bullet to save soldier's life Hospital patients scrambled to find cover under desks, police and Swat teams moved through the hospital in search of the gunman, and officers locked down hospital wings, including the nursery. Hector Avitia, who was in the hospital waiting room with his wife,told the Chicago Tribune,externalthat he tried to get people away from windows as the bullets started flying. ""I've heard shootings,"" he said. ""I've known people that have died in the neighbourhood like that. But something like that? No."" ""He was just shooting like a maniac,"" he continued. ""And he obviously knows how to shoot because he was holding the gun with both hands."" Dr O'Neal was an emergency physician at Mercy Hospital on Chicago's South Side. Dr Patrick Connor, director of the hospital's emergency department, said she had been ""dedicated to caring for her community - a wonderful individual"". Allow Twitter content?

Cabinet meets amid Brexit pressure on PM,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned fellow Tory MPs that if they don't ditch Theresa May now she will lead them into the next election, scheduled for 2022. Few Tories thought this was a ""good idea"", the Brexiteer MP suggested. Mr Rees-Mogg wants to oust the PM over her EU withdrawal agreement but has so far failed to get enough colleagues to back his call for a no confidence vote. Meanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to the Finance Bill after the DUP withdrew its backing. Labour said the government was ""falling apart in front of us"" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the bill to pass the Budget. They were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal What to look for in Brexit declaration Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment Mr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote. ""What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,"" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference. ""We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible."" He said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement. But he added: ""I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election. Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months.

The hospitals that 'never treat patients on time',"Nearly one in five local hospital services are consistently failing to hit any of their key waiting-time targets, BBC analysis shows. Twenty-nine hospital trusts and boards out of 157 have not hit a single target for a whole year. Northern Ireland is struggling the most - all five trusts have failed their key targets for A&E, cancer and routine operations every time in 2017-18. NHS leaders said the NHS was facing a very difficult winter.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the NHS was going into the coming months ""on the back foot"". She said research by the RCN showed hospitals were facing a shortage of both beds and staff - with images of ""patients waiting on trolleys in corridors"" becoming all too common. The health departments in each nation have said they are committed to improving waiting times. In Scotland and Wales, specific programmes have been launched to speed up progress. Northern Ireland's Health and Social Care Board conceded ""the waiting times experienced by many patients continue to be unacceptable"". The Department of Health and Social Care in England praised ""hard-working staff"" and said the extra money being provided to the health service in the coming years would put it on a ""sustainable footing"". Carol Johns has been battling to get her mother, Maria King, treatment since the spring. Ms King, 84, has been experiencing painful and swollen feet, which has left her struggling to walk and has disturbed her sleep. Her daughter said she had experienced delay after delay in trying to get scans and appointments with doctors. One appointment had to be cancelled because the hospital said it did not have enough doctors. She has even tried to get treatment at other hospitals further away from her home in the Midlands and paid for a scan to be done privately. But her mother is still waiting. ""I am very frustrated. My mother has not got the quality of life she did. She is suffering."" It depends on where you live in the UK. In each UK nation, patients are meant to be seen within four hours of arrival at A&E - and by seen, the NHS means either admitted into hospital for further treatment or treated and discharged. For cancer, each nation expects patients to start their treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral, although there are differences in the way each nation measures that. The biggest variation in the way performance is judged is seen in the waiting times for non-emergency treatments, such as knee and hip replacements. In England and Scotland, patients are meant to be seen within 18 weeks, while in Wales it is 26 weeks. Northern Ireland has a different system in that it only measures part of the patient's wait - once they are under the care of a hospital doctor rather than when they are referred by a GP. It means their wait for tests and scans is not counted in the 13-week wait target. Another way of looking at performance is to judge it on a nation-level rather than by local hospital service. If you do that performance has sunk to its worst level in recent times. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have failed to hit any of the three targets for more than a year. It is the first time this has happened across the UK since targets started to be introduced more than a decade ago. The last time any target was met on a national level was in August 2017 in Scotland. In Wales, none of its three key targets has been hit for at least five years. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents managers, said it was clear the system was facing ""significant strain"". In England, 16 hospital trusts out of 131 missed all their monthly targets. They were: Bradford Teaching Hospitals Taunton and Somerset Guy's and St Thomas' Northern Lincolnshire & Goole Plymouth Hospitals The Royal Wolverhampton Mid Essex Hospital Services Leeds Teaching Hospitals University College London Hospitals East Kent Hospitals Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals United Lincolnshire Hospitals Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells East and North Hertfordshire Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals In Northern Ireland, all five trusts have failed to hit a single target in the past 12 months. They were: Belfast South Eastern Northern Southern Western In Scotland, three out of 14 health boards missed all their targets. They were: Forth Valley Greater Glasgow and Clyde Lothian In Wales, five out of seven health boards missed all their targets. They were: Cardiff and Vale Cwm Taf Aneurin Bevan Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Betsi Cadwaladr A combination of rising demand and the need to prioritise emergency patients has been blamed by the NHS trusts which are struggling the most. Plymouth Hospitals chief operating officer Kevin Baber said staff were working hard, but were struggling with the ""ever increasing demand"". He said headway was being made in some areas. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells said it had had to prioritise emergency patients over the past year - and that had meant others were having to wait longer. And Gwen Nuttall, from the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said meeting targets ""will always be a challenge"" in the current climate. ""Our hospitals, along with others regionally and nationally, are incredibly busy,"" she added.

The importance of being unionist?,"Theresa May has said she would never support a Brexit deal that would damage the integrity of the union From the very moment she entered Number 10, Theresa May said the word ""unionist"" was important to her. The full title of her party is, after all, the Conservative and Unionist Party. The prime minister's talk of protecting the ""precious bond"" between the UK's four nations pleased unionist parties in Northern Ireland. But that was July 2016 - Brexit twists since then have taken the debate around unionist credentials to new heights. Irish have 'poked unionists in the eye' Is the backstop an opportunity or a threat? DUP should 'consider backing Brexit deal' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The deal the UK government has negotiated with the EU sparked a backlash, amid claims it could damage the integrity of the union. It has all come down tothe proposal on the Irish border backstop, which aims to ensure frictionless trade and will come into effect if another solution can't be found as part of a wider trade deal. The draft withdrawal agreement says Northern Ireland alone would align with the EU single market in some areas, meaning new regulatory barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - the so-called Irish Sea border. That's what has frustrated Northern Ireland's biggest unionist party - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - so much. DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds say people in NI would be 'appalled' by the prime minister's draft deal It believes any differences could damage Northern Ireland's economy and democracy. In February,Mrs May rejected an earlier EU proposalfor Northern Ireland, and said ""no prime minister could sign up"" to something which threatened the UK's constitutional integrity. The DUP says the prime minister has now broken that promise she made. And its words carry weight at Westminster, as Mrs Mayrelies on the party's 10 MPs in a confidence-and-supply pact, in order to have a parliamentary majority. The jovial photo opportunity of 26 June 2017 - the day that deal was announced, seems a far cry from the events of the past week. It culminated in the DUP's decision to abstain on minor amendments to budget votes in the Commons on Monday night- not crucial, but an absolute reminder to the government of what the DUP can do, and how important its numbers are. The DUP and Conservative Party signed a deal worth Â£1bn, to give Theresa May a working majority in the Commons Despite the DUP's protests that it will vote against the draft agreement when it comes to the Commons, the government is defending its plan. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has called the deal ""good for the union"", urging politicians to get behind it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But some within the Tory party aren't buying that. And as reaction to the draft agreement swirled around last week, several politicians were quick out of the gates to put their commitment to unionism on record. It was notable that the two members of the cabinet who quit - Dominic Raab and Esther McVey -both specifically referenced the unionin their resignation statements. Former Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said the regulatory regime planned for NI was a ""very real threat"" to the integrity of the UK, while ex-Work and Pensions Secretary Ms McVey said ""as a unionist"", she couldn't back anything that risked breaking it up. Esther McVey's resignation statement made reference how she, as a unionist, could not back the prime minister's plan They received messages on social media from DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who thanked them for ""standing up for the union"". But has the Brexit debate made it politically convenient for some to lay claim to being a unionist? Journalist and political commentator, Alex Kane, thinks there might be some truth to that theory. ""For all the times we've been told there are closet unionists or very public unionists in the Conservative ranks, when push comes to shove, when they have to make a key decision between the national interest versus the individual interest of a unionist party in Northern Ireland, I can't think one of one occasion when they didn't back the national interest,"" he toldBBC Radio Ulster's Sunday News programme. But it's not just cabinet ministers who have spoken of their concerns about the future of the union. Turn to Scotland, and some Tory MPs there are insistent on making sure Northern Ireland doesn't get special treatment. Their fear is that any new controls which separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK could fuel the case for Scottish independence - another potential fracture in the union.

The MP Ross Thomson has been one of the most vocal,calling on Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell to follow cabinet colleagues and quitin protest at the government's plan. He said ""no unionist"" could sign up to it - but Mr Mundell said he wouldn't ""take lectures from latter-day unionists who are now using it as merely a hook on which to hang their resignations"". Mr Mundell has now publicly backed the draft deal,despite warning before its publicationagainst any different arrangements for Northern Ireland. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier (left) met Ulster Unionist Party representatives in Brussels earlier this year to discuss their concerns about Brexit To be clear, the DUP is not the only unionist party in Northern Ireland opposed to the draft agreement. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which has one representative in the European Parliament, is also worried about the possibility of a border down the Irish Sea. But rather than focusing its ire on Theresa May, the UUP accused the DUP of overstating its influence at Westminster. And on Monday, former UUP leader Lord Trimble was amonga group of Brexiteers spotted in Downing Street,external, putting forward an alternative to the backstop plan. Northern Ireland's other voice in London, independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Sylvia Hermon, has saidshe's not happy with everything in the deal but there is no time for anything else. ""I would be very surprised if I were ever to find myself on the same page as Sammy Wilson and Jacob Rees-Mogg,"" she added. The DUP, however, contends that it has friends in all corners of the Commons when it comes to Brexit. Its chief whip, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has saidTheresa May is the ""lonely"" one right now. The party has warned that parliament has a choice:Vote against the deal and protect the UK, or back it and cause the union to break up. But even if it means upsetting her unionist allies, the prime minister seems determined to push her plan through, in order to avoid a no-deal scenario. In a matter of weeks, we'll see which argument MPs have been persuaded by. Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal?

Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal,"The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713 Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr SÃ¡nchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr SÃ¡nchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. This video can not be played Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He saidthe EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines,external, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. What to look for in Brexit declaration? Spain hopeful of Gibraltar deal by summer Gibraltar angered by Spain's EU 'veto' Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Pictures of life on the Rock Read more about Gibraltar here A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control. There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed? The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators. A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU. Gibraltar has a population of 33,600,externaland 7.7 million visitors a year Financial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there It has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates Although there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25% Gibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita,externalthan either the UK or Spain.

How to check if Black Friday is cheaperPrice-trackers can show the history of what on-line retailers have been chargingBusinessComments,"It's time for that seasonal debate once again: Are so-called Black Friday bargains all they are cracked up to be? Research from the consumer group Which? suggests that most products are actually cheaper at other times of year. But the website Trusted Reviews said that Black Friday can indeed be the best time to buy many products, particularly tech items. As a result it is advising consumers to download their own price-trackers. Such trackers can show the history of prices charged, and whether they have been hiked shortly before the promotional period, to make any reduction look larger. Black Friday 2017: Online the winner Black Friday 2017: Deals not all they seem Which? tracked the prices of 94 popular products for six months before and after Black Friday last year. It said that the ""overwhelming majority"" - some 87% of those goods - were cheaper at other times of year. Its analysis covered retailers including Currys PC World, Amazon, John Lewis and Argos. Most goods came down in price in the six months after Black Friday 2017. For example: An LG 60 inch TV was advertised at Â£799 by Amazon on Black Friday. By the end of December it was Â£150 cheaper A Sony Cybershot camera was on sale at Â£189 at Currys PC World on Black Friday.  Later it was Â£10 cheaper A Fitbit Alta activity tracker was advertised by John Lewis at Â£99.99 on Black Friday. By March this had been reduced to Â£39.99 Trusted Reviews said it had found many items which had their lowest price on Black Friday 2017. These included: The Dyson V6 animal wireless vacuum cleaner. It cost Â£179.99 on Black Friday 2017, its lowest ever price and a 45% reduction Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones. They cost Â£159 last Black Friday, a 32% price reduction, and the lowest price until March 2018. ""While amazing deals are available before Black Friday, not every deal is always as good as it seems,"" said Nick Merritt, editor in chief of Trusted Reviews. ""That's why it's so important people find a trusted source of impartial information before taking the plunge. Doing so could save you hundreds of pounds."" One way of establishing whether you are getting a bargain or not is to download a price-tracker. This will give you a full history of how much has been charged for any particular item in the past.

Father sues McDonald's over Happy Meals,"A Quebec father has launched a class-action lawsuit against McDonald's, alleging the company's Happy Meals break strict provincial laws against advertising to children. Since its debut in 1979, the Happy Meal has been a staple of McDonald's menu and a go-to meal option on family road trips. But some Canadian parents are decidedly unhappy about the hold the fast-food empire has over their children's stomachs. Antonio Bramante is the lead plaintiff in a newly certified lawsuit that alleges McDonald's is unlawfully aiming advertising at children under 13 years of age. That would violate the province's strict youth consumer protection laws. Mr Bramante, a father of three young children, says he eats at McDonald's about once every two weeks on the urging of his children, according to the court documents. He estimates he has spent hundreds of dollars on Happy Meals, which are children's meals that come with toys. The Quebec father says the toys are often linked to popular film releases and his children often want to return to the restaurant so they can complete their set of toys. He also claims the restaurant is directly targeting children by displaying the Happy Meals toys at their eye level. Ice resurfacers are among the toys available in Canada ""In today's world, parents have to choose their battles. And what's the easiest thing to give into? It's to feed your children,"" says Joey Zukran, the Montreal-based lawyer who filed the class action on Mr Bramante's behalf. Quebec prohibits marketing to children under the age of 13, making it one of a handful of jurisdictions in the world to essentially ban all advertising geared towards children. The province has also had a law since 1980 that restricts marketing unhealthy food to children. 'Anti-vaxxers' in US chickenpox outbreak Outcry over teen's underwear in rape trial WATCH: The town where 'police don't come out' ""McDonald's has a legal obligation to respect that law and they're not, in Quebec at least,"" Mr Zukran told the BBC. There are three exceptions, with conditions, to Quebec's advertising law: for ads in children's magazines, for promoting a children's entertainment event, and for advertising via store windows, displays, containers, packaging and labels. Mr Zukran says he is ready to argue McDonald's is not covered by any of these exceptions. A Quebec court judge issued a ruling certifying the lawsuit,externallast week. Anyone who purchased a McDonald's Happy Meal in Quebec from November 2013, even if they are not Canadian residents, can request to be part of the class action, Mr Zukran says. Children at McDonald's It seeks both compensatory and punitive damages and an order to prevent McDonald's from continuing the alleged practice. McDonald's has about 300 restaurants in the Canadian province. In a statement, McDonald's Canada told the BBC it has received the ruling certifying the lawsuit and plans to examine it carefully. ""We are aware of our obligations under Quebec's advertising laws and reiterate that we do not believe this class action has merit,"" it said. McDonald's is one of the world's biggest distributors of toys in the world, driven in large part by Happy Meals sales. McDonald's denies Minions toy given out in Happy Meals are swearing KFC and Kellogg's broke junk food ad rules Online children's junk food ads banned This is not the first time the Happy Meals toys have been the target of a lawsuit. In 2015, the US Children's Advertising Review Unit, a self-regulatory body, advised the company to focus its advertising on food and not its Happy Meal toys. The company agreed to take the advice into consideration for future advertisements. In 2010, the restaurant chain faced a charge that its advertising violated California consumer protection laws. The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group based in the US, was eventually dismissed. The claim that the company exploits children in advertising also made its way into the longest court case in UK history. The ""McLibel"" case pitted the fast-food empire against two Greenpeace activists who had distributed leaflets entitled ""What's wrong with McDonalds - everything they don't want you to know"" It is estimated McDonald's spent millions in legal fees suing the couple for libel. The couple defended themselves after being denied legal aid. In 1997, a judge ruled in favour of McDonald's, but found the leaflet's claim that the company exploited children in advertising to be true. First ads banned under new junk food rules McDonald's workers strike over harassment Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads McDonald's to ditch plastic straws McDonald's gives mum-to-be chemical latte McDonald's in recycled packaging pledge Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Spain threatens to vote against Brexit dealPrime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez says Spain will reject the draft deal without clarification on Gibraltar.Europe,"The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713 Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr SÃ¡nchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr SÃ¡nchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. This video can not be played Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He saidthe EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines,external, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. What to look for in Brexit declaration? Spain hopeful of Gibraltar deal by summer Gibraltar angered by Spain's EU 'veto' Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Pictures of life on the Rock Read more about Gibraltar here A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control. There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed? The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators. A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU. Gibraltar has a population of 33,600,externaland 7.7 million visitors a year Financial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there It has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates Although there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25% Gibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita,externalthan either the UK or Spain.

"Migrant workers send home ÃÂ£8bn to familiesThe UN says money sent home pays for school, but too much is taken in transfer charges.Family & EducationComments","Migrant workers in the English grape harvest: Many send money home to support their families' education Migrant workers in the UK, many in low-paid jobs, are sending Â£8bn a year to support families in their home countries, says a report from the United Nations' education agency. This is often used to help relations in poorer countries to stay in school. But Unesco warns too much of this ""hard-earned money"" is being taken in transfer charges by finance companies. It says that people wiring money should only have to pay 3% in charges - but the global average is 7%. The Association of UK Payment Institutions says prices would be lower if regulators allowed more companies to compete in this market. The remittances sent home by migrants can be a lifeline for families in poorer countries - sent back by people working in wealthier parts of the world. Such cash has become an informal and often unseen subsidy for educating families in less affluent countries. The UK is in the top 10 countries for overseas workers sending back money - with billions of pounds sent to the three biggest recipients - Nigeria, India and Pakistan. Hundreds of millions are sent to Poland, China, Kenya, Philippines, Bangladesh and Ghana each year. From the US, remittances have been particularly important to countries in Central America and South America. But Unesco, in its annual report on education, says too much is being taken in fees by finance firms. ""Companies should not be allowed to continue skimming off so much of the money that migrants are sending back home,"" says Manos Antoninis, director of the Global Education Monitoring report. ""Such transaction costs are highest for the poorest migrants."" Family help that's bigger than aid budgets Where remittances are a 'lifesaver' Remittances 'propping up the economy' Getting fees down to 3% across the world would save migrant families $25bn (Â£20bn) per year - which the UN's education estimates would lead to an extra $1bn being spent on education. Although the average commission is 7% - the UN says many charges can be much higher, with some costs for sending money to Africa rising about 20%. Unesco's report shows the dependency on remittances and the positive impact of the extra cash. Families sending money home to Kenya help to put children through school In 18 countries across Africa and Asia, remittances increased education spending by 35% - and in Latin America by over 50%. In India, rural families receiving remittances spent 17% more on education than neighbours who did not have such cash being sent back by relations. In the Philippines, this extra income from overseas was seen as a way of reducing child labour, allowing children to remain in education. In Ecuador, money from remittances has become important to keeping girls enrolled in school. There has been growing recognition of the scale of remittances in a globalised economy. As well as migrant workers in low-paid jobs, there are also well-qualified, professional workers who go to wealthy countries and then send money home to help with others in their family wanting to study. The Â£8bn sent back from migrant workers in the UK compares with about Â£13bn, which a House of Commons library report said was the UK government's total overseas aid. According to the Pew research group in the US, more than Â£500bn per year is sent worldwide in remittances. Such payments are a ""vital resource in the countries where migrants have come from,"" says Unesco's Mr Antoninis. ""These migrants have left everything, often following a dream. They then send their hard-earned money back home to support those they left behind, only to find they are charged extortionate fees for the service."" A spokesman for the Association of UK Payment Institutions says fees might appear ""unnecessarily high"" - but it reflected the high levels of regulation and restrictions in a market which mostly handled cash, rather than electronic transfers. He also said that even if some firms appeared to have low charges, there could be other costs added through the exchange rate. A spokeswoman for Western Union said they believed that about 30% of transfers were intended for education. She said that her firm's overall average fee for moving money was between 4% and 6% - and that reflected the cost of a service that could immediately transfer cash around the globe.

Brexit dinner date: Big Brother contestant meets Lord Winston,"This video can not be played Watch the best bits of Prof Winston and Aisleyne's date What happens when two strong-minded individuals from opposite sides of the Brexit debate sit down for dinner? To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates. Former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace is pro-Leave. Labour peer and fertility expert Prof Lord Winston believes the UK would be much better remaining in the EU. They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting. But did they get on? Who are you?I'm Aisleyne. I work on TV but my main income is as a property developer. What are your views on Brexit?We need to be able to stand alone. We need to shut the borders because we're bursting at the seams financially and we need to fix our problems at home before we fix anyone else's problems. [Being in the EU] is like having a broken leg and trying to carry another person with a broken leg to the hospital. It's just not going to work. What was your initial impression of Prof Lord Winston?I thought: ""What a dapper gentleman, looking like Super Mario."" Aisleyne and Robert met for the first time How was your date?It was a pleasure to spend time with someone that's so educated and for me to still be able to hold a decent conversation and not feel out of my depth. I'm just in awe of him and all the work he's done with embryos - I saved him in my phone as ""Lord Embryo"". What did you talk about?The fact that he said all of his learned colleagues at [the hospital where he works] were already leaving the UK. That worried me a bit because I didn't think that was happening. I don't know if he was saying it for effect but he doesn't strike me as the type of person to lie. This video can not be played ""You're getting angry with me"". Aisleyne and Robert discuss trade Any common ground?Just the fact that we both loved [hip hop artists] Tupac and Biggie - and our fascination behind reproduction. Anything you didn't enjoy?When he thought I was patronising him [when saying: ""Thank you for your service,"" after he explained his work in the NHS]. He said: ""Don't patronise me,"" but it was really just a compliment, because I'd never want to hurt anyone's feelings. Did he convince you of anything?I still believe that we can stand alone and we do need to fix our problems but he has made me think that it needs to be a little bit more tailored. Before, I thought: ""[Let's just have a] hard Brexit,"" but he has made me realise the intricacies. Did you convince him of anything?Just that I was fabulous - I think he really did stop and listen to what I had to say, which was a huge compliment. Robert tried to ring his son, a Big Brother viewer, during the date Would you see him again?Yes - he took me to the House of Lords [since the blind date]. It was just fascinating. It was really eye-opening to see how the other half work. I just think he's an absolute delight and what a pleasure to now be friends with him - he's a really great person. Describe him in three words:Genius, kind, learned. Marks out of 10 for the date:I really want to say 10. I left feeling like I wanted to know more. I left feeling like I could hold a conversation with a lord. Watch the BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. And find out what happened when broadcaster June Sarpong met ex-Stig Perry McCarthy on Wednesday's Brexit blind date. Who are you?Robert Winston, professor of science and society at Imperial College in London, where I work on reproductive medicine. What are your views on Brexit?I voted Remain. I see myself as a European. I've always felt that. Recognising what had happened to Europe, really from 1618 onwards, the time of the Thirty Years' War, it seemed to me obvious that we actually need some form of better coalition between European countries. I think one of the very real reasons for wanting to be part of the union is to have a peaceful Europe, which has been highly successful. What was remarkable in the Brexit debate was this was seldom actually recognised. This video can not be played Robert tells Aisleyne: ""Don't patronise me"" How was your date?The food was OK. The soup was good but you can't really talk and eat soup. What did you talk about?The NHS, trade, Theresa May. Any common ground?Not much. What did you disagree about?Everything - one of the things that is always a problem in arguments, and I hear it in the House of Lords in debates, is when someone says: ""I believe that so-and-so should happen'. The trouble is when you are arguing with or against belief, there is an emotional compound to it. That is a big problem when you are looking mathematically and rationally and in a dispassionate way. That's the problem with Brexit - it has polarised communities and individuals in a way I don't think anyone expected. What did you learn about your date?I learned a whole lot of things. I didn't know about her background, I didn't know who she was -  I didn't know who I was meeting. Would you see her again?We are going to meet in five years' time, we've agreed - that's a firm commitment. And I took her to the House of Lords so she can see Parliament in action.

"DUP issue Brexit warning to Theresa MayDemocratic Unionists tell the PM to ""keep her side of the bargain"" after abstaining in Commons votes.UK Politics","Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned fellow Tory MPs that if they don't ditch Theresa May now she will lead them into the next election, scheduled for 2022. Few Tories thought this was a ""good idea"", the Brexiteer MP suggested. Mr Rees-Mogg wants to oust the PM over her EU withdrawal agreement but has so far failed to get enough colleagues to back his call for a no confidence vote. Meanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to the Finance Bill after the DUP withdrew its backing. Labour said the government was ""falling apart in front of us"" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the bill to pass the Budget. They were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal What to look for in Brexit declaration Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment Mr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote. ""What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,"" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference. ""We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible."" He said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement. But he added: ""I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election. Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months. The PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and it will allow the country to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"". This video can not be played Sammy Wilson, DUP: ""The government had broken one of the fundamental agreements they had with us... we had to do something."" In other developments: Downing Street said at a meeting of the cabinet earlier, the first since a spate of Brexit resignations last week, ministers had discussed possible alternative arrangements to keep the border open, that could involve ""technological solutions"". In a sign of tension on the EU side, Spain has said it will not agree to the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without clarity over how talks on the future status of Gibraltar should be handled. Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Tory-DUP relationship 'broken over Europe' The importance of being unionist Downing Street said that,during talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the PM had emphasised that the draft Brexit terms would give Scottish businesses the ""clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters"". The SNP leader also met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier to discuss tactics ahead of the Commons vote. This video can not be played In full: Nicola Sturgeon interview with Laura Kuenssberg on Brexit Ms Sturgeon held a separate meeting with Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, who all back another EU referendum. She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she wanted to form a ""coalition of opposition"" to Mrs May's Brexit plans, and that momentum for another referendum was growing. She described her talks with Mr Corbyn as ""exploratory"" and said she did not know whether he would back a referendum. But she said they both agreed that the PM's Brexit deal is a bad one and that no-deal should not be the only alternative presented to MPs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A Labour spokesman said: ""They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May's botched Brexit deal and determination to work across Parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome.""

Sturgeon has 'constructive' Corbyn talks Work with Plaid on Brexit, Labour urged And Mrs May is coming under growing pressure from the DUP, whose 10 MPs keep her government in power. This video can not be played Theresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: ""Don't just listen to the politicians."" The DUP abstained in Monday night's Budget votes as a warning shot over what they say are her broken promises on Brexit. After the DUP indicated they would abstain again on further votes on Tuesday, ministers accepted Labour and SNP amendments in order to avoid likely defeat. These will require the government to conduct a review into the public health impact of gaming, a report into the impact of Brexit on international tax enforcement and a review into the impact of tax avoidance measures on income inequality and child poverty. Under the terms of their House of Commons deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year's general election, the DUP is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence votes. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said their refusal to do so now was ""absolutely staggering"", adding that the Conservatives were ""in office but not in power"".

DUP MPs abstain on key bill,"The confidence and supply agreement between the parties was signed in June 2017 The DUP has failed to back the government on a number of amendments to its Finance Bill. The party also supported an amendment proposed by the Labour Party. The debate on the Finance Bill is due to last throughout Monday evening,externaland into Tuesday, with the DUP expected to abstain on more amendments. TheDUP has a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party. The DUP's Brexit message to Theresa May Brexit Secretary Raab resigns PM faces grilling amid Brexit deal backlash UK(NI): Four letters that mean so much Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The Conservative government agreed a financial package with the DUP in exchange for support on certain issues. About Â£430m has come to Northern Ireland's budget under the arrangement so far. The remainder of the Â£1bn is due to come in the 2019-20 financial year, with the York Street Interchange and rural broadband among the projects earmarked for cash. This video can not be played Sammy Wilson, DUP: ""The government had broken one of the fundamental agreements they had with us... we had to do something."" In recent weeks the relationship between the two parties has been strained following criticism by the DUP of the prime minister's draft Brexit agreement. On Monday,DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson warned Theresa May to ""keep her side of the bargain"". The DUP has previously said it will review its arrangement propping up the Conservatives if the draft Brexit plan passes through Parliament.

The DUP MP Sammy Wilson, the party's Brexit spokesperson, told BBC's The World Tonight that the government has ""seriously broken"" its commitment that it made with the DUP that Northern Ireland would not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in the Brexit agreement. ""Since the government has not honoured its side of the bargain we tonight tried to spell out some of the consequences of that,"" Mr Wilson said. However the East Antrim MP denied that the confidence and supply agreement pointing out that the Monday night's votes were not intended ""to damage the government fiscally"". He said that none of the votes in which the DUP voted with the opposition had financial consequences for the government, but they had political consequences. ""The prime minister has undermined her own authority with her own party and with our party by blatantly breaking promises about what she would deliver in the Brexit deal with the European Union,"" he said. DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds have both spoken out against the draft deal Senior DUP sources told BBC News NI the DUP had taken the decision to abstain and then vote with Labour because ""we are not a happy bunch"". Another DUP source said it felt the government would respond in a ""tetchy manner, but then ho hum because we've a few who are good at that too"". The same source said the party does not believe the move breached the confidence and supply arrangement as the amendments were ""cost neutral"" - and that is now over to the government to respond. However, the text of the confidence and supply deal states that the DUP agrees to support the government on ""all motions of confidence... the budget, finance bills, money bills"". Commenting on the DUP not voting with the government Labour's Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, Jon Trickett MP, said: ""We no longer have a functioning government. With Brexit only a few months away something has got to give."" Forget for a moment the ""will they, won't they"" numbers game. Unless and until the head honcho of the Tories' backbench committee receives 48 letters there won't be a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. As far as we know tonight the total has not yet been reached. One of those who has submitted their letter told me in no uncertain terms ""where are the others?"" - frustrated that many of his colleagues seem to have promised to be part of the action, but reinforcements are yet to arrive.

'Legal high' sales go underground,"New legislation to tackle ""legal highs"" was introduced last year The sale of so-called legal highs has gone underground after a blanket ban came into force, a report says. While the ban has led to a ""considerable reduction"" in use of the drugs, street dealers are now the main source of supply. Now officially known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), they mimic the effects of other drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy. They were sold openly, mainly in specialist shops, before May 2016. Since the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) came in, they are no longer being sold in the stores, known as head shops, according tothe Home Office review,external. They said 31 outlets had closed, with a further 332 no longer stocking the drugs. Prices have gone up too and ""significantly"" fewer people are using them. But the report warns the drugs have become more potent, with new strands of them continuing to be produced. This suggests the ban has not yet brought an end to the ""game of cat and mouse"" between law enforcement agencies and those producing NPS. The review also says the ban might have led to the most vulnerable users switching back to drugs like cannabis and cocaine. One Manchester drug worker quoted in the report said: ""It was so easy before. But after PSA, in Rochdale young offenders, those in care, they found they had less access to NPS. ""People just couldn't be bothered to source it and there is a culture of 'whatever they can get their hands on easiest'."" But an NPS user in Exeter quoted in the review said: ""Now the shops aren't selling stuff, people get it from another source, like through a dealer. You can still get hold of them just as easily."" Spice stimulants are the main NPS used in prisons, according to the report Ministers had brought forward the NPS legislation after the substances were linked to dozens of deaths. It concluded that most of the aims of the act ""appear to have been achieved, with the open sale of NPS largely eliminated, a significant fall in NPS use in the general population, and a reduction in health-related harms which is likely to have been achieved through reduced usage"". But it said areas of concern had remained - or emerged - since the ban, and noted ""continued high levels of synthetic cannabinoid use among the homeless and prison populations."" The main NPS used within prison is Spice, according to the report. Under the act, offenders can face up to seven years in prison, with civil orders being issued to close down online dealers and head shops. Police recorded 492 arrests in the first six months after the act took effect. There were 1,523 seizures of NPS in 2017/18.

Migrant workers send home Â£8bn to families,"Migrant workers in the English grape harvest: Many send money home to support their families' education Migrant workers in the UK, many in low-paid jobs, are sending Â£8bn a year to support families in their home countries, says a report from the United Nations' education agency. This is often used to help relations in poorer countries to stay in school. But Unesco warns too much of this ""hard-earned money"" is being taken in transfer charges by finance companies. It says that people wiring money should only have to pay 3% in charges - but the global average is 7%. The Association of UK Payment Institutions says prices would be lower if regulators allowed more companies to compete in this market. The remittances sent home by migrants can be a lifeline for families in poorer countries - sent back by people working in wealthier parts of the world. Such cash has become an informal and often unseen subsidy for educating families in less affluent countries. The UK is in the top 10 countries for overseas workers sending back money - with billions of pounds sent to the three biggest recipients - Nigeria, India and Pakistan. Hundreds of millions are sent to Poland, China, Kenya, Philippines, Bangladesh and Ghana each year. From the US, remittances have been particularly important to countries in Central America and South America. But Unesco, in its annual report on education, says too much is being taken in fees by finance firms. ""Companies should not be allowed to continue skimming off so much of the money that migrants are sending back home,"" says Manos Antoninis, director of the Global Education Monitoring report. ""Such transaction costs are highest for the poorest migrants."" Family help that's bigger than aid budgets Where remittances are a 'lifesaver' Remittances 'propping up the economy' Getting fees down to 3% across the world would save migrant families $25bn (Â£20bn) per year - which the UN's education estimates would lead to an extra $1bn being spent on education. Although the average commission is 7% - the UN says many charges can be much higher, with some costs for sending money to Africa rising about 20%. Unesco's report shows the dependency on remittances and the positive impact of the extra cash. Families sending money home to Kenya help to put children through school In 18 countries across Africa and Asia, remittances increased education spending by 35% - and in Latin America by over 50%. In India, rural families receiving remittances spent 17% more on education than neighbours who did not have such cash being sent back by relations. In the Philippines, this extra income from overseas was seen as a way of reducing child labour, allowing children to remain in education. In Ecuador, money from remittances has become important to keeping girls enrolled in school. There has been growing recognition of the scale of remittances in a globalised economy. As well as migrant workers in low-paid jobs, there are also well-qualified, professional workers who go to wealthy countries and then send money home to help with others in their family wanting to study. The Â£8bn sent back from migrant workers in the UK compares with about Â£13bn, which a House of Commons library report said was the UK government's total overseas aid. According to the Pew research group in the US, more than Â£500bn per year is sent worldwide in remittances. Such payments are a ""vital resource in the countries where migrants have come from,"" says Unesco's Mr Antoninis. ""These migrants have left everything, often following a dream. They then send their hard-earned money back home to support those they left behind, only to find they are charged extortionate fees for the service."" A spokesman for the Association of UK Payment Institutions says fees might appear ""unnecessarily high"" - but it reflected the high levels of regulation and restrictions in a market which mostly handled cash, rather than electronic transfers. He also said that even if some firms appeared to have low charges, there could be other costs added through the exchange rate. A spokeswoman for Western Union said they believed that about 30% of transfers were intended for education. She said that her firm's overall average fee for moving money was between 4% and 6% - and that reflected the cost of a service that could immediately transfer cash around the globe.

Brexit blind dates: Prof Lord Winston and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace,"This video can not be played Watch the best bits of Prof Winston and Aisleyne's date What happens when two strong-minded individuals from opposite sides of the Brexit debate sit down for dinner? To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates. Former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace is pro-Leave. Labour peer and fertility expert Prof Lord Winston believes the UK would be much better remaining in the EU. They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting. But did they get on? Who are you?I'm Aisleyne. I work on TV but my main income is as a property developer. What are your views on Brexit?We need to be able to stand alone. We need to shut the borders because we're bursting at the seams financially and we need to fix our problems at home before we fix anyone else's problems. [Being in the EU] is like having a broken leg and trying to carry another person with a broken leg to the hospital. It's just not going to work. What was your initial impression of Prof Lord Winston?I thought: ""What a dapper gentleman, looking like Super Mario."" Aisleyne and Robert met for the first time How was your date?It was a pleasure to spend time with someone that's so educated and for me to still be able to hold a decent conversation and not feel out of my depth. I'm just in awe of him and all the work he's done with embryos - I saved him in my phone as ""Lord Embryo"". What did you talk about?The fact that he said all of his learned colleagues at [the hospital where he works] were already leaving the UK. That worried me a bit because I didn't think that was happening. I don't know if he was saying it for effect but he doesn't strike me as the type of person to lie. This video can not be played ""You're getting angry with me"". Aisleyne and Robert discuss trade Any common ground?Just the fact that we both loved [hip hop artists] Tupac and Biggie - and our fascination behind reproduction. Anything you didn't enjoy?When he thought I was patronising him [when saying: ""Thank you for your service,"" after he explained his work in the NHS]. He said: ""Don't patronise me,"" but it was really just a compliment, because I'd never want to hurt anyone's feelings. Did he convince you of anything?I still believe that we can stand alone and we do need to fix our problems but he has made me think that it needs to be a little bit more tailored. Before, I thought: ""[Let's just have a] hard Brexit,"" but he has made me realise the intricacies. Did you convince him of anything?Just that I was fabulous - I think he really did stop and listen to what I had to say, which was a huge compliment. Robert tried to ring his son, a Big Brother viewer, during the date Would you see him again?Yes - he took me to the House of Lords [since the blind date]. It was just fascinating. It was really eye-opening to see how the other half work. I just think he's an absolute delight and what a pleasure to now be friends with him - he's a really great person. Describe him in three words:Genius, kind, learned. Marks out of 10 for the date:I really want to say 10. I left feeling like I wanted to know more. I left feeling like I could hold a conversation with a lord. Watch the BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. And find out what happened when broadcaster June Sarpong met ex-Stig Perry McCarthy on Wednesday's Brexit blind date. Who are you?Robert Winston, professor of science and society at Imperial College in London, where I work on reproductive medicine. What are your views on Brexit?I voted Remain. I see myself as a European. I've always felt that. Recognising what had happened to Europe, really from 1618 onwards, the time of the Thirty Years' War, it seemed to me obvious that we actually need some form of better coalition between European countries. I think one of the very real reasons for wanting to be part of the union is to have a peaceful Europe, which has been highly successful. What was remarkable in the Brexit debate was this was seldom actually recognised. This video can not be played Robert tells Aisleyne: ""Don't patronise me"" How was your date?The food was OK. The soup was good but you can't really talk and eat soup. What did you talk about?The NHS, trade, Theresa May. Any common ground?Not much. What did you disagree about?Everything - one of the things that is always a problem in arguments, and I hear it in the House of Lords in debates, is when someone says: ""I believe that so-and-so should happen'. The trouble is when you are arguing with or against belief, there is an emotional compound to it. That is a big problem when you are looking mathematically and rationally and in a dispassionate way. That's the problem with Brexit - it has polarised communities and individuals in a way I don't think anyone expected. What did you learn about your date?I learned a whole lot of things. I didn't know about her background, I didn't know who she was -  I didn't know who I was meeting. Would you see her again?We are going to meet in five years' time, we've agreed - that's a firm commitment. And I took her to the House of Lords so she can see Parliament in action.

Nasa robot to target ancient lake crater,"Jezero Crater shows strong evidence from orbit of past water activity The American space agency (Nasa) says it will send its2020 Mars rover,externalto a location known as Jezero Crater. Nasa believes the rocks in this nearly 50km-wide bowl could conceivably hold a record of ancient life on the planet. Satellite images of Jezero point to river water having once cut through its rim and flowed via a delta system into a big lake. It is the kind of environment that might just have supported microbes some 3.5-3.9 billion years ago. This was a period when Mars was much warmer and wetter than it is today. Evidence for the past presence of a lake is obviously a draw, but Ken Farley, the Nasa project scientist on the mission, said the delta traces were also a major attraction. ""A delta is extremely good at preserving bio-signatures - any evidence of life that might have existed in the lake water, or at the interface of the sediment and the lake water, or possibly things that lived in the headwaters region that were swept in by the river and deposited in the delta,"" he told reporters. Jezero's multiple rock types, including clays and carbonates, have high potential to preserve the organic molecules that would hint at life's bygone existence. The 500m-deep crater was chosen after a four-year consultation process with Mars scientists. In a straw-poll taken at the end of the most recent site-selection workshop, it came out the clear favourite. Nasa's administration has now endorsed the choice. Jezero is sited just north of Mars' equator. It is named after a town in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In some Slavic languages the word ""jezero"" also means ""lake"". UK industry to make new 'Hotbirds' Mars robot to be sent to Oxia Planum The jeopardy of landing on Mars The Mars 2020 rover is based on the design of the Curiosity robot Another of the robot's key objectives will be to select and ""cache"" in small canisters some rock samples that could, at a later date, be collected and returned to Earth labs for analysis. Nasa is working with the European Space Agency (Esa) on this initiative, but exactly when the sample tubes might come home is uncertain. Planning with Esa was at an early stage, said Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's science chief. ""Depending on how the details come out, it could be in the early 2030s,"" he explained. Artwork: The 2020 mission will again use a ""Skycrane"" to put the rover on the surface The 2020 rover is based on the one-tonne Curiosity robot that the agency landed in Gale Crater in 2012. Curiosity has been a great success, and Nasa wants to repeat it. Using the same ""template"" also saves money; some equipment spares were left over from 2012. That said, instrument-wise, the new vehicle is quite a bit different. Yes, it will again feature cameras, a robotic arm, a drill and a laser - but there is a new suite of sensors and analysis tools, and there is even an experiment to demonstrate how future astronauts might make oxygen on the Red Planet. The new robot will use the same ""Skycrane"" technology that put Curiosity down with such great precision six years ago - but with an add-on. Engineers have developed an on-the-fly mapping system called Terrain-Relative Navigation which ought to bring even greater accuracy to the landing process. Missions to Mars can only launch inside a tight time window due to the alignment of the planets. The 2020 venture will leave Earth in the July/August of that year and should land on 18 February 2021. ""Nasa has a long and successful track record at Mars. Since Mariner 4 flew by Mars in 1965, we've orbited, we've landed and we've roved across the surface of the Red Planet,"" said Lori Glaze, the acting director of Nasa's planetary science division. ""And we've got another opportunity to improve our track record a week from today when we land InSight on the surface. We're all looking forward to that."" Unlike 2020 and Curiosity,Insight is a static lander,external. It will be the first mission dedicated to ""looking inside"" the planet. It will use seismometers to listen for ""Marsquakes"", to help build a picture of Mars' internal structure. Esa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 also.European scientists recently selected Oxia Planum as its destination. Satellite imagery suggests, as with Jezero and Gale, this ancient terrain came into prolonged contact with water.

Spain demands Gibraltar veto,"The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713 Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr SÃ¡nchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr SÃ¡nchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. This video can not be played Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He saidthe EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines,external, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. What to look for in Brexit declaration? Spain hopeful of Gibraltar deal by summer Gibraltar angered by Spain's EU 'veto' Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Pictures of life on the Rock Read more about Gibraltar here A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control. There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed? The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators. A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU. Gibraltar has a population of 33,600,externaland 7.7 million visitors a year Financial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there It has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates Although there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25% Gibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita,externalthan either the UK or Spain.

Deadly hospital shooting rocks Chicago,"This video can not be played Eyewitness at the cancer centre: ""I was in the gunfire and had to duck down"" A doctor, a newly graduated pharmacist and a police officer were killed after a gunman opened fire at a hospital in Chicago, police say. The gunman was seen arguing with the doctor, Tamara O'Neal, who he had been in a relationship with, before shooting her and turning his gun on others. The shooter, named as Juan Lopez, 32, also died but it is not clear if he was killed by police or took his own life. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the attack ""tears at the soul of our city"". America's gun culture in 10 charts Four dates that explain US gun debate ""It is the face and a consequence of evil,"" he said, adding that the three victims were ""all going about their day, all doing what they loved"". The shootings began with a row in the Mercy Hospital car park between the gunman and Dr O'Neal at about 15:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Monday. When a friend of the doctor's tried to intervene ""the offender lifted up his shirt and displayed a handgun"", Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. This video can not be played Police officers line streets in Chicago to honour their colleague As the friend ran for help, gunfire broke out, witnesses said. One witness, James Gray, told reporters he saw Dr O'Neal fall to the ground and then the gunman ""stood over her and shot her three more times"". When police arrived, the gunman then moved into the hospital, shooting at random and killing pharmacist Dayna Less who was getting off an escalator at the time. In an exchange of fire with the gunman, police officer Samuel Jimenez was killed. A second police officer avoided injury after a bullet fired in his direction became lodged in his gun in his holster. Coins stop bullet to save soldier's life Hospital patients scrambled to find cover under desks, police and Swat teams moved through the hospital in search of the gunman, and officers locked down hospital wings, including the nursery. Hector Avitia, who was in the hospital waiting room with his wife,told the Chicago Tribune,externalthat he tried to get people away from windows as the bullets started flying. ""I've heard shootings,"" he said. ""I've known people that have died in the neighbourhood like that. But something like that? No."" ""He was just shooting like a maniac,"" he continued. ""And he obviously knows how to shoot because he was holding the gun with both hands."" Dr O'Neal was an emergency physician at Mercy Hospital on Chicago's South Side. Dr Patrick Connor, director of the hospital's emergency department, said she had been ""dedicated to caring for her community - a wonderful individual"". Allow Twitter content?

Airbnb removes Israeli West Bank listingsThe US firm says it will take home rentals in Israeli settlements on occupied land off its website.Business,"Airbnb says it will remove from its listings all homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The US firm said it had made the decision because settlements were at the ""core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians"". The move has been welcomed by Palestinians but Israel has called it ""shameful"" and threatened legal action. The West Bank settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Can settlement issue be solved? Israel advances plans for 1,000 new West Bank settler homes Airbnb has previously been criticised by Palestinian officials and human rights campaigners for allowing listings of homes to rent in Israeli settlements. A statement from the company said: ""US law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories. ""At the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced."" The Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim in the occupied West Bank Following an evaluation, it said: ""We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians."" Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), said it was ""crucial for Airbnb to follow the position of international law that Israel is the occupying power and that Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including occupied east Jerusalem, are illegal and constitute war crimes"". But Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said Airbnb's decision was ""the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts"". He said Israel would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in US courts. The Yesha Council, which represents Israeli settlers, accused Airbnb of becoming ""a political site"" and said the decision was ""the result of either anti-Semitism or capitulation to terrorism, or both"". The decision was announced the day before Human Rights Watch was set to publish a report examining Airbnb's business in the settlements. The organisation praised Airbnb's decision on Twitter, hailing it as ""a breakthrough"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The issue of settlements is one of the most contentious areas of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians see them as a major obstacle to peace and a barrier to a hoped-for Palestinian state on land which they occupy. Israel says such an argument is a pretext for avoiding direct peace talks, and that the fate of settlements should be negotiated in accordance with peace accords signed with the Palestinians in 1993.

May seeks business backing for Brexit plan,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will be fully in control of who comes here."" Theresa May has renewed her efforts to sell her draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - arguing it will stop EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". She said migration would become skills-based, with Europeans no longer prioritised over ""engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi"". The PM also insisted to business leaders at the CBI that the withdrawal deal had been ""agreed in full"". Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's remarks on EU free movement were ""offensive"". The Scottish First Minister said for the prime minister to use such language to describe reciprocal arrangements entered into freely by the UK - allowing EU nationals to live and work in the UK and vice-versa - was ""really disgraceful"". Live updates: May and Brexit developments May: Ousting me won't help Brexit Reality Check: What does the draft agreement reveal? Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Meanwhile, the DUP, which is opposed to the Irish border backstop proposal in the withdrawal agreement, abstained on amendments to the Finance Bill in the Commons on Monday evening. It also supported one amendment proposed by the Labour Party. The DUP has a so-called confidence-and-supply arrangement to support the Conservative Party, which does not have a majority in the House of Commons, which was secured with a controversial Â£1bn funding deal for Northern Ireland. The party's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, told BBC's Newsnight the abstentions were made because the government had broken a fundamental agreement to deliver Brexit for the people of the UK ""as a whole"" and to not ""separate Northern Ireland constitutionally or economically from the United Kingdom"". The move was designed to send a political message back, he said. ""'Look, we've got an agreement with you, but you've got to keep your side of the bargain, otherwise we don't feel obliged to keep ours.'"" A senior DUP source stressed, however, that this was not the end of the confidence-and-supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP. This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier Also on Monday evening, the government said it would publish an economic analysis comparing the costs and benefits of its Brexit deal with those of the UK staying in the EU. A cross-party group of MPs had proposed an amendment to the Bill calling on ministers to publish the forecasts. The government said MPs would be given the analysis before the meaningful vote on the final deal. It will look at a no-deal scenario, a free trade agreement and the government's proposed deal. The prime minister's appeal to business leaders came as Tory MPs continue to press for late changes to the deal. Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries have met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK - a meeting which revealed Spanish concern at the wording's impact on Gibraltar's future. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party is set to reject Mrs May's deal, told the CBI business lobby group's conference that Brexit can be a ""catalyst for economic transformation"" in the UK. There has been widespread criticism of the draft 585-page withdrawal agreement - and the short paper setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which are set to be finalised and signed off at an EU summit this weekend. Two of the prime minister's cabinet ministers resigned over the proposed deal, while others are believed to be trying to change its wording. Speculation continues over whether the number of Tory MPs submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May will reach the 48 required to trigger a confidence vote on her leadership of the Conservative Party. Mrs May told the CBI's annual conference in London that her plan would provide a fair immigration system that would help young people in the UK get jobs and training. ""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi. ""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer."" Analysis: PM is 'listening but not hearing' A guide to where we are with Brexit She also said she was not willing to reopen discussions with Brussels over the withdrawal agreement, saying ""the core elements of that deal are already in place"". She said that she expected to hammer out a framework for a future trade relationship in Brussels this week, before signing off the deal on Sunday. CBI president John Allan urged MPs to back Mrs May's deal - despite it not being ""perfect"" - and warned of the consequences for businesses if the UK were to simply crash out of the EU. The Labour leader said Mrs May's ""botched"" deal ""breaches the prime minister's own red lines"" and ""makes no mention of retaining frictionless trade"". Mr Corbyn suggested the EU would consider re-writing the draft agreement ""at the 11th hour"" if MPs rejected the proposals. He also suggested the UK's exit from the EU should be a catalyst for far-reaching economic and social change and a ""radical programme of investment"" in infrastructure, education and skills. The draft document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights. The transition period - currently due to last until 31 December 2020 - will mean the UK is officially out of the EU, but still abiding by most of its rules. During this time, the two sides hope to negotiate a permanent trade deal. The UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border whatever happens, so they agreed to a ""backstop"" - described as an insurance policy by Mrs May - aimed at achieving this if the sides cannot agree a trade deal that avoids a physically visible border. This video can not be played One questioner at the CBI spells out his concerns with the planned deal The backstop would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the whole of the UK would be in a single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. The critics say that during the transition period, the UK will still abide by most of the EU's rules but have no power over setting them - and there is no system for the UK being able to leave any backstop deal without the EU's agreement, so it could become a permanent arrangement. When asked whether the transition period could last until the end of 2022, Business Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be at our request and that would be a maximum period."" He said it could be extended for a matter of ""weeks or months"", and added: ""If we were six weeks away from concluding a future economic partnership and agreeing that, then it may make sense to extend the transition period."" This video can not be played Theresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: ""Don't just listen to the politicians."" Later, Mrs May told the CBI conference that it was ""important"" to be out of the implementation period before the next general election - which is due in June 2022. Reality Check: The withdrawal agreement explained Environment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the five cabinet ministers who were believed to be trying to change the wording of the deal, said on Monday that the prime minister ""has my full support"" and she is doing a ""very good job"". ""I hope people will get behind her as she endeavours to get the very, very best deal for Britain,"" he said. But former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonused his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalto renew his criticism of the draft agreement, describing it as a ""585-page fig-leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat"". And former Tory leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a vote of confidence would be a distraction. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, said any suggestions EU nationals had been given preferential treatment were wrong since they were merely ""exercising rights which provided freedom and opportunities"".

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, called on all parties to ""remain calm"" and focus on the future agreement. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels after meeting the 27 other EU member states, he said the withdrawal deal was ""fair and balanced"" but made clear a transition period extension could not be indefinite, ""it has to be a fixed period of time"". During Monday's meeting, the Spanish government raised concerns about two articles in the withdrawal agreement (184 and 3), saying that taken together they add up to Gibraltar remaining permanently as UK territory. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says most member states, along with the European Commission and the European Council, do not agree with Madrid's reading of the text and are seeking to provide reassurance.

DUP in stark Brexit warning to Theresa May,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned fellow Tory MPs that if they don't ditch Theresa May now she will lead them into the next election, scheduled for 2022. Few Tories thought this was a ""good idea"", the Brexiteer MP suggested. Mr Rees-Mogg wants to oust the PM over her EU withdrawal agreement but has so far failed to get enough colleagues to back his call for a no confidence vote. Meanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to the Finance Bill after the DUP withdrew its backing. Labour said the government was ""falling apart in front of us"" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the bill to pass the Budget. They were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal What to look for in Brexit declaration Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment Mr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote. ""What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,"" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference. ""We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible."" He said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement. But he added: ""I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election. Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months. The PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and it will allow the country to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"". This video can not be played Sammy Wilson, DUP: ""The government had broken one of the fundamental agreements they had with us... we had to do something."" In other developments: Downing Street said at a meeting of the cabinet earlier, the first since a spate of Brexit resignations last week, ministers had discussed possible alternative arrangements to keep the border open, that could involve ""technological solutions"". In a sign of tension on the EU side, Spain has said it will not agree to the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without clarity over how talks on the future status of Gibraltar should be handled. Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Tory-DUP relationship 'broken over Europe' The importance of being unionist Downing Street said that,during talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the PM had emphasised that the draft Brexit terms would give Scottish businesses the ""clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters"". The SNP leader also met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier to discuss tactics ahead of the Commons vote. This video can not be played In full: Nicola Sturgeon interview with Laura Kuenssberg on Brexit Ms Sturgeon held a separate meeting with Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, who all back another EU referendum. She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she wanted to form a ""coalition of opposition"" to Mrs May's Brexit plans, and that momentum for another referendum was growing. She described her talks with Mr Corbyn as ""exploratory"" and said she did not know whether he would back a referendum. But she said they both agreed that the PM's Brexit deal is a bad one and that no-deal should not be the only alternative presented to MPs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A Labour spokesman said: ""They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May's botched Brexit deal and determination to work across Parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome."" As it stands, thereappears to be a majority in Parliament against the deal. Sturgeon has 'constructive' Corbyn talks Work with Plaid on Brexit, Labour urged And Mrs May is coming under growing pressure from the DUP, whose 10 MPs keep her government in power. This video can not be played Theresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: ""Don't just listen to the politicians."" The DUP abstained in Monday night's Budget votes as a warning shot over what they say are her broken promises on Brexit. After the DUP indicated they would abstain again on further votes on Tuesday, ministers accepted Labour and SNP amendments in order to avoid likely defeat. These will require the government to conduct a review into the public health impact of gaming, a report into the impact of Brexit on international tax enforcement and a review into the impact of tax avoidance measures on income inequality and child poverty. Under the terms of their House of Commons deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year's general election, the DUP is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence votes. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said their refusal to do so now was ""absolutely staggering"", adding that the Conservatives were ""in office but not in power"".

Fighting resumes at key Yemeni port,"Battles have resumed in the port city of Hudaydah, a strategic location in the Yemeni conflict Fighting has broken out in the Yemeni city of Hudaydah despite both the Saudi-led military coalition and Houthi rebels agreeing to halt offensives. Coalition warplanes resumed bombing following clashes between rebels and pro-government forces. The UN is attempting to revive talks to end a three-year war that has caused a massive humanitarian crisis. So far, the conflict has killed thousands and pushed millions more Yemenis to the brink of starvation. On Monday, intense fighting could be heard on the outskirts of the city, which is controlled by the Houthi rebels, while coalition warplanes launched a series of air strikes on strategic rebel positions, AFP news agency reports. The head of the Houthis' Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, earlier said in a statement that the rebels were halting drone and missile strikes on coalition forces after a request from the United Nations. The statement added that Houthis were ready to move towards a wider ceasefire if ""the Saudi-led coalition wants peace"". Will peace talks mean more violence in Yemen? Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Last week the coalition, which is led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, ordered a halt in its offensive on Hudaydah, a port on the Red Sea. They have also said that they support the UN-led talks. The UN special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has said he hopes peace talks convene before the end of the year. He told the UN Security Council on Friday that he had been given ""firm assurances"" that both sides would attend, promising to accompany the Houthi representatives from the Yemeni capital Sanaa if need be. The Houthis failed to show up at peace talks in September. The latest violence in Hudaydah is likely to set back international efforts to bring an end to the ongoing conflict. Hudaydah's port is a key lifeline for just under two-thirds of Yemen's population, which is almost totally reliant on imports of food, fuel and medicine. Why battle for Yemen's Hudaydah matters The UN has previously warned that in a worst-case scenario, the conflict could cost up to 250,000 lives, as well as cut off aid supplies to millions of people. The conflict began in 2014 when the Houthi Shia Muslim rebel movement took advantage of the new president's weakness and seized control of northern Saada province and neighbouring areas. The Houthis went on to take Sanaa, forcing President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi into exile abroad. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words The conflict escalated dramatically in March 2015, when Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Muslim Arab states - backed by the US, UK, and France - began air strikes against the Houthis, with the declared aim of restoring Mr Hadi's government.

'Black cab rapist' to stay in prison,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi The ""black cab rapist"" John Worboys must stay in prison, the Parole Board has ruled. Worboys who is now known as John Radford, was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London. Among reasons given for refusing the 61-year-old parole were his ""sense of sexual entitlement"" and a need to control women. In January the Parole Board said he would be freed after serving 10 years, but victims challenged the decision. The High Court overturned the board's original ruling and sided with the legal challenge. The BBC has seen a summary of the reasons why the Parole Board has now refused to release Worboys, which include ""risk factors"" such as Worboys' ""sexual preoccupation, a sense of sexual entitlement and a belief that rape is acceptable"". The black cab used by Worboys in his attacks At his trial at Croydon Crown Court in 2009, jurors were told Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End. The court heard Worboys claimed he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos and offered his victims a glass of celebratory champagne laced with sedatives. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Worboys was convicted of 19 offences including one count of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. As well as being ordered to serve at least eight years,Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence, meaning he could be kept in prison as for as long as he was deemed to remain a danger to the public. Launch of legal bid against Worboys' release Would London ban be enforceable? Victims told Worboys would 'serve life-sentence' Police believe Worboys may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Police found a ""rape kit"" with contraceptives and drugs in Worboys' cab Among the documents considered by the panel were a 1,255 page dossier on Worboys and personal statements from seven victims. It concluded: ""After considering the circumstances of offending, the progress made while in custody, and the evidence presented within the dossier, the panel was not satisfied that Mr Worboys was suitable for release or progression to the open estate."" The Parole Board said under current legislation Worboys will be eligible for a further review ""within two years"", but this would be at a date set by the Ministry of Justice.

Gunman opens fire at Chicago hospital,"This video can not be played Eyewitness at the cancer centre: ""I was in the gunfire and had to duck down"" A doctor, a newly graduated pharmacist and a police officer were killed after a gunman opened fire at a hospital in Chicago, police say. The gunman was seen arguing with the doctor, Tamara O'Neal, who he had been in a relationship with, before shooting her and turning his gun on others. The shooter, named as Juan Lopez, 32, also died but it is not clear if he was killed by police or took his own life. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the attack ""tears at the soul of our city"". America's gun culture in 10 charts Four dates that explain US gun debate ""It is the face and a consequence of evil,"" he said, adding that the three victims were ""all going about their day, all doing what they loved"". The shootings began with a row in the Mercy Hospital car park between the gunman and Dr O'Neal at about 15:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Monday. When a friend of the doctor's tried to intervene ""the offender lifted up his shirt and displayed a handgun"", Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. This video can not be played Police officers line streets in Chicago to honour their colleague As the friend ran for help, gunfire broke out, witnesses said. One witness, James Gray, told reporters he saw Dr O'Neal fall to the ground and then the gunman ""stood over her and shot her three more times"". When police arrived, the gunman then moved into the hospital, shooting at random and killing pharmacist Dayna Less who was getting off an escalator at the time. In an exchange of fire with the gunman, police officer Samuel Jimenez was killed. A second police officer avoided injury after a bullet fired in his direction became lodged in his gun in his holster. Coins stop bullet to save soldier's life Hospital patients scrambled to find cover under desks, police and Swat teams moved through the hospital in search of the gunman, and officers locked down hospital wings, including the nursery. Hector Avitia, who was in the hospital waiting room with his wife,told the Chicago Tribune,externalthat he tried to get people away from windows as the bullets started flying. ""I've heard shootings,"" he said. ""I've known people that have died in the neighbourhood like that. But something like that? No."" ""He was just shooting like a maniac,"" he continued. ""And he obviously knows how to shoot because he was holding the gun with both hands."" Dr O'Neal was an emergency physician at Mercy Hospital on Chicago's South Side. Dr Patrick Connor, director of the hospital's emergency department, said she had been ""dedicated to caring for her community - a wonderful individual"". Allow Twitter content?

'Legal high' sale goes underground,"New legislation to tackle ""legal highs"" was introduced last year The sale of so-called legal highs has gone underground after a blanket ban came into force, a report says. While the ban has led to a ""considerable reduction"" in use of the drugs, street dealers are now the main source of supply. Now officially known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), they mimic the effects of other drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy. They were sold openly, mainly in specialist shops, before May 2016. Since the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) came in, they are no longer being sold in the stores, known as head shops, according tothe Home Office review,external. They said 31 outlets had closed, with a further 332 no longer stocking the drugs. Prices have gone up too and ""significantly"" fewer people are using them. But the report warns the drugs have become more potent, with new strands of them continuing to be produced. This suggests the ban has not yet brought an end to the ""game of cat and mouse"" between law enforcement agencies and those producing NPS. The review also says the ban might have led to the most vulnerable users switching back to drugs like cannabis and cocaine. One Manchester drug worker quoted in the report said: ""It was so easy before. But after PSA, in Rochdale young offenders, those in care, they found they had less access to NPS. ""People just couldn't be bothered to source it and there is a culture of 'whatever they can get their hands on easiest'."" But an NPS user in Exeter quoted in the review said: ""Now the shops aren't selling stuff, people get it from another source, like through a dealer. You can still get hold of them just as easily."" Spice stimulants are the main NPS used in prisons, according to the report Ministers had brought forward the NPS legislation after the substances were linked to dozens of deaths. It concluded that most of the aims of the act ""appear to have been achieved, with the open sale of NPS largely eliminated, a significant fall in NPS use in the general population, and a reduction in health-related harms which is likely to have been achieved through reduced usage"". But it said areas of concern had remained - or emerged - since the ban, and noted ""continued high levels of synthetic cannabinoid use among the homeless and prison populations."" The main NPS used within prison is Spice, according to the report. Under the act, offenders can face up to seven years in prison, with civil orders being issued to close down online dealers and head shops. Police recorded 492 arrests in the first six months after the act took effect. There were 1,523 seizures of NPS in 2017/18.
