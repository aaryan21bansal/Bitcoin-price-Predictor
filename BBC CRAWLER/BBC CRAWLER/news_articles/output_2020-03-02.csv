Coronavirus could spread 'significantly' - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on coronavirus: ""We will face a challenge in the weeks, months ahead"" There could be a ""very significant expansion"" of the number of cases of coronavirus in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson said the possibility of further transmission of the virus was ""clearly on the cards"". It comes as the number of cases in the UK rose to 39 on Monday. Meanwhile, the EU has raised the coronavirus risk level in member states to ""moderate to high"". There were four new UK cases announced on Monday, all of whom had travelled to Italy - which has seen the largest outbreak in Europe. They are from Hertfordshire, Devon and Kent and tracing their contacts has started, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said. It was earlier reported that this took the total to 40. However, a hospital in Middlesex where a doctor was thought to have contracted the virus on Sunday said further tests have proved negative.

It is ""much more likely than not that we will face a challenge in the weeks, months ahead,"" he said, adding that the country was ""well prepared with a fantastic NHS"". Mr Johnson said that ""further protective measures"" against the spread of the disease would be announced ""as and when that spread happens"". ""Don't forget the importance of washing your hands,"" he added. How have you been affected by the spread of Covid-19? Share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The prime minister was speaking after an emergency Cobra meeting where ministers discussed plans to tackle the spread of coronavirus in the UK - due to be published on Tuesday. Mr Johnson said plans would include a ""range of calibrated responses to the spread of coronavirus"". He said the issue with measures such as closing schools and cancelling major public events would be ""when and how and with what logic to deploy them"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson later confirmed that schools ""should stay open unless they're advised otherwise by Public Health England"". The Budget will go ahead as planned on 11 March, despite the impact of the outbreak on the UK and global economy, Downing Street said. All Six Nations rugby matches currently scheduled are set to go ahead, including Saturday's England v Wales fixture, it has been confirmed. Elsewhere, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned the nation should prepare fora ""significant outbreak"" of coronavirus. This video can not be played Do face masks work? And other coronavirus questions answered There has so far been one confirmed case in Scotland, involving a patient who had recently travelled to Italy. Ms Sturgeon said that future cases were likely in the ""days to come"". Earlier, Public Health England (PHE) said widespread transmission of coronavirus in the UK was now ""highly likely"". Medical director Prof Paul Cosford said the increase in cases in the UK and abroad meant the UK must be prepared. If the outbreak worsens, the government has said measures could include asking newly retired doctors and nurses to return to the NHS. People could also be urged to work from home - and closing schools and cancelling major public events have also not been ruled out. Legislation allowing the government to use extra powers to help control the spread of the virus is expected to go through Parliament by the end of March.

World in 'uncharted territory' on coronavirus,"The WHO insists containment measures can still ""push this virus back"" The world is in ""uncharted territory"" on the coronavirus outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was ""unique"" but could be contained with the right measures. Deaths globally have passed 3,000. Most are in China but over the past day there were nine times more new infections outside China than inside. Dr Tedros insisted: ""We can push this virus back"". He also said stigma was more dangerous than the disease itself. The WHO chief said the development of the Covid-19 disease globally was not a ""one-way street"" and could be combated if countries acted quickly and effectively - starting with containment measures. ""There is no choice but to act now,"" he said. One of the countries worst affected outside China - Italy - on Monday saw a jump in its death toll from 34 to 52. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide WAYS TO PREVENT CATCHING IT:How to wash your hands WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Dr Tedros's main advice was that each country had to look at their own situation as there was no one-way-fits-all means of tackling the outbreak. ""Each country must have its own approach but it must start with containment,"" he said. This was a ""unique virus with unique features"" and the WHO would have expected wide contagion by now, but containment measures had appeared to work, the doctor said. Of the 62 countries reporting cases of infection, 38 of them had 10 or fewer, he added. Israel set up a dedicated polling station where people under quarantine could vote in Monday's general election ""Around eight countries have not reported new cases for two weeks and have been able to contain the outbreak,"" he said. China had also shown containment was possible even in countries with a large number of cases. The WHO would continue to monitor whether the outbreak should be called a global pandemic, Dr Tedros said. South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan remain the greatest concern. A WHO staff member has tested positive in Iran, although the symptoms are mild, Dr Tedros said. He also added: ""Stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself. Let's really underline that. Stigma is the most dangerous enemy."" There are now almost 90,000 cases worldwide in about 70 countries, although the vast majority - just under 90% - remain in China, and most of those are in Hubei province, where the virus originated late last year. Of the nearly 8,800 cases outside China, 81% are in four countries - Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan. Italy raised its death toll by 18 on Monday, with 1,835 confirmed cases, most of them in the Lombardy and Veneto areas of the north. Iran reported another 12 deaths, taking the total there to 66. They included Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a high-ranking adviser to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iranian media reported. Health officials in the US state of Washington said on Monday that four more people had died, bringing the total there to six. They are the only deaths in the US so far.

Prosecutors in South Korea have been asked to investigate Mr Lee on possible charges of gross negligence. China reported 42 more deaths, all in Hubei. The province has registered more than 90% of the global fatalities. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan China pollution clears amid coronavirus slowdown How deadly is the coronavirus? Only eight of the newly reported cases of infection were outside Hubei, suggesting containment was working. The 206 new cases reported nationwide on Sunday represented the lowest number of daily cases since 22 January. A spokesman from China's National Health Commission said the next stop would be to ""focus on the risks brought by the resumption of work"". The WHO says the virus appears to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

The supermarket giant said it believed a database of stolen usernames and passwords from other platforms had been tried out on its websites, and may have worked in some cases. No financial data was accessed and its systems have not been hacked, it added. It said this was a precautionary measure and apologised for the inconvenience. ""We are aware of some fraudulent activity around the redemption of a small proportion of our customers' Clubcard vouchers,"" a Tesco spokesperson said.

Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at the firm Eset, told the BBC plenty of people still use simple passwords or similar log-ins for many different platforms.

""The big risk is via brute force attacking the accounts where criminals use leaked common password combinations against the emails to try to break into other personal accounts."" Mr Moore suggested using password managers to generate and store uniquely different passwords, and two factor authentication where possible - in which a text message or email code is required as well as the password.

Legendary US executive Jack Welch dies at 84,"President Donald Trump tweeted a tribute to Jack Welch after hearing of his death Jack Welch, a titan of American business who transformed General Electric (GE) into America's most valuable company, has died aged 84. He ran the US conglomerate from 1981 until 2001, and was once named ""manager of the century"" for his achievements. Nicknamed ""Neutron Jack"" for his cost-cutting, he became a best selling author and confidante of US presidents. President Donald Trump Tweeted that Mr Welch was a business legend and friend. Born in 1935 to Irish-Catholic parents in Massachusetts, Mr Welch spent his entire career at GE, which he joined as a chemical engineer in its plastics division at Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

Made the company's youngest vice-president in 1972, he became vice-chairman in 1979. By the end of 1980, it was announced that he was to become chairman and CEO of the firm, a position he held for 20 years before retiring in 2001. While at the helm in the 1980s and 1990s, he bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding GE into financial services and consulting. He was also known for his focus on straight-talk, efficiency and streamlined bureaucracy. He would regularly cull the lowest-performing 10% of staff each year. ""The underperformers generally had to go,"" he wrote in one of his books. ""In grade school you're graded, in college you make the team or you don't, you graduate or you don't. People are graded all along why at age 22 when you quit school should you stop being evaluated, it's nonsense,""he told the BBC in 2001,external. This ruthless approach was credited with helping to grow GE's market value from $12bn to $410bn (Â£321bn). In 1999,Fortune magazine named him the ""Manager of the Century"",external, crediting him with keeping GE nimble and showing the way to a generation of business leaders facing the shift to a more globalised, less manufacturing-based economy. ""Today is a sad day for the entire GE family,"" GE's current chief, H. Lawrence Culp Jr., said in a statement. ""Jack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world."" A guru to thousands of management hopefuls, his books ""Winning"" and ""Jack: Straight from the Gut"" were bestsellers during his retirement. More recently, a turn for the worse in GE's fortunes has also prompted a second look at Mr Welch's business accomplishments. During the 2008 global financial crisis, losses at the firm's financial services arm delivered a blow to the firm, which subsequently scaled back its operations, selling off many of its less-profitable businesses. Mr Welch's generous retirement package also drew controversy as an example of excessive executive compensation after details of it aired during his divorce from his second wife. In his retirement, Mr Welch founded a business degree programme, wrote columns with his third wife, Suzy, and spoke frequently, preserving his reputation for delivering unvarnished opinions. In 2012, he suggested in a Tweet that the government under Barack Obama was fudging economic data - a claim,he later acknowledged,externalas ""somewhat incendiary"". His advice to women in the workplace, in whichhe emphasised performance,externalandwarned that making choices to put family first would have a career cost,external, was also criticised as out of date.

"Winners and losers from overdraft overhaulSome borrowers will see costs roughly double but others will have bigger savings, analysis shows.BusinessComments","Shopping around for a better deal might be tough among the big brands Some overdraft borrowers will see charges double while others will make ""astonishing"" savings when new prices kick in, new analysis shows. New rules for overdraft charging demanded by the City regulator take effect next month. Financial information service Moneyfacts has tested how much someone borrowing Â£500 through an overdraft for a month would be charged. Some will see costs roughly double to Â£14 but others will enjoy Â£60 savings. Those facing more expensive overdrafts are almost entirely people who previously had an arranged overdraft facility. 'Why are my overdraft costs doubling?' Up until now fees have been complex, difficult to navigate and hard to compare, leaving some with large overdraft bills. Single, simple overdraft interest rates are now being brought in ahead of an April deadline set by the regulator. The Moneyfacts data shows many have been paying around Â£7 a month to borrow an agreed Â£500 for 30 days, but they might soon pay double to borrow the same amount for the same period. ""The much-needed overhaul of the charges has been a double-edged sword for some,"" said Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts. This might prompt them to consider borrowing through credit cards or store cards instead, she said. Others, who would breach their overdraft limit or go overdrawn without permission, could see ""astonishing savings"" as the ""most extortionate fees"" of the old regime were effectively being banned, she said. In one example, a provider's fees for an unarranged Â£500 overdraft for 30 days will drop from Â£100 to less than Â£10. A number of banks will see their fees for a Â£500 overdraft drop by Â£60 or so to Â£14 a month - as the new rules state there must be no difference in charging between arranged and unarranged overdrafts, and specific daily or monthly charges are to be banned. This will hit the bottom line of many big banks. ""It will be interesting to see whether these new charges will be revisited in the coming months or if customers start to see other account perks slashed in light of the shake-up,"" Ms Springall said. Nationwide has said it will bring in an interest rate of 39.9% in April, replacing a daily fee of 50p for arranged overdrafts HSBC's interest rate will double from 19.9% to 39.9% Lloyds' will be 39.9% Santander's will also be 39.9% NatWest raised its to 39.45% Barclays is not far behind with 35%. To put those interest rates into context, the average quoted rate for credit card borrowing is just over 20%, according to the Bank of England. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said most High Street banks had set ""very similar prices"",after it demanded changes to the system. It has sent a letter to banks,external, asking them to explain what influenced their decision. It also asked how the banks will deal with any customers who could be worse off following the changes.

S Korea sect leader apologises for virus spread,"Lee Man-hee is the founder of the Shincheonji Church The head of the religious sect that has been at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea has apologised to the nation for the disease's spread. Lee Man-hee, the leader of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, got on his knees and bowed at a news conference. About 60% of the country's more than 4,000 confirmed cases are sect members. Deaths nationwide now stand at 28. Fatalities globally have now passed the 3,000 mark, although the vast majority are in China, where the outbreak began.

Of the confirmed cases, about 75% are from the southern city of Daegu and 73% of those have been linked to the Shincheonji Church. In the capital, Seoul, the mayor urged the city's 10 million residents to work from home and to avoid crowded places.

China's economy has taken a hit - with factory activity falling at a record rate. On Monday, a man was sentenced to death by a Chinese court for fatally stabbing two officials at a virus checkpoint, news agency AFP reported. Ma Jianguo, 23, refused to co-operate with officials - though it is not clear what he was told to do - and stabbed two checkpoint officials. On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus appeared to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. It urged countries to stock up on ventilators, saying ""oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe Covid-19"". In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

Turkey says millions of migrants may head to EU,"This video can not be played Greek coast guards shot into the sea beside this migrant dinghy and pushed it around with their boats The Turkish president has warned that ""millions"" of migrants and refugees will soon head towards Europe. Recep Tayyip Erdogan was speaking after announcing Turkey could no longer enforce a 2016 deal with the EU to prevent migrants entering Europe. Mr Erdogan said Turkey could not cope with a new wave of refugees after an escalation of the Syrian conflict. A young boy died when a boat capsized off the Greek island of Lesbos on Monday, Greek police said. It was the first reported fatality since Turkey opened its border last week. Meanwhile, a Turkish official accused the Greek authorities of killing a Syrian man who was trying to breach the border on Monday. Athens denied the allegation. An unverified video showed a man on the ground with blood on his neck. Nearly a million Syrians have fled to the Syrian-Turkish border since December, amid heavy fighting in the Idlib region between Turkish-backed rebels and Syrian government forces. Turkey is already hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees, as well as migrants from other countries such as Afghanistan - but previously stopped them from leaving for Europe. This video can not be played Refugees and migrants gather at the Turkish-Greek land border In a televised speech, Mr Erdogan said the EU had provided no help for resettling Syrian refugees in ""safe zones"" inside Syria. After Turkey opened its doors for migrants to leave its territory for Europe last week, he said, ""hundreds of thousands have crossed, soon it will reach millions"". The Turkish leader gave no evidence for his figures, while Greece said about 1,000 migrants had reached its eastern Aegean islands from Turkey since Sunday morning. In addition, Greece said it had stopped almost 10,000 migrants from crossing its land border in 24 hours. Some migrants tossed stones and metal bars when stopped, and Greek border guards fired tear gas. It was proposed as a solution to the migrant crisis in which almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in the EU in 2015 and thousands died in mass drownings On 20 March 2016 the EU and Turkey made a deal that saw Syrian refugees who arrived on Greek islands sent back to Turkey. In returnTurkey received â¬6bn (Â£5.2bn; $6.7bn) in EU aid,externalfor migrants and refugees For every Syrian person removed from Greece to Turkey, another would be resettled from Turkey to the EU The EU agreed to work towards lifting visa requirements for Turkish citizens by the end of June 2016 After the deal was agreed, the number of migrants arriving in Greece declined sharply Besides Syrians, there are Afghans and West Africans among the migrants at the border. Europe's top human rights watchdog, the Council of Europe, condemned Greece and Turkey's actions, calling the situation an ""unprecedented humanitarian crisis"". ""Everything must be done to de-escalate violence in the border region, including by ensuring that law enforcement authorities refrain from using excessive force,"" it said. Refugees eye Europe as Turkey hits breaking point Turkey drone strikes 'kill 19 Syrian soldiers' Why does the battle for Idlib matter? EU Council President Charles Michel and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will go to the border with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Tuesday. ""Either we bring these people to a dignified life in their own land, or everyone will get their share of this burden. Now the unilateral sacrifice period is over,"" Mr Erdogan said. In a statement on Monday, the Greek government said, ""Turkey, instead of curbing the traffickers' channels of migrants and refugees, has itself turned into a trafficker."" Greece has blocked any new asylum applications for the next month, because of what it calls the ""coordinated and massive nature"" of illegal migration from Turkey. ""This relocation of people has nothing to do with international law regarding the right of asylum, which concerns only individual cases,"" the statement said.

Winners and losers from overdraft overhaul,"Shopping around for a better deal might be tough among the big brands Some overdraft borrowers will see charges double while others will make ""astonishing"" savings when new prices kick in, new analysis shows. New rules for overdraft charging demanded by the City regulator take effect next month. Financial information service Moneyfacts has tested how much someone borrowing Â£500 through an overdraft for a month would be charged. Some will see costs roughly double to Â£14 but others will enjoy Â£60 savings. Those facing more expensive overdrafts are almost entirely people who previously had an arranged overdraft facility. 'Why are my overdraft costs doubling?' Up until now fees have been complex, difficult to navigate and hard to compare, leaving some with large overdraft bills. Single, simple overdraft interest rates are now being brought in ahead of an April deadline set by the regulator. The Moneyfacts data shows many have been paying around Â£7 a month to borrow an agreed Â£500 for 30 days, but they might soon pay double to borrow the same amount for the same period. ""The much-needed overhaul of the charges has been a double-edged sword for some,"" said Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts. This might prompt them to consider borrowing through credit cards or store cards instead, she said. Others, who would breach their overdraft limit or go overdrawn without permission, could see ""astonishing savings"" as the ""most extortionate fees"" of the old regime were effectively being banned, she said. In one example, a provider's fees for an unarranged Â£500 overdraft for 30 days will drop from Â£100 to less than Â£10. A number of banks will see their fees for a Â£500 overdraft drop by Â£60 or so to Â£14 a month - as the new rules state there must be no difference in charging between arranged and unarranged overdrafts, and specific daily or monthly charges are to be banned. This will hit the bottom line of many big banks. ""It will be interesting to see whether these new charges will be revisited in the coming months or if customers start to see other account perks slashed in light of the shake-up,"" Ms Springall said. Nationwide has said it will bring in an interest rate of 39.9% in April, replacing a daily fee of 50p for arranged overdrafts HSBC's interest rate will double from 19.9% to 39.9% Lloyds' will be 39.9% Santander's will also be 39.9% NatWest raised its to 39.45% Barclays is not far behind with 35%. To put those interest rates into context, the average quoted rate for credit card borrowing is just over 20%, according to the Bank of England. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said most High Street banks had set ""very similar prices"",after it demanded changes to the system. It has sent a letter to banks,external, asking them to explain what influenced their decision. It also asked how the banks will deal with any customers who could be worse off following the changes. It said some firms could reduce or waive interest for customers who are in financial difficulty because of their overdraft. 'Why are my overdraft costs doubling?'

UK expects 0.16% economic boost from US trade deal,"Cars were the top British export to the US last year, representing 14% of all UK goods exports. The government has estimated a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States would boost the UK economy by 0.16% over the next 15 years. The figure is included in a180-page document,externalsetting out the UK's negotiating position for talks, expected to begin later this month. The document pledges to maintain maintain food standards and stresses that the NHS is ""not on the table"". It comes asseparate trade talks with the EUget under way in Brussels. The UK government said a US deal should seek to lower import taxes, or tariffs, on many UK exports - and increase trade in services. It says an agreement would increase the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) by between 0.07% and 0.16%, depending on the exact terms of the deal. The estimate is based on a model developed by the government in November 2018 when itpredicted various post-Brexit scenarios. That model estimated that UK GDP would fall by 7.6% over 15 years if the government failed to reach a trade deal with the EU. UK-EU trade talks: A simple guide UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The UK's strategy document said a deal should also seek to boost trade in digital services, and make it easier for UK professionals to work in the US, and vice versa. The UK will aim to lower trade barriers faced by British car manufacturers, ceramics makers and producers of products such as Cheddar cheese, the document adds. It suggests a number of economic sectors, including energy, carmaking and construction are expected to benefit from a boost if a deal is struck. However, it said a US deal would lead to a long-term 0.5% reduction in the output of the financial services sector, with resources ""reallocated"" to other areas. The UK's release of its wishlist for a trade deal with the US was an hour behind schedule  - and a full year behind America's list. It's a reminder that nothing is likely to go to plan in the year ahead. The UK, as expected, pledges to protect consumer standards and the NHS. But America wants more access for its farmers, which would likely necessitate a relaxing of standards. And this is happening at the same time as talks with the EU get underway (conducted, to complicate matters with a different team under the authority of a different Whitehall department) - for whom a relaxing of standards is likely to be unpalatable. The US has also specified it wants to be able to veto the UK's ability to strike deals with ""non-market economies"" meaning the likes of China How big are the potential gains? The Department for International Trade touts the potential  for UK GDP to increase by Â£3.4bn if tariffs are eliminated (which actually goes beyond the stated objectives) and other barriers reduced by 50%. So that's a big ""if"" and in any case is equivalent to a scant 0.2% of GDP, and over the course of 15 years. And that's dwarfed by the hit to UK growth other studies have suggested will result from even a free trade agreement with the EU, compared to the status quo. The US published itsoutline for trade talkswith the UK last February. The discussions will take place in both the UK and US and be overseen by the government's chief negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer - formerly New Zealand's chief negotiator and ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Speaking ahead of the publication of the document, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""the best negotiators in the business"" and would ""drive a hard bargain to boost British industry"". But Liberal Democrat International Trade spokesperson Sarah Olney said the document showed the benefits from a UK-US deal ""will not come close to outweighing what we expect to lose from leaving the EU"". Labour MP David Lammy, who had been a prominent Remain supporter, told the government: ""So now you admit the potential economic benefits of a UK-US trade deal are just +0.2% of GDP. ""In what planet does this boost wages or create jobs for anyone except the Tory Cabinet?"" In what appears to be a bid to push back againstaccusations made by Labour during the electionthat the health service would be up for sale under the Conservatives, the government also said any future deal must ""protect"" the NHS. ""The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table,"" the document says. ""The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic."" According to recent media reports, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. But the US has expressed frustration at the ban, arguing that it is not based on scientific evidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner accused the government of making ""false promises"" over commitments to protect the NHS and consumer standards, adding ""there must be a full and proper scrutiny process for this and all trade agreements"". The US is the UK's largest trading partner after the EU, accounting for nearly 19% of all exports in 2018 and 11% of imports. The EU accounted for 45% of all exports and 53% of imports.

Flooding 'not over yet' as river level set to peak,"Swans gather on flooded riverside streets in Worcester Flooding in areas along the River Severn ""isn't over yet"", the Environment Agency (EA) has warned. Homes were evacuated last week in Ironbridge, Shropshire, and in Bewdley, Worcestershire, after flood defences buckled. Levels on the River Severn are expected to peak in Ironbridge on Monday night and will remain high for the next three to four days, the EA said. Dave Throup, from the EA, warned people not to get ""complacent"". On Sunday, the Met Office revealed rainfall data indicatedFebruary was the wettest on record in the UK. On average 202.1mm of rain fell last month, beating February 1990 when 193.4mm was recorded. Bewdley Bridge has been closed to vehicles Mr Throup said that almost the whole length,externalof the River Severn in England remained atflood warning level.,external ""All the water from the weekend is now in Shrewsbury, it's worked its way downstream,"" he said. ""We saw a peak overnight at Welsh bridge of 4.3m so that is a high level, but it's almost a metre lower than last week so more manageable. ""But we don't want people to get complacent, these are still very high flood levels."" Latest updates on flooding in the West Midlands Later on Monday, Mr Throup said they were seeing ""quite a strong rise"" at Bewdley, but stressed it was still lower than last week. ""These are closer to winter flooding levels, but that does bring with it dangers,"" he said. ""We've got a number of roads closed, difficult travel conditions, we're not out of the woods, it's going to take a good few days for these river levels to drop right out."" The flooded rugby ground of Bridgnorth RFC is seen beside the swollen River Severn ""Herculean efforts"" saw damaged flood defences in Ironbridge repaired in time for Storm Jorge The temporary barriers in Ironbridge were pushed back by up to 6.6ft (2m) due to the force of the water on Wednesday, meaning water was able to seep beneath them. Mr Throup said levels there were expected to peak overnight into Tuesday and then peak in Worcestershire on Tuesday night. ""The barriers there have been all checked, we've replaced the bits that got damaged or twisted, so they're all good to go,"" he said. In Worcestershire, Eckington Bridge is closed but other roads in the area have opened. Bewdley Bridge is closed to vehicles ""due to river levels rising faster than anticipated"",the council said,external. It remains open to cyclists and pedestrians. Meanwhile,river levels in flood-hit parts of East Yorkshire are ""dropping very fast"",the EA said. The Environment Agency worked through the night to clear drains Herefordshire Councilsaid it was waiving the need for a permit,externaluntil 8 March for any residents with flood damaged items they want to dispose of. Businesses in a Herefordshire village affected by the partial collapse of a road said there had been a drop in customer numbers. The B4424 between Fownhope and Hereford has been closed since 17 February after a landslip. A coach takes children to a primary school in the village, which is accessible via Ledbury and Ross on Wye, a diversion of 90 minutes for those coming in from elsewhere. Flooding response defended during minister's visit In Pictures: Flood-hit areas in the Midlands Flood barriers repaired before Storm Jorge arrival Local businesses said they urgently needed better signage and managed diversion routes. Kevin Braybrook, who runs Bowens Bed and Breakfast, said he has had cancellations. ""We just need a speedy professional pro-active response about what we're going to do about this road,"" he said.

M&S extends trial of food refill scheme,"Marks & Spencer is to extend a trial of its refill scheme where shoppers can fill their own containers with food. The trial will be extended at its Hedge End store in Southampton, and will be rolled out in Manchester this month. A spokesperson said it was part of the supermarket's ""action to reduce plastic packaging"". UK supermarkets are responsible for 58 billion pieces of plastic a year,according to Greenpeace,external. The initial trial offered 44 plastic packaging-free products from coffee and cereal to sweets and pasta at the Hedge End retail park store. M&S said 25 of those products were now outselling packaged alternatives in the store. The trial will also be extended to the firm's Manchester city centre store, which will take part from March. The retailer said the success of the trial is down to the fact that consumers are trying to shop in a more environmentally-friendly way. Three-quarters of consumers are trying to cut down on the amount of plastic they use, according to a survey of 2,200 adults carried out by YouGov for the supermarket. The research also suggested that customers struggled to find retailers that offered refill schemes, and also find carrying containers around inconvenient. Popular products in the refill scheme include pasta and rice M&S's director of food technology, Paul Willgoss, said: ""Our 'fill your own' concept is one area we're focusing on as part of our action to reduce plastic packaging and support our customers to reuse and recycle. He added: ""We're keen to better understand refill across the entire store process from behind the scenes operations to working with our customers to encourage behaviour change."" Previous research by the environmental charity Greenpeace,externalsuggested discount retailers like Aldi or Lidl might have further to go than other supermarkets such as M&S. It was ranked fourth out of the UK's 10 biggest supermarkets for its plastic ""footprint"". M&S previously committed to introducing additional lines of loose produce and other alternatives to plastic across its UK shops. Other pledges made by major UK retailers include: Asda:Launch a sustainability store in Leeds where customers can use refill stations. Morrisons:Have 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025 and offer paper carrier bags Tesco:Remove hard-to-recycle materials, including PVC, from its own brand products Sainsbury's:Remove lightweight loose product bags from store and replace plastic film on fruit and vegetables with a recyclable option Aldi:Get rid of plastic wrapping on cabbages and cauliflower in some stores, and trial cardboard packaging on steak Single-use plastic has become a major topic for discussion after the BBC's Blue Planet IIhighlighted its effect on the oceans. The BBC has also announced plans for a year-long series of programmes and coverageon climate change, as part of the Our Planet Matters project.

Global growth âcould halveâ because of coronavirus,"The global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned. The influential think tank has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November. But it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5%. It came after the Bank of England vowed to help stabilise markets, which suffered steep losses last week. Coronavirus is already forcing businesses to suspend operations in China and elsewhere as officials try to contain its spread. The OECD forecast the global economy could recover to 3.3% growth in 2021, assuming the epidemic peaked in China in the first quarter of this year and other outbreaks proved mild and contained. But it said the picture would be much worse if the virus spread throughout Asia, Europe and North America. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Coronavirus spread hits Chinese manufacturing Shares drop in worst week since financial crisis Why should I care if share prices fall? ""The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,"" said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist. Last week saw major stock markets suffer their worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with $1.5 trillion being wiped off the value of global shares. Investors now hope central banks around the world will work in unison to support financial markets as the deadly virus spreads. The Bank of England has promised to help stabilise markets On Monday, the Bank of England said it continued to monitor developments and was assessing its potential impact on the global and UK economies and financial systems. ""The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,"" a spokesman said. Japan's central bank and the US Federal Reserve have also said they are prepared to intervene to stop more big falls on global stock markets. Buoyed by the news, US stocks opened higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes both gaining 0.7%. London's FTSE 100 index closed 1.2% higher, while China's Shanghai Composite index gained 3.2% and Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, climbed 1%. On Monday, the privately-run Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed the fastest rate of contraction in China's factory activity since the survey was launched in 2004. That followed the release on Saturday of equally weak official numbers. Both sets of data come after employers across the country were ordered to remain closed after the annual Chinese New Year holiday as part of attempts by authorities to stem the spread of the virus. The falls, which were even worse than the slump seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, highlighted the outbreak's huge impact on the world's second-largest economy. There are limits to what traditional monetary policy can actually achieve if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. If supply chains are disrupted, and factories have to shut down, interest rate cuts are unlikely to help very much. Likewise, if people don't want to go to the shops, eat in restaurants, travel on planes or stay in hotels, cheap credit isn't going to make a lot of difference. And in many countries, interest rates are in any case already low. But the prospect of a rate cut does at least provide a psychological prop - and reduces the risk of the falls on the markets turning into a rout. The next step may be to look at ways of encouraging commercial banks to provide targeted support - for companies that are struggling with repayments on loans because their business has been affected by the outbreak, for example. That may be the kind of life-support that's really needed to keep firms operating until the worst of the crisis is over. The OECD said governments would have to step in if the virus worsened, providing extra support for their health systems and emergency loans for hard hit industries. ""A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,"" Mr Boone added. Over the weekend senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration also tried to soothe concerns about the impact of the outbreak, highlighting the US economy's underlying strength. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, said that the stock market ""will come back"", adding that ""the fundamentals of this economy are strong"".

Coronavirus 'costing pubs hundreds of thousands',"The postponement of the Ireland v Italy rugby match is a financial hit for pubs, says Colin Neill Northern Ireland pubs have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds while feeling the ""pain"" of the coronavirus crisis, an industry chief has claimed. Hospitality Ulster head Colin Neill warned the fear must not ""become bigger than the actual challenge"". He described the cancellation of one of Ireland's Six Nations rugby fixtures due to the virus as a blow to pubs. There have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus on the island of Ireland, one on each side of the border. Thefirst person to test positive was a woman in Northern Irelandwho had recently returned home from northern Italy. The second was a male student who attends a Dublin secondary school that has since beenclosed for 14 days as part of the Republic's infection-control measures. Although the name of the school has not been officially released, parents at Scoil ChaitrÃ­ona in Glasnevin confirmed on social media it was their school. Extra effort is being made on hygiene in the hospitality industry, says Colin Neill The decision tocall off Ireland's Six Nations match against Italywas also taken in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus. which can cause the severe lung disease Covid-19. ""Obviously, [the Six Nations] is a big draw into our pub sector,"" Mr Neill said. ""There is an economic impact there that we would estimate in the hundreds of thousands.

Bank seeks to quell market panic,"The global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned. The influential think tank has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November. But it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5%. It came after the Bank of England vowed to help stabilise markets, which suffered steep losses last week. Coronavirus is already forcing businesses to suspend operations in China and elsewhere as officials try to contain its spread. The OECD forecast the global economy could recover to 3.3% growth in 2021, assuming the epidemic peaked in China in the first quarter of this year and other outbreaks proved mild and contained. But it said the picture would be much worse if the virus spread throughout Asia, Europe and North America. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Coronavirus spread hits Chinese manufacturing Shares drop in worst week since financial crisis Why should I care if share prices fall? ""The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,"" said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist. Last week saw major stock markets suffer their worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with $1.5 trillion being wiped off the value of global shares. Investors now hope central banks around the world will work in unison to support financial markets as the deadly virus spreads. The Bank of England has promised to help stabilise markets On Monday, the Bank of England said it continued to monitor developments and was assessing its potential impact on the global and UK economies and financial systems. ""The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,"" a spokesman said. Japan's central bank and the US Federal Reserve have also said they are prepared to intervene to stop more big falls on global stock markets. Buoyed by the news, US stocks opened higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes both gaining 0.7%. London's FTSE 100 index closed 1.2% higher, while China's Shanghai Composite index gained 3.2% and Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, climbed 1%. On Monday, the privately-run Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed the fastest rate of contraction in China's factory activity since the survey was launched in 2004. That followed the release on Saturday of equally weak official numbers. Both sets of data come after employers across the country were ordered to remain closed after the annual Chinese New Year holiday as part of attempts by authorities to stem the spread of the virus. The falls, which were even worse than the slump seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, highlighted the outbreak's huge impact on the world's second-largest economy. There are limits to what traditional monetary policy can actually achieve if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. If supply chains are disrupted, and factories have to shut down, interest rate cuts are unlikely to help very much. Likewise, if people don't want to go to the shops, eat in restaurants, travel on planes or stay in hotels, cheap credit isn't going to make a lot of difference. And in many countries, interest rates are in any case already low. But the prospect of a rate cut does at least provide a psychological prop - and reduces the risk of the falls on the markets turning into a rout. The next step may be to look at ways of encouraging commercial banks to provide targeted support - for companies that are struggling with repayments on loans because their business has been affected by the outbreak, for example. That may be the kind of life-support that's really needed to keep firms operating until the worst of the crisis is over. The OECD said governments would have to step in if the virus worsened, providing extra support for their health systems and emergency loans for hard hit industries. ""A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,"" Mr Boone added. Over the weekend senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration also tried to soothe concerns about the impact of the outbreak, highlighting the US economy's underlying strength. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, said that the stock market ""will come back"", adding that ""the fundamentals of this economy are strong"".

Of the confirmed cases, about 75% are from the southern city of Daegu and 73% of those have been linked to the Shincheonji Church.

Concerns about the outbreak last week wiped more than $5tn (Â£3.9tn) from global stocks US sportswear giant Nike has closed its European headquarters in Hilversum in the Netherlands after an employee tested positive for the virus Members of the fringe Christian group are believed to have infected one another and then travelled around the country, apparently undetected. The group has been accused of keeping its members' names secret,making it harder to track the outbreak. But church spokesman Kim Shin-chang told the BBC they had provided a list of members, students, and buildings to authorities. ""We were worried about releasing this information because of the safety of our members,"" Mr Kim said.

Ecuador on Monday reported five new cases of the disease, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to six. The US state of New York also confirmed its first case.

A spokesman from China's National Health Commission said the next stop would be to ""focus on the risks brought by the resumption of work"". China's economy has taken a hit - with factory activity falling at a record rate. On Monday, a man was sentenced to death by a Chinese court for fatally stabbing two officials at a virus checkpoint, news agency AFP reported. Ma Jianguo, 23, refused to co-operate with officials - though it is not clear what he was told to do - and stabbed two checkpoint officials. On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus appeared to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. It urged countries to stock up on ventilators, saying ""oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe Covid-19"". In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

Both sets of data come after employers across the country were ordered to remain closed after the annual Chinese New Year holiday as part of attempts by authorities to stem the spread of the virus. The falls, which were even worse than the slump seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, highlighted the outbreak's huge impact on the world's second-largest economy. There are limits to what traditional monetary policy can actually achieve if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. If supply chains are disrupted, and factories have to shut down, interest rate cuts are unlikely to help very much. Likewise, if people don't want to go to the shops, eat in restaurants, travel on planes or stay in hotels, cheap credit isn't going to make a lot of difference. And in many countries, interest rates are in any case already low. But the prospect of a rate cut does at least provide a psychological prop - and reduces the risk of the falls on the markets turning into a rout. The next step may be to look at ways of encouraging commercial banks to provide targeted support - for companies that are struggling with repayments on loans because their business has been affected by the outbreak, for example. That may be the kind of life-support that's really needed to keep firms operating until the worst of the crisis is over. The OECD said governments would have to step in if the virus worsened, providing extra support for their health systems and emergency loans for hard hit industries. ""A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,"" Mr Boone added. Over the weekend senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration also tried to soothe concerns about the impact of the outbreak, highlighting the US economy's underlying strength. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, said that the stock market ""will come back"", adding that ""the fundamentals of this economy are strong"".

NHS 'not on table' in post-Brexit US trade talksThe UK sets out its strategy for trade talks with US - as separate talks with the EU get under way.,"Cars were the top British export to the US last year, representing 14% of all UK goods exports. The government has estimated a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States would boost the UK economy by 0.16% over the next 15 years. The figure is included in a180-page document,externalsetting out the UK's negotiating position for talks, expected to begin later this month. The document pledges to maintain maintain food standards and stresses that the NHS is ""not on the table"". It comes asseparate trade talks with the EUget under way in Brussels. The UK government said a US deal should seek to lower import taxes, or tariffs, on many UK exports - and increase trade in services. It says an agreement would increase the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) by between 0.07% and 0.16%, depending on the exact terms of the deal. The estimate is based on a model developed by the government in November 2018 when itpredicted various post-Brexit scenarios. That model estimated that UK GDP would fall by 7.6% over 15 years if the government failed to reach a trade deal with the EU. UK-EU trade talks: A simple guide UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The UK's strategy document said a deal should also seek to boost trade in digital services, and make it easier for UK professionals to work in the US, and vice versa. The UK will aim to lower trade barriers faced by British car manufacturers, ceramics makers and producers of products such as Cheddar cheese, the document adds. It suggests a number of economic sectors, including energy, carmaking and construction are expected to benefit from a boost if a deal is struck. However, it said a US deal would lead to a long-term 0.5% reduction in the output of the financial services sector, with resources ""reallocated"" to other areas. The UK's release of its wishlist for a trade deal with the US was an hour behind schedule  - and a full year behind America's list. It's a reminder that nothing is likely to go to plan in the year ahead. The UK, as expected, pledges to protect consumer standards and the NHS. But America wants more access for its farmers, which would likely necessitate a relaxing of standards. And this is happening at the same time as talks with the EU get underway (conducted, to complicate matters with a different team under the authority of a different Whitehall department) - for whom a relaxing of standards is likely to be unpalatable. The US has also specified it wants to be able to veto the UK's ability to strike deals with ""non-market economies"" meaning the likes of China How big are the potential gains? The Department for International Trade touts the potential  for UK GDP to increase by Â£3.4bn if tariffs are eliminated (which actually goes beyond the stated objectives) and other barriers reduced by 50%. So that's a big ""if"" and in any case is equivalent to a scant 0.2% of GDP, and over the course of 15 years. And that's dwarfed by the hit to UK growth other studies have suggested will result from even a free trade agreement with the EU, compared to the status quo. The US published itsoutline for trade talkswith the UK last February. The discussions will take place in both the UK and US and be overseen by the government's chief negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer - formerly New Zealand's chief negotiator and ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Speaking ahead of the publication of the document, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""the best negotiators in the business"" and would ""drive a hard bargain to boost British industry"". But Liberal Democrat International Trade spokesperson Sarah Olney said the document showed the benefits from a UK-US deal ""will not come close to outweighing what we expect to lose from leaving the EU"". Labour MP David Lammy, who had been a prominent Remain supporter, told the government: ""So now you admit the potential economic benefits of a UK-US trade deal are just +0.2% of GDP. ""In what planet does this boost wages or create jobs for anyone except the Tory Cabinet?"" In what appears to be a bid to push back againstaccusations made by Labour during the electionthat the health service would be up for sale under the Conservatives, the government also said any future deal must ""protect"" the NHS. ""The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table,"" the document says. ""The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic."" According to recent media reports, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. But the US has expressed frustration at the ban, arguing that it is not based on scientific evidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner accused the government of making ""false promises"" over commitments to protect the NHS and consumer standards, adding ""there must be a full and proper scrutiny process for this and all trade agreements"". The US is the UK's largest trading partner after the EU, accounting for nearly 19% of all exports in 2018 and 11% of imports. The EU accounted for 45% of all exports and 53% of imports.

UK vows to seek 'hard bargain' in US trade talksNegotiating aims being set out on same day discussions with the EU formally kick off in Brussels.UK Politics,"International Trade Secretary Liz Truss welcomed US trade representative Robert Lighthizer to London last week Boris Johnson has promised to ""drive a hard bargain"" as he set out the UK's negotiating position for a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US. The government said a deal would boost the UK economy by Â£3.4bn and particularly benefit Scotland, England's north-east and the Midlands. It pledged to maintain food standards and said the NHS would not be for sale. Meanwhile, talks between the UK and EU aimed at reaching a trade agreement formally kick off in Brussels later. Katya Adler: UK-EU trade talks will be tricky from the outset UK-EU trade talks: A simple guide UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The talks on a free trade agreement with the US are expected to begin later this month. The discussions will take place in both the UK and US and be overseen by the government's chief negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer - formerly New Zealand's chief negotiator and ambassador to the World Trade Organization. A government statement said manufacturers of ceramics, cars, food and drink would be ""the biggest winners"" from a deal, along with the professional services, including architects and lawyers. ""We're going to drive a hard bargain to boost British industry,"" said Mr Johnson. ""Trading Scottish smoked salmon for Stetson hats, we will deliver lower prices and more choice for our shoppers."" In what appears to be a bid to push back againstaccusations made by Labour during the electionthat the health service would be up for sale under the Conservatives, the government also said any future deal ""must protect our NHS"". International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Breakfast: ""We will not diminish our food safety standards and we will also not put the NHS on the table, or the price the NHS pays for drugs on the table."" ""Those are two very clear red lines in our trade deal."" Turning to the EU trade talks, Ms Truss attempted to address concerns over fishing rights - the EU is demanding continued access to British waters, while the UK wants quota deals like the EU has with Norway or Iceland. Ms Truss told BBC Breakfast: ""We are not going to trade away our fishing in a deal with the EU or any other negotiating partner. ""We are going to get a deal with the EU that does not involve selling out our fishing."" Confederation of British Industry director general Carolyn Fairbairn said it was ""encouraging to see the government's ambitions to make it easier for skilled people to move between the UK and US"" and ""support small business exporters"". Boris Johnson and Donald Trump met at a G7 summit in France in August But Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ""The government should be focused on getting a good trade deal with the EU - not cosying up to Donald Trump."" She said a bad trade deal with the US would ""put working people's jobs and rights on the line... and it will undermine our vital public services, environment and food standards"". Ms O'Grady referred to fears from farming leaders that an agreement could see the import of food that would be illegal to produce in the UK, such as chlorinated chicken. According to recent media reports, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. But the US has expressed frustration at the ban, arguing that it is not based on scientific evidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner accused the government of making ""false promises"" over commitments to protect the NHS and consumer standards, adding ""there must be a full and proper scrutiny process for this and all trade agreements"". The US is the UK's largest trading partner after the EU, accounting for nearly 19% of all exports in 2018 and 11% of imports. The EU accounted for 45% of all exports and 53% of imports. On Monday, a hundred British negotiators will travel to Brussels to start talks on a trade deal with the EU. The four days of discussions will be led by David Frost on the UK side and Michel Barnier for the EU, and there will be up to 11 different groups discussing different aspects of the deal. David Frost will lead the UK's negotiations in Brussels Potential flashpoints could include the UK's wish to diverge from EU employment and environmental standards in future, its ruling out of any role for the European Court of Justice, and the level of EU access to UK fishing waters. How do you negotiate a trade agreement? What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? The UK has signalled that it could walk away from trade talks in June unless there is a ""broad outline"" of a deal. French Europe Minister Amelie De Montchalin told the BBC that the EU was prepared to abort a post-Brexit deal if European fishermen were denied access to British waters. Details of what will be discussed and when have been published,,externalwith topics to be covered in the first round of negotiations including trade in goods and services, transport, energy, fisheries and ""fair and open competition"" in future dealings. Further rounds of negotiations will take place every two to three weeks, alternating between London and Brussels. Liberal Democrat acting leader Sir Ed Davey has called on the prime minister to pause trade talks with the EU and extend the Brexit transition period in order to focus on dealing with the coronavirus. Even trade buffs admit their area of expertise can be pretty dry and detail-heavy. And it would certainly suit the government if we all looked the other way during these negotiations because trade deals generally include trade-offs. On both sides. Neither Boris Johnson, nor his predecessor, Theresa May, have been wholly transparent about this with the UK public. So surely it is of interest to those who voted for Brexit, to keep a keen eye on whether the benefits they've been led to believe will be coming the UK's way for farmers, fishermen and slashing immigration numbers, will now materialise in the way they'd imagined. And what do both sides - the EU and Boris Johnson's government - want from a trade deal? Very different things. Read more about what the EU and UK both want from a trade deal.

"M&S extends trial of food refill schemeShoppers can fill their own containers in two stores, as the firm tries to cut down on plastic waste.Business","Marks & Spencer is to extend a trial of its refill scheme where shoppers can fill their own containers with food. The trial will be extended at its Hedge End store in Southampton, and will be rolled out in Manchester this month. A spokesperson said it was part of the supermarket's ""action to reduce plastic packaging"". UK supermarkets are responsible for 58 billion pieces of plastic a year,according to Greenpeace,external. The initial trial offered 44 plastic packaging-free products from coffee and cereal to sweets and pasta at the Hedge End retail park store. M&S said 25 of those products were now outselling packaged alternatives in the store. The trial will also be extended to the firm's Manchester city centre store, which will take part from March. The retailer said the success of the trial is down to the fact that consumers are trying to shop in a more environmentally-friendly way. Three-quarters of consumers are trying to cut down on the amount of plastic they use, according to a survey of 2,200 adults carried out by YouGov for the supermarket. The research also suggested that customers struggled to find retailers that offered refill schemes, and also find carrying containers around inconvenient. Popular products in the refill scheme include pasta and rice M&S's director of food technology, Paul Willgoss, said: ""Our 'fill your own' concept is one area we're focusing on as part of our action to reduce plastic packaging and support our customers to reuse and recycle. He added: ""We're keen to better understand refill across the entire store process from behind the scenes operations to working with our customers to encourage behaviour change."" Previous research by the environmental charity Greenpeace,externalsuggested discount retailers like Aldi or Lidl might have further to go than other supermarkets such as M&S. It was ranked fourth out of the UK's 10 biggest supermarkets for its plastic ""footprint"". M&S previously committed to introducing additional lines of loose produce and other alternatives to plastic across its UK shops. Other pledges made by major UK retailers include: Asda:Launch a sustainability store in Leeds where customers can use refill stations. Morrisons:Have 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025 and offer paper carrier bags Tesco:Remove hard-to-recycle materials, including PVC, from its own brand products Sainsbury's:Remove lightweight loose product bags from store and replace plastic film on fruit and vegetables with a recyclable option Aldi:Get rid of plastic wrapping on cabbages and cauliflower in some stores, and trial cardboard packaging on steak Single-use plastic has become a major topic for discussion after the BBC's Blue Planet IIhighlighted its effect on the oceans. The BBC has also announced plans for a year-long series of programmes and coverageon climate change, as part of the Our Planet Matters project. M&S's environmental pledges come as the struggling company plans to shut more than 100 stores by 2022.But food sales remain a bright spot in its performance, offsetting weaker sales in clothing and homeware.

UK sets out opening position for US trade talks,"Cars were the top British export to the US last year, representing 14% of all UK goods exports. The government has estimated a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States would boost the UK economy by 0.16% over the next 15 years. The figure is included in a180-page document,externalsetting out the UK's negotiating position for talks, expected to begin later this month. The document pledges to maintain maintain food standards and stresses that the NHS is ""not on the table"". It comes asseparate trade talks with the EUget under way in Brussels. The UK government said a US deal should seek to lower import taxes, or tariffs, on many UK exports - and increase trade in services. It says an agreement would increase the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) by between 0.07% and 0.16%, depending on the exact terms of the deal. The estimate is based on a model developed by the government in November 2018 when itpredicted various post-Brexit scenarios. That model estimated that UK GDP would fall by 7.6% over 15 years if the government failed to reach a trade deal with the EU. UK-EU trade talks: A simple guide UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The UK's strategy document said a deal should also seek to boost trade in digital services, and make it easier for UK professionals to work in the US, and vice versa. The UK will aim to lower trade barriers faced by British car manufacturers, ceramics makers and producers of products such as Cheddar cheese, the document adds. It suggests a number of economic sectors, including energy, carmaking and construction are expected to benefit from a boost if a deal is struck. However, it said a US deal would lead to a long-term 0.5% reduction in the output of the financial services sector, with resources ""reallocated"" to other areas. The UK's release of its wishlist for a trade deal with the US was an hour behind schedule  - and a full year behind America's list. It's a reminder that nothing is likely to go to plan in the year ahead. The UK, as expected, pledges to protect consumer standards and the NHS. But America wants more access for its farmers, which would likely necessitate a relaxing of standards. And this is happening at the same time as talks with the EU get underway (conducted, to complicate matters with a different team under the authority of a different Whitehall department) - for whom a relaxing of standards is likely to be unpalatable. The US has also specified it wants to be able to veto the UK's ability to strike deals with ""non-market economies"" meaning the likes of China How big are the potential gains? The Department for International Trade touts the potential  for UK GDP to increase by Â£3.4bn if tariffs are eliminated (which actually goes beyond the stated objectives) and other barriers reduced by 50%. So that's a big ""if"" and in any case is equivalent to a scant 0.2% of GDP, and over the course of 15 years. And that's dwarfed by the hit to UK growth other studies have suggested will result from even a free trade agreement with the EU, compared to the status quo. The US published itsoutline for trade talkswith the UK last February. The discussions will take place in both the UK and US and be overseen by the government's chief negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer - formerly New Zealand's chief negotiator and ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Speaking ahead of the publication of the document, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""the best negotiators in the business"" and would ""drive a hard bargain to boost British industry"". But Liberal Democrat International Trade spokesperson Sarah Olney said the document showed the benefits from a UK-US deal ""will not come close to outweighing what we expect to lose from leaving the EU"". Labour MP David Lammy, who had been a prominent Remain supporter, told the government: ""So now you admit the potential economic benefits of a UK-US trade deal are just +0.2% of GDP. ""In what planet does this boost wages or create jobs for anyone except the Tory Cabinet?"" In what appears to be a bid to push back againstaccusations made by Labour during the electionthat the health service would be up for sale under the Conservatives, the government also said any future deal must ""protect"" the NHS. ""The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table,"" the document says. ""The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic."" According to recent media reports, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. But the US has expressed frustration at the ban, arguing that it is not based on scientific evidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner accused the government of making ""false promises"" over commitments to protect the NHS and consumer standards, adding ""there must be a full and proper scrutiny process for this and all trade agreements"".

Bank of England seeks to quell market panic,"The global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned. The influential think tank has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November. But it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5%. It came after the Bank of England vowed to help stabilise markets, which suffered steep losses last week. Coronavirus is already forcing businesses to suspend operations in China and elsewhere as officials try to contain its spread. The OECD forecast the global economy could recover to 3.3% growth in 2021, assuming the epidemic peaked in China in the first quarter of this year and other outbreaks proved mild and contained. But it said the picture would be much worse if the virus spread throughout Asia, Europe and North America. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Coronavirus spread hits Chinese manufacturing Shares drop in worst week since financial crisis Why should I care if share prices fall? ""The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,"" said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist. Last week saw major stock markets suffer their worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with $1.5 trillion being wiped off the value of global shares. Investors now hope central banks around the world will work in unison to support financial markets as the deadly virus spreads. The Bank of England has promised to help stabilise markets On Monday, the Bank of England said it continued to monitor developments and was assessing its potential impact on the global and UK economies and financial systems. ""The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,"" a spokesman said. Japan's central bank and the US Federal Reserve have also said they are prepared to intervene to stop more big falls on global stock markets. Buoyed by the news, US stocks opened higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes both gaining 0.7%. London's FTSE 100 index closed 1.2% higher, while China's Shanghai Composite index gained 3.2% and Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, climbed 1%. On Monday, the privately-run Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed the fastest rate of contraction in China's factory activity since the survey was launched in 2004. That followed the release on Saturday of equally weak official numbers. Both sets of data come after employers across the country were ordered to remain closed after the annual Chinese New Year holiday as part of attempts by authorities to stem the spread of the virus. The falls, which were even worse than the slump seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, highlighted the outbreak's huge impact on the world's second-largest economy. There are limits to what traditional monetary policy can actually achieve if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. If supply chains are disrupted, and factories have to shut down, interest rate cuts are unlikely to help very much. Likewise, if people don't want to go to the shops, eat in restaurants, travel on planes or stay in hotels, cheap credit isn't going to make a lot of difference. And in many countries, interest rates are in any case already low. But the prospect of a rate cut does at least provide a psychological prop - and reduces the risk of the falls on the markets turning into a rout. The next step may be to look at ways of encouraging commercial banks to provide targeted support - for companies that are struggling with repayments on loans because their business has been affected by the outbreak, for example. That may be the kind of life-support that's really needed to keep firms operating until the worst of the crisis is over. The OECD said governments would have to step in if the virus worsened, providing extra support for their health systems and emergency loans for hard hit industries. ""A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,"" Mr Boone added. Over the weekend senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration also tried to soothe concerns about the impact of the outbreak, highlighting the US economy's underlying strength. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, said that the stock market ""will come back"", adding that ""the fundamentals of this economy are strong"".

Lee Man-hee, the leader of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, got on his knees and bowed at a news conference. About 60% of the country's more than 4,000 confirmed cases are sect members. Deaths nationwide now stand at 28. Fatalities globally have now passed the 3,000 mark, although the vast majority are in China, where the outbreak began.

The group has been accused of keeping its members' names secret,making it harder to track the outbreak. But church spokesman Kim Shin-chang told the BBC they had provided a list of members, students, and buildings to authorities. ""We were worried about releasing this information because of the safety of our members,"" Mr Kim said.

The Shincheonji Church is labelled as a cult within South Korea and also in the Christian community, which results in the group often being discriminated against, persecuted or criticised, Mr Kim told the BBC.

They include Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a high-ranking adviser to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iranian media reported on Monday. Qatar, Ecuador, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Ireland were among countries that confirmed their first cases over the weekend. Ecuador on Monday reported five new cases of the disease, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to six. The US state of New York also confirmed its first case. The patient is a woman in her 30s who contracted the virus during a recent trip to Iran. Two people have died in the US,both in the state of Washington. China on Monday reported 42 more deaths, all in Hubei. The Chinese province was where the virus emerged late last year and it has registered more than 90% of the global fatalities. There were 202 confirmed new cases on Monday - only six of which were outside Hubei. A total of 2,912 people have died inside China, with more than 80,000 confirmed cases of the virus.

A spokesman from China's National Health Commission said the next stop would be to ""focus on the risks brought by the resumption of work"". China's economy has taken a hit - with factory activity falling at a record rate. On Monday, a man was sentenced to death by a Chinese court for fatally stabbing two officials at a virus checkpoint, news agency AFP reported. Ma Jianguo, 23, refused to co-operate with officials - though it is not clear what he was told to do - and stabbed two checkpoint officials. On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus appeared to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. It urged countries to stock up on ventilators, saying ""oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe Covid-19"". In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

What are the chances of dying from coronavirus?,"The UK government's scientific advisers believe that the chances of dying from a coronavirus infection are between 0.5% and 1%. This is lower than the rate of death among confirmed cases - which is 4% globally in WHO figures and 5% in the UK as of March 23 - because not all infections are confirmed by testing. Each country has its own way of deciding who gets tested, so comparing case numbers or apparent death rates across countries can also be misleading. Death rates also depend on a range of factors like your age and general health, and the care you can access. The elderly and the unwell are more likely to die, if they contract coronavirus. Current estimates from Imperial College London are that the death rate is almost 10 times higher than average for those over 80, and much lower for those under 40. The UK government's chief medical advisor, Professor Chris Whitty, says even though the rates are higher for older people, ""the great majority of older people will have a mild or moderate disease"". He also warns that we should not think it's a trivial infection for younger people, pointing out that there are some young people who have ended up in intensive care. It's not just age that determines the risk of infections. In the first big analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, deaths were at least five times more common among confirmed cases with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems. All of these factors interact with each other and we don't yet have a complete picture of the risk for every type of person in every location. And even though patterns in the death rates among confirmed cases can tell us who is most at risk, they can't tell us about the precise risk in any single group. Most cases of most viruses go uncounted because people tend not to visit the doctor with mild symptoms. On 17 March, the chief scientific adviser for the UK, Sir Patrick Vallance, estimated there were about 55,000 cases in the UK, when the confirmed case count was just under 2,000. Dividing deaths by 2,000 will give you a much higher death rate than dividing by 55,000. That's one of the biggest reasons why the death rates among confirmed cases are a bad estimate of the true death rates: overestimating the severity by missing cases. But you can also get it wrong in the other direction: underestimating the death rate by not taking into account those people currently infected who may eventually die. The first big studies into death rates were done in China According to research by Imperial College,external, it's because different countries are better or worse at spotting the milder, harder to count cases. Countries use different tests for the virus, have different testing capacity and different rules for who gets tested. All of these factors change over time. The UK government plans to increase testing to 10,000 a day initially, with a goal of reaching 25,000 a day within four weeks. It currently restricts testing mainly to people in hospitals. Germany has been testing more than 20,000 people a day Germany has a daily testing capacity of more than 20,000 cases and has been testing people with mild symptoms. So their counts of confirmed infections could capture different sections of the pyramid of cases shown above. The death rate among confirmed cases in Germany (less than half a per cent) is among the lowest in Europe, but is expected to rise as the mix of patients getting tested changes. Your prognosis also depends on the treatment that's available and whether the health service can deliver it. In turn, that depends on the stage of the epidemic. If a healthcare system gets swamped with cases and intensive care units can't treat people who need ventilation, then the death rate would go up. Social distancing has left some London landmarks empty Scientists combine individual pieces of evidence about each of these questions to build a picture of the death rate. For example, they estimate the proportion of cases with mild symptoms from small, defined groups of people who are monitored very tightly, like those on repatriated flights. But slightly different answers from these targeted pieces of evidence will add up to big changes in the overall picture. And the evidence will change over time. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, points out that death rates could go down as well as up. ""With Ebola, they came down over time as people got better at treating the disease"" but they can go up too: ""If a healthcare system is overrun, then we see death rates rising"". So scientists give a an upper and a lower figure, as well as a best current estimate. What is the coronavirus advice in the UK? Have you been affected by the coronavirus?

Thirteen coronavirus cases take UK total to 36,"Some people in the UK have begun wearing masks as the number of cases increases Twelve more people in England and one in Scotland have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of UK cases to 36. Scotland confirmed that its first patient was a Tayside residentwho recently returned from Italy. Three of the new cases in England were linked to a man from Surrey, who wasthe first to be infected within the UK. It comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK was still in the ""containment"" phase of the outbreak. He said the government contingency plans, which will be published this week, included banning big events. How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? How deadly is the coronavirus? 'I've been waiting four days for NHS 111 to call' The Scottish government confirmed its first case on Sunday evening. It said the patient was receiving treatment in isolation in hospital. Three of the new cases revealed on Sunday were close contacts of the man from Surrey, who was announced as testing positive on Friday. They included another person from Surrey and two people from West Sussex who were all ""part of an adult family cluster"", Public Health England said. Another new case from Essex had ""no relevant travel"" and it was unclear how they had contracted the virus. The remaining eight had visited affected areas - six to Italy, and two to Iran. They were from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, and included: One person from Bury, who had become infected in Italy. Two Leeds residents, who had both been in Iran One person from Bradford, who had travelled to Italy Someone from Gloucestershire - infected in northern Italy - who is linked to another case from the area announced on Saturday Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said all of the newly identified cases were being investigated and health officials had begun tracing anyone who had close contact with them. As of 09:00 GMT on Sunday, the Department of Health said a total of 11,750 people had been tested in the UK. The latest positive tests come afterthree more cases were confirmed in Englandon Saturday. One of those was a member of staff at St Mary's School in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, the primary school said on Sunday. That follows another school - Willow Bank Infant School in Woodley, Berkshire -confirming,externalthat one of its staff had been infected. This video can not be played Matt Hancock on isolating cities: ""We don't take anything off the table at this stage"" The government has said no tactics will be ""off the table""as part of its plan to contain the virus in the UK. Mr Hancock told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showan emergency ""battle plan"", drawn up for the ""worst case scenario"", includes banning big events, closing schools and dissuading people from using public transport. The health secretary said there were four phases to the plan: Containment- caring for any infected people and identifying their close contacts Delay- deciding what actions to take to slow down the spread Mitigation- damage limitation if the virus spreads widely Research- constant and ongoing work to inform the three other phases Currently, the UK is in the ""containment"" phase - which health leaders say may still be sufficient. But the next phase could see broader ""social distancing"" measures. Matt Hancock would have been warned there was a strong likelihood there would be a jump in cases when he did his interview for the Andrew Marr Show. A few hours later the biggest increase in a single day was announced, with 12 more people testing positive for the coronavirus. That's why he went further than before in setting out possible government plans to tackle an accelerated spread of the virus around the UK if that happens. School closures, cancellations of major public events and moves to persuade people to work at home are clearly options being actively considered. The strategy seems to be to warn that difficult measures may be needed while focusing on trying to contain the spread of the virus. As one government source put it, ""prepare for the worst, work for the best"". Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Hancock must give more detail of any emergency powers he wants to bring in so that MPs ""can properly scrutinise"" the plans. Meanwhile,Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has written to the health secretary,externalto urge him to make sure people are paid if they have to self-isolate, otherwise there could be ""devastating"" effects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday, visited Public Health England's centre in north London on Sunday to discuss attempts to limit the spread of the virus. He said the virus was ""likely to spread a bit more"" but he was ""very, very confident"" the NHS would be able to cope with an outbreak. Tourists at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel have been quarantined and tested for the virus More than 200 British holidaymakers locked down at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife have been told they will be allowed to fly home, if they test negative for the virus. The travellers have been quarantined at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel since Tuesday after four Italians contracted the virus. Some have already been allowed to leave but others are awaiting test results. The Foreign Office is in contact with operators and travel agents about their plans to return Britons to the UK.

About 3,000 people have died - the vast majority in China's Hubei province, where the outbreak originated in December. In other developments: The Foreign Office has announced some British Embassy staff are being withdrawn from Iran because of the outbreak in the country. Iran reported 385 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 978 so far. The death toll rose to 54 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has tested negative for the virus. The Foreign Office said he self-isolated after feeling unwell this week - and has returned to work since the test result A secondary school in Ireland is to close for 14 daysbecause the country's first confirmed case had been in contact with its pupils and teachers In Paris, theLouvre museum did not open on Sunday. The museum said on Twitter a meeting was being held on the public health situation and ""the museum cannot open at the moment"". Australia and Thailand recorded their first fatalities from the virus on Sunday. A 78-year-old Australian man died after being infected on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Thailand said the 35-year-old man who died of the virus had also been suffering from dengue fever The leader of a religious sect in South Korea - which is facing the worst outbreak outside China -could face a homicide investigationover some of the country's deaths.

UK vows to seek 'hard bargain' in US trade talks,"International Trade Secretary Liz Truss welcomed US trade representative Robert Lighthizer to London last week Boris Johnson has promised to ""drive a hard bargain"" as he set out the UK's negotiating position for a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US. The government said a deal would boost the UK economy by Â£3.4bn and particularly benefit Scotland, England's north-east and the Midlands. It pledged to maintain food standards and said the NHS would not be for sale. Meanwhile, talks between the UK and EU aimed at reaching a trade agreement formally kick off in Brussels later. Katya Adler: UK-EU trade talks will be tricky from the outset UK-EU trade talks: A simple guide UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The talks on a free trade agreement with the US are expected to begin later this month. The discussions will take place in both the UK and US and be overseen by the government's chief negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer - formerly New Zealand's chief negotiator and ambassador to the World Trade Organization. A government statement said manufacturers of ceramics, cars, food and drink would be ""the biggest winners"" from a deal, along with the professional services, including architects and lawyers. ""We're going to drive a hard bargain to boost British industry,"" said Mr Johnson. ""Trading Scottish smoked salmon for Stetson hats, we will deliver lower prices and more choice for our shoppers."" In what appears to be a bid to push back againstaccusations made by Labour during the electionthat the health service would be up for sale under the Conservatives, the government also said any future deal ""must protect our NHS"". International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Breakfast: ""We will not diminish our food safety standards and we will also not put the NHS on the table, or the price the NHS pays for drugs on the table."" ""Those are two very clear red lines in our trade deal."" Turning to the EU trade talks, Ms Truss attempted to address concerns over fishing rights - the EU is demanding continued access to British waters, while the UK wants quota deals like the EU has with Norway or Iceland. Ms Truss told BBC Breakfast: ""We are not going to trade away our fishing in a deal with the EU or any other negotiating partner. ""We are going to get a deal with the EU that does not involve selling out our fishing."" Confederation of British Industry director general Carolyn Fairbairn said it was ""encouraging to see the government's ambitions to make it easier for skilled people to move between the UK and US"" and ""support small business exporters"". Boris Johnson and Donald Trump met at a G7 summit in France in August But Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ""The government should be focused on getting a good trade deal with the EU - not cosying up to Donald Trump."" She said a bad trade deal with the US would ""put working people's jobs and rights on the line... and it will undermine our vital public services, environment and food standards"". Ms O'Grady referred to fears from farming leaders that an agreement could see the import of food that would be illegal to produce in the UK, such as chlorinated chicken. According to recent media reports, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. But the US has expressed frustration at the ban, arguing that it is not based on scientific evidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner accused the government of making ""false promises"" over commitments to protect the NHS and consumer standards, adding ""there must be a full and proper scrutiny process for this and all trade agreements"". The US is the UK's largest trading partner after the EU, accounting for nearly 19% of all exports in 2018 and 11% of imports. The EU accounted for 45% of all exports and 53% of imports. On Monday, a hundred British negotiators will travel to Brussels to start talks on a trade deal with the EU. The four days of discussions will be led by David Frost on the UK side and Michel Barnier for the EU, and there will be up to 11 different groups discussing different aspects of the deal. David Frost will lead the UK's negotiations in Brussels Potential flashpoints could include the UK's wish to diverge from EU employment and environmental standards in future, its ruling out of any role for the European Court of Justice, and the level of EU access to UK fishing waters. How do you negotiate a trade agreement? What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? The UK has signalled that it could walk away from trade talks in June unless there is a ""broad outline"" of a deal. French Europe Minister Amelie De Montchalin told the BBC that the EU was prepared to abort a post-Brexit deal if European fishermen were denied access to British waters. Details of what will be discussed and when have been published,,externalwith topics to be covered in the first round of negotiations including trade in goods and services, transport, energy, fisheries and ""fair and open competition"" in future dealings. Further rounds of negotiations will take place every two to three weeks, alternating between London and Brussels. Liberal Democrat acting leader Sir Ed Davey has called on the prime minister to pause trade talks with the EU and extend the Brexit transition period in order to focus on dealing with the coronavirus. Even trade buffs admit their area of expertise can be pretty dry and detail-heavy. And it would certainly suit the government if we all looked the other way during these negotiations because trade deals generally include trade-offs. On both sides. Neither Boris Johnson, nor his predecessor, Theresa May, have been wholly transparent about this with the UK public. So surely it is of interest to those who voted for Brexit, to keep a keen eye on whether the benefits they've been led to believe will be coming the UK's way for farmers, fishermen and slashing immigration numbers, will now materialise in the way they'd imagined. And what do both sides - the EU and Boris Johnson's government - want from a trade deal? Very different things. Read more about what the EU and UK both want from a trade deal.

Emergency meeting as UK coronavirus cases reach 36Official plan on tackling virus spread will be signed off at talks chaired by the prime minister.UK,"Widespread transmission of coronavirus in the UK is now ""highly likely"", Public Health England (PHE) has said. Medical Director Prof Paul Cosford said the country must be prepared. The prime minister was at a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee on Monday to finalise government plans, after the number of UK cases jumped to 36. Meanwhile, the EU has raised the coronavirus risk in member states to ""moderate to high"".

Last week concerns about the outbreak wiped more than $5tn from global stocks. But prices in Asiabegan to rise on Mondayafter Japan's central bank promised to take action to support the markets. The government has said its plan if the outbreak worsens could include asking newly-retired doctors and nurses to return to the NHS. People could also be urged to work from home - and closing schools and cancelling major public events have also not been ruled out. The government has also set up a ""war room"" in the Cabinet Office to roll out a public health campaign encouraging people to wash their hands for 20 seconds or more. On Sunday, 13 new cases were revealed: Three of them were close contacts of the man from Surrey, who was announced as testing positive on Friday. They included another person fromSurreyand two people fromWest Sussexwho were all ""part of an adult family cluster"", Public Health England said. Another new case fromEssexhad ""no relevant travel"" and it was unclear how they had contracted the virus. The remaining eight had visited affected areas - six to Italy, and two to Iran. They were fromLondon,West Yorkshire,Greater Manchester,HertfordshireandGloucestershire. Scotland recorded its first case - a patient from theTaysidearea who had recently travelled from Italy. On Saturday, three new cases were confirmed inGloucestershire,HertfordshireandBerkshire. One of those was a member of staff at St Mary's School in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, the primary school confirmed.  Another school - Willow Bank Infant School in Woodley, Berkshire - said one of its staff had been infected. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said his party ""broadly supported"" the government's aims. But he told the BBC he was concerned about the NHS's capacity to deal with the virus and urged the government to consider emergency funding. Meanwhile,Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has written to the health secretary,externalto urge him to make sure people are paid if they have to self-isolate. The GMB union has also called on NHS trusts to ensure that outsourced staff are given sick pay in suspected cases of Covid-19. It warned most private companies providing the NHS with cleaners, porters and caterers do not offer sick pay for the first three days.

On Monday, a man was sentenced to death by a Chinese court for fatally stabbing two officials at a virus checkpoint, news agency AFP reported. Ma Jianguo, 23, refused to co-operate with officials - though it is not clear what he was told to do - and stabbed two checkpoint officials. On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus appeared to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. It urged countries to stock up on ventilators, saying ""oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe Covid-19"". In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

Two thirds of UK homes 'fail on energy targets',"Experts say the UK needs to retrofit homes to make them energy efficient Nearly two thirds of UK homes fail to meet long-term energy efficiency targets, according to data analysed by the BBC. More than 12 million homes fall below the C grade on Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) graded from A-G. It means householders spend more on energy bills and pump tonnes more CO2 into the atmosphere than necessary. The government has said it needs to go ""much further and faster"" to improve the energy performance of homes. Experts say retrofit measures are needed because so many homes were built before the year 1990. Dr Tim Forman, a research academic at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Sustainable Development, said now only a national project of a scale not seen since World War Two, would be enough to help Great Britain meet its 2050 net zero carbon target,which was signed into law in June 2019. EPCs measure the efficiency of a house by looking at how well a property is insulated, glazed, or uses alternative measures to reduce energy use. Homes are given a grade between A and G. The closer to A, the more efficient the home, meaning it should have lower energy bills and a smaller carbon footprint. A grade G is at the other end of the scale. C is just above average. The governmenthad set a target,externalto upgrade as many homes to grade C by 2035 ""where practical, cost-effective and affordable"", and for all fuel poor households, and as many rented homes as possible, to reach the same standard by 2030. Critics, however, say moves towards achieving that have ""fallen off a cliff"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was investing ""over Â£6bn"" towards those upgrades and it was ""also exploring how to halve the cost of retrofitting properties and investing over Â£320m into helping heat homes with lower carbon alternatives, such as heat networks and heat pumps"". It highlighted that from April landlords cannot let a rental flat or house in a new tenancy or a renewal unless the property has a grade of E or higher. The 65.9 million tonnes of CO2 produced by the UK's homes in 2018, was more than that from power stations which generated our energy supply, according to annual greenhouse gas emissions data. ""We need to throw everything we have at it [energy efficiency],"" Dr Forman said. ""There's a desperate need to do something, not in 10-15 years, but now."" The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed the grades awarded to more than 19.6 million homes across the UK since their introduction in 2007. The local authorities across England and Wales with the highest average CO2 emissions per household were all rural areas. Similarly, the biggest domestic producers of CO2 in Scotland were in the islands and highlands. Peter Smith, from national fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said there was ""definitely a rural/urban split"" especially in areas not connected to the gas grid. ""They tend to live in the least energy efficient housing, which tends to be older and uses fuels like LPG or solid fuels,"" he said. ""At a high level...there needs to be a push to improve all homes, but to do this it needs to have the same infrastructure priority as HS2 or building a third runway [at Heathrow]."" ""Since 2012 it [tackling energy efficiency] has fallen off a cliff."" That decline has been blamed by some on theGreen Deal scheme. It came into force in 2012 but was axed three years later amid criticism it was too complicated and had been poorly implemented. Energy efficiency is a devolved issue and the ruling authorities in Scotland and Wales provide additional funding for measures including low-interest loans, for those with the ability to pay, and free measures to low-income households at risk of fuel poverty. Under new Welsh government plans announced earlier this year, every new home built there after 2025 will be only heated and powered by clean energy, and produce up to 80% less CO2. One suggestion to increase the pace of change could be to offer financial incentives for people to make improvements at significant ""trigger points"" in their lives such as when they moved home or had already planned other renovations, Jenny Hill, of independent advisory body Committee on Climate Change, said. Bigger borrowing powers for local authorities to spend on new social housing, could also drive the building of more energy-efficient housing across Great Britain, some experts suggest. One example isGoldsmith Street in Norwich, which won the Stirling Prize for architecture, and is built to the Passivhaus building standard. Goldsmith Street in Norwich has won plaudits It means the homes use new technologies to ensure low energy use, the windows are triple-glazed and the homes are positioned so the sun heats them in the winter and helps them stay cool in summer. Passivhaus buildings can, however, be around 8% more expensive to build than a traditional house, but they are intended to be more efficient and cheaper to run. Those standards can also be retrofitted to existing homes. Kim Ratcliffe lives on Erneley Close, in the Longsight area of Manchester, a former council estate retrofitted to Passivhaus standards five years ago. The 55-year-old mother-of-two said: ""In the past we had to use fan heaters because it was so cold and because we could not afford to put on the radiators. ""We would get through Â£12-Â£13 a day just to run the heaters. ""I have never had to put the heating on since it has been redone. The cladding at Erneley Close turns different colours in different lights ""The rent has gone up a little bit, but the heating bills are so much lower that it is still saving us money."" John Palmer, from the Passivhaus Trust which sets and administers the standard, said interest from councils and housing associations could influence change. ""Developers aren't interested in running costs, they build it and walk away. ""Local authorities and housing associations are. They have a vested interest in keeping running costs as low as possible for themselves or for tenants."" Depending on the age and nature of individual properties, the cost of retrofitting energy efficiency measures could range from Â£18,000 to Â£150,000, Dr Forman said. Jenny Hill said that while financial incentives were important, ""a robust legal standard"" would create ongoing demand for these measures. ""That is what gives the market confidence that demand will be there in the long term. It makes them willing to invest in jobs and skills,"" she said.

Asian stocks rise as central banks pledge support,"The global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned. The influential think tank has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November. But it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5%. It came after the Bank of England vowed to help stabilise markets, which suffered steep losses last week. Coronavirus is already forcing businesses to suspend operations in China and elsewhere as officials try to contain its spread. The OECD forecast the global economy could recover to 3.3% growth in 2021, assuming the epidemic peaked in China in the first quarter of this year and other outbreaks proved mild and contained. But it said the picture would be much worse if the virus spread throughout Asia, Europe and North America. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Coronavirus spread hits Chinese manufacturing Shares drop in worst week since financial crisis Why should I care if share prices fall? ""The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,"" said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist. Last week saw major stock markets suffer their worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with $1.5 trillion being wiped off the value of global shares. Investors now hope central banks around the world will work in unison to support financial markets as the deadly virus spreads. The Bank of England has promised to help stabilise markets On Monday, the Bank of England said it continued to monitor developments and was assessing its potential impact on the global and UK economies and financial systems. ""The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,"" a spokesman said. Japan's central bank and the US Federal Reserve have also said they are prepared to intervene to stop more big falls on global stock markets. Buoyed by the news, US stocks opened higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes both gaining 0.7%. London's FTSE 100 index closed 1.2% higher, while China's Shanghai Composite index gained 3.2% and Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, climbed 1%. On Monday, the privately-run Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed the fastest rate of contraction in China's factory activity since the survey was launched in 2004. That followed the release on Saturday of equally weak official numbers. Both sets of data come after employers across the country were ordered to remain closed after the annual Chinese New Year holiday as part of attempts by authorities to stem the spread of the virus. The falls, which were even worse than the slump seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, highlighted the outbreak's huge impact on the world's second-largest economy. There are limits to what traditional monetary policy can actually achieve if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. If supply chains are disrupted, and factories have to shut down, interest rate cuts are unlikely to help very much. Likewise, if people don't want to go to the shops, eat in restaurants, travel on planes or stay in hotels, cheap credit isn't going to make a lot of difference. And in many countries, interest rates are in any case already low. But the prospect of a rate cut does at least provide a psychological prop - and reduces the risk of the falls on the markets turning into a rout. The next step may be to look at ways of encouraging commercial banks to provide targeted support - for companies that are struggling with repayments on loans because their business has been affected by the outbreak, for example. That may be the kind of life-support that's really needed to keep firms operating until the worst of the crisis is over. The OECD said governments would have to step in if the virus worsened, providing extra support for their health systems and emergency loans for hard hit industries. ""A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,"" Mr Boone added. Over the weekend senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration also tried to soothe concerns about the impact of the outbreak, highlighting the US economy's underlying strength. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, said that the stock market ""will come back"", adding that ""the fundamentals of this economy are strong"".

They include Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a high-ranking adviser to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iranian media reported on Monday. Qatar, Ecuador, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Ireland were among countries that confirmed their first cases over the weekend. Ecuador on Monday reported five new cases of the disease, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to six. The US state of New York also confirmed its first case. The patient is a woman in her 30s who contracted the virus during a recent trip to Iran. Two people have died in the US,both in the state of Washington. China on Monday reported 42 more deaths, all in Hubei. The Chinese province was where the virus emerged late last year and it has registered more than 90% of the global fatalities. There were 202 confirmed new cases on Monday - only six of which were outside Hubei. A total of 2,912 people have died inside China, with more than 80,000 confirmed cases of the virus.

China's economy has taken a hit - with factory activity falling at a record rate. On Monday, a man was sentenced to death by a Chinese court for fatally stabbing two officials at a virus checkpoint, news agency AFP reported. Ma Jianguo, 23, refused to co-operate with officials - though it is not clear what he was told to do - and stabbed two checkpoint officials. On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus appeared to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. It urged countries to stock up on ventilators, saying ""oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe Covid-19"". In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

Shares slide as coronavirus raises recession fearsStock markets around the world have just seen their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.Business,"The global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned. The influential think tank has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November. But it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5%. It came after the Bank of England vowed to help stabilise markets, which suffered steep losses last week. Coronavirus is already forcing businesses to suspend operations in China and elsewhere as officials try to contain its spread. The OECD forecast the global economy could recover to 3.3% growth in 2021, assuming the epidemic peaked in China in the first quarter of this year and other outbreaks proved mild and contained. But it said the picture would be much worse if the virus spread throughout Asia, Europe and North America. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Coronavirus spread hits Chinese manufacturing Shares drop in worst week since financial crisis Why should I care if share prices fall? ""The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,"" said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist. Last week saw major stock markets suffer their worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with $1.5 trillion being wiped off the value of global shares. Investors now hope central banks around the world will work in unison to support financial markets as the deadly virus spreads. The Bank of England has promised to help stabilise markets On Monday, the Bank of England said it continued to monitor developments and was assessing its potential impact on the global and UK economies and financial systems. ""The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,"" a spokesman said. Japan's central bank and the US Federal Reserve have also said they are prepared to intervene to stop more big falls on global stock markets. Buoyed by the news, US stocks opened higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes both gaining 0.7%. London's FTSE 100 index closed 1.2% higher, while China's Shanghai Composite index gained 3.2% and Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, climbed 1%. On Monday, the privately-run Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed the fastest rate of contraction in China's factory activity since the survey was launched in 2004. That followed the release on Saturday of equally weak official numbers. Both sets of data come after employers across the country were ordered to remain closed after the annual Chinese New Year holiday as part of attempts by authorities to stem the spread of the virus. The falls, which were even worse than the slump seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, highlighted the outbreak's huge impact on the world's second-largest economy. There are limits to what traditional monetary policy can actually achieve if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. If supply chains are disrupted, and factories have to shut down, interest rate cuts are unlikely to help very much. Likewise, if people don't want to go to the shops, eat in restaurants, travel on planes or stay in hotels, cheap credit isn't going to make a lot of difference. And in many countries, interest rates are in any case already low. But the prospect of a rate cut does at least provide a psychological prop - and reduces the risk of the falls on the markets turning into a rout. The next step may be to look at ways of encouraging commercial banks to provide targeted support - for companies that are struggling with repayments on loans because their business has been affected by the outbreak, for example. That may be the kind of life-support that's really needed to keep firms operating until the worst of the crisis is over. The OECD said governments would have to step in if the virus worsened, providing extra support for their health systems and emergency loans for hard hit industries. ""A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,"" Mr Boone added. Over the weekend senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration also tried to soothe concerns about the impact of the outbreak, highlighting the US economy's underlying strength. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, said that the stock market ""will come back"", adding that ""the fundamentals of this economy are strong"".

S Korea religious leader faces coronavirus probe,"This video can not be played 'We're often persecuted': Spokesman for virus-hit S Korean church defends secrecy (March 2020) The leader of a religious sect in South Korea will be investigated over some of the country's coronavirus deaths. The city government of the capital Seoul has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji Church, and 11 others. They are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread. South Korea is battling the worst coronavirus outbreak outside China. The country has reported 3,730 cases and 21 deaths so far. More than half of all infections involve members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a fringe Christian group. Authorities say Shincheonji members infected one another in the southern city of Daegu last month, before fanning out around the country. This video can not be played Watch how germs spread and how you can prevent it One senior member, Kim Shin-chang, told the BBC's Laura Bicker that the church was ""very sorry for causing concern"". He admitted that some church members had been afraid to reveal their identities but said the church had now revealed all of its information, including all its locations and members. ""We were worried about releasing this kind of information because of the safety of our members, but we believe right now the most important thing is to fully cooperate with the government,"" he said. On Sunday the Seoul City government filed a legal complaint to prosecutors against 12 leaders of the sect. They are accused of homicide, causing harm and violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act. All 230,000 members of the church have been interviewed. Nearly 9,000 said they were showing symptoms of coronavirus. A 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive for the virus was among the first to be infected. She initially refused to be taken to a hospital to be tested and is known to have attended several church gatherings before testing positive. The sect's leader, Lee Man-hee, claims he is the Messiah. He has also been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results. Roman Catholic churches remain closed, major Protestant groups have cancelled Sunday services and all Buddhist events have been called off. Growing anger over the sect's handling of the outbreak has sparked a petition calling for the church to be disbanded. Nearly 1.2m people have signed it. This investigation has been sparked by Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon, who urged the Chief Prosecutor to detain the sect leader. He warned that he would request a criminal investigation for homicide by wilful negligence and, on Sunday evening, he filed the claim with the prosecutor's office. But this does not mean the church leaders will face murder charges. It means prosecutors will have to look into the case. Once prosecutors have finished their investigation they will decide which charges, if any, to bring against the sect. Lee Man-hee, 88, claims he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and identifies as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible. He founded the Shincheonji Church in 1984. In Korean, Shincheonji means ""new heaven and earth"". The group is considered a cult by many. Mr Lee's followers believe he will take 144,000 people to heaven with him. The church says it has more than 20,000 followers outside of South Korea including in China, Japan and areas of Southeast Asia. The group is known for packing its followers tightly together during services. Glasses, necklaces and earrings are reportedly banned from services.

A 78-year-old Australian man died after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan last month. Thailand, which has had 42 cases of the virus, said a 35-year-old man who died was also suffering from dengue fever. In Paris, the Louvre museum did not open on Sunday. The museum said on Twitter a meeting was being held on the public health situation and ""the museum cannot open at the moment"".

Two thirds of UK homes 'fail on energy targets'Evidence suggests improving housing is one of the most cost-effective ways to cut carbon emissions.UK,"Experts say the UK needs to retrofit homes to make them energy efficient Nearly two thirds of UK homes fail to meet long-term energy efficiency targets, according to data analysed by the BBC. More than 12 million homes fall below the C grade on Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) graded from A-G. It means householders spend more on energy bills and pump tonnes more CO2 into the atmosphere than necessary. The government has said it needs to go ""much further and faster"" to improve the energy performance of homes. Experts say retrofit measures are needed because so many homes were built before the year 1990. Dr Tim Forman, a research academic at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Sustainable Development, said now only a national project of a scale not seen since World War Two, would be enough to help Great Britain meet its 2050 net zero carbon target,which was signed into law in June 2019. EPCs measure the efficiency of a house by looking at how well a property is insulated, glazed, or uses alternative measures to reduce energy use. Homes are given a grade between A and G. The closer to A, the more efficient the home, meaning it should have lower energy bills and a smaller carbon footprint. A grade G is at the other end of the scale. C is just above average. The governmenthad set a target,externalto upgrade as many homes to grade C by 2035 ""where practical, cost-effective and affordable"", and for all fuel poor households, and as many rented homes as possible, to reach the same standard by 2030. Critics, however, say moves towards achieving that have ""fallen off a cliff"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was investing ""over Â£6bn"" towards those upgrades and it was ""also exploring how to halve the cost of retrofitting properties and investing over Â£320m into helping heat homes with lower carbon alternatives, such as heat networks and heat pumps"". It highlighted that from April landlords cannot let a rental flat or house in a new tenancy or a renewal unless the property has a grade of E or higher. The 65.9 million tonnes of CO2 produced by the UK's homes in 2018, was more than that from power stations which generated our energy supply, according to annual greenhouse gas emissions data. ""We need to throw everything we have at it [energy efficiency],"" Dr Forman said. ""There's a desperate need to do something, not in 10-15 years, but now."" The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed the grades awarded to more than 19.6 million homes across the UK since their introduction in 2007. The local authorities across England and Wales with the highest average CO2 emissions per household were all rural areas. Similarly, the biggest domestic producers of CO2 in Scotland were in the islands and highlands. Peter Smith, from national fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said there was ""definitely a rural/urban split"" especially in areas not connected to the gas grid. ""They tend to live in the least energy efficient housing, which tends to be older and uses fuels like LPG or solid fuels,"" he said. ""At a high level...there needs to be a push to improve all homes, but to do this it needs to have the same infrastructure priority as HS2 or building a third runway [at Heathrow]."" ""Since 2012 it [tackling energy efficiency] has fallen off a cliff."" That decline has been blamed by some on theGreen Deal scheme. It came into force in 2012 but was axed three years later amid criticism it was too complicated and had been poorly implemented. Energy efficiency is a devolved issue and the ruling authorities in Scotland and Wales provide additional funding for measures including low-interest loans, for those with the ability to pay, and free measures to low-income households at risk of fuel poverty. Under new Welsh government plans announced earlier this year, every new home built there after 2025 will be only heated and powered by clean energy, and produce up to 80% less CO2. One suggestion to increase the pace of change could be to offer financial incentives for people to make improvements at significant ""trigger points"" in their lives such as when they moved home or had already planned other renovations, Jenny Hill, of independent advisory body Committee on Climate Change, said. Bigger borrowing powers for local authorities to spend on new social housing, could also drive the building of more energy-efficient housing across Great Britain, some experts suggest. One example isGoldsmith Street in Norwich, which won the Stirling Prize for architecture, and is built to the Passivhaus building standard. Goldsmith Street in Norwich has won plaudits It means the homes use new technologies to ensure low energy use, the windows are triple-glazed and the homes are positioned so the sun heats them in the winter and helps them stay cool in summer. Passivhaus buildings can, however, be around 8% more expensive to build than a traditional house, but they are intended to be more efficient and cheaper to run. Those standards can also be retrofitted to existing homes. Kim Ratcliffe lives on Erneley Close, in the Longsight area of Manchester, a former council estate retrofitted to Passivhaus standards five years ago. The 55-year-old mother-of-two said: ""In the past we had to use fan heaters because it was so cold and because we could not afford to put on the radiators. ""We would get through Â£12-Â£13 a day just to run the heaters. ""I have never had to put the heating on since it has been redone. The cladding at Erneley Close turns different colours in different lights ""The rent has gone up a little bit, but the heating bills are so much lower that it is still saving us money."" John Palmer, from the Passivhaus Trust which sets and administers the standard, said interest from councils and housing associations could influence change. ""Developers aren't interested in running costs, they build it and walk away. ""Local authorities and housing associations are. They have a vested interest in keeping running costs as low as possible for themselves or for tenants."" Depending on the age and nature of individual properties, the cost of retrofitting energy efficiency measures could range from Â£18,000 to Â£150,000, Dr Forman said. Jenny Hill said that while financial incentives were important, ""a robust legal standard"" would create ongoing demand for these measures. ""That is what gives the market confidence that demand will be there in the long term. It makes them willing to invest in jobs and skills,"" she said.
