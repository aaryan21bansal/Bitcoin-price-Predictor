VAT cut to be extended for bars and restaurants,"The chancellor has announced the extension of a VAT cut for the hospitality and tourism sectors - some of the worst-hit by the pandemic. Rishi Sunak said that the temporary reduction of VAT rates from 20% to 5% would remain in place until 31 March 2021, rather than 13 January. The measure would ""help protect 2.4 million jobs through the winter"", he said. But industry figures said that they were ""still not out of the woods"". Restaurants and pubs in particular were affected by lockdown measures, and thousands of jobs in the sector have already been lost. The temporary VAT cut first came into force in July and was designed to help hotels, restaurants, cafes and pubs to shore up their finances. Some firms, however, such as KFC, Nando's and Pret, decided to pass on the savings directly to customers by cutting prices in their outlets. The chancellor said on Thursday that the extension to the VAT cut would help ""support more than 150,000 businesses"" through the winter period. The cut applies to food and non-alcoholic drinks, accommodation and admission to tourist attractions across the UK,according to the Treasury's Winter Economy Plan.,external In a press conference on Thursday, the chancellor said that the extension would cost the Treasury Â£800m - on top of the previous estimate of Â£2.5bn. Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. Read more about VAT. The chief executive of trade association UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said that the cut provided some good news for the sector after it was announced that pubs and restaurants in England must now close at 22:00 BST. ""The announcement of further restrictions was a significant hammer blow that will inevitably depress trading,"" she said. Curfew could be 'fatal blow' to some pubs and bars How are pubs keeping customers safe? 'Another lockdown would be disastrous for our business' ""It was crucial that the chancellor delivered support today that specifically targeted the hospitality sector which has been hit harder than any. ""The chancellor has given us some reason to be positive again but we urge him to engage with the trade on specific measures to keep people in work. ""While some of these measures announced today will give businesses a future to shoot for and hope that they can begin to rebuild, we are still not out of the woods."" In an attempt to boost consumer demand, Mr Sunak introduced the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August as restaurants and cafes gradually reopened over the summer. Many restaurants took part in the chancellor's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August Under the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Earlier in September, the Treasury saidthat more than 100 million meals had been claimed under the scheme, which saw restaurant bookings surge. But Will Hawkley, UK head of leisure at KPMG, labelled the scheme ""a distant memory"", with the government's job retention scheme winding down and the number of coronavirus cases rising in the UK. ""The leisure and tourism industry has understandably been feeling uneasy, if not left questioning its survival prospects,"" he said. ""While the chancellor may have demonstrated that the sector's woes haven't been overlooked, most businesses are likely to conclude that the extension of the VAT cut and the latest job support measures don't go far enough. ""Sadly not all operators will be able to survive and further job losses will be inevitable without further government support."" Many firms have been forced to make job cuts due to the impact the pandemic has had on trade overall. On Tuesday, Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn and Beefeater,warned that 6,000 staffcould lose their jobs after guest numbers had slumped. Last month,Pizza Express warned 1,100 peoplecould lose their jobs under its planned restructuring which will see the closure of 73 outlets.. In June, The Restaurant Group - which owns Frankie and Benny's -said it was cutting up to 3,000 jobs. âAnother lockdown would be disastrous for our businessâ 'Closing pubs at 10pm halves your takings' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Will the chancellor's plan to save jobs work?,"The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Rishi Sunak unveils emergency jobs scheme Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance VAT cut to be extended for hospitality sector It will be possible to claim the coronavirus job retention bonus for reemploying furloughed workers, too. It has been tailored for the UK's more flexible jobs market. The chancellor has kept a careful eye on schemes from all around the world. But the size of the scheme also reflects the phenomenal amount of borrowing that the government has done, and will continue to have to do, in terms of lost tax revenue as the recovery is subdued by ongoing restrictions. Funding conditions for government remain benign. But the Treasury is keeping an eye on how sensitive the public finances are now to even a small increase in market interest rates. The Treasury has extended the bridge of support it put in place in March to cover the next six months. But the new scheme requires everybody to chip in. That will be too much for many employers. We are about to find out just how many.

How will I be paid on the Jobs Support Scheme?What help are self-employed people getting?Why can't I download the new contact tracing app? And other questionsHow does Covid-19 test-and-trace work?Which countries are on the UK's quarantine list?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

What help are self-employed people getting?Why can't I download the new contact tracing app? And other questionsHow does Covid-19 test-and-trace work?Which countries are on the UK's quarantine list?,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

Why can't I download the new contact tracing app? And other questionsHow does Covid-19 test-and-trace work?Which countries are on the UK's quarantine list?,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work?Which countries are on the UK's quarantine list?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance VAT cut to be extended for hospitality sector Will the chancellor's plan to save jobs work? Under the Job Support Scheme, if bosses bring back workers part time, the government will help top up their wages with employers to at least three-quarters of their full-time pay. It will begin on 1 November and last for six months. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise the pay of employees who are working fewer than their normal hours due to lower demand. Employers will pay for the hours actually worked. And then the government and the employer will between them cover two-thirds of the lost wages. But only staff who can work at least a third of their normal hours will be eligible for the scheme. The payment will be based on an employee's normal salary, with the government contribution capped at Â£697.92 per month. Mr Sunak described the scheme as a ""radical new policy"", designed ""to help protect as many jobs as possible [and] keep people in part-time work rather than laying them off"". However, he said it would only support ""viable jobs"" - as opposed to jobs that exist because the government is continuing to subsidise the wages. ""It's not for me to sit here and make pronouncements upon exactly what job is viable or not but what we do need to do is evolve our support now that we're through the acute phase of the crisis,"" Mr Sunak said at a press conference after the scheme was unveiled. ""We obviously can't sustain the same level of things that we were doing at the beginning of this crisis."" The BBC understands that the Treasury is estimating that anywhere between two and five million people could be covered by the new Jobs Support Scheme. However, the chancellor told a press conference that he would be ""lying"" if he tried to give precise numbers but he said that some forecasts for unemployment ""don't make for good reading"". Nearly three million workers - or 12% of the UK's workforce - are currently on partial or full furlough leave, according to official figures. The current furlough scheme ends on 31 October. The government's contribution to workers' pay will fall sharply compared with the furlough scheme. Under furlough, it initially paid 80% of a monthly wage up to Â£2,500 - under the new scheme this will drop to 22%. ""The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people's jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I cannot save every business, I cannot save every job."" The scheme will cost the government an estimated Â£300m a month. Companies who use it can also still claim the Job Retention Bonus, where the government pays Â£1,000 for every furloughed employee who comes back to work until at least the end of January. Mr Sunak said a similar scheme for the self-employed would be available. All small and medium-sized businesses will be eligible for the scheme but larger business will only qualify if their turnover has fallen during the crisis. It will run for six months starting in November and be open to employers across the UK even if they have not previously used the furlough scheme. Employees must be in ''viable jobs"" to benefit from the scheme. Those in industries currently closed - such as nightclubs - may lose out as there isn't any work. Gavin McQueen, the manager of Pryzm in Leeds, sits in the club, which has not reopened since the UK went into lockdown in March Business lobby group the CBI welcomed the government's plan. ""It is right to target help on jobs with a future, but can only be part-time while demand remains flat. This is how skills and jobs can be preserved to enable a fast recovery,"" said CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. However, Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said that the new jobs scheme on its own ""will not encourage firms to cut hours rather than jobs because the one-third employer contribution means it is much cheaper for firms to employ one person full-time than two people part-time"". He warned that the Â£1,000 Job Retention Bonus firms would receive for retaining workers at the end of January, combined with the new scheme could create a new ""cliff-edge"" for job cuts. ""We've now got a big incentive for firms to retain workers part-time until you qualify for the bonus."" Labour, meanwhile, said it would support any measures to safeguard jobs but accused the government of acting too late. Tracey Sheppard is a cleaner at a leisure centre in Essex who has been on furlough since the end of March. She said she hoped the new Jobs Support Scheme will help her, but there are no guarantees. ""They're a very big company that I work for â¦ but I don't know whether they'd be able to afford to keep me onâ¦ I just don't know,"" she told the BBC's World At One. She said she feels ""frightened"" because her family only recently moved to the area and this is the only job she can fit in around childcare. ""I've just heard nothing [from my employer]. The last time I heard from them was the beginning of lockdown."" A cut in VAT for hospitality and tourism companies will also be extended until March. The cut from 20% to 5% VAT - which came into force on 15 July - had been due to expire on 12 January next year. However, the Food and Drink Federation said this and the new jobs plan did ""not go far enough"" in helping the industry which has been hit by the government's new restrictions to stop coronavirus cases from rising. Mr Sunak also announced that businesses that have borrowed money through the government's loan scheme would be given more time to repay the money. The chancellor said that small businesses who took out ""Bounce Back"" loans can use a new ""Pay as You Grow"" flexible repayment system. It means borrowings can be repaid over 10 years instead of the original six-year term. The longer repayment time also applied to small and medium-sized firms who borrowed under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. Businesses will also have more time to apply for these loans, as well as the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Future Fund. Application dates for the various schemes had been due to end in October and November. The new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The Treasury has extended the bridge of support it put in place in March to cover the next six months. But the new scheme requires everybody to chip in. That will be too much for many employers.

Students in Scotland told not to go to pubs,"Students in Glasgow have been getting tests after an outbreak Students in Scotland are being told not to go to pubs, parties or restaurants this weekend in a bid to stem a spate of coronavirus outbreaks. Hundreds of university students have tested positive at campuses across the country, with many more self-isolating. Universities have now pledged to make it ""absolutely clear"" to students that there must be no parties. And they will not be allowed to socialise with anyone outside of their accommodation. Students have also been warned that any breaches of the new rules ""will not be tolerated"". Thestricter guidelines,externalwere announced after opposition leaders accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of a ""basic failure"" to anticipate the problem and provide more testing on university campuses. However they have been criticised by the National Union of Students Scotland as ""unjustified""and ""deeply concerning"". President Matt Crilly said it was especially concerning for students who relied on income from hospitality jobs, and showed ""complete disregard"" for their mental health and wellbeing. Mary Senior, of the University and College Union, said she was ""absolutely astounded"" by the announcement, saying the outbreaks were ""inevitable"". Speaking on BBCGood Morning Scotlandshe questioned the motives of universities in bringing students back to campus, pointing out that student accommodation ""provides important commercial income for universities"" and ""cross subsidies teaching"". Meanwhile the Children and Young People's Commissioner Scotland has raisedconcerns about the ""human rights implications"",externalof the restrictions. Self-isolation: PPE to pee and running out of food What do campus outbreaks mean for students? University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' Universities Scotland said the new guidance that had been agreed with the Scottish government was a ""necessary step at this crucial moment of managing the virus in the student population, to protect students and the wider community"". The new rules state that all universities will ""make absolutely clear to students that there must be no parties, and no socialising outside their households"". They go on to say: ""This weekend, the first of the new tighter Scottish government guidance, we will require students to avoid all socialising outside of their households and outside of their accommodation. ""We will ask them not to go to bars or other hospitality venues."" Extra staff will be brought into student accommodation to watch for any breaches of the guidance and to support students who are self-isolating. LaterUniversities Scotland denied the move amounted to a ban,externalbut admitted it was a ""big ask"". And Nicola Sturgeon clarified,externalthat the rules about avoiding hospitality applied only to this weekend. One Glasgow University student, Elise, told BBC Scotland that she was angry at the new rules imposing strict restrictions on their social lives. The first-year student is currently isolating at Murano Street halls, after one of her flatmates tested positive. She described the new restrictions as ""quite ridiculous"" and said it was wrong to pin the blame on students for spreading the virus. She asked why the university told them to move into the halls when they could have followed their online courses from home. ""We were told to come to university halls - 48 people from across the country in one building- it was inevitable that it was going to spread,"" she said. ""We are getting punished for just living here but we were told to come. ""There's no reason for us to be here because everything is online."" Another student at the Murano halls asked how the requirement not to go to pubs was going to be policed. ""Will there be officers going up to students and asking if they are students? ""We are isolating so we won't be going to pubs anyway but what about those students who are fine? It's a depressing and bleak situation."" Police Scotland will also be monitoring student behaviour off-campus and in private accommodation. And private providers of student accommodation will also be urged to strictly enforce the guidance. Students will also be required to download the Protect Scotland app. The guidance warns: ""We will take a strict 'Yellow Card/Red Card' approach to breaches of student discipline that put students and others at risk. ""While we first want to advise students about breaches of discipline, we will not hesitate to escalate this to disciplinary action including potential discontinuation of study."" In aTwitter message directed at students,external, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was sorry Covid was ""making this special time of your lives so tough"". ""But it won't be forever and the more we get this virus back under control now, the sooner you'll get a bit of normality back,"" she said. Several universities across the country are dealing with major outbreaks of the virus, with many students in halls of residence in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh all being told to self-isolate. A total of 172 Glasgow University students have so far tested positive, with 600 in isolation, while all 500 residents at the Parker House halls in Dundeehave been told to quarantine. And 120 cases have been identified in an outbreak at Edinburgh Napier University. Opposition parties have argued that the Scottish government should have been better prepared for outbreaks when university students returned for the new term. Ms Sturgeon has said the number of positive cases at universities was likely to increase, but claimed this showed that the test and protect system ""is working, and we must continue to have confidence in that"". She urged students to follow the latest guidance and said she was sorry that the pandemic was ""making this special time of your lives so tough"". Life for university students was already very different this term. Most students were already set to learn mostly online, but the university experience is a social one as much as an academic one. Perhaps the most significant move is to appeal to students not to visit bar or hospitality venues. Ultimately students who break the rules on campus or in university accommodation face expulsion. However, universities know they also have to appeal to the individual's sense of responsibility and common sense. It will still be a big ask. Homesick students won't usually be able to go back inside the family home they lived in until a few weeks ago. Starting university can be a difficult experience - a student may not like their course or may find it hard to live away from home or make new friends. This year it will be even tougher so for that reason, it will be more important than ever to consider the wellbeing and mental health of students. Are you a student in Scotland?

Cardiff 'could go into local lockdown',"Cardiff has seen 38.2 cases per 100,000 people in the past week Wales' capital city is facing a local lockdown as coronavirus cases rise ""rapidly"". Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas has warned of potential restrictions on travel and different households mixing. He told a virtual meeting of the authority that over the past seven days, the area has seen 38.2 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Thomas said the city was on the verge of entering the Welsh Government's ""red zone"". He said if that was to happen ""then I fully expect that we will be implementing further restrictions as we have seen elsewhere"" in south Wales. Urdd Eisteddfod 2021 'at risk' UK sees highest Covid cases since mass tests began Cardiff is home to 366,903 people and would be the seventh area to have tighter restrictions imposed. People living in Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport cannot leave their areas without a reasonable excuse. Should Cardiff follow them into lockdown, it would mean more than a 1.2 million people - about a third of Wales' population - would be under tighter restrictions than the rest of the country. Conservative councillor Jayne Cowan asked Mr Thomas if Cardiff would be put into a local lockdown in the next 48 hours. He replied: ""We'll look at the numbers again in the morning and make a decision based on that."" It comes asCaerphilly's lockdown has been confirmedfor at least a further seven days. Mr Thomas said restrictions could be introduced ""at speed"" and could include a ban on households meeting or travel outside of Cardiff. The council leader said the coronavirus test positivity rate stood at 3.8%, which exceeds the government's amber threshold of 2.5%. There has been a sharp rise in hospital emergency attendance in the past week, he added, with the spread of infection ""most frequently found within household settings"". ""Our test trace and protect data suggests this is particularly in cases where family bubble rules have been breached, and also where people are mixing in indoor home settings and not following the rule of six,"" he said. ""The truth is that indoor mixing with people not in extended households in homes, cafes, bars and restaurants is happening far too frequently."" Cardiff city centre at the end of July Mr Thomas said there had been a significant rise in those aged 35 to 50 testing positive. Any new restrictions would need to be introduced by the Welsh Government. Mr Thomas said he met First Minister Mark Drakeford and Health Minister Vaughan Gething prior to Thursday night's council meeting. The threshold for foreign countries to be added to the list of destinations where people need to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in the UK is 20 cases per 100,000. Cardiff councillor Jayne Cowan told BBC Radio Wales a local lockdown was ""inevitable"" but feared the impact on businesses. ""Many businesses won't survive another lockdown,"" she said. ""We're seeing many thousands of cases of people having livelihoods stripped away. As part of the first lockdown, I was made redundant from my part time job. ""The Welsh Government needs to come up with the goods."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman, Andrew RT Davies, tweeted that a ""it's incumbent on the Welsh Labour government to bring forward a package of financial support for the many businesses (particularly hospitality) that will be devastated by the news"". He said a blanket lockdown of the city ""really isn't local"". Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru health spokesman, said: ""Shutting pubs slightly earlier isn't going to be enough - the Welsh Government must think of a suite of new steps, which are perhaps stricter but for a shorter period, in order to control these new spikes.""

Michael Kiwanuka wins the 2020 Mercury Prize,"This video can not be played Michael Kiwanuka said he was ""so excited"" to win the Mercury Prize Singer-songwriter Michael Kiwanuka has won the 2020 Mercury Prize for his soul-searching third record, Kiwanuka. A lush, immersive album of politicised soul, it sees the star exploring themes of self-doubt, faith and civil rights. Released last November, Kiwanuka beat best-sellers like Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia and Stormzy's Heavy Is The Head to win the Â£25,000 prize. ""It's blown my mind,"" said the singer. ""Music is all I've ever wanted to do, so I'm over the moon."" Kiwanuka won on his third attempt, having been nominated for each of his previous albums: 2012's Home Again and 2016's Love & Hate. ""I was kind of resigned to the fact [that] if I don't win one this year, probably I'll never win one,"" he told BBC 6 Music. Michael Kiwanuka interview: 'I am not an imposter' Mercury Prize 2020: As-it-happened Kiwanuka's victory was revealed by Radio 1's Annie Mac on The One Show, after Covid-19 restrictions made the traditional award ceremony impossible. The DJ, who was on the judging panel alongside the likes of Jamie Cullum and Jorja Smith, said it had been a ""unanimous"" decision. ""I don't think any of the judges walked away unhappy,"" she said. ""Everyone felt the same thing about this album, which is that it thoroughly deserved to win the prize."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Kiwanuka, whose Ugandan parents escaped Idi Amin's regime to settle in Muswell Hill, London, is a former session musician who dropped out of the Royal Academy of Music to become a solo artist. He first came to attention after supporting Adele on her 2011 tour andwinning the BBC's Sound of 2012. He released his debut album, Home Again, later that year. The musician cemented his reputation with 2016's Love & Hate, which made him a star in the US when the opening song,Cold Little Heart,external, became the theme tune to the TV series Big Little Lies. The self-titled album has given Kiwanuka his third Mercury Prize nomination and first win Despite his success, his latest album emerged from a period of crippling self-doubt. ""I've always had imposter syndrome,"" he told the BBC last year. ""I was always waiting for someone to find me out. ""But about a year and a half ago, I got tired of that way of thinking. I just went, 'This isn't helping anyone, least of all me.'"" The result was Kiwanuka's opening track, You Ain't The Problem, on which the musician vows to stop getting in his own way, singing: ""I used to hate myself / You got the key / Break out the prison.""

The record continues as a song cycle where Kiwanuka's own experiences and fears are interwoven with samples of civil rights campaigners and reflections on racial politics. On the psych-rock soliloquy Hero, he compares the murder of 1960s Black Panther activist Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings. Exasperated, he turns to God for answers on the call-and-response coda ofI've Been Dazed,external. Everything you need to know about the Mercury nominees Pop star 'not British enough' for Mercury prize Released last November, the album earned rave reviews and reached number two in the UK charts. It is the latest album reflecting the experiences of young black Britons to be chosen by Mercury judges. Kiwanuka is the fifth black male solo artist to win the award in the past six years. Rapper Dave won for Psychodrama last year. The musician was the bookies' favourite to win, followed by Laura Marling, who has now been passed over four times. Announcing the winner on The One Show will undoubtedly gave Kiwanuka's record extra exposure. The prime-time BBC One programme regularly attracts three million viewers, compared with the 155,000 who tuned in to last year's final on BBC Four. Mac explained that Kiwanuka had been informed of the result before the show, so that he could be invited to the studio. However, she shared a video of the moment she ambushed him with the news, as he was on his way to be interviewed by Jools Holland. Allow Twitter content?

Baftas to add nominees after diversity row,"Renee Zellweger and Joaquin Phoenix won the top acting prizes at the 2020 Bafta Film Awards The Bafta Film Awards will have more nominees next year in an attempt to increase the diversity of the stars and film-makers who are up for honours. All four acting categories as well as the best director award will have six nominees, instead of the usual five. Ten titles will be in contention for the outstanding British film award - four more than the customary six. Earlier this year, Bafta was heavily criticised after picking an all-white line-up of acting nominees. Meanwhile, no female film-makers were nominated for the best director prize for the seventh year running. Organisers carried out a ""detailed review"" as a result, and said they would now also seek to ""meaningfully target"" 1,000 new voting members from under-represented groups. The move, they said, was one in a series of steps ""to ensure a more representative and inclusive membership that reflects today's British society"". Director Andrew Onwubolu, aka Rapman, on the set of Blue Story In January, Blue Story director Rapman was among Bafta's many critics, saying it had done his gritty urban drama ""dirty"" by not shortlisting it for any awards. Bafta said the review had begun as ""a direct response"" to the lack of diversity in its 2020 nominations, but had ""soon expanded to encompass all aspects"" of the organisation. Baftas 'reviews' voting process amid diversity row Oscars set out best picture diversity targets Bafta - the British Academy of Film and Television Arts - said the expansion of its outstanding British film award would enable it to ""do more to champion the vast pool of multicultural British talent"". ""One of the key issues raised time and time again... was that too much deserving work was not being seen,"" said film committee chair Marc Samuelson. ""The changes we are implementing are designed to ensure these films are seen and judged on merit alone."" Changes to campaigning rules will seek to ensure ""a fairer consideration of all films regardless of marketing budget"". Bafta said this would ensure ""smaller"" films were not ""left out of the conversation"" and would have as much ""visibility"" as titles backed by major studios. Changes to Bafta's voting practices will ensure the best director jury will have a guaranteed number of female film-makers to choose from. The final six nominees will be drawn from an expanded longlist of 20 names, half of which will be female. Bafta said this would help to address ""a historic lack of female representation in the directing category"". Kathryn Bigelow, pictured with Clive Owen in 2010, is the only female winner of the best director Bafta Only five women have ever made the shortlist for the best director award, which Bafta first presented in 1969. Kathryn Bigelow, the only woman to win, for The Hurt Locker in 2010, was also the last woman to be shortlisted when she was nominated in 2013 for Zero Dark Thirty. All voting members will also now be required to take a ""specially designed bespoke"" course in ""conscious voter training"". Bafta said that would help its members ""navigate and recognise the wider societal influences that can impact the voting process"". Krishnendu Majumdar is the first Bafta chair from a BAME background In the case of the overall best film award, all voters will be required to watch all 15 movies on the longlist. The shortlist will continue to consist of five films. Bafta's review was led by its chair Krishnendu Majumdar, Samuelson and a steering group that included former Doctor Who actor Noel Clarke, academic Sadia Habib and ITV's head of diversity Ade Rawcliffe. Mr Majumdar praised them for ""bravely sharing their experiences of racism and discrimination"" during ""tough, chastening [and] captivating"" sessions. Noel Clarke played Mickey Smith in Doctor Who and has directed several films ""This is a watershed moment for Bafta,"" the TV producer said in a statement.

Amazon unveils flying Ring security drone,"The Always Home Cam covers up its camera when not in flight Amazon's smart home security division Ring has unveiled a flying camera that launches if sensors detect a potential home break-in. It is designed to activate only when residents are out, works indoors, and is limited to one floor of a building. The firm also unveiled an online games-streaming service and a voice-activated screen that swivels about. But one campaign group described the drone camera as Amazon's ""most chilling home surveillance product"" yet. ""It's difficult to imagine why Amazon thinks anyone wants flying internet cameras linked up to a data-gathering company in the privacy of their own home,"" said Silkie Carlo from Big Brother Watch. ""It's important to acknowledge the influence that Amazon's product development is having on communities and the growing surveillance market."" When the Always Home Cam is triggered by a suspected break-in, owners will get a smartphone alert to let them see live footage. Amazon said that privacy had been ""top of mind"" when the machine was designed. ""It only reports when it's in motion, and when it's not in motion it actually sits in a dock where it's physically blocked from even being able to report,"" explained Leila Rouhi, president of Ring. ""In addition to that, it's built to be loud, so it's really privacy that you can hear."" The drone's rotor blades are inside a cage, which could help protect pets The device is set to cost $250 (Â£192) when it goes on sale. At launch, it will only be available in the US. ""The Always Home Cam is an incredibly ambitious device that will seem like something from a science fiction movie for many consumers,"" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""I expect it to generate a huge amount of interest from technology enthusiasts who are typically the people who embrace smart home technology first. However, it is also likely to provoke a huge discussion around privacy and the future role of technology in the home."" The Ring division also unveiled a new security camera designed for use in a car, which monitors for nearby activity when the vehicle is parked. It can also start recording video if a driver is pulled over while on a journey, potentially allowing them to record an interaction with the police. Ring's business has previously been criticised because it has encouraged users to share their recordings with the authorities. This has prompted claims that it is normalising surveillance technologies that can intrude on people's lives. The division claims its existing products - including video doorbells, indoor video cameras, and smart alarm systems - have helped make neighbourhoods safer. Global consumer spending on smart home products is expected to fall about 15% this year to $44bn (Â£24.5bn) due to the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,according to market research firm Strategy Analytics,external. But it predicts a rebound in 2021. Amazon's rivals have previously accused it of anti-competitive behaviour by selling its products at a lower price than they cost to make, in order to secure market share. When questioned about sales of the firm's Echo speakers in July, chief executive Jeff Bezos said the firm did not lose money on the range when they were sold at ""list price"", but acknowledged they were often on promotion at a lower cost. Amazon's other big announcement was the launch of its long-rumoured cloud-based games-streaming service. Luna will run games on remote computer servers so that players do not need to buy a console or other dedicated devices beyond a controller. Its Luna+ channel will offer access to a selection of older games such as Control, Resident Evil: Biohazard, Sonic Mania and Metro: Exodus for $6 a month. Many gamers may be more interested in the forthcoming ""Ubisoft channel"", which will include the publisher's next Assassin's Creed game among other blockbuster releases. The monthly cost of the Ubisoft channel has yet to be disclosed. The Luna Controller will cost extra on top of the service's subscription fee At launch, Luna will work with Amazon's own Fire TV dongles, Windows and MacOS computers, as well as on iPhones and iPads via the web browser. Support for iPhones and iPads is notable as Apple has restricted other high-profile games-streaming services that did not obey its App Store rules. Luna will compete with Google Stadia, which launched about a year ago and has struggled to establish itself in a busy marketplace. Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Now, Apple Arcade and EA Play are among other subscription services competing for players' money and attention. The Luna controller connects directly to the wi-fi However, Amazon has the advantage of owning the hugely popular Twitch platform, where people watch each other play. This could help it promote Luna. ""Amazon is allowing third-party channels on Luna, but at an additional cost to the user,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis. He added that this was the opposite strategy to Microsoft, which had recently revealed it was bundling EA Play with the ultimate edition of its Xbox Game Pass without raising its price. ""Amazon's approach is commercially more sustainable and flexible,"" Mr Harding-Rolls concluded. Usersin parts of the US,externalare the only ones able to sign up for ""early access"" at this time. It is easy to forget how quickly drone technology has developed. Always Home Cam is straight out of a 1980s science-fiction movie. But this is 2020, and the technology for flying security drones is here. The Always Home Cam (l) is launched from a dock and streams live video to a smartphone For years, Amazon has been using drones to try to speed up its delivery network. And in the past, its patents have suggested thesecould also provide a surveillance service. But using drones for security inside the home is a new development. There are general worries that this is the thin end of a wedge. Future products might include Ring drones that operate around your house at times other than a suspected burglary - maybe there will even be guard drones in the future. Other announcements during Amazon's virtual event included a revamp for the firm's Echo and smaller Echo Dot smart speakers, which now come in spherical designs. The devices can now recognise when a child is speaking to them and adapt their responses accordingly - for example selecting ""kid-friendly"" songs when asked to play music. The new Amazon Echo is spherical and covered in cloth The firm said that a new computer chip inside would allow more artificial intelligence-related tasks to be processed locally, meaning responses to commands and questions could be given more quickly. Amazon also launched a new version of its Echo Show 10 smart screen, which can now rotate to stay facing its users as they move about. In addition, the built-in camera has been upgraded to a 13-megapixel component to allow it to digitally zoom in and track users. This should help the machine keep the owner in view during a video chat, and mirrors the capabilities of Facebook's rival Portal product. The device will also add support for Zoom video calls and Netflix, as well as retaining Amazon's proprietary services and Skype. The Echo Show 10 can swivel and face the person who is speaking to it Amazon added that Alexa's voice would soon sound more natural, by adding pauses for Alexa to take a ""breath"". And it said the virtual assistant would soon become better at recognising when customers were talking to it and when they were talking to each other, after it had been activated by a wake word. This should help it avoid responding to speech that is not directed at it. Amazon Echo is forecast to have 11.6 million smart speaker users in the UK by the end of 2020, according to research firm eMarketer. By contrast, it says the nearest competitor Google Home would have 3.7 million. Other new products announced included: an updated range of Eero hubs, which extend a property's broadband connection via a ""mesh network"" and now use the new Wi-Fi 6 standard for faster data speeds a Fire TV stick that provides HDR (high dynamic range) video and Dolby Atmos sound, if the user has a compatible screen and audio system Alexa Care Hub, a service that allows people to monitor an elderly relative's interactions with an Echo device, and contacts the younger party if the older one says ""Alexa, call for help"" 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Morrisons limits sales of 'key items',"Limits are being applied to certain products to prevent panic buying at Morrisons supermarkets Shoppers at Morrisons face restrictions on the number of items they can purchase to prevent panic buying. The supermarket chain has put a limit of three items per customer on some ranges, including toilet rolls and disinfectant products. It said stock levels ""were good"", but the firm wanted to ""make sure they were available for everyone"". The British Retail Consortium said supply chains were ""stronger than ever"". Bradford-based Morrisons said restrictions would be sign-posted on shelf edges at tills. A spokeswoman said: ""We have some products with limits on all year round such as paracetamol and so it works in just the same way."" Shelves at some stores were left depleted recently after the Government warned of rising coronavirus cases across the UK and the possibility of stricter lockdown measures. More stories across Yorkshire The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged consumers to be considerate of others and ""shop as you normally would"". Despite scenes at some stores, supermarket giants Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Aldi said they had ""good availability"" earlier in the week and had not experienced any shortages yet. Tesco added its online capacity had more than doubled from 600,000 weekly delivery slots in March to 1.5 million in September. Director of food and sustainability at the BRC, Andrew Opie, said: ""Supply chains are stronger than ever before and we do not anticipate any issues in the availability of food or other goods under a future lockdown. ""Nonetheless, we urge consumers to be considerate of others and shop as they normally would."" Asda is to enforce the rules on face coverings during the pandemic and deploy 'safety marshals' at its stores Meanwhile, Asda is set to enforce rules on face coverings more strictly across its shops amid the pandemic. Customers who do not have a covering when they enter a store will be offered a pack of disposable masks that they can pay for at the end of their trip. The firm announced on Wednesday that it will create 1,000 new ""safety marshal"" roles across its 639 UK stores.

UK can be 'Saudi Arabia of wind power' - PM,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to make a ""big bet"" on renewables, turning the UK into the ""Saudi Arabia"" of wind power. Talking via video link to a roundtable discussion at the UN in New York, he said the country held ""extraordinary potential"" for wind energy. He said the UK should embrace a range of new technologies to achieve its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The UK holds the presidency of the UN climate conference, known as the COP. But because of the coronavirus crisis, the annual gathering will not take place this year. It has instead been postponed until November 2021. China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal What is in the Paris climate agreement? Covid crisis does little to slow climate change The prime minister said the UK had an ambitious agenda for the meeting and called on other countries to show similar ambition. He praised the recent pledge by China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Mr Johnson reiterated his government's pledge to ""build back greener"" after the Covid-19 pandemic, through a green industrial revolution. He promised to deliver thousands of new jobs in the process. As regards wind power, Mr Johnson said: ""We've got huge, huge gusts of wind going around the north of our country - Scotland. Quite extraordinary potential we have for wind."" On the question of new technologies, the prime minister also said he wanted the UK to take the lead in carbon capture and storage  (CCS) technology, in which greenhouse gas emissions are captured from sources such as power stations and then stored underground. Mr Johnson said the UK had ""quite extraordinary potential"" for wind power Mr Johnson said this was a technology he ""barely believed was possible, but I am now a complete evangelist for"". He said the country would also be investing in renewable hydrogen fuel technology to provide what he called ""grunt""  for ""trucks, for trains, even perhaps for planes - for vehicles that aren't readily capable of being moved by electric batteries"". Like many other countries, he said the UK government was also thinking of bringing forward the date for phasing out new petrol and diesel cars.  It's thought that date will be 2030, with 2035 for plug-in hybrids - but this has not yet been confirmed. This would help accelerate the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs). The government would be continuing its ongoing investments in solar power and nuclear energy: ""I do think nuclear has to be part of the mix,"" the prime minister said. Plug-in hybrids are a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Something that might have got a bit lost amongst Mr Johnsons references to the UK not ""lagging on lagging"" or the need to get hydrogen ""grunt"" to power the nation's trucks was just how important the Glasgow conference is. It was only at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015 that the world actually agreed that all nations needed to do their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even as the Paris conference closed, the participants knew the commitments made were not sufficient to meet the UN's stated goal of keeping temperature rises well below 2C. That is why they agreed to review their ambitions every five years. The idea is that they will keep raising the bar, doubling down on the efforts to moderate climate change. Mr Johnson's goal today was to urge them to bring the boldest possible carbon cuts at a new meeting marking the anniversary of the Paris agreement on 12 December. What they bring to that meeting will kick off a year of negotiations designed to get them to go even further eleven months later at Glasgow. So Mr Johnson was beginning a process that will determine how successful the conference will be and - much more important - will also determine the future direction of global climate. The UK plans to invest in hydrogen-powered vehicles In addition, homes would have to be improved so that they emit far fewer emissions. ""Putting in lagging, changing the way the windows are configured, all kinds of things - changing the boilers. You can do so much to make a home less carbon-emitting. ""The UK may sometimes be accused of lagging in some things my friends, but we will never be lagging in lagging."" Mr Johnson said the UK's greenhouse gases were 8-10% down in 2020 on previous years. But added: ""The bad news is we've achieved that by sustaining an appalling economic shock in the form of coronavirus. ""The only way we've done - or we're going to do it - is as you can imagine because our planes aren't flying, our people aren't moving, our cars aren't travelling and our industry isn't producing emissions in the way that it normally would."" At the roundtable, Ursula Van der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said that keeping global temperature rise under 1.5C - considered the gateway to dangerous global warming - was still possible ""if we act quickly and if we act together"".

Thalidomide campaigners lead journalist tributes,"Sir Harold was one of Britain and America's best-known journalists Thalidomide campaigners have paid tribute to investigative journalist Sir Harold Evans, who has died aged 92. The British-American journalist, who led an investigation into the drug, died of heart failure in New York, his wife Tina Brown said. David Mason, whose daughter Louise Medus-Mansell was a Thalidomide victim, said Sir Harold played a ""pivotal"" role in securing compensation for survivors. Sir Harold oversaw many campaigns as editor of the Sunday Times. His 70-year career also saw him work as a magazine founder, book publisher, author and, at the time of his death, Reuters' editor-at-large. Sir Harold's Thalidomide campaign was launched in 1972 and eventually forced the UK manufacturer, Distillers Company - at the time the Sunday Times's biggest advertiser - to increase the compensation received by victims. Thalidomide, which first appeared in the UK in 1958, was prescribed to expectant mothers to control the symptoms of morning sickness. However, hundreds of these mothers in Britain, and many thousands across the world, gave birth to children with missing limbs, deformed hearts, blindness and other problems. This video can not be played Campaigner David Mason says meeting Sir Harold was ""pivotal"" David Mason's daughter, Mrs Medus-Mansell, was born without arms and legs after her mother was prescribed Thalidomide during pregnancy. Mr Mason told the BBC his first meeting with Sir Harold was ""pivotal"" to his campaign to secure further compensation for his daughter and other survivors. ""I'd been fighting this campaign for many years before meeting Harry, but the idea of the press campaign, and bringing public awareness to my campaign, was absolutely vital,"" he said. ""There's no doubt that without Harry's expertise, involvement and leadership with that, I would not have won the Thalidomide campaign. ""Week on week he was bashing Distillers, and brought about tremendous national coverage, and tremendous sympathy for the victims of Thalidomide, which helped me enormously."" Thalidomide: Were more affected? Ageing in the wake of thalidomide Obituary: Sir Harold Evans He added that Sir Harold was a ""wonderful campaigning journalist, and a thoroughly nice man, very popular with everybody. He really was invaluable and I'll miss him greatly."" Mrs Medus-Mansell, who also campaigned for the rights of Thalidomide victims,died aged 56 in 2018 after years of poor health. Louise Medus-Mansell, pictured with Olivia Newton-John, was one of the last babies born with the effects of the drug Louise Medus-Mansell with her daughter Emma Glen Harrison, a Thalidomide survivor and deputy chairman of the campaign group Thalidomide UK, also paid tribute following Sir Harold's death. He described him as ""an outstanding human being for our cause"". In addition to helping to secure extra compensation for victims, Sir Harold fought a legal injunction to stop the Sunday Times from revealing the drug's developers had not gone through the proper testing procedures. Speaking about his campaigning in a 2010 interview withthe Independent,external, Sir Harold said: ""I tried to do - all I hoped to do - was to shed a little light. And if that light grew weeds, we'd have to try and pull them up."" Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Grunenthal It was launched on 1 October 1957 First marketed as a sedative, it was then given to pregnant women to combat morning sickness As many as 10,000 babies of these women were born worldwide with deformities After 14 years as editor of the Sunday Times, Sir Harold went on to become the founding editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine and later president of the publishing giant, Random House. One of Britain and America's best-known journalists, Sir Harold also wrote several books about the press and in 2003 was given a knighthood for his services to journalism. A year earlier, a poll by the Press Gazette and the British Journalism Review named him the greatest newspaper editor of all time. Author and editorTina Brown said on Twitter,externalthat her husband was ""the most magical of men"" and had been ""my soulmate for 39 years"". Sir Harold Evans was appointed editor-at-large at the Reuters news agency in 2011 Sir Harold forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950. Despite his many notable campaigns, Sir Harold said newspaper campaigns should be selective, and he deplored what he saw as the invasion of privacy by the British tabloid press. After editing the Sunday Times Sir Harold edited the Times, but left in 1981 following a public falling-out with the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, over editorial independence. Sir Harold and his second wife Tina Brown pictured in 1989, after their move to New York City Writing about,externaltheir relationship, Sir Harold described his decision not to ""campaign against"" Mr Murdoch's takeover of the papers as ""the worst in my professional career"". He added: ""My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what the Times became."" Harry Evans personified not only the noblest possibilities of journalism, but of social mobility in the 20th Century too. Born into what he called ""the respectable working-class"", his route to national and international acclaim via the streets of Manchester and Darlington - the latter as editor of the Northern Echo - is sadly a route few take today. He embodied the most romantic ideal of an editor: a humble hack taking on mighty forces through the dogged pursuit of truth. Though he later fell out with Rupert Murdoch, and never forgave him, in his 14 years at the helm of the Sunday Times he redefined journalism itself. He was a master craftsman, in a trade where practical wisdom was precious and vital; and he combined a flair for layout, projection and design with a remarkable nose for a story, particularly those with human suffering at their heart. But above all he was brave. During his reign, it seemed no super-rich bully or powerful government could intimidate him. In our era of information overload, diminished trust in journalism, and fewer people willing to pay for news, the nostalgia for what he represented is impossible to resist. As he put it himself in the title of his wonderful memoir from 2009, he reached the top in Vanished Times. He had the resources, and the time, to hold power to account - and he did uniquely well. Mixed with his charm and sheer decency, this put journalism itself in a debt to him that will never be fully serviced. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ""Sir Harold Evans was a giant among journalists who strove to put the ordinary man and woman at the heart of his reporting."" After leaving the Times, Sir Harold and his second wife, Tina Brown, moved to New York. She edited Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, while he became founding editor of Conde Nast magazine. In 2011, at the age of 82, Sir Harold was appointed editor-at-large at Reuters, the organisation's editor-in-chief describing him as ""one of the greatest minds in journalism"".

Sir Harold Evans was appointed editor-at-large at the Reuters news agency in 2011 Sir Harold forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950. Despite his many notable campaigns, Sir Harold said newspaper campaigns should be selective, and he deplored what he saw as the invasion of privacy by the British tabloid press. After editing the Sunday Times Sir Harold edited the Times, but left in 1981 following a public falling-out with the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, over editorial independence. Sir Harold and his second wife Tina Brown pictured in 1989, after their move to New York City Writing about,externaltheir relationship, Sir Harold described his decision not to ""campaign against"" Mr Murdoch's takeover of the papers as ""the worst in my professional career"". He added: ""My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what the Times became."" Harry Evans personified not only the noblest possibilities of journalism, but of social mobility in the 20th Century too. Born into what he called ""the respectable working-class"", his route to national and international acclaim via the streets of Manchester and Darlington - the latter as editor of the Northern Echo - is sadly a route few take today. He embodied the most romantic ideal of an editor: a humble hack taking on mighty forces through the dogged pursuit of truth. Though he later fell out with Rupert Murdoch, and never forgave him, in his 14 years at the helm of the Sunday Times he redefined journalism itself. He was a master craftsman, in a trade where practical wisdom was precious and vital; and he combined a flair for layout, projection and design with a remarkable nose for a story, particularly those with human suffering at their heart. But above all he was brave. During his reign, it seemed no super-rich bully or powerful government could intimidate him. In our era of information overload, diminished trust in journalism, and fewer people willing to pay for news, the nostalgia for what he represented is impossible to resist. As he put it himself in the title of his wonderful memoir from 2009, he reached the top in Vanished Times. He had the resources, and the time, to hold power to account - and he did uniquely well. Mixed with his charm and sheer decency, this put journalism itself in a debt to him that will never be fully serviced. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ""Sir Harold Evans was a giant among journalists who strove to put the ordinary man and woman at the heart of his reporting."" After leaving the Times, Sir Harold and his second wife, Tina Brown, moved to New York. She edited Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, while he became founding editor of Conde Nast magazine. In 2011, at the age of 82, Sir Harold was appointed editor-at-large at Reuters, the organisation's editor-in-chief describing him as ""one of the greatest minds in journalism"".

Scottish students banned from going to pubs,"Students in Glasgow have been getting tests after an outbreak Students in Scotland are being told not to go to pubs, parties or restaurants this weekend in a bid to stem a spate of coronavirus outbreaks. Hundreds of university students have tested positive at campuses across the country, with many more self-isolating. Universities have now pledged to make it ""absolutely clear"" to students that there must be no parties. And they will not be allowed to socialise with anyone outside of their accommodation. Students have also been warned that any breaches of the new rules ""will not be tolerated"". Thestricter guidelines,externalwere announced after opposition leaders accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of a ""basic failure"" to anticipate the problem and provide more testing on university campuses. However they have been criticised by the National Union of Students Scotland as ""unjustified""and ""deeply concerning"". President Matt Crilly said it was especially concerning for students who relied on income from hospitality jobs, and showed ""complete disregard"" for their mental health and wellbeing. Mary Senior, of the University and College Union, said she was ""absolutely astounded"" by the announcement, saying the outbreaks were ""inevitable"". Speaking on BBCGood Morning Scotlandshe questioned the motives of universities in bringing students back to campus, pointing out that student accommodation ""provides important commercial income for universities"" and ""cross subsidies teaching"". Meanwhile the Children and Young People's Commissioner Scotland has raisedconcerns about the ""human rights implications"",externalof the restrictions. Self-isolation: PPE to pee and running out of food What do campus outbreaks mean for students? University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' Universities Scotland said the new guidance that had been agreed with the Scottish government was a ""necessary step at this crucial moment of managing the virus in the student population, to protect students and the wider community"". The new rules state that all universities will ""make absolutely clear to students that there must be no parties, and no socialising outside their households"". They go on to say: ""This weekend, the first of the new tighter Scottish government guidance, we will require students to avoid all socialising outside of their households and outside of their accommodation. ""We will ask them not to go to bars or other hospitality venues."" Extra staff will be brought into student accommodation to watch for any breaches of the guidance and to support students who are self-isolating. LaterUniversities Scotland denied the move amounted to a ban,externalbut admitted it was a ""big ask"". And Nicola Sturgeon clarified,externalthat the rules about avoiding hospitality applied only to this weekend. One Glasgow University student, Elise, told BBC Scotland that she was angry at the new rules imposing strict restrictions on their social lives. The first-year student is currently isolating at Murano Street halls, after one of her flatmates tested positive. She described the new restrictions as ""quite ridiculous"" and said it was wrong to pin the blame on students for spreading the virus. She asked why the university told them to move into the halls when they could have followed their online courses from home. ""We were told to come to university halls - 48 people from across the country in one building- it was inevitable that it was going to spread,"" she said. ""We are getting punished for just living here but we were told to come. ""There's no reason for us to be here because everything is online."" Another student at the Murano halls asked how the requirement not to go to pubs was going to be policed. ""Will there be officers going up to students and asking if they are students? ""We are isolating so we won't be going to pubs anyway but what about those students who are fine? It's a depressing and bleak situation."" Police Scotland will also be monitoring student behaviour off-campus and in private accommodation. And private providers of student accommodation will also be urged to strictly enforce the guidance. Students will also be required to download the Protect Scotland app. The guidance warns: ""We will take a strict 'Yellow Card/Red Card' approach to breaches of student discipline that put students and others at risk. ""While we first want to advise students about breaches of discipline, we will not hesitate to escalate this to disciplinary action including potential discontinuation of study."" In aTwitter message directed at students,external, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was sorry Covid was ""making this special time of your lives so tough"". ""But it won't be forever and the more we get this virus back under control now, the sooner you'll get a bit of normality back,"" she said. Several universities across the country are dealing with major outbreaks of the virus, with many students in halls of residence in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh all being told to self-isolate. A total of 172 Glasgow University students have so far tested positive, with 600 in isolation, while all 500 residents at the Parker House halls in Dundeehave been told to quarantine. And 120 cases have been identified in an outbreak at Edinburgh Napier University. Opposition parties have argued that the Scottish government should have been better prepared for outbreaks when university students returned for the new term. Ms Sturgeon has said the number of positive cases at universities was likely to increase, but claimed this showed that the test and protect system ""is working, and we must continue to have confidence in that"". She urged students to follow the latest guidance and said she was sorry that the pandemic was ""making this special time of your lives so tough"". Life for university students was already very different this term. Most students were already set to learn mostly online, but the university experience is a social one as much as an academic one. Perhaps the most significant move is to appeal to students not to visit bar or hospitality venues. Ultimately students who break the rules on campus or in university accommodation face expulsion. However, universities know they also have to appeal to the individual's sense of responsibility and common sense. It will still be a big ask. Homesick students won't usually be able to go back inside the family home they lived in until a few weeks ago. Starting university can be a difficult experience - a student may not like their course or may find it hard to live away from home or make new friends. This year it will be even tougher so for that reason, it will be more important than ever to consider the wellbeing and mental health of students. Are you a student in Scotland?

NHS Covid-19 app hits one million downloads,"Users will be told to self-isolate if the app determines they are at high risk of being infected More than one million people have downloaded the government's contact-tracing app for England and Wales within its first day of release. NHS Covid-19 instructs users to self-isolate for 14 days if it detects they were nearby someone who has the virus. It also has a check-in scanner to alert owners if a venue they have visited is found to be an outbreak hotspot. Anyone aged 16 and over is being asked to install it. The government plans to give its own download tally on Monday. This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the app ""helps us to find more people who are at risk of having the virus"" that human contact tracers are unable to find. ""Everybody who downloads the app will be helping to protect themselves, helping to protect their loved ones, helping to protect their community because the more people who download it, the more effective it will be,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The app keeps secret who receives a self-isolation alert. And there was some confusion about whether users could ignore a notification telling them to stay at home. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""That self-isolation is voluntary, unlike the mandatory self-isolation if you are called by NHS Test and Trace."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said people might need to ""upgrade"" to access the NHS Covid-19 app But the Department of Health had earlier said that users must obey the command and would in theory be liable for fines of Â£1,000 or more if they did not, while acknowledging it had no way to check. A senior source has since told the BBC that the notification is ""advisory"" because the authorities cannot legally enforce something that cannot be proved. How to use England and Wales' contact-tracing app How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? The decision to allow those 16 and over to download the app is a change from trials, which were limited to the over-18s. User will have to verify they are over 16 before they can start using the app The move reflects a desire by health chiefs for the software to be used by as many students in further education colleges and universities as possible. The age limit is in line with the Protect Scotland contact-tracing app. And health chiefs behind Northern Ireland's StopCOVID NI have said they intend to launch a new version that accepts under-18s later this month. The launch comes as the UKreported 6,178 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. The government had originally intended to release the app months ago. But problems with the initial design and the addition of extra features meant it was only ready for its final public test in August. One tech expert who has tracked the initiative acknowledged the team involved had worked hard to address concerns about privacy and transparency, but said wider problems could still limit its impact. ""Not only is the app late to launch, but it will be hindered by the delays in the testing system,"" Rachel Coldicutt told the BBC. ""If you don't have symptoms, will a push notification saying you were near someone a week ago make you and your family self-isolate and spend days hitting refresh on the testing website, trying to find a test?"" Although the app allows users to order a coronavirus test and automatically get the results, the government does not believe it will complicate efforts to meet demand. The app is available for smartphones only - not tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go toAndroid's Google Play,externalorApple's App Store,externaland search for ""NHS Covid-19"". The handsets must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. And some of the latest Huawei handsets are excluded. The notification will tell the recipient to go into self-isolation for a fortnight - and trigger the start of the app's countdown clock. Even if the recipient has no symptoms or a subsequent negative test result, they must stay at home for the duration. Unlike when a human contact tracer orders someone to self-isolate, the app keeps the subject's identity a secret. Those that have not received such an alert, but fill in the app's symptoms checker and meet the criteria, will be directed to self-isolate for eight days. They will also be directed to an external website to book a test. Read more about how the app works in our Q&A Automated contact tracing is designed to complement the work done by humans by helping to identify encounters with strangers - for example, someone standing close to a user while waiting in a queue outside a shop. When someone anonymously shares a positive Covid-19 test result via the app, a process developed by Apple and Google makes other users' smartphones check if they had recently detected the infected person's handset. But smartphones were not designed for this purpose and the readings involved are not always accurate. This has led to fears of ""false positives"" - people being instructed to self-isolate who were never at risk. A publicity campaign will encourage users to download the app to protect others However, health chiefs believe a recent change to the calculations involved should help minimise the problem: they now take into account when the virus-carrier was at their most contagious. One of the app's other major features is a scanner to let it keep track of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other places the user has visited. Hospitality venues in England now face Â£1,000 fines if they do not display an officialTest and Trace poster featuring a QR barcode assigned to them,external. Cinemas, community centres and places of worship are also being asked to display authorised QR barcode posters So far, the government says more than 160,000 businesses have downloaded a unique code for their property. The benefit is that if officials later identify a venue as being at the centre of an outbreak, they can update a database which the phones regularly check for a match. Users can then be told to self-isolate and/or get tested, depending on the circumstances, without having to revealing their identities. Other facilities, including postcode-based threat updates and details of the latest guidance, are intended to encourage people to regularly look at the app and change their behaviour. But a major challenge will be convincing them to download it in the first place: officials suggest only about one in 10 people installed the app during a recent trial in the London Borough of Newham, an area picked for its ethnic diversity. When the BBC visited on Wednesday, a reporter could only find one person using it Scotland's app launched about a fortnight ago, and roughly one in five people there have installed it Ireland, one of the leaders in the field, has still only convinced about one in three people to use its app, which was released in July To encourage adoption in England and Wales, the the major mobile networks have agreed not to deduct data used by the app from subscribers' monthly allowances. In addition, the app now supports more languages than the test version - adding Turkish, Arabic, Mandarin, Romanian and soon Polish. The app provides a risk score for the user's neighbourhood as well as a self-isolation countdown clock And it now allows users to delete individual venue visits from the app's ""digital diary"". This followed feedback from victims of domestic abuse, whose partners often check their phones. One change, however, may be less popular. Those told to go into self-isolation because of a contact-tracing match will not be able to challenge the decision. Adocument published online had indicated,externalthat users would be able to call an NHS 111 operator, who might overrule the command. TESTING:What tests are available?

We'll be back tomorrow. The live page writers today were: Joseph Lee, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Victoria Bisset, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. A flag tribute to Americans who have died with Covid-19 can been seen in Washington DC In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for today. Before then, here's a recap of the main UK stories from today. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Read more More than 40 children have tested positive after an outbreak linked to a wedding in the German town of Hamm, German news agency DPA reports. Nine schools have been affected by the cluster of cases, a spokesman for the city said on Thursday, adding that only one of the children infected had no connection to the wedding. Of the almost 200 people in the town to have tested positive, 150 were guests at the wedding, according to the town's official website. A total of 300 people are currently in quarantine and are subject to mandatory testing. The news comes as a second German minister went into quarantine after he was found to have contact with an infected individual. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who hosted a meeting of EU trade ministers in Berlin on Monday, said he was self-isolating as a precaution after the employee of a minister who attended had tested positive. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was in quarantine after a member of his security staff tested positive. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tested positive on Wednesday The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Russia has reached 6,595, the highest since mid-July. In the capital, Moscow, cases are at their highest level since late June. Russia has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and almost 20,000 deaths since the pandemic began, and there are fears the new figures could signal a new wave in the country. Moscow has already registered the world's first coronavirus vaccine, despite experts saying the trials were too small to prove its safety and effectiveness. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, lambasted the US over its coronavirus criticism Senior diplomats from China and the US have lashed out at each other at a meeting of the UN Security Council, deepening a row over the coronavirus pandemic. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, used his speech to reject US attempts to blame the country for the pandemic. âI must say, enough is enough! You have created enough troubles for the world already,"" he told the meeting via video link on Thursday. âIf someone should be held accountable, it should be a few US politicians themselves.â His comments appeared to be a response to US President Donald Trump,who called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemicin his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week. Tensions between China and the US have flared over the pandemic and a number of other issues, including trade and alleged human rights abuses. The US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, voiced anger at the tone of Thursdayâs UN Security Council meeting. ""You know, shame on each of you. I am astonished and I am disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. Earlier, we reported thatthe UK recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases on Thursday- the highest figure since mass testing began. The below charts show the trends in cases and deaths - both before and since mass testing became available. However, hospital admissions data was not available in Thursday's figures, which are released by the government. You can look at more detail at the numbers in our piece tracking UK caseshere. More than 10,000 people have died in Indonesia Indonesia has seen a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. More than 4,600 new infections were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number to 262,000. More than 10,000 people have died in the country since the pandemic began. Indonesia is the 17th country to pass 10,000 Covid deaths, While the official figures are the highest in South East Asia, there are fears the true number of cases could be much higher due to the country's low testing rate. Earlier this week, the official in charge of the country's coronavirus response in the nine worst-hit provinces police and the military could break up illegal rallies in the run-up to December's regional elections. More than 25,000 people have died with coronavirus in Iran, official figures show, as the country witnesses a spike in cases. A ministry spokesman said today that 175 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 25,015. However,an investigation by BBC Persian earlier this yearfound the number of coronavirus deaths was nearly three times as high as the official statistics. The government's own records appeared to show almost 42,000 people had died with Covid-19 symptoms in the run up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry at the time. The country is the worst affected in the Middle East, with more than 436,000 coronavirus cases recorded to date. Earlier this week, an official warned the country is facing a third wave of infections. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The official records may show that the UK has just seen the highest number of new cases reported on a single day.  But it is, of course, nothing of the sort.  At the peak of the pandemic in the spring we had such limited testing capacity that it was largely only hospital patients who were being checked.  It meant we were identifying just the tip of the iceberg.  Estimates have suggested there may have been as many 100,000 cases a day at the peak.  We are clearly not capturing all the infections - even now with the mass testing that is available.  Surveillance data last week suggested we may only be identifying around a half of cases. But that still puts the infection levels well below what they were in the spring.  Hospital admissions and deaths have also started creeping up, but are still very low.  Health experts have been clear we are now on the upwards path so we should expect this trend to continue. Crucial will be how quickly figures rise for all three measures - with the hospital cases and deaths the most important. Evidence from Spain and France, which started seeing rises a few weeks before us, offer some hope. Cases have been climbing gradually - at least more gradually than the trajectory government scientists warned could lead the UK to 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italian President Sergio Mattarella responded to Boris Johnson's comments on Thursday The president of Italy has rebuked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for suggesting that Britons were more ""freedom-loving"" than his compatriots. It was in parliament this week that Johnson was asked by a Labour MP whether Italy and Germany had lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK because of more efficient testing and tracing. ""No"" the prime minister replied. ""There is an important difference between our country and many others around the world - ours is a freedom-loving country,"" he added. Now, Italian President Sergio Mattarella has responded, telling reporters: ""We Italians also love freedom â but seriousness is dear to us as well."" Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus and impose a national lockdown, appears to have brought the pandemic under control. Mask-wearing is scrupulous, testing is widespread and restrictions have remained in place for a long time. But in a country that fought for independence and liberation from Nazi occupation, its president has reminded Johnson that the love of freedom isn't exclusively a British value. Plans to resume weekly mass participation Parkrun events in October have been scrapped due to stricter coronavirus rules. The events, which take place in more than 700 parks across the UK, were suspendedin March because of the pandemic. Organisers had hoped to resume in October, but new rules introduced due to rising case numbers have forced a re-think. Parkrun chief executive Nick Pearson said they felt it ""would be insensitive to push forward with reopening"". Read more Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven warned against complacency Sweden has seen a âworryingâ rise in coronavirus infections in parts of the country where people have not been taking social distancing seriously, its prime minister has said. Stefan Lofven said the coronavirus situation in Sweden was âstableâ compared to other countries, but there were signs of a resurgence. ""That's worrying. It requires that we tighten our behaviour,"" the prime minister said at a media briefing on Thursday. âThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs and parties, bus trips in rush-hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal.â Sweden has recorded more than 90,000 infections and almost 6,000 deaths to date, higher figures than its Nordic neighbours on both counts. Unlike most countries, Sweden did not impose a sweeping lockdown at the height of the pandemicâs first wave. Instead, the countryâs health officials emphasised personal responsibility, with limited restrictions on life. We reported earlier that the UK has reported 6,634 new cases, up from 6,178 the day before. Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""The signals are clear. Positivity rates are rising across all age groups and we're continuing to see spikes in rates of admission to hospital and critical care. ""We must all follow the new measures that have been bought in to help control the virus and download the new NHS Covid-19 App which is the fastest way of knowing when you're at risk."" She also said: ""This is the highest number recorded and a stark warning for us all."" While 6,634 cases is the highest number recorded by mass testing, experts believe the true number of daily cases was far higher earlier in the pandemic. France is one of the countries to have witnessed a rise in cases Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, with countries on the brink of national lockdowns amid a second wave of infections, the European Union's health commissioner has warned. ""It might be our last chance to prevent a repeat of last spring,"" Stella Kyriakides said today. ""All member states must be ready to roll out measures immediately and at the right time."" Earlier this year, countries across Europe imposed strict nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus, grinding economic activity to an abrupt halt. Allow Twitter content?

Kyriakides's warning echoesthat of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),external, which today said it was concerned about the rising number of infections on the continent. The EU agency said health messages ""should emphasise that the pandemic is far from over"", adding that the current situation ""poses an increasing risk of infection for vulnerable individuals"" and health workers. The UK government has announced another 6,634 Covid-19 cases - that's an increase on Wednesday's figure, which was 6,178. They also said a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. That's up from 37 deaths announced on Wednesday. We'll have more charts setting out the spread of the virus in the UK later. We've been reporting today on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new measures to support jobs and the economy, including the Job Support Scheme, which will replace the Job Retention Scheme. But the government has also repeatedly referred to an existing measure aimed at encouraging employers to keep on staff that had been furloughed. The Job Retention Bonus is a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee still in meaningful employment at the end of January. Eligible employees must earn at least Â£520 a month on average between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said the bonus, in conjunction with the Job Support Scheme, has given firms a ""big incentive"" to retain staff merely until the end of January. Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and the Caribbean island of Curacao have been removed from the UK government's list of travel corridors, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. That means travellers arriving in England from those countries after 04:00 BST on Saturday must self-isolate for 14 days, Shapps said. He reminded travellers that they must self-isolate when returning from a non-exempt country, or face a fine starting from Â£1,000. Allow Twitter content?

"Michael Kiwanuka wins the 2020 Mercury PrizeThe star's soul-searching, self-titled album is named the best British record of the past 12 months.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Michael Kiwanuka said he was ""so excited"" to win the Mercury Prize Singer-songwriter Michael Kiwanuka has won the 2020 Mercury Prize for his soul-searching third record, Kiwanuka. A lush, immersive album of politicised soul, it sees the star exploring themes of self-doubt, faith and civil rights. Released last November, Kiwanuka beat best-sellers like Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia and Stormzy's Heavy Is The Head to win the Â£25,000 prize. ""It's blown my mind,"" said the singer. ""Music is all I've ever wanted to do, so I'm over the moon."" Kiwanuka won on his third attempt, having been nominated for each of his previous albums: 2012's Home Again and 2016's Love & Hate. ""I was kind of resigned to the fact [that] if I don't win one this year, probably I'll never win one,"" he told BBC 6 Music. Michael Kiwanuka interview: 'I am not an imposter' Mercury Prize 2020: As-it-happened Kiwanuka's victory was revealed by Radio 1's Annie Mac on The One Show, after Covid-19 restrictions made the traditional award ceremony impossible. The DJ, who was on the judging panel alongside the likes of Jamie Cullum and Jorja Smith, said it had been a ""unanimous"" decision. ""I don't think any of the judges walked away unhappy,"" she said. ""Everyone felt the same thing about this album, which is that it thoroughly deserved to win the prize."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Kiwanuka, whose Ugandan parents escaped Idi Amin's regime to settle in Muswell Hill, London, is a former session musician who dropped out of the Royal Academy of Music to become a solo artist. He first came to attention after supporting Adele on her 2011 tour andwinning the BBC's Sound of 2012. He released his debut album, Home Again, later that year. The musician cemented his reputation with 2016's Love & Hate, which made him a star in the US when the opening song,Cold Little Heart,external, became the theme tune to the TV series Big Little Lies. The self-titled album has given Kiwanuka his third Mercury Prize nomination and first win Despite his success, his latest album emerged from a period of crippling self-doubt. ""I've always had imposter syndrome,"" he told the BBC last year. ""I was always waiting for someone to find me out. ""But about a year and a half ago, I got tired of that way of thinking. I just went, 'This isn't helping anyone, least of all me.'"" The result was Kiwanuka's opening track, You Ain't The Problem, on which the musician vows to stop getting in his own way, singing: ""I used to hate myself / You got the key / Break out the prison.""

The record continues as a song cycle where Kiwanuka's own experiences and fears are interwoven with samples of civil rights campaigners and reflections on racial politics. On the psych-rock soliloquy Hero, he compares the murder of 1960s Black Panther activist Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings. Exasperated, he turns to God for answers on the call-and-response coda ofI've Been Dazed,external. Everything you need to know about the Mercury nominees Pop star 'not British enough' for Mercury prize Released last November, the album earned rave reviews and reached number two in the UK charts. It is the latest album reflecting the experiences of young black Britons to be chosen by Mercury judges. Kiwanuka is the fifth black male solo artist to win the award in the past six years. Rapper Dave won for Psychodrama last year. The musician was the bookies' favourite to win, followed by Laura Marling, who has now been passed over four times. Announcing the winner on The One Show will undoubtedly gave Kiwanuka's record extra exposure. The prime-time BBC One programme regularly attracts three million viewers, compared with the 155,000 who tuned in to last year's final on BBC Four. Mac explained that Kiwanuka had been informed of the result before the show, so that he could be invited to the studio. However, she shared a video of the moment she ambushed him with the news, as he was on his way to be interviewed by Jools Holland. Allow Twitter content?

Baftas to add nominees after diversity rowThe Bafta Film Awards will have an overhaul after this year's event had an all-white acting line-up.Entertainment & Arts,"Renee Zellweger and Joaquin Phoenix won the top acting prizes at the 2020 Bafta Film Awards The Bafta Film Awards will have more nominees next year in an attempt to increase the diversity of the stars and film-makers who are up for honours. All four acting categories as well as the best director award will have six nominees, instead of the usual five. Ten titles will be in contention for the outstanding British film award - four more than the customary six. Earlier this year, Bafta was heavily criticised after picking an all-white line-up of acting nominees. Meanwhile, no female film-makers were nominated for the best director prize for the seventh year running. Organisers carried out a ""detailed review"" as a result, and said they would now also seek to ""meaningfully target"" 1,000 new voting members from under-represented groups. The move, they said, was one in a series of steps ""to ensure a more representative and inclusive membership that reflects today's British society"". Director Andrew Onwubolu, aka Rapman, on the set of Blue Story In January, Blue Story director Rapman was among Bafta's many critics, saying it had done his gritty urban drama ""dirty"" by not shortlisting it for any awards. Bafta said the review had begun as ""a direct response"" to the lack of diversity in its 2020 nominations, but had ""soon expanded to encompass all aspects"" of the organisation. Baftas 'reviews' voting process amid diversity row Oscars set out best picture diversity targets Bafta - the British Academy of Film and Television Arts - said the expansion of its outstanding British film award would enable it to ""do more to champion the vast pool of multicultural British talent"". ""One of the key issues raised time and time again... was that too much deserving work was not being seen,"" said film committee chair Marc Samuelson. ""The changes we are implementing are designed to ensure these films are seen and judged on merit alone."" Changes to campaigning rules will seek to ensure ""a fairer consideration of all films regardless of marketing budget"". Bafta said this would ensure ""smaller"" films were not ""left out of the conversation"" and would have as much ""visibility"" as titles backed by major studios. Changes to Bafta's voting practices will ensure the best director jury will have a guaranteed number of female film-makers to choose from. The final six nominees will be drawn from an expanded longlist of 20 names, half of which will be female. Bafta said this would help to address ""a historic lack of female representation in the directing category"". Kathryn Bigelow, pictured with Clive Owen in 2010, is the only female winner of the best director Bafta Only five women have ever made the shortlist for the best director award, which Bafta first presented in 1969. Kathryn Bigelow, the only woman to win, for The Hurt Locker in 2010, was also the last woman to be shortlisted when she was nominated in 2013 for Zero Dark Thirty. All voting members will also now be required to take a ""specially designed bespoke"" course in ""conscious voter training"". Bafta said that would help its members ""navigate and recognise the wider societal influences that can impact the voting process"". Krishnendu Majumdar is the first Bafta chair from a BAME background In the case of the overall best film award, all voters will be required to watch all 15 movies on the longlist. The shortlist will continue to consist of five films. Bafta's review was led by its chair Krishnendu Majumdar, Samuelson and a steering group that included former Doctor Who actor Noel Clarke, academic Sadia Habib and ITV's head of diversity Ade Rawcliffe. Mr Majumdar praised them for ""bravely sharing their experiences of racism and discrimination"" during ""tough, chastening [and] captivating"" sessions. Noel Clarke played Mickey Smith in Doctor Who and has directed several films ""This is a watershed moment for Bafta,"" the TV producer said in a statement. ""The Academy has never opened itself up like this before."" Bafta's chief executive Amanda Berry concurred, saying the review was ""a fantastic opportunity... to make substantial cultural and organisational change"". Bafta said ""significant changes"" to its Television Awards would be announced in October and that its Games and Children's Awards would also be reviewed. The 2021 Bafta Film Awards are scheduled to take place on 11 April, two months later than usual due to the coronavirus pandemic. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

What help are self-employed people getting?,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

How many people could become unemployed?,"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

Navalny has 'bank accounts frozen and flat seized',"Alexei Navalny and his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, were pictured at the hospital in Berlin Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny has had his bank accounts frozen and flat seized after a court order, his spokeswoman says. A day earlier he was discharged from a hospital where he was being treated for Novichok nerve agent poisoning. ""They seized the assets and the apartment of a person who was in a coma,"" Kira Yarmysh said. His team accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering the poisoning, something the Kremlin strongly denies. The leading opposition figure and vocal critic of Mr Putin collapsed on a flight in Siberia on 20 August, and was later transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in the German capital Berlin for treatment. Profile: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life How Navalny's team found Novichok bottle evidence Germany's government said laboratories in France and Sweden had reconfirmed German tests showing that the poison used on Mr Navalny was a Novichok agent, and numerous governments have demanded an explanation. The Kremlin however has said there is no proof of that. After Mr Navalny was discharged on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was ""free"" to return to Moscow ""at any moment"", and wished him ""a speedy recovery"". Ms Yarmysh said officials had seized the opposition activist's assets on 27 August, including his three-bedroom apartment in the south-east of the Russian capital, Moscow. ""It means the flat cannot be sold, donated or mortgaged,""Ms Yarmysh said in a video posted on Twitter,external. Kira Yarmysh photographed outside Omsk hospital where Mr Navalny was first taken after falling seriously ill The move comes after a lawsuit was filed by the Moscow Schoolchild catering company, owned by wealthy Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, nicknamed ""Putin's chef"". Powerful 'Putin's chef' cooks up murky deals Mr Navalny, his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and an associate made a video questioning the quality of their products after a food poisoning outbreak in Moscow's schools in 2018. But in October 2019 a court ordered them to delete the video and pay 88 million rubles ($1.1m; Â£900,000) in damages for libel, saying they had caused the company moral damage. On Wednesday, Mr Prigozhin released a statement saying that if Mr Navalny ""goes to meet his maker, then I personally do not intend to pursue him in this world"". Analysis by Oleg Boldyrev, BBC Russian, Moscow Alexei Navalny narrowly escaped death by Novichok poisoning just over a month ago, but in Russia it's business as usual - the courts are still after him. Last year he published an investigation into food supplies to Moscow schools, alleging safety breaches. The investigation pointed the finger at firms linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a shadowy businessman with interests in many fields: from catering for banquets in the Kremlin, to food supplies for the army and secondary schools, and - as is widely suspected though denied by the Russian authorities - to running private military companies which guard Russian interests in Syria, Libya, and some African countries. Mr Prigozhin sued Mr Navalny for defamation and was awarded compensation totalling more than $1m. An ordinary flat in the southern outskirts of Moscow owned by Mr Navalny is not worth anything near that much. The Anti-Corruption Foundation set up by the opposition politician says it will need to re-structure, but will continue to investigate corrupt Russian politicians despite this financial blow. Mr Navalny was discharged from the hospital after 32 days, 24 of which were spent in intensive care. ""Based on the patient's progress and current condition, the treating physicians believe that complete recovery is possible,"" a hospital statement said. ""However, it remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning."" This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works After he came out of his medically-induced coma, Mr Navalny's team announced that he planned to return to Russia. Ms Yarmysh said ""no other options were ever considered"". However, she said on Wednesday he would for the moment remain in Germany ""because his treatment is not over"". Mr Navalny posted a picture of himself online standing unaided, with a message saying doctors had given him every chance of a full recovery. Shortly after he was discharged,Mr Navalny described his rehabilitation programme in a post on Instagram,external. ""Further recovery does not require in-patient care, but a normal life,"" he wrote. ""Walking, spending time with my family. Immersing myself in a daily routine. ""My plans are simple: [go to] the physiotherapist every day,"" he said. ""Possibly a rehabilitation centre. Stand on one leg. Regain complete control over my fingers. Maintain my balance."" Poisoned Navalny discharged from Berlin hospital What are Novichok nerve agents?

How to use England and Wales' contact-tracing app,"England and Wales' Covid-19 app has now launched, joining earlier efforts by Northern Ireland and Scotland. Apple and Google's automated contact-tracing technology is being used to tell people to self-isolate if their phone detects they were near someone later determined to have the virus. Other features are also included, and health chiefs say the primary goal is to change people's behaviour to make them less likely to catch or transmit the coronavirus. The app is available for smartphones only - not tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go toAndroid's Google Play,externalorApple's App Store,externaland search for ""NHS Covid-19"". This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app The handsets must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. To check what iOS system you have,go into Settings, then tap on General, and click on About,external. To upgrade click on Software Update. On Android,open Settings, then select System, and click on Advanced,external. It will show what version you have. If you click System Update, it will check if there is an available upgrade. Some of the latest Huawei handsets will not run the app. And users must confirm they are 16 or older to get started. There's a raft of features including: The app keeps a record of venues the user has been to in order to warn them if one is later linked to an outbreak a venue check-in barcode scanner a postcode-based risk-level checker a symptoms-reporter tool the means to order a coronavirus test and receive its results a countdown timer to keep track of how long to stay in self-isolation a guide to the latest advice on local restrictions, financial support and other related information When two devices running the app are close to each other, they exchange Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to determine the distance and duration, measured in sessions lasting five minutes. The measurements are not always accurate - and work continues to improve them - but the logs are used to create a cumulative points score for the set of interactions between two people over the course of a day. If the points threshold is met and one of the two owners later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. The formula above was used during the trial, but has since been tweaked to take account of when the person with Covid-19 was most infectious. Further changes may be made over time. The notification will tell the recipient to go into self-isolation for a fortnight - and trigger the start of the app's countdown clock. But the recipient is not told who triggered the alert. And the authorities cannot identify either party, although they can track how many people have been told to self-isolate. Even if the recipient has no symptoms or a subsequent negative test result, they must stay at home for the duration. How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? From 28 September,people in England can be fined,externalÂ£1,000 or more for breaching self-isolation rules. However,the relevant legislation says that it does not apply to notifications,externalserved via the app. In any case, because the app lets users remain anonymous there would be no way to enforce penalties for non-compliance. Unlike when a human contact tracer orders someone to self-isolate, the app keeps the subject's identity a secret. Only if they subsequently get in contact - for example to arrange a financial support payment - will their name be registered. Restaurants, bars and other leisure facilities should display an authorised QR barcode on a poster or digital sign, which the app can scan. The app recognises only QR codes related to the check-in scheme, to which businesses must be registered The venue will then be added to the app's ""digital diary"" of places the user has visited. And in England - but not Wales - the user will not need to give their name and address to the venue. If officials later judge the location to be the centre of an outbreak, they can trigger an alert to users who were there. And this notification will tell them that if they are feeling unwell they should use the app's symptom checker. The app first asks the user for permission to use Bluetooth and their postcode, before revealing its home screen When a smartphone owner first uses the app, they are given the option of typing in the first part of their postcode - ""M23"", for example. Typically, thousands of other households will have the same code, so although this causes information to be shared with the authorities, it should not identify individuals. The user is then given a risk-level for their neighbourhood, at the top of the app's home screen, and can be sent an alert if it changes. And in turn, the NHS and local government can collect data about the numbers of app downloads and coronavirus cases in their area, helping them manage the crisis. The app can trigger notification alerts to warn the user if their local risk level has changed or if they have been linked to someone who has the coronavirus Users can report symptoms - and when they started - at any time. If they suggest infection, the user is told to book a test and that everyone in their household must self-isolate for eight days. Booking a test involves using an external website, which asks for the user's name and address. But these personal details are not shared back to the app. And a unique code lets users receive their test result via the app as soon as it is ready. The developers suggest the app should account for less than 5% of a device's battery use. But if the phone is set to use a low-power mode, owners should go into their settings to exclude the app so it can continue contact tracing at all times. And while the app is continually checking for updated data, the major networks have said they will not deduct usage from people's allowances. Apple and Google's framework will not allow two apps to contact trace simultaneously. So when users cross the border, they need to open the local app and turn on contact tracing within it. This will bring up a prompt asking: ""Switch app for exposure notifications?"" Google Play shows users which UK-related contact-tracing apps are available to them Doing so, will turn off the one they were using beforehand. While users are normally encouraged to keep the app active and their phone to hand whenever out of the house, there are exceptions. To avoid people being told to self-isolate when they were protected, or phones logging each other while  in lockers, there is an option to temporarily turn off contact tracing, at the bottom of the home screen. While the human and automated contact-tracing systems are being deliberately kept separate, they should complement each other. So, for example, if you were in a supermarket queue, human tracers might find it hard to identify the person next in line but the app would be able to. Likewise, if you were at a pub where a contagious user was sitting but not using the app, you might still receive an alert via the check-in service. According to modelling done by the University of Oxford, the app can significantly reduce deaths and hospital admissions if at least 15% of the population use it. But real-world data on how effective such apps have been in other countries using them is scant. And so far, they have been offered when the levels of infection have been relatively low, meaning the chance of any user receiving an alert has been slim. Most people have yet to be convinced to install them too - about a third of the population in Ireland, 22% in Germany and only about 4% in France have done so. As Covid-19 resurges that may change. And as health chiefs note, there are other measures of success, including whether those that do download the app regularly open it and then change their behaviour as a result.

Uni self-isolation: 'PPE to pee' and being stuck in bedroom,"Hundreds of students have been asked to self-isolate in their halls of residence following Covid outbreaks at several Scottish universities. They include 600 at the University of Glasgow and another 500 at Abertay University in Dundee. So what's it like to self-isolate in a student flat? One student, who is self isolating because of positive cases in her student household, told the BBC she has had to adapt quickly. She said: ""Being asked to isolate in uni halls isn't the best. It's not like in your own house where you might have a garden and your own bathroom and a separate room to work in and sleep in. ""Most of the time is spent in my bedroom. It's nice but it can get me down a bit. I get out of bed, take two steps to my desk and that's what I do for most of the day. ""We share our bathrooms - there are five showers for eight of us which is plenty but we have designated two for the people who have tested positive so we have tried to contain the virus within our household."" What do campus outbreaks mean for students? University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' She also said the students needed practical help. ""I am slowly running out of food. I've only been here a week and haven't done a big food shop. I have been using up the few things I brought with me. It's another stressor to deal with."" She said students from her accommodation had socialised in other halls before the outbreak and had been ""mingling outside their household"". She added the threat from the university accommodation bosses that anyone breaking rules may be evicted was worrying. She said: ""Threats to kick people out are quite harsh. We took a decision as a group to be more responsible because we knew we didn't have somewhere to go if we got kicked out. It might make students think twice."" Robbie Low says social distancing is difficult in a tiny flat shared with nine others First year law student Robbie Low is staying in the University of Glasgow's Murano Street halls of residence, the epicentre of one of the main outbreaks. The 18-year-old, from Edinburgh, is sharing a flat with nine others Two girls in his flat have tested positive. Some others have had symptoms and are waiting for test results. He said: ""Freshers Week was good - maybe too good now we see the consequences of that. ""I arrived on the 14th (of September), and that Monday was the last day people were properly mixing, then it died down after that and there was a police presence."" He said a mobile testing unit had been set up outside the Murano halls but that some students, against regulations, had gone home. He said: ""Some people in my block have been extracted by their parents and are self-isolating at home now. But I wouldn't do that. ""I don't want to expose my parents to the virus. We came here knowing this was a likely scenario and we have all just made sure we don't see vulnerable members of our family."" Robbie says staying apart in his small flat is hard. ""The kitchen is small - the same size as for a five-person flat, so it's hard to socially distance in the flat."" Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow Concerned mum Amanda from Argyll is in regular contact with her 18-year-old daughter who is living in a five-person student flat within the Murano halls. She told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Kaye Adams: ""I believe the architect of the Murano halls was famed for prison designs. And it has been a tough and lonely situation. ""My daughter was the first in her flat to test positive and there was a bit of a social stigma to that."" In her flat, Amanda's daughter shares a bathroom and a kitchen with four others, which makes self-isolating difficult. Amanda said: ""She has to get into PPE to go for a pee. Then she has to disinfect everything - the flusher, the taps, the sink, the door handle before she can go back to her tiny room. It's the last thing you want to do when you are feeling rubbish. ""She can't access the kitchen at the same time as any of the others so she goes in there alone to cook in PPE and again has to disinfect everything - the taps, the surfaces, the cooker, knives if she has used them. ""She ran out of fresh fruit and veg early and is now on to the stock of dried food we sent her to Glasgow with."" Amanda also said that laundry was an issue because ""not much"" was done in the first two weeks at university. Three of the five freshers in her flat have tested positive for the virus now and the other two are awaiting results, but they are all self-isolating. The Covid clusters in Glasgow are centred on two halls of residence, the Murano Street Village and Cairncross residences, with 172 students testing positive so far. The university said the actual number of infected students was ""likely to be higher"" and blamed social activity at the start of freshers' week, from 12 to 14 September. It said the affected students had access to food and other supplies, and that advice on medical issues - including mental health and wellbeing - was also being made available. Elsewhere in Scotland, all 500 residents atParker House in Dundee have been asked to self-isolateuntil contact tracing is complete after three confirmed coronavirus cases. In Aberdeen, 72 residents at Hillhead student village are self isolating after students tested positive. Aberdeen University has urged anyone who has attended parties or other gatherings since Friday to come forward to aid contact tracing efforts - and promised they will not be punished for breaching guidance if they do.

Cineworld swings to huge loss after virus closuresThe cinema chain warns it may need to raise more money in the event of further coronavirus restrictions.,"Cineworld has warned it may need to raise more money in the event of further coronavirus restrictions or film delays due to Covid-19. It swung to a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June as its cinemas were closed under lockdown. ""There can be no certainty as to the future impact of Covid-19 on the group,"" it said. The cinema giant said it had reopened 561 out of 778 sites worldwide as lockdown restrictions have eased. Six of its theatres in the UK remain closed after cinemas were forced to shut temporarily for several months from mid-March in an attempt to contain the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown closures meant group revenues sank to $712.4m in the first six months of the year, compared with $2.15bn a year earlier. The group loss this year also marks a huge fall from the pre-tax profits of $139.7m seen in the first six months of 2019. Cineworld directors waive salaries as virus impact hits Tenet gives shot in arm to UK and Ireland cinemas What are the new coronavirus restrictions? Cineworld said it was still in talks with lenders to negotiate waivers on banking agreements, which fall due in December and in June next year. The company warned that it might have to take action if current measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus were tightened. ""If governments were to strengthen restrictions on social gathering, which may therefore oblige us to close our estate again or further push back movie releases, it would have a negative impact on our financial performance and likely require the need to raise additional liquidity."" Independent London cinema Peckhamplex recently announced it was being forced to close its doors temporarily due to falling visitor numbers and delayed releases. In an email to regular visitors, it said that ""the film distributors that we rent our films from are constantly re-scheduling the big titles to further and further away"". Under current plans, the cinema will close on 25 September and hopes to reopen in November, around the time the next James Bond film is due to be released. But Cineworld said recent trading had been ""encouraging considering the circumstances"", with solid demand for Christopher Nolan's spy film Tenet released earlier in September. ""Despite the difficult events of the last few months, we have been delighted by the return of global audiences to our cinemas toward the end of the first half, as well as by the positive customer feedback we have received from those that have waited patiently to see a movie on the big screen again,"" said chief executive Mooky Greidinger. ""Current trading has been encouraging considering the circumstances, further underpinning our belief that there remains a significant difference between watching a movie in a cinema - with high-quality screens and best-in-class sounds - to watching it at home."" Cineworld's share price fell by more than 13% on Thursday after the publication of its half-year results. ""Today's first half-year numbers serve to highlight the scale of the mountain that needs to be scaled by the sector as a whole,"" said Michael Hewson, senior analyst at CMC Markets. He added that they ""certainly back up"" Cineworld's decision in June to pull out of a $2.1bn deal to buy the Canadian cinema chain Cineplex. The two firms now face a legal battle after Cineplex announced it would sue Cineworld for $1.1bn in damages. Cineworld said on Thursday it had filed a counterclaim against the Canadian group for alleged ""losses suffered as a result of Cineplex's breaches"" of their agreement, as well as lost financing costs and advisory fees.

UK can be 'Saudi Arabia of wind power' - PMThe UK prime minister says the UK holds extraordinary potential for wind power.Science & Environment,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to make a ""big bet"" on renewables, turning the UK into the ""Saudi Arabia"" of wind power. Talking via video link to a roundtable discussion at the UN in New York, he said the country held ""extraordinary potential"" for wind energy. He said the UK should embrace a range of new technologies to achieve its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The UK holds the presidency of the UN climate conference, known as the COP. But because of the coronavirus crisis, the annual gathering will not take place this year. It has instead been postponed until November 2021. China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal What is in the Paris climate agreement? Covid crisis does little to slow climate change The prime minister said the UK had an ambitious agenda for the meeting and called on other countries to show similar ambition. He praised the recent pledge by China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Mr Johnson reiterated his government's pledge to ""build back greener"" after the Covid-19 pandemic, through a green industrial revolution. He promised to deliver thousands of new jobs in the process. As regards wind power, Mr Johnson said: ""We've got huge, huge gusts of wind going around the north of our country - Scotland. Quite extraordinary potential we have for wind."" On the question of new technologies, the prime minister also said he wanted the UK to take the lead in carbon capture and storage  (CCS) technology, in which greenhouse gas emissions are captured from sources such as power stations and then stored underground. Mr Johnson said the UK had ""quite extraordinary potential"" for wind power Mr Johnson said this was a technology he ""barely believed was possible, but I am now a complete evangelist for"". He said the country would also be investing in renewable hydrogen fuel technology to provide what he called ""grunt""  for ""trucks, for trains, even perhaps for planes - for vehicles that aren't readily capable of being moved by electric batteries"". Like many other countries, he said the UK government was also thinking of bringing forward the date for phasing out new petrol and diesel cars.  It's thought that date will be 2030, with 2035 for plug-in hybrids - but this has not yet been confirmed. This would help accelerate the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs). The government would be continuing its ongoing investments in solar power and nuclear energy: ""I do think nuclear has to be part of the mix,"" the prime minister said. Plug-in hybrids are a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Something that might have got a bit lost amongst Mr Johnsons references to the UK not ""lagging on lagging"" or the need to get hydrogen ""grunt"" to power the nation's trucks was just how important the Glasgow conference is. It was only at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015 that the world actually agreed that all nations needed to do their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even as the Paris conference closed, the participants knew the commitments made were not sufficient to meet the UN's stated goal of keeping temperature rises well below 2C. That is why they agreed to review their ambitions every five years. The idea is that they will keep raising the bar, doubling down on the efforts to moderate climate change. Mr Johnson's goal today was to urge them to bring the boldest possible carbon cuts at a new meeting marking the anniversary of the Paris agreement on 12 December. What they bring to that meeting will kick off a year of negotiations designed to get them to go even further eleven months later at Glasgow. So Mr Johnson was beginning a process that will determine how successful the conference will be and - much more important - will also determine the future direction of global climate. The UK plans to invest in hydrogen-powered vehicles In addition, homes would have to be improved so that they emit far fewer emissions. ""Putting in lagging, changing the way the windows are configured, all kinds of things - changing the boilers. You can do so much to make a home less carbon-emitting. ""The UK may sometimes be accused of lagging in some things my friends, but we will never be lagging in lagging."" Mr Johnson said the UK's greenhouse gases were 8-10% down in 2020 on previous years. But added: ""The bad news is we've achieved that by sustaining an appalling economic shock in the form of coronavirus. ""The only way we've done - or we're going to do it - is as you can imagine because our planes aren't flying, our people aren't moving, our cars aren't travelling and our industry isn't producing emissions in the way that it normally would."" At the roundtable, Ursula Van der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said that keeping global temperature rise under 1.5C - considered the gateway to dangerous global warming - was still possible ""if we act quickly and if we act together"".

Cineworld swings to huge loss after virus closures,"Cineworld has warned it may need to raise more money in the event of further coronavirus restrictions or film delays due to Covid-19. It swung to a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June as its cinemas were closed under lockdown. ""There can be no certainty as to the future impact of Covid-19 on the group,"" it said. The cinema giant said it had reopened 561 out of 778 sites worldwide as lockdown restrictions have eased. Six of its theatres in the UK remain closed after cinemas were forced to shut temporarily for several months from mid-March in an attempt to contain the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown closures meant group revenues sank to $712.4m in the first six months of the year, compared with $2.15bn a year earlier. The group loss this year also marks a huge fall from the pre-tax profits of $139.7m seen in the first six months of 2019. Cineworld directors waive salaries as virus impact hits Tenet gives shot in arm to UK and Ireland cinemas What are the new coronavirus restrictions? Cineworld said it was still in talks with lenders to negotiate waivers on banking agreements, which fall due in December and in June next year. The company warned that it might have to take action if current measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus were tightened. ""If governments were to strengthen restrictions on social gathering, which may therefore oblige us to close our estate again or further push back movie releases, it would have a negative impact on our financial performance and likely require the need to raise additional liquidity."" Independent London cinema Peckhamplex recently announced it was being forced to close its doors temporarily due to falling visitor numbers and delayed releases. In an email to regular visitors, it said that ""the film distributors that we rent our films from are constantly re-scheduling the big titles to further and further away"". Under current plans, the cinema will close on 25 September and hopes to reopen in November, around the time the next James Bond film is due to be released. But Cineworld said recent trading had been ""encouraging considering the circumstances"", with solid demand for Christopher Nolan's spy film Tenet released earlier in September. ""Despite the difficult events of the last few months, we have been delighted by the return of global audiences to our cinemas toward the end of the first half, as well as by the positive customer feedback we have received from those that have waited patiently to see a movie on the big screen again,"" said chief executive Mooky Greidinger. ""Current trading has been encouraging considering the circumstances, further underpinning our belief that there remains a significant difference between watching a movie in a cinema - with high-quality screens and best-in-class sounds - to watching it at home."" Cineworld's share price fell by more than 13% on Thursday after the publication of its half-year results. ""Today's first half-year numbers serve to highlight the scale of the mountain that needs to be scaled by the sector as a whole,"" said Michael Hewson, senior analyst at CMC Markets. He added that they ""certainly back up"" Cineworld's decision in June to pull out of a $2.1bn deal to buy the Canadian cinema chain Cineplex. The two firms now face a legal battle after Cineplex announced it would sue Cineworld for $1.1bn in damages. Cineworld said on Thursday it had filed a counterclaim against the Canadian group for alleged ""losses suffered as a result of Cineplex's breaches"" of their agreement, as well as lost financing costs and advisory fees.

We'll be back tomorrow. The live page writers today were: Joseph Lee, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Victoria Bisset, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. A flag tribute to Americans who have died with Covid-19 can been seen in Washington DC In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for today. Before then, here's a recap of the main UK stories from today. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Read more More than 40 children have tested positive after an outbreak linked to a wedding in the German town of Hamm, German news agency DPA reports. Nine schools have been affected by the cluster of cases, a spokesman for the city said on Thursday, adding that only one of the children infected had no connection to the wedding. Of the almost 200 people in the town to have tested positive, 150 were guests at the wedding, according to the town's official website. A total of 300 people are currently in quarantine and are subject to mandatory testing. The news comes as a second German minister went into quarantine after he was found to have contact with an infected individual. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who hosted a meeting of EU trade ministers in Berlin on Monday, said he was self-isolating as a precaution after the employee of a minister who attended had tested positive. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was in quarantine after a member of his security staff tested positive. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tested positive on Wednesday The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Russia has reached 6,595, the highest since mid-July. In the capital, Moscow, cases are at their highest level since late June. Russia has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and almost 20,000 deaths since the pandemic began, and there are fears the new figures could signal a new wave in the country. Moscow has already registered the world's first coronavirus vaccine, despite experts saying the trials were too small to prove its safety and effectiveness. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, lambasted the US over its coronavirus criticism Senior diplomats from China and the US have lashed out at each other at a meeting of the UN Security Council, deepening a row over the coronavirus pandemic. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, used his speech to reject US attempts to blame the country for the pandemic. âI must say, enough is enough! You have created enough troubles for the world already,"" he told the meeting via video link on Thursday. âIf someone should be held accountable, it should be a few US politicians themselves.â His comments appeared to be a response to US President Donald Trump,who called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemicin his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week. Tensions between China and the US have flared over the pandemic and a number of other issues, including trade and alleged human rights abuses. The US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, voiced anger at the tone of Thursdayâs UN Security Council meeting. ""You know, shame on each of you. I am astonished and I am disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. Earlier, we reported thatthe UK recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases on Thursday- the highest figure since mass testing began. The below charts show the trends in cases and deaths - both before and since mass testing became available. However, hospital admissions data was not available in Thursday's figures, which are released by the government. You can look at more detail at the numbers in our piece tracking UK caseshere. More than 10,000 people have died in Indonesia Indonesia has seen a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. More than 4,600 new infections were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number to 262,000. More than 10,000 people have died in the country since the pandemic began. Indonesia is the 17th country to pass 10,000 Covid deaths, While the official figures are the highest in South East Asia, there are fears the true number of cases could be much higher due to the country's low testing rate. Earlier this week, the official in charge of the country's coronavirus response in the nine worst-hit provinces police and the military could break up illegal rallies in the run-up to December's regional elections. More than 25,000 people have died with coronavirus in Iran, official figures show, as the country witnesses a spike in cases. A ministry spokesman said today that 175 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 25,015. However,an investigation by BBC Persian earlier this yearfound the number of coronavirus deaths was nearly three times as high as the official statistics. The government's own records appeared to show almost 42,000 people had died with Covid-19 symptoms in the run up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry at the time. The country is the worst affected in the Middle East, with more than 436,000 coronavirus cases recorded to date. Earlier this week, an official warned the country is facing a third wave of infections. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The official records may show that the UK has just seen the highest number of new cases reported on a single day.  But it is, of course, nothing of the sort.  At the peak of the pandemic in the spring we had such limited testing capacity that it was largely only hospital patients who were being checked.  It meant we were identifying just the tip of the iceberg.  Estimates have suggested there may have been as many 100,000 cases a day at the peak.  We are clearly not capturing all the infections - even now with the mass testing that is available.  Surveillance data last week suggested we may only be identifying around a half of cases. But that still puts the infection levels well below what they were in the spring.  Hospital admissions and deaths have also started creeping up, but are still very low.  Health experts have been clear we are now on the upwards path so we should expect this trend to continue. Crucial will be how quickly figures rise for all three measures - with the hospital cases and deaths the most important. Evidence from Spain and France, which started seeing rises a few weeks before us, offer some hope. Cases have been climbing gradually - at least more gradually than the trajectory government scientists warned could lead the UK to 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italian President Sergio Mattarella responded to Boris Johnson's comments on Thursday The president of Italy has rebuked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for suggesting that Britons were more ""freedom-loving"" than his compatriots. It was in parliament this week that Johnson was asked by a Labour MP whether Italy and Germany had lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK because of more efficient testing and tracing. ""No"" the prime minister replied. ""There is an important difference between our country and many others around the world - ours is a freedom-loving country,"" he added. Now, Italian President Sergio Mattarella has responded, telling reporters: ""We Italians also love freedom â but seriousness is dear to us as well."" Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus and impose a national lockdown, appears to have brought the pandemic under control. Mask-wearing is scrupulous, testing is widespread and restrictions have remained in place for a long time. But in a country that fought for independence and liberation from Nazi occupation, its president has reminded Johnson that the love of freedom isn't exclusively a British value. Plans to resume weekly mass participation Parkrun events in October have been scrapped due to stricter coronavirus rules. The events, which take place in more than 700 parks across the UK, were suspendedin March because of the pandemic. Organisers had hoped to resume in October, but new rules introduced due to rising case numbers have forced a re-think. Parkrun chief executive Nick Pearson said they felt it ""would be insensitive to push forward with reopening"". Read more Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven warned against complacency Sweden has seen a âworryingâ rise in coronavirus infections in parts of the country where people have not been taking social distancing seriously, its prime minister has said. Stefan Lofven said the coronavirus situation in Sweden was âstableâ compared to other countries, but there were signs of a resurgence. ""That's worrying. It requires that we tighten our behaviour,"" the prime minister said at a media briefing on Thursday. âThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs and parties, bus trips in rush-hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal.â Sweden has recorded more than 90,000 infections and almost 6,000 deaths to date, higher figures than its Nordic neighbours on both counts. Unlike most countries, Sweden did not impose a sweeping lockdown at the height of the pandemicâs first wave. Instead, the countryâs health officials emphasised personal responsibility, with limited restrictions on life. We reported earlier that the UK has reported 6,634 new cases, up from 6,178 the day before. Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""The signals are clear. Positivity rates are rising across all age groups and we're continuing to see spikes in rates of admission to hospital and critical care. ""We must all follow the new measures that have been bought in to help control the virus and download the new NHS Covid-19 App which is the fastest way of knowing when you're at risk."" She also said: ""This is the highest number recorded and a stark warning for us all."" While 6,634 cases is the highest number recorded by mass testing, experts believe the true number of daily cases was far higher earlier in the pandemic. France is one of the countries to have witnessed a rise in cases Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, with countries on the brink of national lockdowns amid a second wave of infections, the European Union's health commissioner has warned. ""It might be our last chance to prevent a repeat of last spring,"" Stella Kyriakides said today. ""All member states must be ready to roll out measures immediately and at the right time."" Earlier this year, countries across Europe imposed strict nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus, grinding economic activity to an abrupt halt. Allow Twitter content?

Kyriakides's warning echoesthat of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),external, which today said it was concerned about the rising number of infections on the continent. The EU agency said health messages ""should emphasise that the pandemic is far from over"", adding that the current situation ""poses an increasing risk of infection for vulnerable individuals"" and health workers. The UK government has announced another 6,634 Covid-19 cases - that's an increase on Wednesday's figure, which was 6,178. They also said a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. That's up from 37 deaths announced on Wednesday. We'll have more charts setting out the spread of the virus in the UK later. We've been reporting today on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new measures to support jobs and the economy, including the Job Support Scheme, which will replace the Job Retention Scheme. But the government has also repeatedly referred to an existing measure aimed at encouraging employers to keep on staff that had been furloughed. The Job Retention Bonus is a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee still in meaningful employment at the end of January. Eligible employees must earn at least Â£520 a month on average between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said the bonus, in conjunction with the Job Support Scheme, has given firms a ""big incentive"" to retain staff merely until the end of January. Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and the Caribbean island of Curacao have been removed from the UK government's list of travel corridors, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. That means travellers arriving in England from those countries after 04:00 BST on Saturday must self-isolate for 14 days, Shapps said. He reminded travellers that they must self-isolate when returning from a non-exempt country, or face a fine starting from Â£1,000. Allow Twitter content?

Uni self-isolation: PPE to pee and being stuck in bedroom,"Hundreds of students have been asked to self-isolate in their halls of residence following Covid outbreaks at several Scottish universities. They include 600 at the University of Glasgow and another 500 at Abertay University in Dundee. So what's it like to self-isolate in a student flat? One student, who is self isolating because of positive cases in her student household, told the BBC she has had to adapt quickly. She said: ""Being asked to isolate in uni halls isn't the best. It's not like in your own house where you might have a garden and your own bathroom and a separate room to work in and sleep in. ""Most of the time is spent in my bedroom. It's nice but it can get me down a bit. I get out of bed, take two steps to my desk and that's what I do for most of the day. ""We share our bathrooms - there are five showers for eight of us which is plenty but we have designated two for the people who have tested positive so we have tried to contain the virus within our household."" What do campus outbreaks mean for students? University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' She also said the students needed practical help. ""I am slowly running out of food. I've only been here a week and haven't done a big food shop. I have been using up the few things I brought with me. It's another stressor to deal with."" She said students from her accommodation had socialised in other halls before the outbreak and had been ""mingling outside their household"". She added the threat from the university accommodation bosses that anyone breaking rules may be evicted was worrying. She said: ""Threats to kick people out are quite harsh. We took a decision as a group to be more responsible because we knew we didn't have somewhere to go if we got kicked out. It might make students think twice."" Robbie Low says social distancing is difficult in a tiny flat shared with nine others First year law student Robbie Low is staying in the University of Glasgow's Murano Street halls of residence, the epicentre of one of the main outbreaks. The 18-year-old, from Edinburgh, is sharing a flat with nine others Two girls in his flat have tested positive. Some others have had symptoms and are waiting for test results. He said: ""Freshers Week was good - maybe too good now we see the consequences of that. ""I arrived on the 14th (of September), and that Monday was the last day people were properly mixing, then it died down after that and there was a police presence."" He said a mobile testing unit had been set up outside the Murano halls but that some students, against regulations, had gone home. He said: ""Some people in my block have been extracted by their parents and are self-isolating at home now. But I wouldn't do that. ""I don't want to expose my parents to the virus. We came here knowing this was a likely scenario and we have all just made sure we don't see vulnerable members of our family."" Robbie says staying apart in his small flat is hard. ""The kitchen is small - the same size as for a five-person flat, so it's hard to socially distance in the flat."" Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow Concerned mum Amanda from Argyll is in regular contact with her 18-year-old daughter who is living in a five-person student flat within the Murano halls. She told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Kaye Adams: ""I believe the architect of the Murano halls was famed for prison designs. And it has been a tough and lonely situation. ""My daughter was the first in her flat to test positive and there was a bit of a social stigma to that."" In her flat, Amanda's daughter shares a bathroom and a kitchen with four others, which makes self-isolating difficult. Amanda said: ""She has to get into PPE to go for a pee. Then she has to disinfect everything - the flusher, the taps, the sink, the door handle before she can go back to her tiny room. It's the last thing you want to do when you are feeling rubbish. ""She can't access the kitchen at the same time as any of the others so she goes in there alone to cook in PPE and again has to disinfect everything - the taps, the surfaces, the cooker, knives if she has used them. ""She ran out of fresh fruit and veg early and is now on to the stock of dried food we sent her to Glasgow with."" Amanda also said that laundry was an issue because ""not much"" was done in the first two weeks at university. Three of the five freshers in her flat have tested positive for the virus now and the other two are awaiting results, but they are all self-isolating. The Covid clusters in Glasgow are centred on two halls of residence, the Murano Street Village and Cairncross residences, with 172 students testing positive so far. The university said the actual number of infected students was ""likely to be higher"" and blamed social activity at the start of freshers' week, from 12 to 14 September. It said the affected students had access to food and other supplies, and that advice on medical issues - including mental health and wellbeing - was also being made available. Elsewhere in Scotland, all 500 residents atParker House in Dundee have been asked to self-isolateuntil contact tracing is complete after three confirmed coronavirus cases. In Aberdeen, 72 residents at Hillhead student village are self isolating after students tested positive. Aberdeen University has urged anyone who has attended parties or other gatherings since Friday to come forward to aid contact tracing efforts - and promised they will not be punished for breaching guidance if they do.

Developer coalition takes on Apple App Store,"Several major developers have formed a coalition to fight Apple over its app store policies. The Coalition for App Fairness counts Spotify, Epic Games and Tinder owner Match Group among its founding members. It claims Apple ""taxes consumers and crushes innovation"", criticising what it calls anti-competitive policies. Apple, which is embroiled in legal action with some of the members, has long denied these accusations. Google, which runs the Play app store on Android, is not mentioned in the group's launch statement but is named elsewhere on its website, and accused of similar policies. The coalition has been established as an independent non-profit organisation, and is open to other developers - regardless of size - to join. Alongside an11-point ""vision"",external, the group has identified three key issues it will campaign on: alleged anti-competitive policies from both Apple and Google, which it says limits products and features available to consumers the 30% cut that both Apple and Google take from sales through their app stores, which the group says is an ""app tax"" what it alleges is a lack of consumer freedom, with ""no competition, no options, no recourse"" Some of the founding members are longstanding public critics of Apple's policies in particular. Epic Games has in recent months been involved in avery public spat with Apple- and to a lesser extent, Google - after it deliberately breached their guidelines and began a legal battle over them.

Spotify, meanwhile, hasfiled a complaint with the European Union against Apple's policies, while Tile has previously accused Apple of anti-competitive behaviour, making antitrust claims in the US and Europe. Basecamp, another member, is behind Hey - an email app which found itself at the centre of anenormous public disputeover the App Store earlier this year. And Prepear, a listed member, is a relatively small firm which recently found itselfdefending its logo from a trademark disputeafter Apple said the pear shape was too similar to its own logo. In a statement about the coalition, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said: ""The basic freedoms of developers are under attack. ""We are an advocate for any company that's ready to reclaim its rights and challenge the anti-competitive behaviours that exist on app stores today."" This video can not be played Jaden ""Wolfiez"" Ashman became the youngest esports player to win a million dollars Match Group, which owns Tinder and other dating apps, said it was joining because Apple's in-app purchase system ""forces consumers to pay higher prices by inserting Apple between app developers and their users, leading to customer confusion and dissatisfaction that has far-reaching implications for our businesses"". Other founding members include Blix, Blockchain.com, Deezer, the European Publishers Council, News Media Europe, Protonmail and SkyDemon. Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' app economy Apple makes concessions to App Store developers Apple fires back in Fortnite App Store battle Apple has yet to comment directly on the formation of the new group. But it maintains that its 30% cut of App Store sales is in line with industry standards and other digital marketplaces. It has also recently released new statistics on its investment in user security and privacy last year, including: rejecting more than 150,000 app submissions for violating privacy guidelines reviewing more than 100,000 apps every week rejecting more than a million apps for harmful, objectionable, or illegal content removing more than 60 million spam reviews Such investments are one of the arguments Apple puts forward for retaining control of its ecosystem, arguing that it leads to increased security and safety for users.

Editor who exposed Thalidomide impact dies aged 92,"Former Sunday Times editor Sir Harold Evans has died at the age of 92. The British-American journalist, who led an investigation into the drug Thalidomide, died of heart failure in New York, his wife Tina Brown said. His 70-year career also saw him work as a magazine founder, book publisher, author and - at the time of his death - Reuters' editor-at-large. Sir Harold was editor of the Sunday Times for 14 years and oversaw many campaigns in that time. He then went on to become the founding editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine and later president of the publishing giant, Random House. Obituary: Sir Harold Evans One of Britain and America's best-known journalists, Sir Harold also wrote several books about the press and in 2003 was given a knighthood for his services to journalism. A year earlier, a poll by the Press Gazette and the British Journalism Review named him the greatest newspaper editor of all time. Author and editorTina Brown said on Twitter,externalthat her husband was ""the most magical of men"" and had been ""my soulmate for 39 years"". Sir Harold Evans was appointed editor-at-large at the Reuters news agency in 2011 Sir Harold forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950. During his tenure as editor of the Sunday Times, his notable campaigns included fighting the Distillers Company for greater compensation for those affected by Thalidomide. But he said campaigns should be selective, and he deplored what he saw as the invasion of privacy by the British tabloid press. Thalidomide, which first appeared in the UK in 1958, was prescribed to expectant mothers to control the symptoms of morning sickness. However, hundreds of these mothers in Britain, and many thousands across the world, gave birth to children with missing limbs, deformed hearts, blindness and other problems. Thalidomide: Were more affected? Ageing in the wake of thalidomide Sir Harold's campaign, launched in 1972, eventually forced the UK manufacturer, Distillers Company - at the time the Sunday Times's biggest advertiser - to increase the compensation payments. He also fought a legal injunction to stop the paper revealing the drug's developers had not gone through the proper testing procedures. Speaking about his campaigning in a 2010 interview withthe Independent,external, Sir Harold said: ""I tried to do - all I hoped to do - was to shed a little light. And if that light grew weeds, we'd have to try and pull them up."" Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Grunenthal It was launched on 1 October 1957 First marketed as a sedative, it was then given to pregnant women to combat morning sickness As many as 10,000 babies of these women were born worldwide with deformities Sir Harold and his second wife Tina Brown pictured in 1989, after their move to New York City Sir Harold later edited the Times but left in 1981 following a public falling-out with the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, over editorial independence. Writing about,externaltheir relationship, Sir Harold described his decision not to ""campaign against"" Mr Murdoch's takeover of the papers as ""the worst in my professional career"". He added: ""My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what the Times became."" Harry Evans personified not only the noblest possibilities of journalism, but of social mobility in the 20th Century too. Born into what he called ""the respectable working-class"", his route to national and international acclaim via the streets of Manchester and Darlington - the latter as editor of the Northern Echo - is sadly a route few take today. He embodied the most romantic ideal of an editor: a humble hack taking on mighty forces through the dogged pursuit of truth. Though he later fell out with Rupert Murdoch, and never forgave him, in his 14 years at the helm of the Sunday Times he redefined journalism itself. He was a master craftsman, in a trade where practical wisdom was precious and vital; and he combined a flair for layout, projection and design with a remarkable nose for a story, particularly those with human suffering at their heart. But above all he was brave. During his reign, it seemed no super-rich bully or powerful government could intimidate him. In our era of information overload, diminished trust in journalism, and fewer people willing to pay for news, the nostalgia for what he represented is impossible to resist. As he put it himself in the title of his wonderful memoir from 2009, he reached the top in Vanished Times. He had the resources, and the time, to hold power to account - and he did uniquely well. Mixed with his charm and sheer decency, this put journalism itself in a debt to him that will never be fully serviced. Journalists have paid tribute to his campaigning work on the Thalidomide scandal and other injustices. Alan Rusbridger, former editor of the Guardian, said he was a ""master craftsman of journalism"" who ""was the editor we all wanted to be"". Andrew Neil, a former editor of the Sunday Times, described Sir Harold as the ""greatest editor of his generation"" and one with an ""unerring instinct for a story"". Author Robert Harris told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Sir Harold was an outsider coming in to the Sunday Times, the ""son of a railway man who wanted to take on the establishment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who once worked as a journalist at the Times newspaper, described Sir Harold as a ""true pioneer of investigative journalism"" who ""will always be remembered"" for ""tirelessly campaigning on behalf of those who were affected"" by the Thalidomide scandal that he exposed. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ""Sir Harold Evans was a giant among journalists who strove to put the ordinary man and woman at the heart of his reporting."" And Glen Harrison, a Thalidomide survivor and deputy chairman of the campaign group Thalidomide UK, described Sir Harold as ""an outstanding human being for our cause"". After leaving the Times, Sir Harold and his second wife, Tina Brown, moved to New York. She edited Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, while he became founding editor of Conde Nast magazine. In 2011, at the age of 82, Sir Harold was appointed editor-at-large at Reuters, the organisation's editor-in-chief describing him as ""one of the greatest minds in journalism"".

Chinaâs new richest person is a bottled water tycoon,"The richest person is China is a bottled water tycoon, knocking Alibaba founder Jack Ma from his mantle. Zhong Shanshan founded  Nongfu Spring in 1996 in the Zhejiang province on China's Eastern coast. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index now puts Mr Shanshan in top spot with wealth of $58.7bn (Â£46.2bn). The recent stock market listing of his bottled water firm and a controlling stake in a vaccine maker have helped boost his fortunes. Nicknamed the ""Lone Wolf"", Mr Zhong is now Asia's second-richest person behind India's Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire behind Reliance Industries. China's mighty Ant heads for a mega market debut China's Star market aims to take on the Nasdaq Yum China's HK listing is the latest 'homecoming' Mr Zhong now ranks 17th overall on its list of the world's top 500 richest people. Most of China's new billionaires come from the tech industry. But rising tensions between China and the US over Huawei, TikTok and WeChat have pushed down valuations of Chinese tech stocks. China's food and grocery sector is now vying with its tech industry in producing the country's richest business people. In April, Mr Zhong's Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise listed on the Chinese stock market. His controlling stake in the firm saw his overall wealth jump as much as $20bn by August. The pharma company says it has partnered with two universities to develop a candidate vaccine to fight Covid-19. Zhong Shanshan founded Nongfu Spring in 1996 Nongfu Spring shares jumped 54% on the first day of trading earlier this month when they were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Nongfu Spring's red-capped bottles are sold nationwide from small stores to high-end hotels. The company also sells teas, flavoured vitamin drinks and juices. The successful stock market listing propelled Mr Zhong into China's top three richest people alongside Alibaba's Mr Ma and Tencent boss Pony Ma. But this week's downturn for tech stocks saw the Chinese tycoon move up the wealth rankings. Mr Zhong may not stay ahead of Mr Ma, who has held the top spot for the past six years, for long. Alibaba-backed Ant Group is due to list on Chinese and Hong Kong stock exchanges next month, which will boost the tech boss's wealth even further. The online payments firm could net Mr Ma an estimated $28bn if the company achieves the $250bn valuation it has been targeting.

Facebook's 'Supreme Court' to start before US vote,"Helle Thorning-Schmidt and 19 other influential figures will act as independent arbiters of Facebook and Instagram Facebook's Oversight Board is ""opening its doors to business"" in mid-October. Users will be able to file appeals against posts the firm has removed from its platforms, and the board can overrule decisions made by Facebook's moderators and executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. The timing means that some rulings could relate to the US Presidential election, which is on 3 November. But one member of the board told the BBC it expected to act slowly at first. ""In principle, we will be able to look at issues arising connected to the election and also after the election,"" Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former Prime Minister of Denmark, explained. ""But if Facebook takes something down or leaves something up the day after the election, there won't be a ruling the day after. ""That's not why we're here. We're here to take principled decisions and deliberate properly."" Earlier this week,Facebook's global affairs chief Nick Clegg,externaltold the Financial Times that if there was an ""extremely chaotic and, worse still, violent set of circumstances"" following a contested election result, it would act aggressively to ""significantly restrict the circulation of content on our platform"". In theory, the 20-person panel - which has been likened to the US Supreme Court - could force the firm to reverse some of its judgements. Ms Thorning-Schmidt said that the board had the capacity to examine ""expedited cases"" but preferred not to do so in its early days. Facebook first announced its plans toset up the Oversight Board a year ago, and it has taken until now to select its members and arrange how it will work in practice. The members will be paid an undisclosed sum, but are intended to serve as an independent body, and will decide which cases to look into. Their work will cover Facebook's main platform as well as the photo-centric app Instagram, which the company owns. In addition to user complaints, the board can also examine issues that the company has raised itself. This video can not be played WATCH: Facebook watchdog will not rush into rulings Facebook has said it expects cases to be resolvedwithin 90 days,external, including any action it is told to take. The panel's decisions are supposed to be binding and set a precedent for subsequent moderation decisions. Critics of the scheme have suggested it is a ""fig leaf"" designed to help Facebook avoid being regulated by others. But Ms Thorning-Schmidt said it was too early to write it off. ""It would be much better if the global community in the UN [United Nations] could come up with a content moderation system that could look into all social media platforms, but that is not going to happen,"" she said. ""So this is the second best. ""Give us two years to try to prove that it is better to have this board than not to have this board."" The following interview with Ms Thorning-Schmidt has been edited for brevity and clarity: Has Facebook already consulted the board about its plans to deal with election-related posts? It's very important to keep a distance between the Oversight Board and Facebook. So we don't have much to do with Facebook right now. And they don't consult us on what they should be doing. And we don't think they should consult us. And just to be clear - in the days after the election, you might ask for a removed post to be put back up on Facebook or Instagram? Yes, it is it is an option. But we are focused on quality rather than speed. Facebook has been criticised for moving fast and breaking things. We want to move slowly and try to create something which is sustainable in the long run. So if Facebook takes down something right after the election, or leaves something up, there won't be a ruling the day after from the Oversight Board. In theory, the Oversight Board has the right to overrule Mark Zuckerberg himself. But since he still controls the majority of Facebook's voting shares, isn't there a risk he in turn overrules whatever you decided? It was very, very clear to us when we were appointed that we will work with transparency and independence. If Facebook doesn't follow our decisions, it won't last very long. The obligation from Facebook, including, of course Mark Zuckerberg, is to follow our decisions. So that is the red line for us and not up for discussion. Mark Zuckerberg has a disproportionate share of Facebook's voting rights given that he owns a 13% stake Presumably that means you'd resign? I don't think we should talk about these issues. We want to give this a serious go. I'm urging everyone to look at the Oversight Board and not make the perfect the enemy of the good. This is the best we have these days to try to regulate content on social media. I have not seen any other ways of doing this. And we are all committed to given this giving this a real chance. Facebook's not been short of controversies over recent years. There's been Cambridge Analytica, hate speech directed at the Rohingyas in Myanmar, a decision not to take down posts from Holocaust deniers, and a decision to take a less interventionist stance on some of President Trump's posts than Twitter has done. Which of these or other cases do you think might have turned out differently had the Oversight Board already existed? I understand that you want to discuss current examples. And I do find that fascinating as well. But I also think it would be wrong for a board member to go into concrete issues because it would pre-empt our decisions later on. There's been some quite horrific examples in the past, and there will probably be more horrific examples in the future. I have no doubt that the board will look into fact-checking and whether there was real harm caused by content that was left up for too long, which they should have taken down. Some critics are concerned that this is still a form of self-regulation, and what is needed is external intervention by politicians and official watchdogs. I think these big tech firms, social media platforms, need regulation in many areas. There is a need for regulation in terms of tax issues. And there's probably also a need for regulation in terms of data protection and how long you keep data. I've argued very adamantly for a duty of care for Facebook and other social media providers. But the board is not taking the place of regulation. Perhaps rather the opposite. The more rulings and decisions we make, the more it will become clear that we need a better conversation about content, and perhaps also more regulation around content.

Uni self-isolation: PPE to pee and being stuck in bedroomHow students in Glasgow halls of residence are coping with self-isolation amid a coronavirus outbreak.Scotland,"Hundreds of students have been asked to self-isolate in their halls of residence following Covid outbreaks at several Scottish universities. They include 600 at the University of Glasgow and another 500 at Abertay University in Dundee. So what's it like to self-isolate in a student flat? One student, who is self isolating because of positive cases in her student household, told the BBC she has had to adapt quickly. She said: ""Being asked to isolate in uni halls isn't the best. It's not like in your own house where you might have a garden and your own bathroom and a separate room to work in and sleep in. ""Most of the time is spent in my bedroom. It's nice but it can get me down a bit. I get out of bed, take two steps to my desk and that's what I do for most of the day. ""We share our bathrooms - there are five showers for eight of us which is plenty but we have designated two for the people who have tested positive so we have tried to contain the virus within our household."" What do campus outbreaks mean for students? University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' She also said the students needed practical help. ""I am slowly running out of food. I've only been here a week and haven't done a big food shop. I have been using up the few things I brought with me. It's another stressor to deal with."" She said students from her accommodation had socialised in other halls before the outbreak and had been ""mingling outside their household"". She added the threat from the university accommodation bosses that anyone breaking rules may be evicted was worrying. She said: ""Threats to kick people out are quite harsh. We took a decision as a group to be more responsible because we knew we didn't have somewhere to go if we got kicked out. It might make students think twice."" Robbie Low says social distancing is difficult in a tiny flat shared with nine others First year law student Robbie Low is staying in the University of Glasgow's Murano Street halls of residence, the epicentre of one of the main outbreaks. The 18-year-old, from Edinburgh, is sharing a flat with nine others Two girls in his flat have tested positive. Some others have had symptoms and are waiting for test results. He said: ""Freshers Week was good - maybe too good now we see the consequences of that. ""I arrived on the 14th (of September), and that Monday was the last day people were properly mixing, then it died down after that and there was a police presence."" He said a mobile testing unit had been set up outside the Murano halls but that some students, against regulations, had gone home. He said: ""Some people in my block have been extracted by their parents and are self-isolating at home now. But I wouldn't do that. ""I don't want to expose my parents to the virus. We came here knowing this was a likely scenario and we have all just made sure we don't see vulnerable members of our family."" Robbie says staying apart in his small flat is hard. ""The kitchen is small - the same size as for a five-person flat, so it's hard to socially distance in the flat."" Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow Concerned mum Amanda from Argyll is in regular contact with her 18-year-old daughter who is living in a five-person student flat within the Murano halls. She told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Kaye Adams: ""I believe the architect of the Murano halls was famed for prison designs. And it has been a tough and lonely situation. ""My daughter was the first in her flat to test positive and there was a bit of a social stigma to that."" In her flat, Amanda's daughter shares a bathroom and a kitchen with four others, which makes self-isolating difficult. Amanda said: ""She has to get into PPE to go for a pee. Then she has to disinfect everything - the flusher, the taps, the sink, the door handle before she can go back to her tiny room. It's the last thing you want to do when you are feeling rubbish. ""She can't access the kitchen at the same time as any of the others so she goes in there alone to cook in PPE and again has to disinfect everything - the taps, the surfaces, the cooker, knives if she has used them. ""She ran out of fresh fruit and veg early and is now on to the stock of dried food we sent her to Glasgow with."" Amanda also said that laundry was an issue because ""not much"" was done in the first two weeks at university. Three of the five freshers in her flat have tested positive for the virus now and the other two are awaiting results, but they are all self-isolating. The Covid clusters in Glasgow are centred on two halls of residence, the Murano Street Village and Cairncross residences, with 172 students testing positive so far. The university said the actual number of infected students was ""likely to be higher"" and blamed social activity at the start of freshers' week, from 12 to 14 September. It said the affected students had access to food and other supplies, and that advice on medical issues - including mental health and wellbeing - was also being made available. Elsewhere in Scotland, all 500 residents atParker House in Dundee have been asked to self-isolateuntil contact tracing is complete after three confirmed coronavirus cases. In Aberdeen, 72 residents at Hillhead student village are self isolating after students tested positive. Aberdeen University has urged anyone who has attended parties or other gatherings since Friday to come forward to aid contact tracing efforts - and promised they will not be punished for breaching guidance if they do.

VideoNew job scheme to help 'large numbers',"This video can not be played The UK chancellor has announced a new scheme which will see some workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. Rishi Sunak said it was ""impossible"" for him to predict the labour market, but added that the government needed ""evolve our supportâ for jobs.

Could UK adopt German or French scheme?,"Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages Unlike the UK, the Germans didn't have to invent a job support programme from scratch when the pandemic struck: they already had one oven-ready. While British companies were getting to grips with the novelty of furloughing workers at the government's expense, their German counterparts simply fell back on a tried and tested scheme. Now, while UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is insisting that the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will not continue past October, Germany is extending its Kurzarbeit job subsidy measures until the end of 2021. At the same time, France is following Germany's example and expects to be doing so for a couple of years. Germany extends coronavirus top-up pay scheme How are other economies dealing with the downturn? MPs want furlough extended to minimise job losses In the UK, influential figures including former prime minister Gordon Brown are urging the government to bring in a German or French-style system after October. So what are the German and French schemes and how do they work? ""I'm very glad we have this system,"" says Dr Volker Verch, director of the Central Westphalian employers' federation. ""We would have lost many more jobs, in my region and across the country, if we didn't have this Kurzarbeit,"" he told the BBC. ""Obviously it all has to be paid for, but it's worth it in terms of social harmony."" When the British scheme began, it was based on paying workers to stay at home and do nothing. It was not until July that furloughed employees were able to go back to work part-time. However, the German system was always about short-time working - allowing employers to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job. The government pays workers a percentage of the money they would have got for working those lost hours. Rolls-Royce Power Systems employs 5,500 workers in Germany According to the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research, at the height of the pandemic, half of all German firms had at least some of their staff on the scheme. That includes Rolls-Royce Power Systems, a German engineering company owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings and specialising in power generation and propulsion systems. It employs 9,000 people worldwide, 5,500 of them in Germany. Chief executive Andreas Schell told the BBC that the company came relatively late to the Kurzarbeit scheme. ""When the crisis came, we were sitting on a good order book,"" he says. ""But we anticipated a reduction in orders, and we had less to do in the third quarter, so we had to adjust our capacity."" In June, the firm put 1,000 of its German employees on ""short-time working"". That rose to 1,800 in July, before falling back in August and September as workers went on holiday instead. ""It's a really good programme of support by the German government,"" says Mr Schell. ""Otherwise we would have suffered economically. But it also helps to mitigate the economic consequences for our employees. It offers flexibility to us as a company and that's a good thing."" Andreas Schell has nothing but praise for the Kurzarbeit scheme Kurzarbeit has a long pedigree, going back to the early 20th Century. However, it came to prominence during the global financial crisis of 2008-09, when it is thought to have saved up to half a million jobs. Even in normal times, it can be used by companies undergoing restructuring or suffering from seasonal fluctuations in their business. But normally it lasts for only six months. During the pandemic, that has been increased to a maximum of 21 months, while the criteria have been changed to include more firms and workers. The percentage of lost wages paid by the government will also go up in stages, from the usual 60% to 80% after the first six months. In comparison with the UK's furlough scheme, the cost of Kurzarbeit seems relatively modest, perhaps reflecting its more limited scope. Berlin ploughed â¬23.5bn into bolstering the scheme at the start of the pandemic, then expanded it again in August, at an estimated cost of â¬10bn more, to run for all of next year. By contrast, the Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the UK's furlough scheme will have cost Â£60bn, about twice as much as the Germans are spending, by the time it ends in October. The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. It too is designed to subsidise the jobs of people on reduced working hours - and it's also intended for the long haul. Under the French scheme, firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The scheme is subject to all kinds of French bureaucracy, requiring firms to come to an agreement with unions and offer formal guarantees of job security, but the principle is the same as in Germany. CIC Orio is a specialist industrial firm Olivier Six is chief executive of two very different firms, both based in the Grenoble area. The bigger of the two, CIC Orio, is a metallurgy company that employs 150 people making industrial boilers and other specialised equipment. The other, G-Tech Guidetti, specialises in making hiking accessories. ""When the crisis began, there was a loss of confidence,"" he told the BBC. ""Firms were sitting on their funds, nobody was paying anybody."" G-Tech Guidetti, as a consumer-facing firm, was immediately hit by the lockdown, because all its stockists had to close, so all its 15 employees went on the partial activity scheme. ""But after confinement ended, there was a pick-up in consumption and the recovery was very strong,"" he says. CIC Orio, however, is still making use of the scheme. Its employees are currently working four days out of five, with the government compensating them for the lost day's earnings. ""It's fortunate that we have this scheme, because we're afraid that the crisis will come back again,"" he says. ""This will last a long time. There will probably be another year of very weak economic activity."" The French government describes its scheme as a ""bouclier anti-licenciements,external"" - that is, an anti-redundancy shield. For now, it appears to be working. But with cases of coronavirus on the rise again in France, it's anyone's guess how long it might be needed.

What happens when furlough ends?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring?

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

VAT cut to be extended,"The chancellor has announced the extension of a VAT cut for the hospitality and tourism sectors - some of the worst-hit by the pandemic. Rishi Sunak said that the temporary reduction of VAT rates from 20% to 5% would remain in place until 31 March 2021, rather than 13 January. The measure would ""help protect 2.4 million jobs through the winter"", he said. But industry figures said that they were ""still not out of the woods"". Restaurants and pubs in particular were affected by lockdown measures, and thousands of jobs in the sector have already been lost. The temporary VAT cut first came into force in July and was designed to help hotels, restaurants, cafes and pubs to shore up their finances. Some firms, however, such as KFC, Nando's and Pret, decided to pass on the savings directly to customers by cutting prices in their outlets. The chancellor said on Thursday that the extension to the VAT cut would help ""support more than 150,000 businesses"" through the winter period. The cut applies to food and non-alcoholic drinks, accommodation and admission to tourist attractions across the UK,according to the Treasury's Winter Economy Plan.,external In a press conference on Thursday, the chancellor said that the extension would cost the Treasury Â£800m - on top of the previous estimate of Â£2.5bn. Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. Read more about VAT. The chief executive of trade association UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said that the cut provided some good news for the sector after it was announced that pubs and restaurants in England must now close at 22:00 BST. ""The announcement of further restrictions was a significant hammer blow that will inevitably depress trading,"" she said. Curfew could be 'fatal blow' to some pubs and bars How are pubs keeping customers safe? 'Another lockdown would be disastrous for our business' ""It was crucial that the chancellor delivered support today that specifically targeted the hospitality sector which has been hit harder than any. ""The chancellor has given us some reason to be positive again but we urge him to engage with the trade on specific measures to keep people in work. ""While some of these measures announced today will give businesses a future to shoot for and hope that they can begin to rebuild, we are still not out of the woods."" In an attempt to boost consumer demand, Mr Sunak introduced the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August as restaurants and cafes gradually reopened over the summer. Many restaurants took part in the chancellor's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August Under the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Earlier in September, the Treasury saidthat more than 100 million meals had been claimed under the scheme, which saw restaurant bookings surge. But Will Hawkley, UK head of leisure at KPMG, labelled the scheme ""a distant memory"", with the government's job retention scheme winding down and the number of coronavirus cases rising in the UK. ""The leisure and tourism industry has understandably been feeling uneasy, if not left questioning its survival prospects,"" he said. ""While the chancellor may have demonstrated that the sector's woes haven't been overlooked, most businesses are likely to conclude that the extension of the VAT cut and the latest job support measures don't go far enough. ""Sadly not all operators will be able to survive and further job losses will be inevitable without further government support."" Many firms have been forced to make job cuts due to the impact the pandemic has had on trade overall. On Tuesday, Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn and Beefeater,warned that 6,000 staffcould lose their jobs after guest numbers had slumped. Last month,Pizza Express warned 1,100 peoplecould lose their jobs under its planned restructuring which will see the closure of 73 outlets.. In June, The Restaurant Group - which owns Frankie and Benny's -said it was cutting up to 3,000 jobs. âAnother lockdown would be disastrous for our businessâ 'Closing pubs at 10pm halves your takings' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Could UK adopt German scheme?,"Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages Unlike the UK, the Germans didn't have to invent a job support programme from scratch when the pandemic struck: they already had one oven-ready. While British companies were getting to grips with the novelty of furloughing workers at the government's expense, their German counterparts simply fell back on a tried and tested scheme. Now, while UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is insisting that the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will not continue past October, Germany is extending its Kurzarbeit job subsidy measures until the end of 2021. At the same time, France is following Germany's example and expects to be doing so for a couple of years. Germany extends coronavirus top-up pay scheme How are other economies dealing with the downturn? MPs want furlough extended to minimise job losses In the UK, influential figures including former prime minister Gordon Brown are urging the government to bring in a German or French-style system after October. So what are the German and French schemes and how do they work? ""I'm very glad we have this system,"" says Dr Volker Verch, director of the Central Westphalian employers' federation. ""We would have lost many more jobs, in my region and across the country, if we didn't have this Kurzarbeit,"" he told the BBC. ""Obviously it all has to be paid for, but it's worth it in terms of social harmony."" When the British scheme began, it was based on paying workers to stay at home and do nothing. It was not until July that furloughed employees were able to go back to work part-time. However, the German system was always about short-time working - allowing employers to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job. The government pays workers a percentage of the money they would have got for working those lost hours. Rolls-Royce Power Systems employs 5,500 workers in Germany According to the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research, at the height of the pandemic, half of all German firms had at least some of their staff on the scheme. That includes Rolls-Royce Power Systems, a German engineering company owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings and specialising in power generation and propulsion systems. It employs 9,000 people worldwide, 5,500 of them in Germany. Chief executive Andreas Schell told the BBC that the company came relatively late to the Kurzarbeit scheme. ""When the crisis came, we were sitting on a good order book,"" he says. ""But we anticipated a reduction in orders, and we had less to do in the third quarter, so we had to adjust our capacity."" In June, the firm put 1,000 of its German employees on ""short-time working"". That rose to 1,800 in July, before falling back in August and September as workers went on holiday instead. ""It's a really good programme of support by the German government,"" says Mr Schell. ""Otherwise we would have suffered economically. But it also helps to mitigate the economic consequences for our employees. It offers flexibility to us as a company and that's a good thing."" Andreas Schell has nothing but praise for the Kurzarbeit scheme Kurzarbeit has a long pedigree, going back to the early 20th Century. However, it came to prominence during the global financial crisis of 2008-09, when it is thought to have saved up to half a million jobs. Even in normal times, it can be used by companies undergoing restructuring or suffering from seasonal fluctuations in their business. But normally it lasts for only six months. During the pandemic, that has been increased to a maximum of 21 months, while the criteria have been changed to include more firms and workers. The percentage of lost wages paid by the government will also go up in stages, from the usual 60% to 80% after the first six months. In comparison with the UK's furlough scheme, the cost of Kurzarbeit seems relatively modest, perhaps reflecting its more limited scope. Berlin ploughed â¬23.5bn into bolstering the scheme at the start of the pandemic, then expanded it again in August, at an estimated cost of â¬10bn more, to run for all of next year. By contrast, the Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the UK's furlough scheme will have cost Â£60bn, about twice as much as the Germans are spending, by the time it ends in October. The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. It too is designed to subsidise the jobs of people on reduced working hours - and it's also intended for the long haul. Under the French scheme, firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The scheme is subject to all kinds of French bureaucracy, requiring firms to come to an agreement with unions and offer formal guarantees of job security, but the principle is the same as in Germany. CIC Orio is a specialist industrial firm Olivier Six is chief executive of two very different firms, both based in the Grenoble area. The bigger of the two, CIC Orio, is a metallurgy company that employs 150 people making industrial boilers and other specialised equipment. The other, G-Tech Guidetti, specialises in making hiking accessories. ""When the crisis began, there was a loss of confidence,"" he told the BBC. ""Firms were sitting on their funds, nobody was paying anybody."" G-Tech Guidetti, as a consumer-facing firm, was immediately hit by the lockdown, because all its stockists had to close, so all its 15 employees went on the partial activity scheme. ""But after confinement ended, there was a pick-up in consumption and the recovery was very strong,"" he says. CIC Orio, however, is still making use of the scheme. Its employees are currently working four days out of five, with the government compensating them for the lost day's earnings. ""It's fortunate that we have this scheme, because we're afraid that the crisis will come back again,"" he says. ""This will last a long time. There will probably be another year of very weak economic activity."" The French government describes its scheme as a ""bouclier anti-licenciements,external"" - that is, an anti-redundancy shield. For now, it appears to be working. But with cases of coronavirus on the rise again in France, it's anyone's guess how long it might be needed.

UK volunteers could be given virus to test vaccine,"Scientists around the globe are working on potential vaccines for coronavirus The UK could be the first country in the world to carry out Covid ""challenge trials"" - where healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with coronavirus to test possible vaccines. It is understood the studies - first reportedby the Financial Times,external- would be conducted in London. The UK government said it was holding discussions about developing a vaccine through such ""human challenge studies"". No contracts have yet been signed, the BBC understands. This video can not be played What are human challenge trials? How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? NHS Covid-19 app launches for the over-16s Alastair Fraser-Urquhart, an 18-year old university student, is planning on volunteering for the trial if it is given the green light to go ahead. He helps run the advocacy group, 1Day Sooner. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ""I think the challenge trial has the potential to save thousands of lives and really bring the world out of the pandemic sooner. It is just something that made instant sense to me."" Speaking on the same programme, Prof Peter Horby of Oxford University, said he thought the trial was a good idea that had the real potential to advance science and get a better understanding of the disease. He said: ""We now know the risk in a healthy young adult with no underlying conditions is extremely low. ""We suspected this before, but we really did not have the strength of evidence to go forward with challenging people with the virus -  but now I think there is clear data. ""The second thing that has changed is there are now some treatments that have been shown to have a benefit, so in the likely event that a a challenged person does becomes unwell, there are drugs that can be given very early to help control the disease."" Prof Horby said it is likely volunteers would be observed very closely and their immune systems would be monitored to see how they respond to the virus. There are - perhaps surprisingly - lots of young, healthy people ready to volunteer forcoronavirus challenge trials. It would be a way of finding out, almost immediately, whether a vaccine works. And it could help speed the selection of the promising coronavirus vaccines. The health of the volunteers would be monitored round the clock at a clinical research facility in London. I understand that no contracts for the study, which would be government funded, have yet been signed, but the hope is they could begin in January. What's been holding things up are ethical considerations - challenge studies have been used to test vaccines for flu, cholera and typhoid, but in each case there was an effective treatment to prevent volunteers from falling ill. With coronavirus, there would be an added level of risk - but it's one that volunteers say they are willing to take. A government spokesman said discussions around challenge trials were ongoing as part of the overall consideration of potential avenues for coronavirus research. Work to find a coronavirus vaccine is under way at breakneck speed around the globe. There are currently 36 vaccines in clinical trials, including one being developed by the University of Oxford that is alreadyin an advanced stage of testing. A successful vaccine would provide some protection against the virus by training people's immune systems to fight it so they should not become sick. This would allow lockdowns to be lifted more safely, and social distancing to be relaxed. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? News of the potential trials comes as the number of daily reported cases rose by a quarter on Wednesday to 6,178, the latest government figures showed, up 1,252 since Tuesday. Some 37 deaths were also announced. Tighter restrictions were announced across the UK on Tuesday, including a 22:00closing time for pubs in England,externalstarting on Thursday. Scotland is introducing similar measures, with pubs and restaurants having to close at 22:00 BST from Friday, while in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00 from Thursday. Other measures in England include people being told to work from home if they can, rules on face coverings being expanded and the number of people allowed at weddings being halved.

LiveLiveChancellor to reveal future of job protection scheme,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces a new Job Support Scheme, starting in November It replaces the 'furlough scheme' and means the government will pay part of workers' wages who have lost hours The worker must do at least one-third of normal hours, and the government and employer will pay one-third each of the lost hours The cut in VAT to 5% for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended until 31 March Sunak says he wants to protect 'viable jobs' - but warns not every job can be saved People coming to England from Denmark, Iceland, Slovakia, and Curacao must now self-isolate for 14 days The UK confirms another 6,634 cases - up from 6,178 on Wednesday AC Milan footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic tests positive, but says he has no symptoms Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" with countries on the brink of national lockdowns, EU health official warns US President Donald Trump has said a move by the FDA to introduce stricter guidelines for coronavirus vaccines was ""political"" Iran's virus death toll has passed 25,000 as the country, the worst affected in the Middle East, sees a spike in cases Edited by Owen Amos We're now closing our live page - thanks for joining us. We'll be back tomorrow. The live page writers today were: Joseph Lee, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Victoria Bisset, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. A flag tribute to Americans who have died with Covid-19 can been seen in Washington DC In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for today. Before then, here's a recap of the main UK stories from today. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Read more More than 40 children have tested positive after an outbreak linked to a wedding in the German town of Hamm, German news agency DPA reports. Nine schools have been affected by the cluster of cases, a spokesman for the city said on Thursday, adding that only one of the children infected had no connection to the wedding. Of the almost 200 people in the town to have tested positive, 150 were guests at the wedding, according to the town's official website. A total of 300 people are currently in quarantine and are subject to mandatory testing. The news comes as a second German minister went into quarantine after he was found to have contact with an infected individual. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who hosted a meeting of EU trade ministers in Berlin on Monday, said he was self-isolating as a precaution after the employee of a minister who attended had tested positive. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was in quarantine after a member of his security staff tested positive. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tested positive on Wednesday The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Russia has reached 6,595, the highest since mid-July. In the capital, Moscow, cases are at their highest level since late June. Russia has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and almost 20,000 deaths since the pandemic began, and there are fears the new figures could signal a new wave in the country. Moscow has already registered the world's first coronavirus vaccine, despite experts saying the trials were too small to prove its safety and effectiveness. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, lambasted the US over its coronavirus criticism Senior diplomats from China and the US have lashed out at each other at a meeting of the UN Security Council, deepening a row over the coronavirus pandemic. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, used his speech to reject US attempts to blame the country for the pandemic. âI must say, enough is enough! You have created enough troubles for the world already,"" he told the meeting via video link on Thursday. âIf someone should be held accountable, it should be a few US politicians themselves.â His comments appeared to be a response to US President Donald Trump,who called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemicin his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week. Tensions between China and the US have flared over the pandemic and a number of other issues, including trade and alleged human rights abuses. The US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, voiced anger at the tone of Thursdayâs UN Security Council meeting. ""You know, shame on each of you. I am astonished and I am disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. Earlier, we reported thatthe UK recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases on Thursday- the highest figure since mass testing began. The below charts show the trends in cases and deaths - both before and since mass testing became available. However, hospital admissions data was not available in Thursday's figures, which are released by the government. You can look at more detail at the numbers in our piece tracking UK caseshere. More than 10,000 people have died in Indonesia Indonesia has seen a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. More than 4,600 new infections were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number to 262,000. More than 10,000 people have died in the country since the pandemic began. Indonesia is the 17th country to pass 10,000 Covid deaths, While the official figures are the highest in South East Asia, there are fears the true number of cases could be much higher due to the country's low testing rate. Earlier this week, the official in charge of the country's coronavirus response in the nine worst-hit provinces police and the military could break up illegal rallies in the run-up to December's regional elections. More than 25,000 people have died with coronavirus in Iran, official figures show, as the country witnesses a spike in cases. A ministry spokesman said today that 175 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 25,015. However,an investigation by BBC Persian earlier this yearfound the number of coronavirus deaths was nearly three times as high as the official statistics. The government's own records appeared to show almost 42,000 people had died with Covid-19 symptoms in the run up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry at the time. The country is the worst affected in the Middle East, with more than 436,000 coronavirus cases recorded to date. Earlier this week, an official warned the country is facing a third wave of infections. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The official records may show that the UK has just seen the highest number of new cases reported on a single day.  But it is, of course, nothing of the sort.  At the peak of the pandemic in the spring we had such limited testing capacity that it was largely only hospital patients who were being checked.  It meant we were identifying just the tip of the iceberg.  Estimates have suggested there may have been as many 100,000 cases a day at the peak.  We are clearly not capturing all the infections - even now with the mass testing that is available.  Surveillance data last week suggested we may only be identifying around a half of cases. But that still puts the infection levels well below what they were in the spring.  Hospital admissions and deaths have also started creeping up, but are still very low.  Health experts have been clear we are now on the upwards path so we should expect this trend to continue. Crucial will be how quickly figures rise for all three measures - with the hospital cases and deaths the most important. Evidence from Spain and France, which started seeing rises a few weeks before us, offer some hope. Cases have been climbing gradually - at least more gradually than the trajectory government scientists warned could lead the UK to 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italian President Sergio Mattarella responded to Boris Johnson's comments on Thursday The president of Italy has rebuked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for suggesting that Britons were more ""freedom-loving"" than his compatriots. It was in parliament this week that Johnson was asked by a Labour MP whether Italy and Germany had lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK because of more efficient testing and tracing. ""No"" the prime minister replied. ""There is an important difference between our country and many others around the world - ours is a freedom-loving country,"" he added. Now, Italian President Sergio Mattarella has responded, telling reporters: ""We Italians also love freedom â but seriousness is dear to us as well."" Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus and impose a national lockdown, appears to have brought the pandemic under control. Mask-wearing is scrupulous, testing is widespread and restrictions have remained in place for a long time. But in a country that fought for independence and liberation from Nazi occupation, its president has reminded Johnson that the love of freedom isn't exclusively a British value. Plans to resume weekly mass participation Parkrun events in October have been scrapped due to stricter coronavirus rules. The events, which take place in more than 700 parks across the UK, were suspendedin March because of the pandemic. Organisers had hoped to resume in October, but new rules introduced due to rising case numbers have forced a re-think. Parkrun chief executive Nick Pearson said they felt it ""would be insensitive to push forward with reopening"". Read more Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven warned against complacency Sweden has seen a âworryingâ rise in coronavirus infections in parts of the country where people have not been taking social distancing seriously, its prime minister has said. Stefan Lofven said the coronavirus situation in Sweden was âstableâ compared to other countries, but there were signs of a resurgence. ""That's worrying. It requires that we tighten our behaviour,"" the prime minister said at a media briefing on Thursday. âThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs and parties, bus trips in rush-hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal.â Sweden has recorded more than 90,000 infections and almost 6,000 deaths to date, higher figures than its Nordic neighbours on both counts. Unlike most countries, Sweden did not impose a sweeping lockdown at the height of the pandemicâs first wave. Instead, the countryâs health officials emphasised personal responsibility, with limited restrictions on life. We reported earlier that the UK has reported 6,634 new cases, up from 6,178 the day before. Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""The signals are clear. Positivity rates are rising across all age groups and we're continuing to see spikes in rates of admission to hospital and critical care. ""We must all follow the new measures that have been bought in to help control the virus and download the new NHS Covid-19 App which is the fastest way of knowing when you're at risk."" She also said: ""This is the highest number recorded and a stark warning for us all."" While 6,634 cases is the highest number recorded by mass testing, experts believe the true number of daily cases was far higher earlier in the pandemic. France is one of the countries to have witnessed a rise in cases Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, with countries on the brink of national lockdowns amid a second wave of infections, the European Union's health commissioner has warned. ""It might be our last chance to prevent a repeat of last spring,"" Stella Kyriakides said today. ""All member states must be ready to roll out measures immediately and at the right time."" Earlier this year, countries across Europe imposed strict nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus, grinding economic activity to an abrupt halt. Allow Twitter content?

Kyriakides's warning echoesthat of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),external, which today said it was concerned about the rising number of infections on the continent. The EU agency said health messages ""should emphasise that the pandemic is far from over"", adding that the current situation ""poses an increasing risk of infection for vulnerable individuals"" and health workers. The UK government has announced another 6,634 Covid-19 cases - that's an increase on Wednesday's figure, which was 6,178. They also said a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. That's up from 37 deaths announced on Wednesday. We'll have more charts setting out the spread of the virus in the UK later. We've been reporting today on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new measures to support jobs and the economy, including the Job Support Scheme, which will replace the Job Retention Scheme. But the government has also repeatedly referred to an existing measure aimed at encouraging employers to keep on staff that had been furloughed. The Job Retention Bonus is a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee still in meaningful employment at the end of January. Eligible employees must earn at least Â£520 a month on average between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said the bonus, in conjunction with the Job Support Scheme, has given firms a ""big incentive"" to retain staff merely until the end of January. Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and the Caribbean island of Curacao have been removed from the UK government's list of travel corridors, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. That means travellers arriving in England from those countries after 04:00 BST on Saturday must self-isolate for 14 days, Shapps said. He reminded travellers that they must self-isolate when returning from a non-exempt country, or face a fine starting from Â£1,000. Allow Twitter content?

Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

What happens when furlough ends?How many people could become unemployed?How have the rules on meeting friends changed?Why are pubs closing early but not shops selling alcohol? And other questions,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

How many people could become unemployed?How have the rules on meeting friends changed?Why are pubs closing early but not shops selling alcohol? And other questions,"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

A flag tribute to Americans who have died with Covid-19 can been seen in Washington DC In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for today. Before then, here's a recap of the main UK stories from today. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Read more More than 40 children have tested positive after an outbreak linked to a wedding in the German town of Hamm, German news agency DPA reports. Nine schools have been affected by the cluster of cases, a spokesman for the city said on Thursday, adding that only one of the children infected had no connection to the wedding. Of the almost 200 people in the town to have tested positive, 150 were guests at the wedding, according to the town's official website. A total of 300 people are currently in quarantine and are subject to mandatory testing. The news comes as a second German minister went into quarantine after he was found to have contact with an infected individual. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who hosted a meeting of EU trade ministers in Berlin on Monday, said he was self-isolating as a precaution after the employee of a minister who attended had tested positive. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was in quarantine after a member of his security staff tested positive. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tested positive on Wednesday The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Russia has reached 6,595, the highest since mid-July. In the capital, Moscow, cases are at their highest level since late June. Russia has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and almost 20,000 deaths since the pandemic began, and there are fears the new figures could signal a new wave in the country. Moscow has already registered the world's first coronavirus vaccine, despite experts saying the trials were too small to prove its safety and effectiveness. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, lambasted the US over its coronavirus criticism Senior diplomats from China and the US have lashed out at each other at a meeting of the UN Security Council, deepening a row over the coronavirus pandemic. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, used his speech to reject US attempts to blame the country for the pandemic. âI must say, enough is enough! You have created enough troubles for the world already,"" he told the meeting via video link on Thursday. âIf someone should be held accountable, it should be a few US politicians themselves.â His comments appeared to be a response to US President Donald Trump,who called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemicin his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week. Tensions between China and the US have flared over the pandemic and a number of other issues, including trade and alleged human rights abuses. The US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, voiced anger at the tone of Thursdayâs UN Security Council meeting. ""You know, shame on each of you. I am astonished and I am disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. Earlier, we reported thatthe UK recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases on Thursday- the highest figure since mass testing began. The below charts show the trends in cases and deaths - both before and since mass testing became available. However, hospital admissions data was not available in Thursday's figures, which are released by the government. You can look at more detail at the numbers in our piece tracking UK caseshere. More than 10,000 people have died in Indonesia Indonesia has seen a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. More than 4,600 new infections were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number to 262,000. More than 10,000 people have died in the country since the pandemic began. Indonesia is the 17th country to pass 10,000 Covid deaths, While the official figures are the highest in South East Asia, there are fears the true number of cases could be much higher due to the country's low testing rate. Earlier this week, the official in charge of the country's coronavirus response in the nine worst-hit provinces police and the military could break up illegal rallies in the run-up to December's regional elections. More than 25,000 people have died with coronavirus in Iran, official figures show, as the country witnesses a spike in cases. A ministry spokesman said today that 175 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 25,015. However,an investigation by BBC Persian earlier this yearfound the number of coronavirus deaths was nearly three times as high as the official statistics. The government's own records appeared to show almost 42,000 people had died with Covid-19 symptoms in the run up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry at the time. The country is the worst affected in the Middle East, with more than 436,000 coronavirus cases recorded to date. Earlier this week, an official warned the country is facing a third wave of infections. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The official records may show that the UK has just seen the highest number of new cases reported on a single day.  But it is, of course, nothing of the sort.  At the peak of the pandemic in the spring we had such limited testing capacity that it was largely only hospital patients who were being checked.  It meant we were identifying just the tip of the iceberg.  Estimates have suggested there may have been as many 100,000 cases a day at the peak.  We are clearly not capturing all the infections - even now with the mass testing that is available.  Surveillance data last week suggested we may only be identifying around a half of cases. But that still puts the infection levels well below what they were in the spring.  Hospital admissions and deaths have also started creeping up, but are still very low.  Health experts have been clear we are now on the upwards path so we should expect this trend to continue. Crucial will be how quickly figures rise for all three measures - with the hospital cases and deaths the most important. Evidence from Spain and France, which started seeing rises a few weeks before us, offer some hope. Cases have been climbing gradually - at least more gradually than the trajectory government scientists warned could lead the UK to 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italian President Sergio Mattarella responded to Boris Johnson's comments on Thursday The president of Italy has rebuked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for suggesting that Britons were more ""freedom-loving"" than his compatriots. It was in parliament this week that Johnson was asked by a Labour MP whether Italy and Germany had lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK because of more efficient testing and tracing. ""No"" the prime minister replied. ""There is an important difference between our country and many others around the world - ours is a freedom-loving country,"" he added. Now, Italian President Sergio Mattarella has responded, telling reporters: ""We Italians also love freedom â but seriousness is dear to us as well."" Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus and impose a national lockdown, appears to have brought the pandemic under control. Mask-wearing is scrupulous, testing is widespread and restrictions have remained in place for a long time. But in a country that fought for independence and liberation from Nazi occupation, its president has reminded Johnson that the love of freedom isn't exclusively a British value. Plans to resume weekly mass participation Parkrun events in October have been scrapped due to stricter coronavirus rules. The events, which take place in more than 700 parks across the UK, were suspendedin March because of the pandemic. Organisers had hoped to resume in October, but new rules introduced due to rising case numbers have forced a re-think. Parkrun chief executive Nick Pearson said they felt it ""would be insensitive to push forward with reopening"". Read more Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven warned against complacency Sweden has seen a âworryingâ rise in coronavirus infections in parts of the country where people have not been taking social distancing seriously, its prime minister has said. Stefan Lofven said the coronavirus situation in Sweden was âstableâ compared to other countries, but there were signs of a resurgence. ""That's worrying. It requires that we tighten our behaviour,"" the prime minister said at a media briefing on Thursday. âThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs and parties, bus trips in rush-hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal.â Sweden has recorded more than 90,000 infections and almost 6,000 deaths to date, higher figures than its Nordic neighbours on both counts. Unlike most countries, Sweden did not impose a sweeping lockdown at the height of the pandemicâs first wave. Instead, the countryâs health officials emphasised personal responsibility, with limited restrictions on life. We reported earlier that the UK has reported 6,634 new cases, up from 6,178 the day before. Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""The signals are clear. Positivity rates are rising across all age groups and we're continuing to see spikes in rates of admission to hospital and critical care. ""We must all follow the new measures that have been bought in to help control the virus and download the new NHS Covid-19 App which is the fastest way of knowing when you're at risk."" She also said: ""This is the highest number recorded and a stark warning for us all."" While 6,634 cases is the highest number recorded by mass testing, experts believe the true number of daily cases was far higher earlier in the pandemic. France is one of the countries to have witnessed a rise in cases Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, with countries on the brink of national lockdowns amid a second wave of infections, the European Union's health commissioner has warned. ""It might be our last chance to prevent a repeat of last spring,"" Stella Kyriakides said today. ""All member states must be ready to roll out measures immediately and at the right time."" Earlier this year, countries across Europe imposed strict nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus, grinding economic activity to an abrupt halt. Allow Twitter content?

Kyriakides's warning echoesthat of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),external, which today said it was concerned about the rising number of infections on the continent. The EU agency said health messages ""should emphasise that the pandemic is far from over"", adding that the current situation ""poses an increasing risk of infection for vulnerable individuals"" and health workers. The UK government has announced another 6,634 Covid-19 cases - that's an increase on Wednesday's figure, which was 6,178. They also said a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. That's up from 37 deaths announced on Wednesday. We'll have more charts setting out the spread of the virus in the UK later. We've been reporting today on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new measures to support jobs and the economy, including the Job Support Scheme, which will replace the Job Retention Scheme. But the government has also repeatedly referred to an existing measure aimed at encouraging employers to keep on staff that had been furloughed. The Job Retention Bonus is a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee still in meaningful employment at the end of January. Eligible employees must earn at least Â£520 a month on average between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said the bonus, in conjunction with the Job Support Scheme, has given firms a ""big incentive"" to retain staff merely until the end of January. Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and the Caribbean island of Curacao have been removed from the UK government's list of travel corridors, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. That means travellers arriving in England from those countries after 04:00 BST on Saturday must self-isolate for 14 days, Shapps said. He reminded travellers that they must self-isolate when returning from a non-exempt country, or face a fine starting from Â£1,000. Allow Twitter content?

A flag tribute to Americans who have died with Covid-19 can been seen in Washington DC In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for today. Before then, here's a recap of the main UK stories from today. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Read more More than 40 children have tested positive after an outbreak linked to a wedding in the German town of Hamm, German news agency DPA reports. Nine schools have been affected by the cluster of cases, a spokesman for the city said on Thursday, adding that only one of the children infected had no connection to the wedding. Of the almost 200 people in the town to have tested positive, 150 were guests at the wedding, according to the town's official website. A total of 300 people are currently in quarantine and are subject to mandatory testing. The news comes as a second German minister went into quarantine after he was found to have contact with an infected individual. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who hosted a meeting of EU trade ministers in Berlin on Monday, said he was self-isolating as a precaution after the employee of a minister who attended had tested positive. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was in quarantine after a member of his security staff tested positive. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tested positive on Wednesday The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Russia has reached 6,595, the highest since mid-July. In the capital, Moscow, cases are at their highest level since late June. Russia has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and almost 20,000 deaths since the pandemic began, and there are fears the new figures could signal a new wave in the country. Moscow has already registered the world's first coronavirus vaccine, despite experts saying the trials were too small to prove its safety and effectiveness. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, lambasted the US over its coronavirus criticism Senior diplomats from China and the US have lashed out at each other at a meeting of the UN Security Council, deepening a row over the coronavirus pandemic. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, used his speech to reject US attempts to blame the country for the pandemic. âI must say, enough is enough! You have created enough troubles for the world already,"" he told the meeting via video link on Thursday. âIf someone should be held accountable, it should be a few US politicians themselves.â His comments appeared to be a response to US President Donald Trump,who called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemicin his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week. Tensions between China and the US have flared over the pandemic and a number of other issues, including trade and alleged human rights abuses. The US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, voiced anger at the tone of Thursdayâs UN Security Council meeting. ""You know, shame on each of you. I am astonished and I am disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. Earlier, we reported thatthe UK recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases on Thursday- the highest figure since mass testing began. The below charts show the trends in cases and deaths - both before and since mass testing became available. However, hospital admissions data was not available in Thursday's figures, which are released by the government. You can look at more detail at the numbers in our piece tracking UK caseshere. More than 10,000 people have died in Indonesia Indonesia has seen a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. More than 4,600 new infections were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number to 262,000. More than 10,000 people have died in the country since the pandemic began. Indonesia is the 17th country to pass 10,000 Covid deaths, While the official figures are the highest in South East Asia, there are fears the true number of cases could be much higher due to the country's low testing rate. Earlier this week, the official in charge of the country's coronavirus response in the nine worst-hit provinces police and the military could break up illegal rallies in the run-up to December's regional elections. More than 25,000 people have died with coronavirus in Iran, official figures show, as the country witnesses a spike in cases. A ministry spokesman said today that 175 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 25,015. However,an investigation by BBC Persian earlier this yearfound the number of coronavirus deaths was nearly three times as high as the official statistics. The government's own records appeared to show almost 42,000 people had died with Covid-19 symptoms in the run up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry at the time. The country is the worst affected in the Middle East, with more than 436,000 coronavirus cases recorded to date. Earlier this week, an official warned the country is facing a third wave of infections. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The official records may show that the UK has just seen the highest number of new cases reported on a single day.  But it is, of course, nothing of the sort.  At the peak of the pandemic in the spring we had such limited testing capacity that it was largely only hospital patients who were being checked.  It meant we were identifying just the tip of the iceberg.  Estimates have suggested there may have been as many 100,000 cases a day at the peak.  We are clearly not capturing all the infections - even now with the mass testing that is available.  Surveillance data last week suggested we may only be identifying around a half of cases. But that still puts the infection levels well below what they were in the spring.  Hospital admissions and deaths have also started creeping up, but are still very low.  Health experts have been clear we are now on the upwards path so we should expect this trend to continue. Crucial will be how quickly figures rise for all three measures - with the hospital cases and deaths the most important. Evidence from Spain and France, which started seeing rises a few weeks before us, offer some hope. Cases have been climbing gradually - at least more gradually than the trajectory government scientists warned could lead the UK to 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italian President Sergio Mattarella responded to Boris Johnson's comments on Thursday The president of Italy has rebuked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for suggesting that Britons were more ""freedom-loving"" than his compatriots. It was in parliament this week that Johnson was asked by a Labour MP whether Italy and Germany had lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK because of more efficient testing and tracing. ""No"" the prime minister replied. ""There is an important difference between our country and many others around the world - ours is a freedom-loving country,"" he added. Now, Italian President Sergio Mattarella has responded, telling reporters: ""We Italians also love freedom â but seriousness is dear to us as well."" Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus and impose a national lockdown, appears to have brought the pandemic under control. Mask-wearing is scrupulous, testing is widespread and restrictions have remained in place for a long time. But in a country that fought for independence and liberation from Nazi occupation, its president has reminded Johnson that the love of freedom isn't exclusively a British value. Plans to resume weekly mass participation Parkrun events in October have been scrapped due to stricter coronavirus rules. The events, which take place in more than 700 parks across the UK, were suspendedin March because of the pandemic. Organisers had hoped to resume in October, but new rules introduced due to rising case numbers have forced a re-think. Parkrun chief executive Nick Pearson said they felt it ""would be insensitive to push forward with reopening"". Read more Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven warned against complacency Sweden has seen a âworryingâ rise in coronavirus infections in parts of the country where people have not been taking social distancing seriously, its prime minister has said. Stefan Lofven said the coronavirus situation in Sweden was âstableâ compared to other countries, but there were signs of a resurgence. ""That's worrying. It requires that we tighten our behaviour,"" the prime minister said at a media briefing on Thursday. âThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs and parties, bus trips in rush-hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal.â Sweden has recorded more than 90,000 infections and almost 6,000 deaths to date, higher figures than its Nordic neighbours on both counts. Unlike most countries, Sweden did not impose a sweeping lockdown at the height of the pandemicâs first wave. Instead, the countryâs health officials emphasised personal responsibility, with limited restrictions on life. We reported earlier that the UK has reported 6,634 new cases, up from 6,178 the day before. Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""The signals are clear. Positivity rates are rising across all age groups and we're continuing to see spikes in rates of admission to hospital and critical care. ""We must all follow the new measures that have been bought in to help control the virus and download the new NHS Covid-19 App which is the fastest way of knowing when you're at risk."" She also said: ""This is the highest number recorded and a stark warning for us all."" While 6,634 cases is the highest number recorded by mass testing, experts believe the true number of daily cases was far higher earlier in the pandemic. France is one of the countries to have witnessed a rise in cases Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, with countries on the brink of national lockdowns amid a second wave of infections, the European Union's health commissioner has warned. ""It might be our last chance to prevent a repeat of last spring,"" Stella Kyriakides said today. ""All member states must be ready to roll out measures immediately and at the right time."" Earlier this year, countries across Europe imposed strict nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus, grinding economic activity to an abrupt halt. Allow Twitter content?

Kyriakides's warning echoesthat of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),external, which today said it was concerned about the rising number of infections on the continent. The EU agency said health messages ""should emphasise that the pandemic is far from over"", adding that the current situation ""poses an increasing risk of infection for vulnerable individuals"" and health workers. The UK government has announced another 6,634 Covid-19 cases - that's an increase on Wednesday's figure, which was 6,178. They also said a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. That's up from 37 deaths announced on Wednesday. We'll have more charts setting out the spread of the virus in the UK later. We've been reporting today on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new measures to support jobs and the economy, including the Job Support Scheme, which will replace the Job Retention Scheme. But the government has also repeatedly referred to an existing measure aimed at encouraging employers to keep on staff that had been furloughed. The Job Retention Bonus is a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee still in meaningful employment at the end of January. Eligible employees must earn at least Â£520 a month on average between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said the bonus, in conjunction with the Job Support Scheme, has given firms a ""big incentive"" to retain staff merely until the end of January. Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and the Caribbean island of Curacao have been removed from the UK government's list of travel corridors, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. That means travellers arriving in England from those countries after 04:00 BST on Saturday must self-isolate for 14 days, Shapps said. He reminded travellers that they must self-isolate when returning from a non-exempt country, or face a fine starting from Â£1,000. Allow Twitter content?

Sunak to unveil emergency jobs schemeThe chancellor is expected to announce new measures to replace the furlough scheme which expires next month.,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak will later unveil a plan aimed at minimising further unemployment as stricter Covid-19 restrictions come into force. The new measures are expected to replace the furlough scheme, which is set to expire next month. In July, around five million workers were still receiving some or all of their incomethrough the scheme, many in the hospitality sector. Pubs and restaurants have warned they will be hit hard by new restrictions. From Thursday, hospitality venues in England will have to shut at 22:00 BST as the government tries to control the spread of the coronavirus. Scotland is introducing similar measures, with pubs and restaurants having to close at 22:00 BST from Friday, while in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00 from Thursday. ""Lots of businesses will not survive this and we are going to see more and more people lose their jobs,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality. At around 11:45, the chancellor is expected to address the Commons to unveil plans that the government hopes will stem those job losses. Covid crisis forces Autumn Budget to be scrapped Could UK adopt German or French furlough scheme? The Treasury said the chancellor had been ""preparing contingency plans over the summer in case the pandemic required it"". It is understood Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is also thought to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. The prime minister said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. Mr Sunak also announced on Wednesday that the Autumn Budget would be scrapped this year because of the pandemic. While latest government figures are yet to be released, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates almost three million - or 12% of the workforce - are currently furloughed. Director Paul Johnson said he expected a ""big rise"" in unemployment when the existing furlough scheme expires at the end of next month. ""We've already seen something like a reduction of nearly three quarters of a million... in terms of the number of people on payroll and then we've got at least another two million or so on furlough not working,"" Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""Some of those will likely be supported by this new scheme but not all of them and that implies, I suspect, by the end of the year that we will have something like... two million fewer than we had at the beginning of the year, although oddly that doesn't seem to be translating at the moment into the official unemployment figures."" Cancelling the Budget is a big deal, because of what it shows about the big picture: a government still in crisis mode, having to put off medium-term tough decisions, on tax rises, that would have at least been signalled in the contents of a Budget Red Box. But we will get more spending, more support for jobs. Asthe chancellor told me last week, that does not mean extending the furlough scheme endlessly, but he has been thinking ""creatively"". The discussions with business groups and unions have centred around supporting employers with cash flow constraints to keep viable jobs. The furlough scheme's initial purpose was to support people's wages, expressly for them to stay at home. The new scheme is likely to take inspiration from continental Europe, by subsidising ""short time"" work, that is to say, helping top up pay for workers given fewer hours of work in the crisis. The furlough scheme is regularly lauded by the prime minister, and has undoubtedly been one of the most competently executed policy responses of the Covid crisis. Throw in the fact that the Tory ""red wall"" is more comfortable with use of state spending, and some Tory thinkers advocate a permanent scheme of wage support, such as occurs in Germany. We also expect extensions by weeks or months of the various loan guarantee schemes offered by the Treasury. Already banks are fretting about having to call in some of these loans. Now significant swathes of the economy remain under the shadow of the pandemic and of ongoing social restrictions meant to defeat it. It is difficult to see how a full Spending Review over four years could occur. The Treasury can not calculate the size of the pie to be sliced up. Having a one year review, like last year, also avoids some corrosive internal politics over winners and losers. So more spending, and more jobs support, as infection rates rise, and restrictions look likely to be strengthened rather than loosened, but not yet accounting for how it is all to be paid for, at a time of high and rising public borrowing. The government has been under mounting pressure to extend or replace the furlough scheme, which will wind down next month. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was introduced in March and paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since then, employers have been asked to pay 10% of the wages of those on furlough, plus their National Insurance and pension contributions. Furloughed workers can also now return to work part-time with the government paying for any remaining hours not worked. Could the furlough scheme be extended? How many people are out of work? During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson faced calls from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned tocut up to 6,000 jobsin the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. In a televised response to Tuesday's prime ministerial broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses."" Germany's Kurzarbeit:The employer cuts workers' hours and the government pays them a percentage of the money they would have lost as a result. It is a long-established scheme, but it has been revised during the pandemic. It can now run for up to 21 months and the percentage of lost wages paid by the government can now be as high as 80%. France's ""chÃ´mage partiel"":The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The CBI's suggestion:A wages top-up from the government should be available provided that employees can work at least 50% of their normal hours. The firm would pay the actual hours worked in full, but the employee would get paid for two-thirds of the lost hours, with the cost shared between the company and the Treasury. The subsidy would last up to a year. The TUC's suggestion:A more generous version of the above. Employees could work a smaller proportion of their normal hours and still be eligible, while they would be guaranteed 80% pay for the hours lost, or 100% if they are on minimum wage.

Many firms 'have not considered Brexit effect',"This video can not be played Why is it so hard to reach a Brexit deal? Only half of UK firms that trade internationally have considered the impact of Brexit on their business, says the British Chambers of Commerce. It said only 52% of them had carried out a risk assessment ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January 2021. The BCC said firms needed more clarity. It added that it had written to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove seeking action for businesses and urgent discussions to help firms prepare. Exporters to the EU face 7,000-truck-long queues in Kent and two-day delays to trade after the Brexit transition period ends, according to a letter sent to the freight industry by Mr Gove. On Wednesday, Mr Gove told Parliament that it was up to firms to get ready for the end of the transition period. ""The consequences of a lack of business preparedness will be not just economic opportunities missed for those companies who don't prepare, but potentially much wider disruption,"" he said. Brexit letter warns of 7,000-truck queues in Kent What is the Brexit transition period? Brexit: A simple guide The BCC's director general, Adam Marshall, said businesses still had ""significant unanswered questions"" and called on the government to ""ramp up engagement with business urgently"". The BCC also complained of a lack of information with which to plan, while companies were suffering from ""deadline fatigue"". As Andrew Lawless sees the end of the Brexit transition period approaching, he has found himself having second thoughts about his vote in the 2016 referendum. The sales director of Clitheroe-based packaging firm Phoenix Handling Solutions and member of the East Lancashire Chamber of Commerce, voted in favour of Brexit, because he thought it would be good for his business. His fellow directors did the same. ""But when we realised that the trade agreements were a bit of a sticking point, we did actually wonder if we'd made the right decision,"" he told the BBC. ""We're only a small SME and we import virtually all our equipment. We don't want to let our blue-chip customers down because of delays at the ports."" The company's customers include Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestle and Heineken. It now sees itself having to take on paperwork that was previously handled by its suppliers in Italy, the Netherlands and France. ""To be honest, we're a bit apprehensive, because we're not 100% certain we're doing the right things,"" he says. ""I'm sure there will be a few sleepless nights."" ""With just 98 days to go, business communities face the triple threat of a resurgent coronavirus, receding government support schemes and a disorderly end to the transition period,"" said Mr Marshall. ""Despite recent public information campaigns, base levels of preparedness are low. Many firms say they've heard talk of deadlines and cliff-edges before, and others are still grappling with fundamental challenges as a result of the pandemic."" The BCC said companies were still in the dark on a number of issues, including: Firms do not know what rules of origin will apply after the transition period, preventing them and their customers from planning and potentially creating unprecedented new administration and costs There is no clarity on how food and drink due to be sold in the EU and Northern Ireland is to be labelled There is very limited guidance on the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland. The BCC's data came from a survey conducted between 17 and 21 August and is based on responses from 527 firms. Why is it so hard to reach a Brexit deal?

Flu jabs limited due to high demand,"Pharmacists and GP surgeries are having to limit flu jabs to the most at-risk groups due to increased demand. The Boots chain has suspended its appointment booking system for anyone outside of the vulnerable groups, which include people aged over 65. It said it faces ""unprecedented demand"" for vaccinations, but NHS England says enough stocks are available. This year, up to 30 million people can be vaccinated in England, the government says. Vaccines are delivered in batches to pharmacies and GPs so priority is given to the most at-risk groups. Within the next few weeks it is likely that winter flu will start to circulate alongside the coronavirus. This will potentially present an additional challenge to an already stretched healthcare system. How can I get a flu jab? Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu: Why we still need to worry about it this winter How bad will winter really be? This year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for the first time the flu vaccine will be offered to the over-50s - over-55s in Scotland. But this will only be after it has been given to those who normally get a free NHS jab - including the over-65s, pregnant women, and people with conditions like lung disease or diabetes. This year,the free vaccination is being offered,externalin England to: Adults aged 65 and over People with some medical conditions, including diabetes, heart failure and asthma People who were required to shield from coronavirus - and anyone they live with Pregnant women Children aged from two to 11 Health and social care workers The NHS offers the flu vaccine via your GP or your local pharmacy. In a statement, Boots said: ""This year, our customers have been more conscious than ever about protecting the health of themselves and their families, and protecting against flu has been front-of-mind for many of us. ""As a result, we have seen more people than ever booking early to get their flu vaccinations."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Delivery of flu vaccinations is phased over the autumn and into winter, and priority is rightly given to those who are most at-risk with others being asked to wait to later in the year."" Deliveries of flu vaccines for at-risk groups will continue in all areas in England throughout the winter months. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) says other independent pharmacies have also had to slow down the rate of vaccination. Robbie Turner, RPS Director of Pharmacy, said: ""This year many more people are anticipating receiving a flu vaccination and they need assurance that sufficient stocks are available. ""We will continue to talk with government on the supply of vaccines, and how pharmacists can support those who are most at risk."" Professor Martin Marshall, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, said widespread flu vaccination would play a key role in preventing the NHS being overwhelmed this winter. He said the government must ensure there is ""an adequate supply of vaccines for everyone who wants one"" among patients now eligible and called for guidance on who should be prioritised for the flu jab if supplies are limited. Supplying the vaccine - which needs to be refrigerated - is a logistical challenge. But NHS England says there are adequate stocks in place. The Department of Health and Social Care says it will issue guidance shortly on how pharmacists and GPs can access additional stockpiles if needed. It is unclear how bad flu might be this winter - some years are worse than others - but experts say the vaccine is a good match for the strain of flu that will be circulating. Flu, like coronavirus, is a viral infection that is passed on through coughs and sneezes. Social distancing, masks and handwashing should help reduce the spread of both. Most people with flu recover at home in a week, but people with chronic conditions or who are over 65 should call NHS 111. If you think you have either flu or Covid-19, stay at home and self-isolate. Book a coronavirus test if you have: a high fever a new, continuous cough a loss of, or a change to, your sense of smell or taste Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Can I get a free flu jab?

New rules for MI5 and police to authorise crimes,"Lawyers for the Security Service told a court that the rules were ""critical"" to national security Undercover informants working for the police and MI5 are going to be explicitly permitted for the first time under British law to commit crimes. The unprecedented legislation to authorise and oversee crimes comes after years of unclear rules over when these agents can break the law. The law will not specify exactly which crimes can be committed. And critics are urging MPs to amend the proposed law to rule out murder and serious violence. The highly unusual decision to create a law that sanctions crime comes after a legal battle to force MI5 and the government to reveal secret rules governing when an informant can break the law. Informants - also known as agents - are recruited to gather intelligence on targets, including terrorist organisations, major drugs gangs and child abuse networks. These agents are often already involved in the networks being targeted and need to maintain a cover in order to gather critical evidence for investigators. However, a major court ruling last year found that while MI5 had an ""implied"" power to authorise crimes - it did not mean anyone involved was immune from prosecution. That judgement,external, only narrowly in the government's favour, prompted the decision to create the new law. Power for informants to commit crimes is ruled 'lawful' Power to commit crimes 'critical' for informants, MI5 lawyers say The day I tried to be a spook Only some of the secret rules have been revealed in court - now to be replaced by a public law Under the legislation going before Parliament on Thursday, MI5, the police, the National Crime Agency and other agencies that use informants or undercover agents will be able to explicitly authorise them to commit a specific crime as part of an operation. The law will require MI5 officers and others to show the crime is ""necessary and proportionate"". Security officials will not say which crimes they will consider authorising because that could lead to terrorists and other serious criminals working out who is working undercover. But the legislation stresses agencies must not breach the Human Rights Act, which requires the government to protect life. While the security service's watchdog, a senior judge, will report on how the power is used, there will be no role for the Crown Prosecution Service in reviewing the crimes. Ken McCallum, the new Director General of MI5, said agents working deep undercover had played a critical role in stopping many of the 27 terror plots that have been uncovered in the last three years. ""Without the contribution of human agents, be in no doubt, many of these attacks would not have been prevented,"" he said. And Security Minister James Brokenshire said the new law had in-built guarantees. ""This is a critical capability and is subject to robust, independent oversight. It is important that those with a responsibility to protect the public can continue this work, knowing that they are on a sound legal footing."" But Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, a legal and human rights campaign group that challenged the secrecy around the rules, said: ""We are seriously concerned that the bill fails to expressly prohibit MI5 and other agencies from authorising crimes like torture, murder and sexual violence. ""Our intelligence agencies do a vital job in keeping this country safe, but there must be common sense limits on their agents' activities, and we hope MPs will ensure these limits are written into the legislation"".

Crusading paper editor Sir Harold Evans dies at 92,"Former Sunday Times editor Sir Harold Evans has died at the age of 92. The British-American journalist, who led an investigation into the drug Thalidomide, died of heart failure in New York, his wife Tina Brown said. His 70-year career also saw him work as a magazine founder, book publisher, author and - at the time of his death - Reuters' editor-at-large. Sir Harold was editor of the Sunday Times for 14 years and oversaw many campaigns in that time. He then went on to become the founding editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine and later president of the publishing giant, Random House. Obituary: Sir Harold Evans One of Britain and America's best-known journalists, Sir Harold also wrote several books about the press and in 2003 was given a knighthood for his services to journalism. A year earlier, a poll by the Press Gazette and the British Journalism Review named him the greatest newspaper editor of all time. Author and editorTina Brown said on Twitter,externalthat her husband was ""the most magical of men"" and had been ""my soulmate for 39 years"". Sir Harold Evans was appointed editor-at-large at the Reuters news agency in 2011 Sir Harold forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950. During his tenure as editor of the Sunday Times, his notable campaigns included fighting the Distillers Company for greater compensation for those affected by Thalidomide. But he said campaigns should be selective, and he deplored what he saw as the invasion of privacy by the British tabloid press. Thalidomide, which first appeared in the UK in 1958, was prescribed to expectant mothers to control the symptoms of morning sickness. However, hundreds of these mothers in Britain, and many thousands across the world, gave birth to children with missing limbs, deformed hearts, blindness and other problems. Thalidomide: Were more affected? Ageing in the wake of thalidomide Sir Harold's campaign, launched in 1972, eventually forced the UK manufacturer, Distillers Company - at the time the Sunday Times's biggest advertiser - to increase the compensation payments. He also fought a legal injunction to stop the paper revealing the drug's developers had not gone through the proper testing procedures. Speaking about his campaigning in a 2010 interview withthe Independent,external, Sir Harold said: ""I tried to do - all I hoped to do - was to shed a little light. And if that light grew weeds, we'd have to try and pull them up."" Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Grunenthal It was launched on 1 October 1957 First marketed as a sedative, it was then given to pregnant women to combat morning sickness As many as 10,000 babies of these women were born worldwide with deformities Sir Harold and his second wife Tina Brown pictured in 1989, after their move to New York City Sir Harold later edited the Times but left in 1981 following a public falling-out with the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, over editorial independence. Writing about,externaltheir relationship, Sir Harold described his decision not to ""campaign against"" Mr Murdoch's takeover of the papers as ""the worst in my professional career"". He added: ""My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what the Times became."" Harry Evans personified not only the noblest possibilities of journalism, but of social mobility in the 20th Century too. Born into what he called ""the respectable working-class"", his route to national and international acclaim via the streets of Manchester and Darlington - the latter as editor of the Northern Echo - is sadly a route few take today. He embodied the most romantic ideal of an editor: a humble hack taking on mighty forces through the dogged pursuit of truth. Though he later fell out with Rupert Murdoch, and never forgave him, in his 14 years at the helm of the Sunday Times he redefined journalism itself. He was a master craftsman, in a trade where practical wisdom was precious and vital; and he combined a flair for layout, projection and design with a remarkable nose for a story, particularly those with human suffering at their heart. But above all he was brave. During his reign, it seemed no super-rich bully or powerful government could intimidate him. In our era of information overload, diminished trust in journalism, and fewer people willing to pay for news, the nostalgia for what he represented is impossible to resist. As he put it himself in the title of his wonderful memoir from 2009, he reached the top in Vanished Times. He had the resources, and the time, to hold power to account - and he did uniquely well. Mixed with his charm and sheer decency, this put journalism itself in a debt to him that will never be fully serviced. Journalists have paid tribute to his campaigning work on the Thalidomide scandal and other injustices. Alan Rusbridger, former editor of the Guardian, said he was a ""master craftsman of journalism"" who ""was the editor we all wanted to be"". Andrew Neil, a former editor of the Sunday Times, described Sir Harold as the ""greatest editor of his generation"" and one with an ""unerring instinct for a story"". Author Robert Harris told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Sir Harold was an outsider coming in to the Sunday Times, the ""son of a railway man who wanted to take on the establishment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who once worked as a journalist at the Times newspaper, described Sir Harold as a ""true pioneer of investigative journalism"" who ""will always be remembered"" for ""tirelessly campaigning on behalf of those who were affected"" by the Thalidomide scandal that he exposed. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ""Sir Harold Evans was a giant among journalists who strove to put the ordinary man and woman at the heart of his reporting."" And Glen Harrison, a Thalidomide survivor and deputy chairman of the campaign group Thalidomide UK, described Sir Harold as ""an outstanding human being for our cause"". After leaving the Times, Sir Harold and his second wife, Tina Brown, moved to New York. She edited Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, while he became founding editor of Conde Nast magazine. In 2011, at the age of 82, Sir Harold was appointed editor-at-large at Reuters, the organisation's editor-in-chief describing him as ""one of the greatest minds in journalism"".

LiveLiveUK to announce measures to protect jobs3 minutes ago,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces a new Job Support Scheme, starting in November It replaces the 'furlough scheme' and means the government will pay part of workers' wages who have lost hours The worker must do at least one-third of normal hours, and the government and employer will pay one-third each of the lost hours The cut in VAT to 5% for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended until 31 March Sunak says he wants to protect 'viable jobs' - but warns not every job can be saved People coming to England from Denmark, Iceland, Slovakia, and Curacao must now self-isolate for 14 days The UK confirms another 6,634 cases - up from 6,178 on Wednesday AC Milan footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic tests positive, but says he has no symptoms Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" with countries on the brink of national lockdowns, EU health official warns US President Donald Trump has said a move by the FDA to introduce stricter guidelines for coronavirus vaccines was ""political"" Iran's virus death toll has passed 25,000 as the country, the worst affected in the Middle East, sees a spike in cases Edited by Owen Amos We're now closing our live page - thanks for joining us. We'll be back tomorrow. The live page writers today were: Joseph Lee, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Victoria Bisset, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. A flag tribute to Americans who have died with Covid-19 can been seen in Washington DC In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a close for today. Before then, here's a recap of the main UK stories from today. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Read more More than 40 children have tested positive after an outbreak linked to a wedding in the German town of Hamm, German news agency DPA reports. Nine schools have been affected by the cluster of cases, a spokesman for the city said on Thursday, adding that only one of the children infected had no connection to the wedding. Of the almost 200 people in the town to have tested positive, 150 were guests at the wedding, according to the town's official website. A total of 300 people are currently in quarantine and are subject to mandatory testing. The news comes as a second German minister went into quarantine after he was found to have contact with an infected individual. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who hosted a meeting of EU trade ministers in Berlin on Monday, said he was self-isolating as a precaution after the employee of a minister who attended had tested positive. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was in quarantine after a member of his security staff tested positive. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tested positive on Wednesday The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Russia has reached 6,595, the highest since mid-July. In the capital, Moscow, cases are at their highest level since late June. Russia has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and almost 20,000 deaths since the pandemic began, and there are fears the new figures could signal a new wave in the country. Moscow has already registered the world's first coronavirus vaccine, despite experts saying the trials were too small to prove its safety and effectiveness. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, lambasted the US over its coronavirus criticism Senior diplomats from China and the US have lashed out at each other at a meeting of the UN Security Council, deepening a row over the coronavirus pandemic. Chinaâs ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, used his speech to reject US attempts to blame the country for the pandemic. âI must say, enough is enough! You have created enough troubles for the world already,"" he told the meeting via video link on Thursday. âIf someone should be held accountable, it should be a few US politicians themselves.â His comments appeared to be a response to US President Donald Trump,who called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemicin his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week. Tensions between China and the US have flared over the pandemic and a number of other issues, including trade and alleged human rights abuses. The US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, voiced anger at the tone of Thursdayâs UN Security Council meeting. ""You know, shame on each of you. I am astonished and I am disgusted by the content of today's discussion,"" Craft said. Earlier, we reported thatthe UK recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases on Thursday- the highest figure since mass testing began. The below charts show the trends in cases and deaths - both before and since mass testing became available. However, hospital admissions data was not available in Thursday's figures, which are released by the government. You can look at more detail at the numbers in our piece tracking UK caseshere. More than 10,000 people have died in Indonesia Indonesia has seen a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. More than 4,600 new infections were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number to 262,000. More than 10,000 people have died in the country since the pandemic began. Indonesia is the 17th country to pass 10,000 Covid deaths, While the official figures are the highest in South East Asia, there are fears the true number of cases could be much higher due to the country's low testing rate. Earlier this week, the official in charge of the country's coronavirus response in the nine worst-hit provinces police and the military could break up illegal rallies in the run-up to December's regional elections. More than 25,000 people have died with coronavirus in Iran, official figures show, as the country witnesses a spike in cases. A ministry spokesman said today that 175 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 25,015. However,an investigation by BBC Persian earlier this yearfound the number of coronavirus deaths was nearly three times as high as the official statistics. The government's own records appeared to show almost 42,000 people had died with Covid-19 symptoms in the run up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry at the time. The country is the worst affected in the Middle East, with more than 436,000 coronavirus cases recorded to date. Earlier this week, an official warned the country is facing a third wave of infections. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The official records may show that the UK has just seen the highest number of new cases reported on a single day.  But it is, of course, nothing of the sort.  At the peak of the pandemic in the spring we had such limited testing capacity that it was largely only hospital patients who were being checked.  It meant we were identifying just the tip of the iceberg.  Estimates have suggested there may have been as many 100,000 cases a day at the peak.  We are clearly not capturing all the infections - even now with the mass testing that is available.  Surveillance data last week suggested we may only be identifying around a half of cases. But that still puts the infection levels well below what they were in the spring.  Hospital admissions and deaths have also started creeping up, but are still very low.  Health experts have been clear we are now on the upwards path so we should expect this trend to continue. Crucial will be how quickly figures rise for all three measures - with the hospital cases and deaths the most important. Evidence from Spain and France, which started seeing rises a few weeks before us, offer some hope. Cases have been climbing gradually - at least more gradually than the trajectory government scientists warned could lead the UK to 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italian President Sergio Mattarella responded to Boris Johnson's comments on Thursday The president of Italy has rebuked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for suggesting that Britons were more ""freedom-loving"" than his compatriots. It was in parliament this week that Johnson was asked by a Labour MP whether Italy and Germany had lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK because of more efficient testing and tracing. ""No"" the prime minister replied. ""There is an important difference between our country and many others around the world - ours is a freedom-loving country,"" he added. Now, Italian President Sergio Mattarella has responded, telling reporters: ""We Italians also love freedom â but seriousness is dear to us as well."" Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus and impose a national lockdown, appears to have brought the pandemic under control. Mask-wearing is scrupulous, testing is widespread and restrictions have remained in place for a long time. But in a country that fought for independence and liberation from Nazi occupation, its president has reminded Johnson that the love of freedom isn't exclusively a British value. Plans to resume weekly mass participation Parkrun events in October have been scrapped due to stricter coronavirus rules. The events, which take place in more than 700 parks across the UK, were suspendedin March because of the pandemic. Organisers had hoped to resume in October, but new rules introduced due to rising case numbers have forced a re-think. Parkrun chief executive Nick Pearson said they felt it ""would be insensitive to push forward with reopening"". Read more Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven warned against complacency Sweden has seen a âworryingâ rise in coronavirus infections in parts of the country where people have not been taking social distancing seriously, its prime minister has said. Stefan Lofven said the coronavirus situation in Sweden was âstableâ compared to other countries, but there were signs of a resurgence. ""That's worrying. It requires that we tighten our behaviour,"" the prime minister said at a media briefing on Thursday. âThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs and parties, bus trips in rush-hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal.â Sweden has recorded more than 90,000 infections and almost 6,000 deaths to date, higher figures than its Nordic neighbours on both counts. Unlike most countries, Sweden did not impose a sweeping lockdown at the height of the pandemicâs first wave. Instead, the countryâs health officials emphasised personal responsibility, with limited restrictions on life. We reported earlier that the UK has reported 6,634 new cases, up from 6,178 the day before. Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""The signals are clear. Positivity rates are rising across all age groups and we're continuing to see spikes in rates of admission to hospital and critical care. ""We must all follow the new measures that have been bought in to help control the virus and download the new NHS Covid-19 App which is the fastest way of knowing when you're at risk."" She also said: ""This is the highest number recorded and a stark warning for us all."" While 6,634 cases is the highest number recorded by mass testing, experts believe the true number of daily cases was far higher earlier in the pandemic. France is one of the countries to have witnessed a rise in cases Europe is at a ""decisive moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, with countries on the brink of national lockdowns amid a second wave of infections, the European Union's health commissioner has warned. ""It might be our last chance to prevent a repeat of last spring,"" Stella Kyriakides said today. ""All member states must be ready to roll out measures immediately and at the right time."" Earlier this year, countries across Europe imposed strict nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus, grinding economic activity to an abrupt halt. Allow Twitter content?

Kyriakides's warning echoesthat of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),external, which today said it was concerned about the rising number of infections on the continent. The EU agency said health messages ""should emphasise that the pandemic is far from over"", adding that the current situation ""poses an increasing risk of infection for vulnerable individuals"" and health workers. The UK government has announced another 6,634 Covid-19 cases - that's an increase on Wednesday's figure, which was 6,178. They also said a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. That's up from 37 deaths announced on Wednesday. We'll have more charts setting out the spread of the virus in the UK later. We've been reporting today on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new measures to support jobs and the economy, including the Job Support Scheme, which will replace the Job Retention Scheme. But the government has also repeatedly referred to an existing measure aimed at encouraging employers to keep on staff that had been furloughed. The Job Retention Bonus is a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee still in meaningful employment at the end of January. Eligible employees must earn at least Â£520 a month on average between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said the bonus, in conjunction with the Job Support Scheme, has given firms a ""big incentive"" to retain staff merely until the end of January. Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and the Caribbean island of Curacao have been removed from the UK government's list of travel corridors, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. That means travellers arriving in England from those countries after 04:00 BST on Saturday must self-isolate for 14 days, Shapps said. He reminded travellers that they must self-isolate when returning from a non-exempt country, or face a fine starting from Â£1,000. Allow Twitter content?

NHS Covid-19 app launches for the over-16sUsers are being urged to install the app to protect themselves and others against the resurgent virus.,"Users will be told to self-isolate if the app determines they are at high risk of being infected More than one million people have downloaded the government's contact-tracing app for England and Wales within its first day of release. NHS Covid-19 instructs users to self-isolate for 14 days if it detects they were nearby someone who has the virus. It also has a check-in scanner to alert owners if a venue they have visited is found to be an outbreak hotspot. Anyone aged 16 and over is being asked to install it. The government plans to give its own download tally on Monday. This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the app ""helps us to find more people who are at risk of having the virus"" that human contact tracers are unable to find. ""Everybody who downloads the app will be helping to protect themselves, helping to protect their loved ones, helping to protect their community because the more people who download it, the more effective it will be,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The app keeps secret who receives a self-isolation alert. And there was some confusion about whether users could ignore a notification telling them to stay at home. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""That self-isolation is voluntary, unlike the mandatory self-isolation if you are called by NHS Test and Trace."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said people might need to ""upgrade"" to access the NHS Covid-19 app But the Department of Health had earlier said that users must obey the command and would in theory be liable for fines of Â£1,000 or more if they did not, while acknowledging it had no way to check. A senior source has since told the BBC that the notification is ""advisory"" because the authorities cannot legally enforce something that cannot be proved. How to use England and Wales' contact-tracing app How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? The decision to allow those 16 and over to download the app is a change from trials, which were limited to the over-18s. User will have to verify they are over 16 before they can start using the app The move reflects a desire by health chiefs for the software to be used by as many students in further education colleges and universities as possible. The age limit is in line with the Protect Scotland contact-tracing app. And health chiefs behind Northern Ireland's StopCOVID NI have said they intend to launch a new version that accepts under-18s later this month. The launch comes as the UKreported 6,178 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. The government had originally intended to release the app months ago. But problems with the initial design and the addition of extra features meant it was only ready for its final public test in August. One tech expert who has tracked the initiative acknowledged the team involved had worked hard to address concerns about privacy and transparency, but said wider problems could still limit its impact. ""Not only is the app late to launch, but it will be hindered by the delays in the testing system,"" Rachel Coldicutt told the BBC. ""If you don't have symptoms, will a push notification saying you were near someone a week ago make you and your family self-isolate and spend days hitting refresh on the testing website, trying to find a test?"" Although the app allows users to order a coronavirus test and automatically get the results, the government does not believe it will complicate efforts to meet demand. The app is available for smartphones only - not tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go toAndroid's Google Play,externalorApple's App Store,externaland search for ""NHS Covid-19"". The handsets must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. And some of the latest Huawei handsets are excluded. The notification will tell the recipient to go into self-isolation for a fortnight - and trigger the start of the app's countdown clock. Even if the recipient has no symptoms or a subsequent negative test result, they must stay at home for the duration. Unlike when a human contact tracer orders someone to self-isolate, the app keeps the subject's identity a secret. Those that have not received such an alert, but fill in the app's symptoms checker and meet the criteria, will be directed to self-isolate for eight days. They will also be directed to an external website to book a test. Read more about how the app works in our Q&A Automated contact tracing is designed to complement the work done by humans by helping to identify encounters with strangers - for example, someone standing close to a user while waiting in a queue outside a shop. When someone anonymously shares a positive Covid-19 test result via the app, a process developed by Apple and Google makes other users' smartphones check if they had recently detected the infected person's handset. But smartphones were not designed for this purpose and the readings involved are not always accurate. This has led to fears of ""false positives"" - people being instructed to self-isolate who were never at risk. A publicity campaign will encourage users to download the app to protect others However, health chiefs believe a recent change to the calculations involved should help minimise the problem: they now take into account when the virus-carrier was at their most contagious. One of the app's other major features is a scanner to let it keep track of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other places the user has visited. Hospitality venues in England now face Â£1,000 fines if they do not display an officialTest and Trace poster featuring a QR barcode assigned to them,external. Cinemas, community centres and places of worship are also being asked to display authorised QR barcode posters So far, the government says more than 160,000 businesses have downloaded a unique code for their property. The benefit is that if officials later identify a venue as being at the centre of an outbreak, they can update a database which the phones regularly check for a match. Users can then be told to self-isolate and/or get tested, depending on the circumstances, without having to revealing their identities. Other facilities, including postcode-based threat updates and details of the latest guidance, are intended to encourage people to regularly look at the app and change their behaviour. But a major challenge will be convincing them to download it in the first place: officials suggest only about one in 10 people installed the app during a recent trial in the London Borough of Newham, an area picked for its ethnic diversity. When the BBC visited on Wednesday, a reporter could only find one person using it Scotland's app launched about a fortnight ago, and roughly one in five people there have installed it Ireland, one of the leaders in the field, has still only convinced about one in three people to use its app, which was released in July To encourage adoption in England and Wales, the the major mobile networks have agreed not to deduct data used by the app from subscribers' monthly allowances. In addition, the app now supports more languages than the test version - adding Turkish, Arabic, Mandarin, Romanian and soon Polish. The app provides a risk score for the user's neighbourhood as well as a self-isolation countdown clock And it now allows users to delete individual venue visits from the app's ""digital diary"". This followed feedback from victims of domestic abuse, whose partners often check their phones. One change, however, may be less popular. Those told to go into self-isolation because of a contact-tracing match will not be able to challenge the decision. Adocument published online had indicated,externalthat users would be able to call an NHS 111 operator, who might overrule the command. TESTING:What tests are available?

Male domestic abuse 'soars during Covid lockdown',"Some men who have suffered domestic abuse have slept in cars or tents in the gardens of friends or relatives Charities dealing with men who suffer domestic abuse have seen pleas for help jump by up to 60% during the lockdown. The Respect Men's Advice Line said some victims had told them they had sought refuge by sleeping in cars or in tents in the gardens of friends or relatives. The charity said it had received 13,812 calls and emails between April and July in lockdown compared to 8,648 in the same period in 2019. Respect's Ippo Panteloudakis said the pandemic had made the problem worse. He said: ""It was absolutely clear the lockdown period exacerbated everyone's domestic abuse experiences. ""They were talking about increases in violence, increases in psychological abuse and becoming homeless as a result of the domestic abuse and not having anywhere to go. ""We had reports from men sleeping in their cars overnight or sleeping in their friends' or parents' gardens in tents."" The advice line said the biggest increase in contact with abuse victims came through emails and the service saw the volume increase by 96% from 372 emails in June 2019 to 728 in June 2020. On average it received 22 emails a day and 92 phone calls as the lockdown took hold from April to June. Men Standing Up service manager Nikasha Khan said the coronavirus restrictions meant more of the work was done on the telephone Bradford-based charity Men Standing Up takes male domestic abuse referrals from across the country. It started up six years ago and has dealt with more than 4,000 cases. Men Standing Up has so-called crash pads and emergency accommodation for men for up to 14 days. Before the coronavirus lockdown it ran a support group and helped victims attend court for hearings over restraining orders or to go to GP appointments. Service manager Nikasha Khan said: ""It's gone from them being able to pick up the phone and say 'I'm feeling really down, could we go out for a coffee?'. ""That's had to stop unfortunately because of the restrictions so we've been trying to provide as much telephone support as possible and give them that emotional support that they need but they have been struggling with that."" A man who contacted Men Standing Up for help said he had wanted to kill himself because of the domestic abuse he suffered One man in West Yorkshire who was directed to Men Standing Up by the advice line said he asked for help as he had wanted to kill himself after suffering years of psychological abuse including gaslighting, controlling behaviour and financial abuse. The man, who did not want to reveal his identity, said: ""I needed help, I needed to get out of this place because I was watched everywhere I was going - every single step. ""It was killing me from inside and I needed to get out to see the world. ""I used to cry all the time, I just used to isolate myself in my room and I used to be there for days. ""If it wasn't for Men Standing Up I wouldn't have known what to do - I could've been dead. ""With men they just keep it inside them, just keep quiet and pass the time and just for the sake of the kids they do it, but it doesn't get any easier, it just gets worse."" Ean Monk from the charity said: ""The service was set up as a response to the growing number of men who were accessing our homelessness services who were saying the primary reason for homelessness was domestic abuse."" More than 40,000calls and contacts were made to the National Domestic Abuse Helplineduring the first three months of lockdown, most by women seeking help, figures showed. In June, calls and contacts were nearly 80% higher than usual, said the charity Refuge, which runs the helpline. And as restrictions initially eased, there was a surge in women seeking refuge places to escape their abusers, the charity said.

Ford closure 'grieving process' for workforce,"This video can not be played Four decades of manufacturing axed The closure of the Ford engine plant in Bridgend has been a ""grieving process"" for the workforce and is ""devastating for the local community"", says a worker and union official. The 1,700 highly-skilled, well-paid jobs ""can't be replaced"", said Andrew Pearson, Unite convener at the site. Ford in Bridgend had been a driving force in the Welsh automotive industry since it began operating 40 years ago. The closure decision in 2019 was blamed on ""changing customer demand and cost"". Workers leaving the plant when the closure was announced in June 2019 The Welsh Government said at the time it was ""absolutely livid"" at Ford's decision and that it ""expected more"" from the car giant. Currently, 999 staff are still working at the plant and BBC Wales believes a large number are expected to finish on Thursday with the others following on Friday with the final closure of the plant. Andrew Pearson said there were workers from 23 different Senedd constituencies Mr Pearson, who has worked at the factory for 14 years, said: ""It was seen as a job for life and it was certainly life changing. ""I wanted to work for them for another 20 years and that's been taken away from me. So it's really tough for me personally and is tough for my family."" He added that Friday would be ""very, very emotional and upsetting"" for everyone at the plant and the local community. But the Unite representative said workers at Ford lived in 23 constituencies across Wales so the impact would be felt well beyond Bridgend too. While Mr Pearson remains critical of Ford's decision to close the plant in the first place, he argued the company had done a lot to support workers over the past 15 months. That included funding for retraining, skills development and community projects. A look back at 40 years of Ford in Bridgend Ford Bridgend loses out in global race Bridgend - the M4 town A task force was set up to try to help bring new jobs and new companies to the area as well as support workers and the local community. ""We can't replace the high-value jobs,"" Mr Pearson argued. ""They're very well paid jobs, we're not going to be able to replace them. These jobs don't come about too often."" This video can not be played The story behind how the Ford engine plant in Bridgend was built between 1977 and 1980. The plant opened in May 1980 after Bridgend beat competition from Ireland for the Â£180m investment The engine was built for the launch of the new Ford Escort, which became one of the most popular cars Originally there were hopes for 2,500 workers, but new production techniques meant only 1,400 were taken on The number of automotive firms grew - there are more than 70 components suppliers along the M4 corridor and valleys alone During the 40 years, the plant has produced more than 22 million engines In 2008, Ford took a more global outlook on its operations - and made its last vehicle in the UK in 2013 Bridgend also made engines for Jaguar but its demise was sealed by the scaling back of plans for a new Dragon engine. Closure was announced in June 2019. Bridgend, on the M4 corridor, has above average numbers working in manufacturing At 76%, the employment rate in Bridgend is close to the average for Great Britain and a little higher than Wales as a whole (74%). But it is heavily dependent on manufacturing, a sector that faces a great deal of uncertainty due to Covid-19 and Brexit. The latest figures show 15.5% of employees work in the sector in Bridgend compared with 11.4% for Wales and 8.1% for Great Britain. Aston Martin has employed hundreds of workers in the Vale of Glamorgan but there was disappointment in July whenIneos announced it was suspending plans to build its new 4x4 in Bridgend. Training opportunities have also been limited due to the pandemic, according to Unite. The trade union said nobody could blame the workforce for the end of production at Ford Bridgend. ""I want to make sure that we left with our heads held high,"" concluded Mr Pearson. ""This is about a global decision made by Ford Motor Company and it's certainly nothing to do with the performance or the commitment from our members in the plant over the last few years."" Tim Williams, chief executive of the Welsh Automotive Forum, said there was hope from the news thatelectric car battery firm Britishvolt was bringing hundreds of jobs to the Vale of Glamorgan. ""We have to make sure companies are anchored here in Wales and stay in Wales,"" said Mr Williams. ""The industry has a future of course but it's going to be down over the next couple of years.""

Sturgeon calls for stronger UK Covid restrictions,"Nicola Sturgeon has written to Boris Johnson calling for urgent four-nation talks to tighten lockdown restrictions further. The Scottish first minister cited scientific opinion that stronger action was needed to control coronavirus. Ms Sturgeon also said more financial support was necessary to cushion the impact on businesses. It comes as the chancellor prepares to unveil plans to minimise job losses as new Covid restrictions come into force. Rishi Sunak is expected to replace the furlough scheme, which is set to expire next month.. Covid crisis forces Autumn Budget to be scrapped Scotland records highest number of new cases In July, about 700,000 workers in Scotland, many in the hospitality sector, were still receiving some or all of their income through the scheme. The Scottish government has already gone further than the Westminster government in introducing restrictions to limit the spread of the virus,by banning different households from meeting inside their homes. As in other parts of the UK, a 22:00 ""curfew"" for bars and restaurants will be introduced in Scotland later this week  - but at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon hinted she believed this did not go far enough. She said if more money had been available to help the hospitality sector it was ""likely"" she would have come to a ""different decision"". In her letter to the prime minister, she said the collective agreement to drive down Covid to the lowest possible level was ""particularly welcome"". But she continued: ""While all four governments announced new restrictions yesterday, there is clearly a significant strand of scientific opinion to the effect that bringing R back below one and the virus back under control will require measures beyond those which any of us have so far announced. ""In my view, there is considerable force in that opinion."" Nicola Sturgeon has hinted that a 22:00 curfew on pubs and restaurants may not go far enough Ms Sturgeon said experience from earlier this year had shown how essential acting ""quickly and decisively"" against the virus had been. ""In other words, if we believe further action will be required there is nothing to be gained - and potentially much to be lost, including lives - from delay."" Ms Sturgeon said the four nations should discuss what further actions might be necessary, what support was required for affected sectors and what arrangements could be put in place to ensure that devolved administrations were not constrained when making what they judge to be essential public health decisions. The Scottish government has repeatedly called for greater borrowing powers as it seeks to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. In response to Ms Sturgeon's letter, the UK government highlighted the support being given through the Treasury to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. A spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister held a Cobra meeting on Tuesday which was attended by the leaders of the devolved administrations. ""This crisis has shown clearly the value of Scotland being part of a strong United Kingdom, with the UK government providing the bulk of Covid testing in Scotland, the UK's armed forces playing a key role in providing support for Scottish communities, and the UK Treasury playing an absolutely critical role in supporting jobs and business across Scotland.

'My bank is shutting my account because of Brexit',"Sharon, who lives in the Netherlands, was shocked to receive a letter saying her current account will be closed unless she can provide a UK address ""I was shocked to receive a notification saying that my bank account is going to be closed in two months,"" says Sharon Clarke, a Briton who has been living in the Netherlands for 20 years and who banks with Lloyds. ""They said that unless I provide a UK address, my account will be closed and I'll have to cut up my card."" She is one of thousands of British expats living in the EU who are being told their bank accounts will be closed because of Brexit. Lloyds Bank has written to 13,000 personal and business customers, saying it will no longer be able to offer banking services once theBrexit transition period ends on 31 December. And Money Box found Barclays, Barclaycard and Coutts - which is owned by NatWest Group - are taking similar action. Experts say it is because lenders will lose their EU banking licences, making operating in some countries too costly. However, HSBC and Santander say they have no plans to close British expat accounts in the EU. Ms Clarke says she has been given until early November to close her account and transfer all monies, standing orders and regular payments to another bank. She says she has never had any financial problems with Lloyds, having banked with them ""for decades"". Robert Kane, who lives in Spain, was told to close his Barclaycard account Britons living in the Netherlands, Slovakia, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have all been sent similar letters. One of them is Robert Kane, who lives in Spain and has a Barclaycard credit card. ""I find this an unbelievable situation that Barclaycard will lose so many thousands of customers because of Brexit,"" Robert says. ""I don't have a UK address as I live in Spain and have done for the last 14 years. They did not offer me any advice other than cut up my card, cancel any regular payments and carry on paying outstanding balances."" A source at NatWest, which owns Coutts, says it has no intention of closing accounts unless there is no other option and any customers who may be affected will be contacted. Banks have told customers to cut up their bank cards if they don't have a UK address Sarah Hall, a fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, a research unit at King's College London, says that EU-wide banking rules will not apply to Britain after Brexit. UK banks will no longer be allowed to provide services to customers in the EU without the right banking licences. This is known as passporting, a system for banks in the EU which allows them to trade freely in any other state in the European Economic Area (EEA) without the need for more authorisation. Sarah said that although HSBC and Santander will still offer banking, others feel it is not worthwhile commercially. ""Some UK banks decided the size and scale of the client base is small, not profitable enough to warrant a subsidiary, so they have determined they will exit that market. It's a potential postcode lottery. ""This means the market will be harder to navigate as a customer. It's less certain and could mean less choice and maybe higher interest and lower saving rates because of less competition."" In a statement, Lloyds said: ""We have written to a small number of customers living in affected EU countries to let them know that due to the UK's exit from the EU, regrettably we will no longer be able to provide them with some UK-based banking services."" Barclays would not reveal how many accounts are going to be closed, but said it would be contacting affected customers. The UK trade body UK Finance said the finance industry had been working hard to get ready for Brexit. ""Where possible, firms want to keep providing banking services to customers living in the EEA after the transition period. ""The impact on each customer will vary depending on the operating model of their bank or provider, the product or service being provided, and the legal and regulatory framework in the country in which they are resident.""

The battered North East firms not ready for Brexit,"Brexit protests on the the River Tyne in Newcastle At any other time the prospect of the biggest change in the UK's trading arrangements with its biggest economic partner would dominate the thinking of almost every business. But Covid-ravaged firms who have been in a fight for survival for the last six months have found it hard to find the time, money or bandwidthto give much thought to Brexit. Although the UK left the EU in January, it's business as usual until 31 December when the transition period ends and the reality of Brexit becomes apparent. With just 98 days to go until then, a new survey from the British Chambers of Commerce has found that half of UK firms that trade internationally have not analysed the impact Brexit may have on their business. Nick Hart from Hart Door systems in Newcastle confesses that he is one of them. ""To be totally honest, before you called me, I hadn't really thought about it. We don't do a lot of trade directly with the EU but a lot of my customers in the UK do. The big unknown is how much it will affect them and in turn how that will affect us,"" he told me. One of his biggest customers is Nissan, which employs 7,000 people directly at its plant in Sunderland. And that supports tens of thousands more in the supply chain. Nissan exports more than 50% of the cars it makes in the North East to the EU. The Japanese firm has repeatedly warned that if the UK and the EU fail to strike a trade deal, the 10% tariff the EU imposes on all cars made anywhere outside the bloc could threaten the plant's future. Not far down the road, Ryan Maughan runs Avid Technology, which supplies components for electrical vehicles and relies on the EU for two thirds of its orders. If there is no deal he would reluctantly have to move a significant amount of production to the EU. He says the stress of that - on top of surviving Covid - has been immense. ""Covid has been a nightmare - all consuming. And now we've somehow got to find the extra time and resources to plan for Brexit. The stress for me is that I know I should be doing something to get ready, but I don't know what that is. I love the North East I want my business to stay here but if there's a bad deal or no deal that involves tariffs, I will have to move some of the operations to mainland Europe."" The North East is the part of the UK that is most reliant on EU exports. Nowhere else does the amount it sells to Europe exceed what it buys from Europe to such a degree. Nowhere else then has potentially more to lose from a failure to reach a deal. However, the North East is also a prime candidate for the kind of direct investment the government wants to make in the regions as part of its ""levelling up"" agenda, without any interference or permission needed from Brussels. One of the biggest stumbling blocks to securing a deal is a row over ""state aid"". The EU doesn't want UK government-backed companies enjoying a competitive advantage. If the UK wants tariff-free access to EU markets, it must play on a level playing field. The irony here is that EU governments spend far more on supporting the private sector than the UK has ever done. But Newcastle-based lawyer Alex Rose, a specialist in state-aid law, said that while the UK could do most of the things it says it wants to do under the current EU guidelines, if you are leaving, you might as well get to write your own rules. ""There is a really good opportunity here to create a Rolls-Royce state aid regime that will allow us to fund our priorities,"" he said. ""Those priorities might be environmental, they might be 'levelling up' - creating jobs in areas that have been economically underperforming. Ultimately, politically the referendum result seems to require a UK-specific state aid regime."" Brian Palmer owns Tharsus Robotics, which makes high-tech equipment for Ocado - among others - and has just sealed a major contract with BMW. He says that is proof that UK companies can compete come what may - and agrees that state aid can help if done right. ""Well-targeted state aid can really help growing businesses be brave, make investment decisions ahead of time and really stretch themselves. So, if the government has a really clear policy and uses state aid wisely, I think that can be of benefit, but it cannot be at the risk of the reputation of the country as a trading nation,"" he said. But to others it's a strange altar on which to sacrifice a trade deal. Why scupper a deal that almost all businesses say they want for the freedom to do something the UK has historically rarely done? Talks are still ongoing and both the EU and UK say they want a deal but progress is hard to discern. The chances of a no-deal Brexit have arguably never been higher. Battered bruised and fighting for survival, are businesses ready for a deeply uncertain three months ahead? Not according to Richard Swart from Berger Closures - another North East-based company enjoying success in a manufacturing niche - supplying the seals that keep the lids on drums and barrels. And 25% of those seals are sold to the EU. ""It's been an incredibly strange and depressing six months with the focus on survival which has pushed Brexit right down the list of priorities,"" he said. But, surely business has had ample time before Covid struck to prepare for a range of Brexit outcomes. Why complain when there is 98 days to go? You hope for the best but prepare for the worst - right? ""We have talked to our customers and they have made it very clear that we must bear any additional costs of a no-deal. Remember in this case it is the government who has created the uncertainty,"" he said. The British Chambers of Commerce agrees to an extent, saying there is a limit to what business can do when there are so many basic unanswered questions. What labelling will UK food and drink of EU export require? How will foreign-sourced components in UK-finished goods be treated? How will development funds that used to come from the EU be replaced? These and other mind, money, and time-draining issues are something the government could help with. The BCC says the government's campaign encouraging business to 'Check, Change, Go' gives the impression that Brexit preparation is like getting an MOT - whereas the reality is that for many businesses, it's ""more akin to planning a moon landing"". Mission control has other problems on its mind right now.

Ex-Sunday Times editor Sir Harold Evans dies at 92,"Former Sunday Times editor Sir Harold Evans has died at the age of 92. The British-American journalist, who led an investigation into the drug Thalidomide, died of heart failure in New York, his wife Tina Brown said. His 70-year career also saw him work as a magazine founder, book publisher, author and - at the time of his death - Reuters' editor-at-large. Sir Harold was editor of the Sunday Times for 14 years and oversaw many campaigns in that time. He then went on to become the founding editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine and later president of the publishing giant, Random House. Obituary: Sir Harold Evans One of Britain and America's best-known journalists, Sir Harold also wrote several books about the press and in 2003 was given a knighthood for his services to journalism. A year earlier, a poll by the Press Gazette and the British Journalism Review named him the greatest newspaper editor of all time. Author and editorTina Brown said on Twitter,externalthat her husband was ""the most magical of men"" and had been ""my soulmate for 39 years"". Sir Harold Evans was appointed editor-at-large at the Reuters news agency in 2011 Sir Harold forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950. During his tenure as editor of the Sunday Times, his notable campaigns included fighting the Distillers Company for greater compensation for those affected by Thalidomide. But he said campaigns should be selective, and he deplored what he saw as the invasion of privacy by the British tabloid press. Thalidomide, which first appeared in the UK in 1958, was prescribed to expectant mothers to control the symptoms of morning sickness. However, hundreds of these mothers in Britain, and many thousands across the world, gave birth to children with missing limbs, deformed hearts, blindness and other problems. Thalidomide: Were more affected? Ageing in the wake of thalidomide Sir Harold's campaign, launched in 1972, eventually forced the UK manufacturer, Distillers Company - at the time the Sunday Times's biggest advertiser - to increase the compensation payments. He also fought a legal injunction to stop the paper revealing the drug's developers had not gone through the proper testing procedures. Speaking about his campaigning in a 2010 interview withthe Independent,external, Sir Harold said: ""I tried to do - all I hoped to do - was to shed a little light. And if that light grew weeds, we'd have to try and pull them up."" Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Grunenthal It was launched on 1 October 1957 First marketed as a sedative, it was then given to pregnant women to combat morning sickness As many as 10,000 babies of these women were born worldwide with deformities Sir Harold and his second wife Tina Brown pictured in 1989, after their move to New York City Sir Harold later edited the Times but left in 1981 following a public falling-out with the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, over editorial independence. Writing about,externaltheir relationship, Sir Harold described his decision not to ""campaign against"" Mr Murdoch's takeover of the papers as ""the worst in my professional career"". He added: ""My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what the Times became."" Harry Evans personified not only the noblest possibilities of journalism, but of social mobility in the 20th Century too. Born into what he called ""the respectable working-class"", his route to national and international acclaim via the streets of Manchester and Darlington - the latter as editor of the Northern Echo - is sadly a route few take today. He embodied the most romantic ideal of an editor: a humble hack taking on mighty forces through the dogged pursuit of truth. Though he later fell out with Rupert Murdoch, and never forgave him, in his 14 years at the helm of the Sunday Times he redefined journalism itself. He was a master craftsman, in a trade where practical wisdom was precious and vital; and he combined a flair for layout, projection and design with a remarkable nose for a story, particularly those with human suffering at their heart. But above all he was brave. During his reign, it seemed no super-rich bully or powerful government could intimidate him. In our era of information overload, diminished trust in journalism, and fewer people willing to pay for news, the nostalgia for what he represented is impossible to resist. As he put it himself in the title of his wonderful memoir from 2009, he reached the top in Vanished Times. He had the resources, and the time, to hold power to account - and he did uniquely well. Mixed with his charm and sheer decency, this put journalism itself in a debt to him that will never be fully serviced. Journalists have paid tribute to his campaigning work on the Thalidomide scandal and other injustices. Alan Rusbridger, former editor of the Guardian, said he was a ""master craftsman of journalism"" who ""was the editor we all wanted to be"". Andrew Neil, a former editor of the Sunday Times, described Sir Harold as the ""greatest editor of his generation"" and one with an ""unerring instinct for a story"". Author Robert Harris told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Sir Harold was an outsider coming in to the Sunday Times, the ""son of a railway man who wanted to take on the establishment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who once worked as a journalist at the Times newspaper, described Sir Harold as a ""true pioneer of investigative journalism"" who ""will always be remembered"" for ""tirelessly campaigning on behalf of those who were affected"" by the Thalidomide scandal that he exposed. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ""Sir Harold Evans was a giant among journalists who strove to put the ordinary man and woman at the heart of his reporting."" And Glen Harrison, a Thalidomide survivor and deputy chairman of the campaign group Thalidomide UK, described Sir Harold as ""an outstanding human being for our cause"". After leaving the Times, Sir Harold and his second wife, Tina Brown, moved to New York. She edited Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, while he became founding editor of Conde Nast magazine. In 2011, at the age of 82, Sir Harold was appointed editor-at-large at Reuters, the organisation's editor-in-chief describing him as ""one of the greatest minds in journalism"".
