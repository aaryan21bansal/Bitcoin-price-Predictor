Bowie estate sells rights to entire body of work,"David Bowie, pictured in 1992, released 26 studio albums during his lifetime David Bowie's estate has sold the publishing rights to his ""entire body of work"" to Warner Chappell Music, including hundreds of songs such as Space Oddity, Changes and Let's Dance. WCM now has global music publishing rights to his song catalogue, the singer's estate told the BBC. Variety suggested,externalthe deal was worth ""upwards of $250m (Â£185m)"", but the terms of the agreement were not given. WCM head Guy Moot said they were ""proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"". Bowiedied of cancerin 2016. He was hailed as an extraordinary artist and genius in a huge global outpouring of tributes from fellow music stars, including Sir Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Brian Eno and Madonna among others. Bowie [L] performed Starman on Top of the Pops in 1972 The agreement with WCM includes the 26 studio albums released during Bowie's lifetime and the posthumous studio album release, Toy, plus the two studio albums from Tin Machine - the rock supergroup fronted by Bowie. Tracks released as singles from soundtracks and other projects are also included. Given the ups and downs of the music industry over the last 20 years, the appeal of a big cheque is, perhaps, unsurprising - especially for 'heritage' acts. Streaming may not quite have replaced the billions lost by the decline of the CD, but it is, for many established artists, proving to be a regular, and largely recession-proof, income stream; and for record labels and a number of new firms who have entered the market, this is, they think, a lucrative asset. With the music industry becoming ever more complicated, with licensing deals over streaming, adverts, films, video games and online video to negotiate, the artists - or their estates and families - have a large and hassle-free deposit in the bank, and the complicated job of turning music into money is left to the experts. With Spotify adding 60,000 songs to its catalogue every day, the chance of a new act making a splash seems tougher than ever - legacy artists with 50 years of fame and proven sales look like a relatively safe bet. Bowie released a total of 111 singles, averaging two per year during his career, and 51 music videos. This deal follows huge names, includingBruce Springsteen,Bob DylanandPaul Simon, recently selling the rights to their music catalogues. Moot, who is WCM's co-chairman and chief executive, said Bowie's was ""one of the most ground-breaking, influential, and enduring catalogues in music history"", adding he had ""inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media"". ""These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever,"" he said. This video can not be played David Bowie: A life in lyrics He described Bowie's ""vision and creative genius"" driving him to ""push the envelope, lyrically and musically - writing songs that challenged convention, changed the conversation, and have become part of the canon of global culture"". The executive added they were looking forward to ""tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care"". WCM said the agreement followedlast year's announcement of a deal,externalbetween Bowie's estate and Warner Music Group [WMG], for it to oversee his full back catalogue of albums between 1968 and 1999. ""Warner Music has licensed worldwide rights to Bowie's recorded music catalogue from 1968. With this new deal with Warner Chappell, WMG is now home to Bowie's body of work as both a songwriter and recording artist,"" WCM added. 'Lost' David Bowie album set for birthday release Warner Chappell Music is the global music publishing company of Warner Music Group. WCM co-chair and COO Carianne Marshall said they were ""pleased"" the estate felt they had the "" knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature"". She called Bowie's music a ""living, breathing collection of timeless songs that are as powerful and resonant today as they were when they were first written"". Obituary: David Bowie David Bowie: A career that shaped modern pop David Bowie: The internet pioneer David Bowie: 69 facts Allen Grubman , speaking on behalf of Bowie's estate, said: ""We are truly gratified that David Bowie's body of music will now be in the capable hands of Warner Chappell Music Publishing. We are sure they will cherish it and take care of it with the greatest level of dignity."" Bowie's innovation was not just in the recording studio and in front of the camera - he was also involved in the world of finance. In the mid-90s, Bowie, his financial manager Bill Zysblat, and banker David Pullmancame up with a new scheme to generate cash from the singer's extensive back catalogue. Bowie introduced the bonds in the late 1990s In 1997, Bowie sold asset-backed securities, dubbed ""Bowie bonds"", which awarded investors a share in his future royalties for 10 years. The securities, which were bought by US insurance giant Prudential Financial for $55m, committed him to repay his new creditors out of future income, and gave a fixed annual return of 7.9%. He struck a deal with record label EMI which allowed him to package up and sell bonds on royalties for 25 albums released between 1969 and 1990 - which included classics such as The Man Who Sold The World, Ziggy Stardust, and Heroes,according to the Financial Times,external. But in 2004, rating agency Moody's Investors Services downgraded Bowie bonds to only one level above ""junk"", the lowest rating, after a downturn in the music industry. Bowie had already predicted the decline in traditional music sales, telling the New York Times in 2002 that music would become ""like running water or electricity"".

French MPs get death threats over Covid-19 pass,"The French government wants to tighten restrictions on unvaccinated people Several French MPs say they have received death threats as they debate a Covid-19 pass that would bar the unvaccinated from much of public life. The government is seeking to pass a law that would require people to show proof of vaccination to access public venues and transport with some exceptions. The legislation is expected to be approved in a vote this week but has angered vaccine opponents. France has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the EU. At least 91% of the adult population have been fully jabbed,according to the French government,external. On Sunday AgnÃ¨s Firmin Le Bodo of the centre-right Agir partytweeted an email,externalshe received containing graphic threats to kill her over her support for the vaccination pass. ""Our democracy is in danger,"" wrote Ms Firmin Le Bodo, who is also a pharmacist and vaccinates people against Covid. In an interview with BFM TV, she said she had reported the threats to the police and would not be deterred from supporting the vaccine pass. AgnÃ¨s Firmin Le Bodo tweeted out a screen shot of an emailed threat she received Another MP, NaÃ¯ma Moutchou of the Horizons party,shared a similar tweet,externalwhich included a screenshot of an emailed threat. In parliament on Monday, Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran condemned the death threats and the ""selfishness"" of vaccine opponents. Last week Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said police would strengthen protections for elected officials ahead of the vote on vaccine passes. Barbara Bessot Ballot of the ruling En Marche! party said MPs had received messages threatening to kill them for ""attacking our freedom"". ""Those death threats are unacceptable,""she wrote on Twitter,external. Throughout the pandemic, critics have accused French President Emmanuel Macron's government of violating freedoms by imposing Covid rules. Protests against these rules have been held regularly. For months France has asked people to show either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access many public venues. But the French government has decided to remove the option to show a negative test in response to record increases in infections, driven by the highly contagious Omicron and Delta variants of Covid. Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The government is aiming to bring the vaccine pass into force in mid-January, once it has been approved by parliament.

Vandalised church hits Â£20k fundraising goal,"The windows were smashed in with rocks A fundraising appeal to repair a vandalised church has reached its Â£20,000 goal in just three days. Eglwys y Grog, near the cliffs at Mwnt in Ceredigion, is a well known landmark and is popular with photographers. Ceredigion county councillor Clive Davies said he was ""totally blown away"" by the donations received. He said the church had been targeted overnight on 2 December and again on 20 December in ""a pointless, saddening act."" Mr Davies said there was nothing of value in the church ""There was nothing of value in the church and it was a senseless act. There was no money there, just a small little church,"" added Mr Davies. ""The church members were getting a lot of requests to donate money and they contacted me to do something co-ordinated online so I set up a JustGiving page for them."" ""It's been a global response really, three thousand pounds came in overnight. There were messages of support from America, and there was a couple from Australia as well,"" he added. ""There are a lot of good people out there and it is an amazing start to 2022 for us."" The leaded church windows and gated entrance were damaged along with the inside of the church. Part of the stone exterior was knocked and broken As well as being the local councillor, Mr Davies said he had long-standing family connections to the church, with plaques to his great-grandparents on either side of the altar. ""The local community has been amazing, supporting it and the power of social media made in tenfold,"" he said. ""It was like a snowball effect really, local businesses have offered not only financial support but will be part of the restoration work needed now."" The gated entrance was smashed in He said it was important for the church to remain open, but safe. ""I'll be meeting with the church members and the vicar and we'll start discussing what needs doing, but also we're going to have to look at safety for the future and what could we do in terms of security,"" he added.

Covid staff shortages to continue into New Year,"Staff shortages continue to blight retailers and hospitality firms, with one warning of closures if Covid absences worsen. David Josephs, boss of food importer and retailer All Greens, told the BBC he could be forced to temporarily shut outlets and redeploy remaining staff. The chief executive of pub group Fullers said things are improving but hundreds of staff are still off work. One employers' group said some firms saw a 50% jump in absences. It comes as ministers consider how the public sector handles mass absences. The government has asked public sector managers to test their contingency plans against a worst-case scenario of 25% staff absence, as part of efforts to minimise disruption from surging infections from the Omicron variant of Covid. Ministers are due to review Plan B restrictions on Wednesday, although Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Monday ""there's nothing in the data"" to suggest further coronavirus measures will be needed later this week. Workplaces told to plan for absences of up to 25% Mr Josephs, which sells fruit and vegetables to businesses such as restaurants, said that before Christmas he had about 15% of his workforce isolating or sick. ""We have had to re-deploy staff from stores into other stores to keep them moving,"" he said. No stores have yet had to close, but ""it's possible that we would have to"" if absences rise, he added. He said his industry had ramped up testing, but Mr Josephs was ""not convinced it's the answer. ""A lot of staff in the sector do not get paid sick pay - ours do - and therefore when they receive positive tests they ignore them. ""Throughout the jobs market - not just in our sector - a large minority or staff on limited contracts or minimum wage cannot afford to be off work and just ignore [positive tests]"". Meanwhile, Simon Emeny, chief executive of Fullers, told the BBC sickness levels among staff have improved in the past week. The company has 420 pubs and hotels across the country, but is focused on London, where rates of Covid infections had been particularly high. Before Christmas he had about 450 of his 4,000 staff off ill or isolating. ""That's now down to about 250. So things are improving,"" he said. Around 20 Fullers sites in the capital have been closed temporarily before Christmas because of falling sales, which he blamed on England's policy of work from home if possible. Sales at the group are ""significantly down"" on what it expected at typically the busiest time of the year for the hospitality sector. On working from home, Mr Emeny said: ""I would urge the prime minister to review that this week, as it does appear that London is coming through this Omicron crisis."" Mathew Fell, chief policy director at the CBI employers' group, said: ""This is clearly set to be one of the issues facing businesses at the start of this New Year. We were hearing just before the Christmas break retailers telling us that Covid-related absences were up about 50% in a week."" He said it was important the government resolves supply problems with Covid testing kits: ""Testing is really key for confidence and making sure we have that as ingrained behaviour."" Covid absence could not come at a worse time for firms, he said, because they were already suffering skills and labour shortages. However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, told the BBC some firms were flouting Covid health and safety rules, and it was time for the government to get tough with these employers. She added: ""The government still hasn't fixed sick pay to ensure that we don't spread the virus. Those staff who are sick should taking proper time off sick, but [sick pay] is only Â£96 a week."" Despite the high number of absences, Mr Josephs said some staff were still ignoring positive tests because they could not afford time off. He said: ""We know that in our sector a lot of staff do not get paid sick pay. Ours do - but staff who are on limited contracts or on minimum wage cannot afford to be off work."" Ministers have been tasked with developing ""robust contingency plans"" for workplace absences, as the government warned rising cases could see up to a quarter of staff off work. Public sector leaders have been asked to prepare for ""worst case scenarios"" of 10%, 20% and 25% absence rates, the Cabinet Office said. The UK has seen record numbers of daily cases over the festive period. Transport, the NHS and schools have already seen the effect of absences. Correction 7 February 2022: This article was amended after we mistakenly reported an employers' group as saying that some firms had seen 50% of staff off work, instead of absences being up 50% pre-Christmas.

Classroom masks for no longer than needed - Zahawi,"This video can not be played Nadhim Zahawi says masks in classrooms are ""not ideal"" but it's a trade-off to stop the spread of Omicron Secondary students in England will wear masks in classrooms ""not for a day longer than necessary"", Nadhim Zahawi has said. The education secretary defendedthe requirement to wear masksduring lessons, as Omicron cases surge. He added ministers are determined to keep schools open after learning a ""painful lesson"" from earlier closures. Mr Zahawi also repeated assurances that nothing in recent Covid data suggests new curbs are needed. He confirmed all secondary pupils in England will be tested before returning this week. After days of inconsistent supply of rapid tests, ministers assured schools that testing kits will be provided as needed and urged pupils to test twice weekly. On Sunday, Mr Zahawi announced face coverings will be required during lessons in England's secondary schools until 26 January, when Plan B measures are due to expire. He explained the move had been recommended by experts after the surge in Omicron cases. The minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had conducted a study in 123 schools, which suggested mask wearing ""made a difference"" to transmission. Will schools in the UK stay open this term? Nothing in data to support new curbs - ministers Workplaces told to plan for absences of up to 25% Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he also said: ""The painful lesson we learnt was when children weren't in school, the impact on their mental health and, of course their education, was quite substantial. ""Which is why I'm so determined, as is the prime minister, to make sure education remains open and children are in the best place when they're in the classroom, with their friends, learning in front of a teacher."" The new on-site testing rules apply to England, where pupils will begin returning to schools for the new term later this week. Mr Zahawi said the government had set up a ""different supply route"" for tests to give to school children early in early 2021 than those offered to the general public. He added the government has been communicating with schools about the testing plans since ""late last year"" to allow them to prepare. Asked about further restrictions, Mr Zahawi said there is ""nothing in the data that gives me any concern that we need to go beyond where we are at"" - adding existing Plan B curbs would be reviewed on Wednesday. Fears have been raised in recent days that a wave of illness and isolation among staff caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant could make it ""impossible"" for schools to deliver face-to-face teaching to all pupils. In Scotland - where older pupils already wear masks in lessons - and in Northern Ireland, students are also being asked to test twice every week. In Wales, the government has urged staff and students to test three times per week before the start of the new term. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ""regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching"". Ministers have also urged pupils to come forward for a Covid vaccine, second dose or booster, depending on their age. Face coverings will be required in England's secondary schools until 26 January As well as testing, Mr Zahawi promised 7,000 more air-cleaning units on top of the 1,000 already announced, as well as 350,000 CO2 monitors for schools. Teachers who had left the profession or retired have been asked to come back as temporary support and all 12-15 year olds are being urged to get both vaccine doses with older children asked to get their booster jabs. But Labour's shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, criticised ministers for the slow rollout of jabs to schoolchildren. She said almost two million students aged 12-17 remain completely unvaccinated and the government had missed ""the chance to get ahead of the virus, and is letting down our children"". Meanwhile, as other industries and sectors see significant disruption due to staffing shortages: A critical incident isdeclared at four Lincolnshire hospitals ScotRail is forced tobring in a temporary timetablein Scotland Shops and hospitality businesseswarn of closures if absences worsen Despite the impact of record infections, government ministerspushed back over the weekend against suggestions that fresh coronavirus restrictionswill be necessary in the coming weeks. Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay said the government believes that significant behaviour changes among members of the public mean further restrictions are not necessary. ""The widespread use of testing is an illustration that the British public are taking sensible steps to keep themselves safe to keep their friends and family safe,"" Mr Barclay said. England's current Plan B restrictions are due to expire on 26 January, although a review is expected in the next few days. On Sunday, England and Wales recorded 137,583 daily cases and 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Data for Scotland and Northern Ireland is due to be updated after the bank holiday weekend.

NI lamb returns to US market after rule change,"The US market is expected to be worth about Â£37m to British exporters in the first five years Northern Ireland lamb is back on the menu in the United States of America from Monday. Restrictions on UK imports, in place for more than 20 years, were lifted last month. That came after the US Department of Agriculture amended its Small Ruminant Rule (SRR) to allow trade to recommence. The US market is expected to be worth about Â£37m to British exporters in the first five years. There are about 10,000 sheep flocks in Northern Ireland, encompassing about a million ewes. They are mainly farmed for their meat, although milk and wool are also produced. The Ulster Farmers Union described the US change as ""quite significant"". ""Sheep farmers will be pleased, every new market is a bonus for them,"" deputy president William Irwin said. ""Boris Johnson, the prime minister, met with President Biden back in September, and this was one of his asks at that time, that UK sheep meat be allowed into the US. ""I don't think anybody thought that the response would have been as quick as this, but everybody's pleased to have this opportunity."" Conall Donnelly, the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters' Association, said it ""won't make an immediate difference"". Conall Donnelly, of the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters' Association, said it was ""another step along the way"" ""But it is another step along the way, in terms of access,"" he added. ""It's all about adding another market, and it gives extra opportunities for processors to add value to farmers' produce and provide a better price, hopefully, in the long-run back to the farmer. ""The USA - it's not a massive market for lamb but it is a high value market."" The lifting of the ban followsthe easing of rules on exports of British beef earlier last year. While lamb has historically not been a meat of choice in the US, tastes are changing, thanks to the popularity of UK cooking programmes. ""The local UK and EU markets is still the closest market and still pivotal,"" Mr Irwin said. ""But having said that, market research in the US tells us that lamb consumption is growing as consumer trends change, so every market helps make the portfolio viable. ""The onus now is on DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), DAERA (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs) and our processors to put everything in place that this can be taken advantage of.""

Debt-laden Evergrande suspends shares in Hong Kong,"Crisis-hit Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has suspended trade in its shares in Hong Kong as investors await news on its restructuring plan. The statement to the stock exchange did not give a reason for the trading halt. Evergrande has more than $300bn (Â£222bn) of debt and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors. Last week, the company dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products. Late on Monday, Evergrande confirmed that it had received an order from authorities in Danzhou city, Hainan province on 30 December telling it to demolish 39 buildings that were under construction at its Ocean Flower Island project. It did not disclose the reason for the demolition order, but local media reported at the weekend that the buildings were built illegally. Evergrande said on Friday that each investor in its wealth management product could expect to receive $1,257 each month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures. The company had earlier not mentioned any amount and had agreed to repay 10% of the investment by the end of the month when the product matures. Evergrande said in a statement posted on the wealth unit's website that the situation was not ""ideal"" and that it would ""actively raise funds"", and update the repayment plan in late March, without giving further details. The announcement was seen as highlighting the deepening cash squeeze at the struggling property developer. Last week, Evergrande did not make some interest payments on its offshore bonds. The company's $19bn in international bonds were deemed to be in default by rating agencies after it missed a payment deadline last month. Evergrande suspended its shares in early October, saying the move was ahead of ""an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction"". There were reports at the time that rival real estate firm Hopson Development was set to buy a 51% stake in its property services unit. However, later that monthEvergrande said the $2.6bn (Â£1.9bn) deal had fallen throughas they were unable to agree on the terms of a deal. Evergrande's shares lost almost 90% of their value last year as investors became increasingly concerned about its future. For months, many of the details of Evergrande's debt crisis have been clouded in uncertainty. But some experts believe that this is no accident - it is exactly how Beijing wants it to be. When the Chinese Communist Party changed its rules to limit how much money the country's property developers could borrow, they knew that it would cause major problems for Evergrande  and other heavily indebted real estate firms. China watchers say the government wanted to send a clear message that what they consider to be the reckless expansion of the sector could not continue. Authorities have also signalled that they have no intention of bailing out Evergrande, and its billionaire founder, because it would go against President Xi Jinping's ""Common Prosperity"" policies, which aim to distribute wealth more fairly throughout society. However, Beijing is also, understandably, keen to ensure that Evergrande's troubles do not become China's Lehman moment, which could affect the rest of the world's second largest economy and beyond. So, the slow restructuring of Evergrande continues quietly behind closed doors. And, just like today's trading halt announcement, no reasons are given.

"Classroom masks for no longer than needed, ZahawiMinisters want to keep schools open after ""painful lesson"" of closures, the education secretary says.","This video can not be played Nadhim Zahawi says masks in classrooms are ""not ideal"" but it's a trade-off to stop the spread of Omicron Secondary students in England will wear masks in classrooms ""not for a day longer than necessary"", Nadhim Zahawi has said. The education secretary defendedthe requirement to wear masksduring lessons, as Omicron cases surge. He added ministers are determined to keep schools open after learning a ""painful lesson"" from earlier closures. Mr Zahawi also repeated assurances that nothing in recent Covid data suggests new curbs are needed. He confirmed all secondary pupils in England will be tested before returning this week. After days of inconsistent supply of rapid tests, ministers assured schools that testing kits will be provided as needed and urged pupils to test twice weekly. On Sunday, Mr Zahawi announced face coverings will be required during lessons in England's secondary schools until 26 January, when Plan B measures are due to expire. He explained the move had been recommended by experts after the surge in Omicron cases. The minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had conducted a study in 123 schools, which suggested mask wearing ""made a difference"" to transmission. Will schools in the UK stay open this term? Nothing in data to support new curbs - ministers Workplaces told to plan for absences of up to 25% Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he also said: ""The painful lesson we learnt was when children weren't in school, the impact on their mental health and, of course their education, was quite substantial. ""Which is why I'm so determined, as is the prime minister, to make sure education remains open and children are in the best place when they're in the classroom, with their friends, learning in front of a teacher."" The new on-site testing rules apply to England, where pupils will begin returning to schools for the new term later this week. Mr Zahawi said the government had set up a ""different supply route"" for tests to give to school children early in early 2021 than those offered to the general public. He added the government has been communicating with schools about the testing plans since ""late last year"" to allow them to prepare. Asked about further restrictions, Mr Zahawi said there is ""nothing in the data that gives me any concern that we need to go beyond where we are at"" - adding existing Plan B curbs would be reviewed on Wednesday. Fears have been raised in recent days that a wave of illness and isolation among staff caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant could make it ""impossible"" for schools to deliver face-to-face teaching to all pupils. In Scotland - where older pupils already wear masks in lessons - and in Northern Ireland, students are also being asked to test twice every week. In Wales, the government has urged staff and students to test three times per week before the start of the new term. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ""regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching"". Ministers have also urged pupils to come forward for a Covid vaccine, second dose or booster, depending on their age. Face coverings will be required in England's secondary schools until 26 January As well as testing, Mr Zahawi promised 7,000 more air-cleaning units on top of the 1,000 already announced, as well as 350,000 CO2 monitors for schools. Teachers who had left the profession or retired have been asked to come back as temporary support and all 12-15 year olds are being urged to get both vaccine doses with older children asked to get their booster jabs. But Labour's shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, criticised ministers for the slow rollout of jabs to schoolchildren. She said almost two million students aged 12-17 remain completely unvaccinated and the government had missed ""the chance to get ahead of the virus, and is letting down our children"". Meanwhile, as other industries and sectors see significant disruption due to staffing shortages: A critical incident isdeclared at four Lincolnshire hospitals ScotRail is forced tobring in a temporary timetablein Scotland Shops and hospitality businesseswarn of closures if absences worsen Despite the impact of record infections, government ministerspushed back over the weekend against suggestions that fresh coronavirus restrictionswill be necessary in the coming weeks. Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay said the government believes that significant behaviour changes among members of the public mean further restrictions are not necessary. ""The widespread use of testing is an illustration that the British public are taking sensible steps to keep themselves safe to keep their friends and family safe,"" Mr Barclay said. England's current Plan B restrictions are due to expire on 26 January, although a review is expected in the next few days. On Sunday, England and Wales recorded 137,583 daily cases and 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.

Ivory-burning conservationist Richard Leakey dies,"Richard Leakey led a high-profile campaign against ivory poaching Richard Leakey, a world-renowned Kenyan conservationist and fossil hunter has died aged 77. His groundbreaking work contributed to the recognition of Africa as the birthplace of humankind. He also spearheaded campaigns to stop poaching in Kenya, famously burning the country's stockpile of poached ivory. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said Leakey had ""served our country with distinction"". Leakey served in various positions in the Kenyan government including the National Museums of Kenya, the Kenya Wildlife Service and as head of the civil service. ""Besides his distinguished career in public service, Dr Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya's civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions,"" Mr Kenyatta said. Leakey followed in his parents' footsteps in paleoanthropology - the practice of seeking to understand human evolution by studying fossils and ancient tools. In his 20s, Leakey made his own important finds, and in two ground-breaking books (Origins and People of the Lake), he explained the emergence of Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans. His work contributed to the growing body of evidence that the earliest humans had lived on the African continent. In 1981, he fronted a seven-part BBC television series called ""The Making of Mankind"", which made him a household name. In the late 1980s, he switched careers to take over as head of Kenya's Wildlife Service at a time when poachers were wiping out the country's entire elephant and rhino populations. He told his rangers to shoot poachers on sight and organised the spectacular public burning of a huge haul of ivory. Kenya's elephant poaching problem How mangrove forests helped stall environmental crime In 1993, the small plane he was flying in lost power and crashed. He survived but both of his legs were amputated below the knee. That did not stop him from entering Kenyan politics, setting up a new political party, Safina. But his political career did not last and in 1998 he took up a role as head of Kenya's civil service, with a mission to fight official corruption. He lasted three years in the role before returning to the Kenya Wildlife Service. At the time of his death, he was serving as chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University in the US. The institute works to facilitate research and education in palaeontology and archaeology in northern Kenya. Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto said Leakey ""inspired many Kenyans with his loyalty to his country. He loved Kenya"". The Duke of Cambridge said he was privileged to meet him and praised him for his efforts to tackle elephant poaching. ""Conservation has lost a true visionary,"" Prince William said in a tweet. From a young age, Richard Leakey was a fiercely independent thinker. His parents' renowned work on archaeology was no doubt a huge influence on his chosen path. But he still found his own voice and made crucial discoveries while barely in his 20s. He was also a fighter. As a child he sustained a broken skull after falling from a horse. Later in life, he had kidney and liver transplants, battled cancer and survived a plane crash in which he lost both legs. But he remained focused on his causes. Kenyan politics, however, proved challenging. Leakey was a strong critic of Daniel arap Moi's government. He even founded a political party to oppose it. But when Moi asked him to head the public service and lead the fight against corruption, he agreed. Foreign funding, which had been frozen due to corruption, began to flow again. But shortly afterwards he was cut off. Outmanoeuvred, Leakey resigned. But in science and conservation he leaves a lasting mark.

Sudan's prime minister resigns after mass protestsAbdalla Hamdok's resignation comes weeks after he was reinstated by the military following a coup.Africa,"Pro-democracy protesters faced another violent crackdown from the military Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has resigned after another day of mass protests rocked the capital Khartoum. Thousands marched against a recent deal he had done to share power with the army, who staged a coup in October. Chanting ""power to the people"", protesters called for a return to full civilian rule. But military forces again responded with force, leaving two people dead. Mr Hamdok's decision to quit leaves the army in full control. It is another blow to Sudan's fragile attempts at a transition to democratic rule after a popular uprising led to the overthrow of Sudan's long-term authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. In a televised address, Mr Hamdok said the country was at a ""dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival"". He said he had tried his best to stop the country from ""sliding towards disaster"", but that ""despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened"". Sudan coup: A simple guide How Sudan's generals betrayed my generation Defying Sudan's generals: 'They cannot kill us all' Civilian and military leaders had made an uneasy power-sharing agreement after the army staged a coup on 25 October and initially placed Prime Minister Hamdok under house arrest. The country was just one month away from transition to a civilian head of state when the army seized power. Mr Hamdok, an economist by training, is widely respected in the international community having previously worked as an official with the United Nations. He helped negotiate a deal to forgive some of Sudan's debts but this involved removing fuel subsidies, leading the prices of many basic goods to rise, and to anti-government protests. Under the agreement reached with Mr Hamdok in November, the reinstated prime minister was supposed to lead a cabinet of technocrats until elections were held. But it was unclear how much power the new civilian government would have, and protests against the military resumed, which were often violently suppressed. Protests continued even after Mr Hamdok had returned to office, with some demonstrators saying that his reinstatement was helping to legitimatise the military takeover. The United Nations' special representative in Sudan has expressed regret over Mr Hamdok's resignation. It puts at risk progress made since the December revolution when Mr Bashir was toppled, Volker Perthes warned. The resignation of Mr Hamdok showed the military was losing their leverage to get international recognition and popular support, according to a spokesman for the opposition Sudanese Congress Party. Further protests against the military are planned for Tuesday. Activists have told people to march to the presidential palace in the capital city, ""until victory is achieved"", according to the AFP news agency. Thousands of people were on the streets of the capital Khartoum and the city of Omdurman on Sunday, chanting and calling on the military to leave politics. More than 50 people have been killed during protests since the coup, including at least two on Sunday, according to the pro-democracy Sudan Central Doctors' Committee. Coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has defended last October's coup, saying the army had acted to prevent a civil war. He says Sudan is still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023. January 1 marked Sudan's Independence Day but there's little to celebrate in the country at the moment. The resignation of PM Abdalla Hamdok is a big blow to the military leaders who had thought an agreement with Mr Hamdok would appease protesters and legitimize their stay in power. Clearly those calculations were wrong. But it means the army are now firmly in power, reversing gains made as the country attempted to return to civilian rule. The current political crisis now threatens to return Sudan to the authoritarian years of former ousted leader Omar al-Bashir. And there's also the risk that the country could go back to being a pariah state with the likes of the US already indicating that they would sanction those impeding a return to civilian rule. Given Sudan's economic struggles, that could have an even worse effect on the lives of Sudanese people. This video can not be played Why are protesters back on the streets in Sudan?

Schools may face 'major disruption' in new term,"A teaching union has called on the Stormont Executive to take urgent action to reduce any further disruption in schools due to Covid-19. NASUWT said its members want to be able to provide face-to-face teaching in the new term which begins this week. Justin McCamphill from the union said the executive must do all it can to prevent schools from experiencing ""significant staffing problems"". There has been a surge in cases of the Omicron variant in Northern Ireland. On Thursday, Stormont ministerswere told that the Omicron variant now accounts for about 90% of cases in Northern Ireland. ""We are calling on the executive to urgently intervene in schools to make sure they're safe,"" Mr McCamphill said. ""Over the new year we have seen a big increase in the number of cases with the Omicron variant so we're expecting a big amount of disruption in schools when they return this week. ""Unfortunately, that will mean many classes and year groups will be sent home."" Before Christmas,some schools had to send individual year groups home for remote learningon specific days due to staff absences and difficulty getting substitute teacher cover. The NASUWT is urging the executive to: Provide air cleaning units to every school and college Support household close contacts to self-isolate to reduce the risk of transmission within schools Commit to providing schools with more resources in the event that on-site Covid testing is again required Provide improved financial support to schools and colleges for the costs of substitute staff Suspend all non-business critical activities in schools at least in the spring term A Belfast principal said up to 15% of his teaching staff will not be available for the new term which starts in a couple of days. Cahal O'Doherty of St Clare's Primary School said the Omicron variant has made planning difficult. ""That's a real issue and I think all schools will be facing that,"" he said. ""I think this particular strain of coronavirus, because it's so much more contagious, it's given us food for thought in terms of being able to manage this situation on the ground."" He said his preparations for the new term are ""changing by the hour"". The principal of St Cecilia's College in Londonderry, whose pupils are due to go back to school on Wednesday, said she feels ""anxious"" and would have preferred a delayed return after Christmas and the new year. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Martine Mulhern said she had hoped pupils and staff were going into the new term ""better prepared"". ""As a principal, I have a duty of care to keep staff and young people safe,"" she said. ""To have everyone back in school with no additional mitigations, for me, could be a potential recipe for disaster."" The SDLP's Education spokesperson, Daniel McCrossan, told BBC News NI's Evening Extra that Stormont's Education Committee had ""continually raised concerns"" with the education minister in relation to the ""very serious risks posed to schools"". He said the committee had met ""five days a week in some instances prior to Christmas"" and that a letter being sent to principals and school staff on a Friday evening ""days before schools return is certainly not appropriate"" and that they had ""flagged this issue time and time again"". A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said both the minister and Permanent Secretary had written to schools setting out mitigations which were in place. In a statement, they said they had a ""shared objective to keep schools safe and open as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school"".""We will continue to do everything in our power to help school leaders during these unprecedented and extremely challenging circumstances,"" the statement continued.The department is encouraging schools to ask all staff and post-primary pupils to take a lateral flow test within 24 hours of their return to school in January. Meanwhile, the Public Health Agency (PHA) hasconfirmed at least 120 care homes in Northern Ireland are dealing with Covid-19 outbreaks. Dr Gillian Armstrong from the PHA told BBC Radio Foyle different pressures within the sector are likely to continue for some time."" Avoid school closures 'at all costs' - principal Pandemic 'had severe impact' on young people County Down school U-turns on remote learning Last week, Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan announceda cut to the Covid-19 self-isolation period for positive cases in Northern Irelandto avoid a ""workforce crisis"". From 31 December, people with Covid have been able to end their self-isolation after seven days instead of 10, by providing negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven. Some principals told Stormont's education committee recently thatclosing schools ""must be avoided at all costs"". They said being out of school had a detrimental impact on children and young people's mental health, wellbeing and education. The executive will next meet on 6 January to discuss its measures and the latest data.

""The widespread use of testing is an illustration that the British public are taking sensible steps to keep themselves safe to keep their friends and family safe,"" Mr Barclay said. England's current Plan B restrictions are due to expire on 26 January, although a review is expected in the next few days. On Sunday, England and Wales recorded 137,583 daily cases and 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Data for Scotland and Northern Ireland is due to be updated after the bank holiday weekend. The latest figures for England are down on the 162,572 new cases reported on Saturday, which had been a record number for the fifth day in a row.

Kenyan conservationist Richard Leakey dies aged 77,"Richard Leakey led a high-profile campaign against ivory poaching Richard Leakey, a world-renowned Kenyan conservationist and fossil hunter has died aged 77. His groundbreaking work contributed to the recognition of Africa as the birthplace of humankind. He also spearheaded campaigns to stop poaching in Kenya, famously burning the country's stockpile of poached ivory. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said Leakey had ""served our country with distinction"". Leakey served in various positions in the Kenyan government including the National Museums of Kenya, the Kenya Wildlife Service and as head of the civil service. ""Besides his distinguished career in public service, Dr Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya's civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions,"" Mr Kenyatta said. Leakey followed in his parents' footsteps in paleoanthropology - the practice of seeking to understand human evolution by studying fossils and ancient tools. In his 20s, Leakey made his own important finds, and in two ground-breaking books (Origins and People of the Lake), he explained the emergence of Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans. His work contributed to the growing body of evidence that the earliest humans had lived on the African continent. In 1981, he fronted a seven-part BBC television series called ""The Making of Mankind"", which made him a household name. In the late 1980s, he switched careers to take over as head of Kenya's Wildlife Service at a time when poachers were wiping out the country's entire elephant and rhino populations. He told his rangers to shoot poachers on sight and organised the spectacular public burning of a huge haul of ivory. Kenya's elephant poaching problem How mangrove forests helped stall environmental crime In 1993, the small plane he was flying in lost power and crashed. He survived but both of his legs were amputated below the knee. That did not stop him from entering Kenyan politics, setting up a new political party, Safina. But his political career did not last and in 1998 he took up a role as head of Kenya's civil service, with a mission to fight official corruption. He lasted three years in the role before returning to the Kenya Wildlife Service. At the time of his death, he was serving as chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University in the US. The institute works to facilitate research and education in palaeontology and archaeology in northern Kenya. Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto said Leakey ""inspired many Kenyans with his loyalty to his country. He loved Kenya"". The Duke of Cambridge said he was privileged to meet him and praised him for his efforts to tackle elephant poaching. ""Conservation has lost a true visionary,"" Prince William said in a tweet. From a young age, Richard Leakey was a fiercely independent thinker. His parents' renowned work on archaeology was no doubt a huge influence on his chosen path. But he still found his own voice and made crucial discoveries while barely in his 20s. He was also a fighter. As a child he sustained a broken skull after falling from a horse. Later in life, he had kidney and liver transplants, battled cancer and survived a plane crash in which he lost both legs. But he remained focused on his causes. Kenyan politics, however, proved challenging. Leakey was a strong critic of Daniel arap Moi's government. He even founded a political party to oppose it. But when Moi asked him to head the public service and lead the fight against corruption, he agreed. Foreign funding, which had been frozen due to corruption, began to flow again. But shortly afterwards he was cut off. Outmanoeuvred, Leakey resigned. But in science and conservation he leaves a lasting mark.

Sound Of 2022: Why Lola Young is bubbling over,"The singer-songwriter is managed by the team behind Adele and Amy Winehouse ""Are you joking? No way! Oh my God. That's amazing. Such good news."" Singer-songwriter Lola Young has just learned she's placed fourth in BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022 - which aims to predict the biggest new stars of the coming year. She's in good company. In previous years, fourth place has gone to artists like Jorja Smith, Khalid, Sampha and Joy Crookes, who've all shaped the sounds of pop and soul in their own mould. Fifth place: Colourful rapper Central Cee Meet the 10 acts on the Sound Of 2022 longlist How the BBC Sound Of... predicts pop royalty,external Young's deep, expressive vocals will be familiar to millions after she covered Together In Electric Dreams for this year's John Lewis Christmas Advert. But the 21-year-old has been on the path to stardom since she wrote her first song, an ode to Santa Claus, when she was 11. Before long, she'd won the Open Mic UK contest and booked a place at the Brit School, while playing as many gigs as she could around her native south London. ""I've done so many [awful] open mic pub gigs where I've rocked up and played to three old men drinking beer and talking through my performance,"" she says. ""But I had to do that.""

It was at one such showcase that she caught the attention of Amy Winehouse's ex-manager Nick Shymansky - who loved her husky, soulful sound, but was reluctant to take her on. ""He said he was too busy and too hurt from his past experiences,"" Young explains. So he introduced her to Nick Huggett, who discovered and signed Adele... before having second thoughts. ""Nick S decided that he couldn't miss out - so they ended up managing me together. They're like my uncles now!"" BBC Sound of 2022: Central Cee takes fifth place BBC Sound of 2022: Official website. Rapper Pa Salieu wins the BBC's Sound of 2021 Signed to Island Records, Young released an assured debut album, Intro, at the age of 18. More recently, the attention-grabbing singles Fake and Bad Tattoo have seen her played on BBC Radio 1, and Elton John's Rocket Hour show. She ended 2021 with a nomination for the Brits Critics' Choice award; and starts 2022 with the endorsement of the 130 pundits who voted for the BBC Sound Of list (the top three will be announced over the next three days). ""It feels like things are getting better and better,"" she beams. ""The bubbling under the surface is starting to really, really bubble over!"" We caught up with her over Zoom to find out more about her backstory - and what she's got in store for the year ahead. Have you always wanted to be a musician? Yeah, I think for some people it comes a little bit later on, but I had it in my head that I wanted to be in music since I was maybe 10 or 11. I've seen interviews where you said you weren't a natural singer. How much work did you have to do? I think in other interviews, I've maybe been a little bit misunderstood in the sense that people thought I couldn't sing at all. It wasn't that. I had a voice, I was able to hold a note, but I didn't have the technical things like vibrato at all. So, it was more the case that I had to work hard to get power and strength. Like with BeyoncÃ©, I can imagine she just popped out singing to the heavens. I didn't have that. I think she actually cried in perfect pitch when she was born. Yeah, literally. What did you enjoy singing when you were a kid? The first album I remember putting on and really enjoying was Paolo Nutini's These Streets. Then, growing up, I listened to a lot of Eminem and Biggie and old school rap; and then eventually a lot of David Bowie, Prince. So my inspirations are quite different. Do you remember the first time you recorded yourself singing? Yeah, I was probably about 13, 14 and I went into a studio. Hearing my voice back was pretty mad - but it confirmed that's what I wanted to do. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

You entered the Open Mic UK competition around the same time. What was that experience like? Back when I was a kid, I thought X Factor or Britain's Got Talent was the way that people blew up. I didn't really understand the business side of things. So Open Mic UK was something I thought was going to change my life and, obviously, it helped a little bit - but it wasn't a game changer. You won with an original song, right? Yeah, it was called Never Enough and it's a song that's never gonna get released! Has your writing changed since then? A hell of a lot! I'm very careful about each lyric now. It can't just be a throwaway. And if it is, then we scrap it. I guess when you start out, you're almost impersonating your favourite artists. Then as you grow and get more experience, you put more of yourself into the songs? That's true - but I think people sometimes underestimate the real power that a young person has. I have one song that I wrote when I was 13, that I still really believe [in] and that's going to be on the album. Is that I Learned From You? Yeah, you know my music! Why did that song survive when other ones got cast away? It had quite an interesting concept. It was about a close relative and how I was trying to understand our relationship. It's kind of complex and, although I didn't really realise at the time, it's quite a mature song. The singer's smoky, guitar-driven songs have seen her nominated for a Brit Award You went to the Brit school after that. Was it what you expected? Um, no, it wasn't. There's a tendency for people to assume the Brit school is the way to the top, but it's still a school. You still do lessons, you still meet bitchy people and there's still bullying. Even the headmaster would say, ""We're not trying to create famous people. That's not why we're here."" I'm not saying I expected more than that because it was a really great experience. It helped me understand my style and where I wanted to go with my music. You released your first album, Intro, when you were 18. I was 18, yeah. One of the tracks, Blind Love, is still your most played song on Spotify. Why do you think people love that song, in particular? Just because it's a classic, sad love song. It's about the journey of a relationship and how it ends, but also trying to come to peace with that. I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling. Allow YouTube content?

On Six Feet Under, you sing about being depressed and thinking about death. What's it like to share dark feelings like those in your music? It's very complex suffering from mental health, I think. Especially as a person who has gone through life without really thinking about mental health - and then suddenly it hits you. You suddenly understand the stigma around it, because you start feeling ashamed about saying certain things, or feeling certain things. So I feel really strongly that I have to be super-honest in my lyrics. I'm sharing [those feelings] with the world but also, I'm trying to share it with myself, as well. What do your friends and family think of those songs? Sometimes it can be hard but my family and my friends are super-understanding. They know already what I've gone through. So as scary as it is to talk about the dark side of your mind, the importance of sharing, of honesty, overrides the fear. The Intro album was just starting to make waves when you developed cysts on your vocal cords. Were you ever worried you'd lose your voice? It was very frightening, for sure, especially because I had a new type of vocal surgery. But I had the best surgeon and it was fine. I mean, I'm still in recovery.  My high register still cracks, so I might need to go for a check-up. Just as you came out of hospital, the world went into lockdown. How did you find that? For me. being indoors and being in my own space is quite hard. I hate it. I can't be alone. And I got Covid as well - not badly, but I did have Covid. But it was a very tough year for a lot of people. People were very low and lost their jobs, you know? So my year was hard, but it wasn't the worst. Allow YouTube content?

The other thing you did in 2020 was release Woman, which is one of your best songs. And it's quite political as well... Woman was a process of me trying to understand how much one could be a feminist without being radical. I think that people really don't understand what that word [feminist] means. I remember getting cat-called as a teenager going to school by an old man in a van and, as you grow up, you start to question why the world lets you believe this is normal.  So in that song, I'm explaining what happens when you feel like you're less [important] than a man. It was something that I felt really strongly about. The songs you've released subsequently, like Ruin My Make Up and Fake, have a similar sense of strength and defiance. I'm interested in why that's a theme that you've focused on lyrically in the last two years. I don't really know why.... I think it's more that I wanted to change my sound up. I was listening a lot to The Cure, and using a lot of vintage sounds and baritone guitars. And I think when the sonic changed, the lyrics changed with it. Like Fake, for example, I think the drama goes well with the sound of the record. It sounds like something off a Tarantino soundtrack. Yeah, that was the intention! Young says her first song, an ode to Santa Claus, ""wasn't great but it was the start of my development"". You ended 2021 by singing the John Lewis Christmas advert. I've always wondered how much input you get in that process? Like, do you get to choose the song? The advertising company suggested the song. The only change I made was to sing it in a joyous way, with a tone of hope. That was a bit of a challenge, because the movement of the track is quite melancholic - but obviously it's supposed to be a Christmas song so it's not supposed to be too depressing! Since then, I've started hearing your music more and more on the radio and in places like H&M. What's that like? It's weird - but it's all I've ever wanted, so obviously that's really good. And so, on to 2022. Are you working on a new album? It's in the works! I've got a good few songs that I'm happy with but I don't know when exactly it will be released. Hopefully end of next year.
