Three-day coronation begins for Thai kingKing Vajiralongkorn came to the throne in 2016 but the rites will consecrate him as god's representative.Asia,"This video can not be played King Vajiralongkorn begins three days of ceremonial rites Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been crowned on the first of three days of coronation rites. King Vajiralongkorn inherited the throne in 2016 when his long-reigning father Bhumibol Adulyadej died. Days ago in a surprise announcement the palace said the king had married his long-term partner and royal consort who would now be Queen Suthida. Thailand has a constitutional monarchy, but the royal family is highly revered by Thais and wields considerable power. Thailand also has strict laws, called lese majeste, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The laws have shielded the royal family from public view and scrutiny. In pictures: Thai coronation ceremony During Saturday's ceremony the 66-year-old king was handed the 7.3kg (16lbs) Great Crown of Victory, which he placed on his head. The monarchy commands widespread reverence in Thailand He then issued his first royal command, promising to reign with righteousness, as his father had done at his coronation 69 years ago. The coronation comes at a time of political uncertainty. A general election was held on 24 March, the first since the army took control in a coup in 2014, but a new government has yet to be declared. Coronation explained:The sacred water that makes a king Thailand's lese-majeste law explained King Vajiralongkorn is the second child, and first son, of Queen Sirikit and Bhumibol Adulyadej. King Vajiralongkorn's father was the longest-reigning monarch in the world He was educated in the UK and Australia and has been trained at the Royal Military College in Canberra. He went on to become an officer in the Thai armed forces and is a qualified civilian and fighter pilot. He became crown prince and official heir to the throne in 1972. He is now known as Rama X, or the 10th King of the Chakri dynasty. Thai TV showed the wedding ceremony of King Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida Queen Suthida, who is his fourth wife, is the deputy commander of his personal security unit. She was made a full general in the army in December 2016. The coronation rituals began at 10:09 (03:09 GMT), an auspicious time, when King Vajiralongkorn changed into a white robe to go through purification and anointment ceremonies using sacred water that has been collected from more than 100 locations around the country. He is receiving the five Royal Regalia - the symbols of kingship - which includes the Great Crown of Victory. Most of the main Brahmin and Buddhist rituals take place on Saturday, and the coronation continues until Monday. While King Vajiralongkorn has been on the throne since 2016, in Thai tradition he cannot be considered a divine representative on Earth nor the main patron of Buddhism until he is consecrated. On Sunday, King Vajiralongkorn will take part in a procession around the capital, Bangkok, giving people a chance to celebrate. Large crowds are expected for this event as well as when he makes a public appearance on a balcony at the Grand Palace on Monday. King Vajiralongkorn spends most of his time abroad and is not as well known to the public as his father. But huge portraits of him can now be seen at many buildings after it was made mandatory for state offices to erect them in the weeks leading up to the celebration. Civil servants were also asked to wear yellow - the colour associated with the king. Many ordinary Thais will also be wearing yellow to show their loyalty to the monarch. Key events Saturday 4 May The Royal Purification and Anointment - sacred water is poured over the king Royal Regalia - the king is presented with the crown, sword and other items Temple of the Emerald Buddha - the king proclaims himself the Royal Patron of Buddhism Assumption of the Royal Residence - he symbolically moves into the official residence with a housewarming ceremony Sunday 5 May Royal Procession on Land - the king rides the Royal Palanquin encircling the city allowing people to pay homage Monday 6 May The king grants a public audience on a balcony in the Grand Palace.

"Prince heckled at nuclear deterrent serviceProtesters have described the commemoration at Westminster Abbey as ""completely inappropriate"".","The Duke of Cambridge arrives at Westminster Abbey with John Hall, Dean of Westminster The Duke of Cambridge has been booed as he arrived at a service marking 50 years of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) greeted Prince William with chants of ""shame on you"" as he arrived at Westminster Abbey. He was joined at the service by Penny Mordaunt, in her first official engagement as defence secretary. Earlier, Ms Mordaunt praised the ""incredible crews"" who had manned the UK's nuclear submarines over the years. She also announced the fourth of the new Dreadnought class submarines - which are replacing the existing Vanguard class submarines - would be called HMS King George VI. The Ministry of Defence has previously been criticised over its failure to dispose of nuclear submarines Anti-nuclear campaigners gathered outside the abbey and staged a ""die-in"" - lying on the ground pretending to be dead - to commemorate victims of nuclear war. Omar Ahmed, an activist from Nelson, Lancashire, said: ""I'm surprised that he would come and support something that could destroy our planet."" CND's head Kate Hudson has described the commemoration as ""disappointing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today Programme, she said: ""A thanksgiving for nuclear weapons is completely inappropriate, and we're not alone in thinking this."" The memorial service was organised under Gavin Williamson beforehe was sacked as defence secretary following an inquiry into a security leak. By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor In a packed Westminster Abbey, with the Duke of Cambridge and newly installed Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt seated close to the High Altar, the dean delivered a brief but pointed address. Acknowledging that he had received a large amount of personal correspondence and emails asking him to cancel the service, he said he was ""proud that it is taking place here in the abbey"". Penny Mordaunt replaced Gavin Williamson as defence secretary after he was sacked this week It was not a celebration of nuclear power, he said, for ""we cannot celebrate weapons of mass destruction"".  But he added: ""We do owe a debt of gratitude to those responsible for maintaining the peace."" Across the road from Westminster Abbey, a cluster of about 200 protesters stood quietly - holding banners which read ""Trust in God not in Nuclear Weapons"" and ""Blessed are the peacemakers"". Musician Brian Eno joined protesters and asked: ""Why are we wasting so much of our resources on weapons that we're never likely to use?"" The Chaplain of the Fleet, the Venerable Martin Gough, who offered the Naval Prayer during the service, said: ""This was an opportunity to acknowledge the sheer sacrifice that naval personnel and their families have to make when they join the sea deterrent service.""

"Actor Sir Tony Robinson quits LabourThe party stalwart blames its poor leadership, Brexit ""duplicity"" and the anti-Semitism row for his decision.","Actor Sir Tony Robinson, a former member of Labour's governing National Executive Committee, says he has quit the party over its current direction. He said he was leaving after nearly 45 years because of Labour's stance on Brexit, its handling of anti-Semitism allegations and its poor leadership. Sir Tony, 72, is best known for playing Baldrick in the comedy Blackadder. The political activist has spoken at rallies for the People's Vote campaign, which is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. His decision comes as Labour lost seats in Thursday's local elections, with voters turning to smaller parties and independents. Announcing his move on Twitter, Sir Tony said it was partly down to the party's ""continued duplicity on Brexit"". He has previously writtena tweet to deputy leader Tom Watson,external, saying: ""Our party members are overwhelmingly in favour of a second referendum. To campaign on a platform of constructive ambiguity would be unprincipled, duplicitous and rather sinister."" Labour has refused to fully endorse a further referendum on Brexit - as supported by many ordinary members - instead sayingit would do so under certain circumstances. Sir Tony, who has frequently criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter, also raised the issue of anti-Semitism and swore when describing the leadership in his tweet. Labour has been dogged by criticism of how it has handled allegations of anti-Semitism since Mr Corbyn became leader. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

HMRC deletes five million voice files,"The voice records of five million taxpayers are being deleted by the UK's tax authority, as the way they were collected broke privacy rules. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) failed to gain explicit consent from individuals before signing them up to the voice ID system for telephone enquiries. Campaigners accused HMRC of creating ""biometric ID cards by the back door"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said there had been a ""significant"" breach of data laws. ""Innovative digital services help make our lives easier but it must not be at the expense of people's fundamental right to privacy,"" said Steve Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO. Now the BBC has learned that the tax authority's system will continue despite the deletions. Sir Jon Thompson, HMRC chief executive, said: ""I am satisfied that HMRC should continue to use voice ID."" ""It is popular with our customers, is a more secure way of protecting customer data, and enables us to get callers through to an adviser faster,"" he saidin a letter,externalto HMRC's data protection officer. In a bid to speed up the much-criticised HMRC helpline, people were invited to use the voice recognition system, rather than the normal security checks. The scheme, launched in 2017, asks callers to repeat the phrase ""my voice is my password"" to register. Once this task is complete, they can use the phrase to confirm their identity when managing their taxes. HMRC passes the voice through an algorithm to instantly confirm their ID. Similar projects have been launched by banks and other providers, although they have not always been entirely successful,as this BBC investigation found. Privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch complained about the audio signatures system, claiming users were ""railroaded"" into using it as they were not given the choice to opt out. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force across the European Union in May last year, requires organisations to obtain explicit consent before they use biometric data to identify someone, including voice recordings. HMRC has been told by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) that it was not adhering to the data protection rules. In effect, it had automatically pushed people into the system without explicit consent. The commissioner is issuing the first enforcement notice of its kind to HMRC, under GDPR rules, to ensure the data is deleted. As a result, no fine will be levied. The tax authority changed the way it sought permission for voice ID in October. Some 1.5 million people have called HMRC since then, and said they wanted to continue using the service. Their records have been retained. But HMRC has started to delete the voice records of the remaining five million who enrolled into the system before October and who have not called or used the service since. It said the records would be deleted ""well before"" the Information Commissioner's deadline of 5 June. Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ""This is a massive success for Big Brother Watch, restoring data rights for millions of ordinary people around the country. ""To our knowledge, this is the biggest ever deletion of biometric IDs from a state-held database. This sets a vital precedent for biometrics collection and the database state, showing that campaigners and the ICO have real teeth and no government department is above the law."" Mr Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: ""We welcome HMRC's prompt action to begin deleting personal data that it obtained unlawfully. Our investigation exposed a significant breach of data protection law. HMRC appears to have given little or no consideration to it with regard to its voice ID service.""

"Ebola deaths pass 1,000 in DRC","The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is already the second deadliest in history The death toll from the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo has passed 1,000, the health ministry says. DRC's Ebola outbreak began in August and is the second deadliest in history. World Health Organization deputy director Dr Michael Ryan said mistrust and violence was harming efforts to tackle the disease as it spread through the east of the country. There have been 119 documented attacks on medical centres and staff since January, Dr Ryan said. WHO staff anticipated ""continued intense transmission"", he added, in a briefing to reporters in Geneva. Ebola disbelief widespread in Congo hotspots Why Ebola keeps coming back Health workers have plenty of vaccines - more than 100,000 people have already been given the treatment. But continuing violence in the east of the country where militias are present, as well as mistrust of doctors, was hindering their programme, Dr Ryan said. ""We still face major issues of community acceptance and trust,"" he said. This video can not be played Treating Ebola in the DR Congo warzone The DRC is also suffering from an outbreak of measles which has killed more than 1,000 people, with 50,000 cases reported. WHO staff have confirmed measles in 14 of the country's 26 provinces, in both rural and urban areas. Global measles cases quadruple - UN The disease that returned from the past Ebola is still contained within two provinces in the DRC but it is becoming harder to monitor the spread of the virus because of violence.The WHO said the risk of a global spread is low, but it was very likely cases would spread into neighbouring countries. Most Ebola outbreaks are over quickly and affect small numbers of people. Only once before has an outbreak been still growing more than eight months after it began - that was theepidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016, which killed 11,310 people. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding. People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola. Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure. Ebola outbreak 'not global emergency yet' Ebola disbelief widespread in Congo hotspots Ebola in the DR Congo warzone.

'Family drugs gang' granny jailed,"Angela Collingbourne (top left) and seven other members of the drugs gang were jailed on Friday A grandmother has been jailed for six years after becoming ""second in command"" to a drugs gang headed by her two sons. Angela Collingbourne, 51, helped the group to sell more than Â£2.7m of cocaine in Newport, with her son directing operations from prison. Seven other members were also jailed for conspiracy to supply class A drugs on Friday at Newport Crown Court. Another eight hadalready been jailed in March, bringing the total to 16. The gang, from Newport, dealt the drug from a garage called NP19 Tyres, with video showing thousands of pounds passing through but only a handful of cars being repaired. The court was told Collingbourne, who is a grandmother, racked up a ""number of convictions"" for shoplifting, driving and a public order offence before becoming responsible for managing the gang's funds and facilitating - and maintaining control of the mobile telephone trading line with 4,000 customers. Prosecutor Andrew Jones said: ""She was a middle tier manager of the organisation."" Another eight members, including Angela Collingbourne's sons, were jailed in March She denied being ""a trusted lieutenant of this organised crime group, the second-in-command"" - but was convicted by a jury. Richard Barton, defending, said Collingbourne was acting out of ""mother's love"" and trying to provide for her three sons - the youngest of which has now lost ""three fifths of his remaining family"" following the convictions. The court was told Collingbourne became estranged from her ""racist"" parents after they did not approve of her relationship. Judge Daniel Williams told Collingbourne: ""During your trial you portrayed yourself as a victim, fighting bigotry and injustice - but the jury saw through you. ""You dismissed your crimes as evidence of your own victim-hood. ""You were counting and banking the vast profits from this operation. Angela Collingbourne was captured on CCTV counting cash from drugs sales ""You began to believe that you were unstoppable."" The gang was arrested following a year-long investigation, Operation Finch, which involved surveillance and secret recordings. Collingbourne's son Jerome Nunes, 28, and Blaine Nunes, 26, were jailed for 12 and 14 years. Judge Williams said it was ""depressing"" that Jerome Nunes was able to direct the operation from his prison cell using hidden mobile phones, while serving a sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to supply. The gang sourced drugs from Merseyside, with Matthew Croft regularly visiting Liverpool to meet ""up-stream suppliers"", the court heard. Police devices recorded Tia Donovan-Jones, 19, counting cash and inputting postcodes for drug deals. She would accompany her partner Thomas Allison to drug deals in her pyjamas and had ambitions of buying a Â£500,000 house with him. A raid recovered Versace, Prada, Bulgari and Louis Vuitton clothing. Angela Collingbourne: six years Tia Donovan-Jones: two years in a young offenders' institution Khaleen Hussain: six years Liam Slade: one year Thomas Jones: four years Rhys Jones: four years with concurrent four months for cannabis production Joshua Southall: eight months Matthew Croft: seven years and four months Blaine Nunes: 14 years Jerome Nunes: 12 years Preston Killoran: eight years, eight months Thomas Allison: 10 years Kieran Vodden: seven years, four months Ashley Lloyd: six years Joel Clark: six years Daniel Richardson: five years Â£2.5m cocaine gang brothers jailed Gwent Police Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Begum âwould face death penalty in Bangladeshâ,"Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria IS bride Shamima Begum would ""face the death penalty"" for terrorism if she came to Bangladesh, the country's foreign minister has said. Abdul Momen told the BBC that Ms Begum has ""nothing to do"" with his country. The 19-year-old, who left east London to join the Islamic State group in 2015, was stripped of her British citizenship in February. Her claim to Bangladeshi nationality through her mother is believed to have informed the Home Office's decision. Under international law, it is illegal to deprive nationals of citizenship if to do so would leave them stateless. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Begum's lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, told the BBC ""in no way is she Bangladesh's problem"". Ms Begum is appealing against the Home Office's decision. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Legal aid: Who is entitled to it? 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' The women and children no-one wants Mr Momen said there was ""no question"" of giving Ms Begum Bangladeshi citizenship or allowing her into the country, piling pressure on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to settle her status. ""She has never sought Bangladeshi citizenship and her parents are also British citizens,"" he told the BBC. ""The British government is responsible for her. They'll have to deal with her."" He added that, if she did end up coming to Bangladesh, she would fall foul of the country's ""zero tolerance policy"" towards terrorism. ""Bangladeshi law is very clear. Terrorists will have to face the death penalty,"" he said. Although Ms Begum travelled to Syria to join the IS group, she has not admitted any terror offences. This video can not be played Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the family of Shamima Begum, expects her to be ""damaged"" by her ordeal The Home Office could reverse its decision ""at any time"" and doing so would ""save British taxpayers a lot of money"" in court costs and legal aid, Mr Akunjee said. ""What Sajid Javid did in stripping Shamima of her citizenship is human fly tipping - taking our problems and dumping them on other countries,"" he said. The Home Office told the BBC it would not respond to Mr Momen's comments and had nothing further to add to its previous statement. How do countries deal with IS returnees? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Ms Begum left the UK with two school friends at the age of 15 before being found by a journalist from the Times in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February this year. Heavily pregnant with her third child, she pleaded to return to the UK, claiming she had been ""brainwashed"" by Islamic State and now ""regrets everything"". She said she did not regret travelling to Syria but did not agree with everything the IS group had done. Mr Javid did not acquiesce to her pleas, telling MPs he ""won't hesitate"" to revoke her citizenship in the interests of national security. ""If you back terror, there must be consequences,"" he said. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Soon afterwards, she gave birth to a boy called Jarrah. He died of pneumonia in March at less than three weeks of age. She had two other children who also died. In the wake of the boy's death, Mr Javid was criticised over the decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Three weeks prior to the death, Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, had written to Mr Javid asking him to help her bring the baby to the UK. Under the 1981 British Nationality Act, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result.

"Woman, 83, 'hypnotised' by murder accused","Ann Moore-Martin died of natural causes in 2017 A church warden plotted for an 83-year-old woman to die during sex or by her choking on her dentures, a court heard. Benjamin Field began a sexual relationship with Ann Moore-Martin, 57 years his senior, as part of a plot a few months after murdering her neighbour Peter Farquhar, 69, prosecutors allege. A jury heard Mrs Moore-Martin acted if she was ""hypnotised"" by him. Mr Field, 28, and Martyn Smith, 32, deny murder and conspiracy to murder. Mr Farquhar, who died in October 2015 and Miss Moore-Martin, who died in May 2017, lived in the Buckinghamshire village of Maids Moreton. Peter Farquhar was a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, told an Oxford Crown Court jury: ""Ann Moore-Martin was gushing about Benjamin Field. ""She sounded like a love-struck teenager."" Jurors were told Mr Field bought her a sex toy and took a picture of a sex act. Mr Field, the son of a Baptist minister, is accused alongside Mr Smith of plotting to make the church-going pensioner's death look like an accident, such as dying during sex, falling down the stairs or choking on her dentures, the court heard. Mr Saxby told the jury that Mr Field suffocated Mr Farquhar and tried to kill Miss Moore-Martin ""by a manner of means"". She died of natural causes, the court was told. Peter Farquhar lived at the house circled on the left, and Ann Moore-Martin on the right Mr Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, possessing an article for the use in fraud and an alternative charge of attempted murder.

Actor Sir Tony Robinson quits Labour,"Actor Sir Tony Robinson, a former member of Labour's governing National Executive Committee, says he has quit the party over its current direction. He said he was leaving after nearly 45 years because of Labour's stance on Brexit, its handling of anti-Semitism allegations and its poor leadership. Sir Tony, 72, is best known for playing Baldrick in the comedy Blackadder. The political activist has spoken at rallies for the People's Vote campaign, which is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. His decision comes as Labour lost seats in Thursday's local elections, with voters turning to smaller parties and independents. Announcing his move on Twitter, Sir Tony said it was partly down to the party's ""continued duplicity on Brexit"". He has previously writtena tweet to deputy leader Tom Watson,external, saying: ""Our party members are overwhelmingly in favour of a second referendum. To campaign on a platform of constructive ambiguity would be unprincipled, duplicitous and rather sinister."" Labour has refused to fully endorse a further referendum on Brexit - as supported by many ordinary members - instead sayingit would do so under certain circumstances. Sir Tony, who has frequently criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter, also raised the issue of anti-Semitism and swore when describing the leadership in his tweet. Labour has been dogged by criticism of how it has handled allegations of anti-Semitism since Mr Corbyn became leader. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Deliver Brexit!' - Daily Express'Got the message? Deliver Brexit!' - Daily ExpressLive Reaction as local election results counted  4 minutes ago,"Elections are held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland Conservatives and Labour both see vote shares fall compared with 2015 The Tories lose 44 councils and 1,334 seats Theresa May says results message is: ""Just get on and deliver Brexit."" Labour loses six councils and 82 seats Lib Dems take control of 10 councils and won 703 seats Greens and independents also make significant gains Anger over Brexit appears to be influencing voters, say experts Arryn Moy and Hamish Mackay That's the end of our live coverage of the local election for now. Here's a recap of what's happened: You can read a full breakdown of all the results here.  The Daily Express says voters vented their anger at the local elections, sending a clear message to politicians to deliver Brexit. The Guardian says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are seeking a cross-party solution to the Brexit deadlock after voters punished both major parties in local elections. The Times claims Theresa May will be told by senior Tories that she must set her departure date next week after the party's drubbing in the local elections. The Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives suffered their worst local election result since ""Tony Blair's humiliation of John Major a quarter of a century ago"". The Daily Mail and the Independent have similar headlines but have interpreted the local election results in very different ways. The Daily Mail says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn suffered humiliation amid protests over failing to deliver Brexit. The Independent, however, says voters turned to parties backing another referendum on Brexit. The iweekend carries a warning from Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who says that voters will punish his ""divided party"" for breaking trust. The Andrew Marr Show Andrew Marr's guests this weekend to look at the local election results will include shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Reviewing the Sunday papers will be Amanda Platell and Steve Richards on the Marr Show from 10:00 BST on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With the results for Waverley and Mansfield now in, every council in England has declared. The Conervatives have suffered huge defeats, losing more than 1,300 councillors and 44 councils. And Labour, who had been expected to make gains, instead lost 81 councillors and six councils. Theresa May has said the results show the public want both parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 700 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Green Party - who are also pro-EU - have picked up an additional 194 seats in comparison to 2015. You can read a full breakdown of all the results here. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council DUP MP Gavin Robinson says it is a ""good news story"" for his party that Allison Bennington has been elected as a councillor. She is the first openly gay candidate to stand for the party. Mr Robinson said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job."" He added: ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Unsurprisingly, the Guardian focuses on the Conservatives' huge losses, which it says are the party's worst for almost a quarter of a century. It's worth noting that since that tweet was sent, their losses have reached 1,327 seats . Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ford and Mayhew's characters were close friends and piloted the Millennium Falcon. ""We were partners in film and friends in life for over 30 years and I loved him,"" said Ford.

Hamill said: ""What was so remarkable about him was his spirit and his kindness and his gentleness was so close to what a Wookiee is. ""He just radiated happiness and warmth. He was always up for a laugh and we just hit it off immediately and stayed friends for over 40 years.""

""He fought his way back from being wheelchair-bound to stand tall and portray Chewbacca once more in Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" his family said. Mayhew also consulted on The Last Jedi, released in 2017, in an attempt to pass on the secrets of the role to his successor, Finland's Joonas Suotamo.

He was a good friend, and I'm saddened by his passing."" Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy added: ""Peter's iconic portrayal of the loyal, lovable Chewbacca has been absolutely integral to the character's success, and to the Star Wars saga itself. ""When I first met Peter during The Force Awakens, I was immediately impressed by his kind and gentle nature. ""Peter was brilliantly able to express his personality through his skilful use of gesture, posture, and eyes. We all love Chewie, and have Peter to thank for that enduring memory.""

"Ebola deaths pass 1,000 in DRCOfficials say hostility to medical staff is hindering efforts to tackle the deadly disease.","The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is already the second deadliest in history The death toll from the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo has passed 1,000, the health ministry says. DRC's Ebola outbreak began in August and is the second deadliest in history. World Health Organization deputy director Dr Michael Ryan said mistrust and violence was harming efforts to tackle the disease as it spread through the east of the country. There have been 119 documented attacks on medical centres and staff since January, Dr Ryan said. WHO staff anticipated ""continued intense transmission"", he added, in a briefing to reporters in Geneva. Ebola disbelief widespread in Congo hotspots Why Ebola keeps coming back Health workers have plenty of vaccines - more than 100,000 people have already been given the treatment. But continuing violence in the east of the country where militias are present, as well as mistrust of doctors, was hindering their programme, Dr Ryan said. ""We still face major issues of community acceptance and trust,"" he said. This video can not be played Treating Ebola in the DR Congo warzone The DRC is also suffering from an outbreak of measles which has killed more than 1,000 people, with 50,000 cases reported. WHO staff have confirmed measles in 14 of the country's 26 provinces, in both rural and urban areas. Global measles cases quadruple - UN The disease that returned from the past Ebola is still contained within two provinces in the DRC but it is becoming harder to monitor the spread of the virus because of violence.The WHO said the risk of a global spread is low, but it was very likely cases would spread into neighbouring countries. Most Ebola outbreaks are over quickly and affect small numbers of people. Only once before has an outbreak been still growing more than eight months after it began - that was theepidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016, which killed 11,310 people. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding. People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.

Police have started an investigation into a number of assaults in Warrington following a visit by the founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson. Mr Robinson, who is standing as a candidate for the European Parliament, had a milkshake thrown over him in the town centre on Thursday. Two people were taken to hospital in the hours that followed. ""We will not tolerate disorder... whatever the motivation,"" said Ch Insp Simon Meegan of Cheshire Constabulary. ""We are aware there has been a lot of talk, videos and speculation about what happened on social media but we need to hear from people who were there at the time and witnessed what happened. ""In particular, we want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and recorded any of the incidents on their mobile phone,"" he said. It was the second time in two days Mr Robinson had a milkshake thrown over him on the campaign trail. He is running as an independent to become an MEP for the north-west England,one of eleven candidates in the constituency. Footage posted on social media appeared to show Mr Robinson arguing with another man before a milkshake is thrown. There is then an altercation. Other footage showed a further altercation between a number of people in central Warrington later that afternoon.

Watson: Why has Labour lost seats?,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to local election results after Labour suffers losses Labour has suffered a net loss of council seats - starting from the low base of 2015 in many cases. The Conservatives have lost more than 10 times as many councillors, but what is remarkable is that the main party of opposition - around the mid-term of a not-very-popular government - has not made net gains. It seems reasonable to assume that some votes have been lost by Labour in Leave areas because - as the leader of Sunderland City Council Graeme Miller has said - the party hasn't decisively ruled out another referendum. (It has retained it as an option, if the Conservatives are unwilling to change their deal). Labour agrees a Brexit referendum position Main parties hit by Brexit backlash in polls LIVE: Local election results and reaction as it happens But if you take a close look at the figures in Sunderland, the complexity of Labour's political problems are revealed. Its vote fell by nearly 17 points there - while UKIP's went up by 4.5. The pro-Remain Lib Dems saw their vote rise by nearly 10 points and the Greens by 8.5. Indeed, the combined vote of the Lib Dems and Greens was 21.4%, not far off UKIP's 23.9%. The swing from Labour to the Lib Dems was about 13%  and to the Greens 10%. Those in Labour's ranks who wanted a stronger commitment to another referendum on any Brexit deal are arguing now that the party is losing support in some Leave areas by failing to appeal enough to those who voted Remain. Defections to the Lib Dems and the Greens suppressed the Labour vote, and further flatters UKIP's performance. In leave-supporting Derby, where Jeremy Corbyn's party lost six seats and UKIP gained two, the swing from Labour to Lib Dems was 6%. But those who support Labour's current policy - a heavily caveatedcommitment to a referendum on Brexit under certain circumstancesrather than a public vote in all circumstances - say this is too simplistic an analysis. In truth, we can't discern the underlying motives of Labour/Lib Dem switchers in every part of the country unless we ask them. There are genuinely local factors at play in some areas - unsurprising, perhaps, as these are indeed local elections. And some on Labour's left have another theory. They say the party is vulnerable to a protest vote because some Labour councils have had to cut services due to constrained budgets. In some cases the Lib Dems are the beneficiaries Others on the left say the party can't get a hearing for its anti-austerity message as the Brexit debate muffles all else. They are actually quite keen for their party leadership to reach a deal with the government soon to get Brexit over the line and - they believe - this will then neutralise the political toxicity of the issue. But there is little doubt politicians will proclaim to know the will of the people, without necessarily exploring deeper motivations - and the results will be interpreted in a way which advances their own arguments.

""What Jim has said this evening about a fellow colleague is wrong"". There were a number of gains for the Alliance Party and smaller parties including the Greens and People Before Profit. Alliance won three seats in the Ormiston district electoral area (DEA) in Belfast and took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Titanic, securing a second councillor in that DEA. The party also topped the poll in every DEA in Lisburn and Castlereagh - with all nine candidates being elected - and won seats outside its traditional greater Belfast heartlands with victories in Coleraine, Lurgan and Faughan.

A difficult day for the UUP The UUP lost a number of seats on Friday, including in Ormiston, where Peter Johnston lost out and in Botanic. So far the party's first preference vote share is down by 2% compared to the last council election in 2014, but this could improve after more results are declared on Saturday. The UUP enjoyed a better day in Lisburn and Castlereagh, where their first preference vote share rose by 1.9%. They also had a narrow victory in Cusher DEA in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon where Gordon Kennedy beat DUP candidate Quincey Dougan to the last seat by 1.84 votes. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Where else would you find such electoral excitement on a Friday night? There have been gains for the smaller parties including Alliance, the Greens and People Before Profit at the expense of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The two biggest parties say their vote has held up - and even improved - in some of their traditional stronghold areas. But there's no denying both have taken gambles that haven't paid off, running more candidates in some areas in a bid to increase their presence only for it not to work out. The SDLP are pleased with their performance in some areas, but across the board the UUP vote looks much poorer than the strong result they polled in 2014. As ever, transfers are key for those final nail-biter seats in each area. As one candidate put it to me: ""Every transfer matters, it's like Game of Thrones!"" In Mid-Ulster, Kyle Black, the son of prison officer David Black who was murdered by dissident republicans, was elected in Carntogher. He said: ""Out of absolutely devastating circumstance that will impact out lives forever, I wanted to try and do something positive - to give back to the community."" This video can not be played Kyle Black says he entered politics after his father's murder showed him the ""worst"" of Northern Ireland It will be late on Saturday before the full results are confirmed. As of Friday night, turnout was recorded as 52%, but this is not the final figure. Thursday's good weather appears to have boosted voter numbers, but there is a wide variation across the different District Electoral Areas (DEAs). In County Fermanagh, the turnout was almost 72% in the Erne East DEA. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tories distance themselves from PM,"Conservative councillors tried to distance themselves from Theresa May and the government Conservative councillors have criticised Theresa May after losing hundreds of seats in the local elections. A council leader who lost his majority said the prime minister should ""consider her position"" and others said they made gains ""despite"" the government. The Conservatives and Labour lost out to smaller parties and independents. There are reports of spoilt ballots referring to Brexit in some areas. Elections for more than 8,400 seats on 248 councils took place amid widespread criticism of MPs and the government over the handling of Brexit. Live election results from your area Main parties hit by Brexit backlash in polls The Conservatives, who were defending council seats they won in 2015, alongside the party's general election victory, were at pains to stress the vote was about local services and council tax rather than what was happening at Westminster. However, by Friday morning they had lost out mainly to the Liberal Democrats and independents on councils such asCotswold,WinchesterandNorth Kesteven. The Greens have also won dozens of seats including inFolkestone and Hythe,where they have six new councillors. Labour have also been losing seats, including in strongholds such as Bolsover,where they lost their majorityamid a surge in support for independents. Party leaderJeremy Corbyn has said he is ""very sorry""it lost three of its councils in the North West, despite winning control inTrafford. Tony Berry wants Theresa May to consider her position after losing control of Cotswold District Council The Tories lost Cotswold District Council after 16 years,with the Liberal Democrats now in charge. Conservative group leader Tony Berry said it was a ""very unusual set of circumstances"". Local election results and reaction as it happens Election results in maps MP weeps as Tories lose control of council He blamed Brexit and ""professional politicians who are basically working for themselves rather than necessarily what is best for the country"". Asked his message to Theresa May, he said: ""I would ask her to consider her position very carefully."" A voter in Worcester posted a picture of his spoilt paper Hundreds ofballot papers were spoiled in Rugby, according to the borough's returning officer. Adam Norburn said many had ""Brexit"" scrawled across them. And a voter in Worcester posted a picture of his spoilt paper on Twitter. Jordan said he was a Conservative party member but that the major parties had been ""lying for three years straight about Brexit"". There were also reports of a ""larger than normal"" number of spoilt ballots in Ipswich. And in one ward in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, almost one in 20 ballots was spoilt. Candidates at the count told the Local Democracy Reporting Service many comments written on the papers related to Brexit. There were 33 spoilt votes out of 673 in the Eastwood Hall ward. In North Norfolk, 563 people spoiled their papers. It is not illegal to spoil a ballot paper, but filling it out incorrectly or covering it with graffiti will render it invalid. In Bath and North East Somerset, where the Liberal Democrats won control, Tory casualties included the council leader Tim Warren. Mr Warren said councillors had been ""given a kicking for something that wasn't our fault"". Asked whether there needed to be changes in leadership or policies at the top of the Conservative Party, Mr Warren replied: ""There needs to be a change in action."" Mike Bird said the Conservatives won control at Walsall ""despite"" the government In Walsall, the Conservatives took control of the council after winning seats from Labour, having run the authority for a year without a majority. Council leader Mike Bird said the Tories won ""despite"" the Conservative government and Theresa May. ""She hasn't helped us make any gains at all - far from it - we made the gains despite the prime minister."" In North East Lincolnshire, another Tory gain, group leader Philip Jackson said the party ""managed to disengage national politics from what was happening locally"".

Judith Blake said the party had been ""punished locally"" after losing four seats on the city council, while retaining control. Labour also lost seats in Wakefield to the Liberal Democrats and independents. Councillor Graham Isherwood said the party was ""paying the price for that lot in Westminster"". In Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, a group of independentswon an overall majority, a month after taking control from Labour. Jason Zadrozny, leader of the Ashfield Independents, said politics had been ""a bit of a mess"". In North Devon, where the Lib Dems won control of the council from the Conservatives and independents, the group's leader David Worden said: ""It was a tremendous night for us and shows that the Lib Dem fight back is well and truly happening.""

The main parties have been punished,"The local election results are disappointing for both the Conservatives and for Labour, while the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents prospered, writes Prof Sir John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. ""A plague on both your houses."" That seems to have been the key message to emerge from the ballot boxes. On the basis of the detailed voting figures in 40 local authorities, we estimate that if the pattern of voting in the local council elections were to be replicated across the whole of Great Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would have won 28% of the vote. This is only the second time that this calculation has put both those parties below 30%. The elections always looked set to be difficult for the Conservatives. The party was defending seats that were mostly last up for grabs four years ago, on the same day David Cameron won the 2015 general election. That, coupled with the party's recent freefall in the polls, clearly pointed to significant Conservative losses. May 2019 local election results in maps and charts Laura Kuenssberg: Two main parties, one key message What happens when councils change hands? And that proved to be the case. The party has suffered net losses of more than 1300 seats. On average the party's share of the vote was down by six points, both compared with 2015 and with last year's local election results. However, despite the government's difficulties, Labour also slipped back - on average, by no less than seven points compared with last year's local election results. As a result, the party has found itself suffering net losses of around 80 seats, when opposition parties are normally expected to post gains. The party's performance would seem to confirm the message of a number of polls that Labour's support has been slipping in the wake of the Brexit impasse, a fall in Jeremy Corbyn's popularity, and a continuing row about anti-Semitism. Compared with last year, the party lost ground more heavily in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-voting ones, a pattern that it shared with the Conservatives (who in previous years have tended to perform better in such areas). This has been seized on by pro-Leave Labour MPs as evidence that the party should reach an agreement with the government which would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU. What the two parties also had in common was a tendency for their support to fall more heavily in their heartlands. Labour's vote fell back most heavily in the north, the Conservatives in the south. Equally, Labour's vote fell more heavily in wards where it was previously strong, while the Conservative vote fell most heavily where they were strongest. It was as though voters vented their frustration with the Brexit process by punishing whichever party represented the political establishment locally. This mood perhaps also helps account for the remarkable success of independent candidates. Those not standing on a party label were on average winning as much as a quarter of the vote where they stood. More than 900 independent councillors have been elected - a net gain of more than 500. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats, who before they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 were often a vehicle for protest votes, also appear to have profited from voters' disenchantment with the two largest parties. The party, which has made net gains of more than 600 seats, advanced particularly strongly in Conservative-held wards where it was previously in second place. Double digit swings from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats were common in such seats. The party seemed to be successful in reinvigorating some of the bastions of local strength where its support had been badly eroded in the wake of the coalition government. This pattern added significantly to the tally of Conservative losses. Theresa May insisted the local election results showed voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. In contrast, and despite the party's pro-Remain stance, there was only limited evidence that the Lib Dems' advance was stronger in areas that voted heavily for Remain in the 2016 referendum. For example, while support for the party rose on average by three points on last year in areas where more than half voted for Remain, it also increased by two points in areas where the Remain vote was less than 45%. Thanks in part to the fact that in 2015 the Liberal Democrats had recorded its worst ever local election performance, the party was able to make so many gains, due to an increase in its vote since then, of eight points. More significant, perhaps, was the fact that its vote was also up by three points on last year's local elections. When the party's performance is projected into a national vote, it is estimated to be worth 19% of the vote. This represents its best local election performance since the party entered into coalition in 2010, but was still well below the party's performance in any round of local votes between 1993 and 2010. Overall, the party's performance is best seen as evidence of a partial recovery from the depths to which the party sank during the coalition years. At the same time, the Greens had one of their best local election results ever. The party made net gains of more than 180 seats. The Greens posted an average of 12% of the vote in the wards they contested, up five points on their performance where they stood four years ago. That equals the party's previous highest average, 12% in 2009, when local elections were held on the same day as European Parliament elections. The party may have been helped by the recent protests about climate change. Fighting just one in six wards, there was little opportunity for UKIP to make much impact on these elections. Where it did stand, the party's vote was down by four  points on its relative high point of 2015, but up eight points on its poor position last year. However, the challenge from the Eurosceptic parties may be more formidable in the European elections in three weeks time, when Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on the ballot paper.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

So far the party's first preference vote share is down by 2% compared to the last council election in 2014, but this could improve after more results are declared on Saturday. The UUP enjoyed a better day in Lisburn and Castlereagh, where their first preference vote share rose by 1.9%. They also had a narrow victory in Cusher DEA in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon where Gordon Kennedy beat DUP candidate Quincey Dougan to the last seat by 1.84 votes. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Where else would you find such electoral excitement on a Friday night? There have been gains for the smaller parties including Alliance, the Greens and People Before Profit at the expense of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The two biggest parties say their vote has held up - and even improved - in some of their traditional stronghold areas. But there's no denying both have taken gambles that haven't paid off, running more candidates in some areas in a bid to increase their presence only for it not to work out. The SDLP are pleased with their performance in some areas, but across the board the UUP vote looks much poorer than the strong result they polled in 2014. As ever, transfers are key for those final nail-biter seats in each area. As one candidate put it to me: ""Every transfer matters, it's like Game of Thrones!"" In Mid-Ulster, Kyle Black, the son of prison officer David Black who was murdered by dissident republicans, was elected in Carntogher. He said: ""Out of absolutely devastating circumstance that will impact out lives forever, I wanted to try and do something positive - to give back to the community."" This video can not be played Kyle Black says he entered politics after his father's murder showed him the ""worst"" of Northern Ireland It will be late on Saturday before the full results are confirmed. As of Friday night, turnout was recorded as 52%, but this is not the final figure. Thursday's good weather appears to have boosted voter numbers, but there is a wide variation across the different District Electoral Areas (DEAs). In County Fermanagh, the turnout was almost 72% in the Erne East DEA. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Boy, 9, died from 'multiple' dog bites","Frankie MacRitchie's family said the ""wonderful"" nine-year-old boy ""will be so very missed"" A nine-year-old boy who was attacked by a dog died from a loss of blood caused by multiple bites to his head, an inquest opening has heard. Frankie MacRitchie from Plymouth, Devon, was attacked in a caravan at a holiday park in Looe, Cornwall, last month and died at the scene. Devon and Cornwall Police said the dog involved in the attack was put down this week. The inquest in Truro has been adjourned to allow further inquiries. His body was identified by his mother in the following days. The inquest heard a post-mortem examination showed the preliminary cause of Frankie's death was severe loss of blood, caused by multiple dog bites to the head. Flowers and messages were left at Frankie's school in Plymouth after his death Emergency services were called to a caravan at Tencreek Holiday Park at 05:00 BST on 13 April after reports of a boy being ""unresponsive"". A woman described by police as a family friend was later arrested at a railway station near Plymouth. The 28-year-old, who was initially held on suspicion of manslaughter and having a dog dangerously out of control, has since been released but remains under investigation. Det Insp Steve Hambly from Devon and Cornwall Police said: ""Officers are working closely with Frankie's parents at what is clearly a most distressing time. ""The dog involved in the incident was put down earlier this week with the full consent of his owner, having previously been housed by police since the day of the incident."" Acting Senior Coroner for Cornwall Andrew Cox told the hearing Frankie's body was identified by his mother Tawnee Willis at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital five days after his death.

"Plot to 'make woman, 83, die during sex'","Ann Moore-Martin died of natural causes in 2017 A church warden plotted for an 83-year-old woman to die during sex or by her choking on her dentures, a court heard. Benjamin Field began a sexual relationship with Ann Moore-Martin, 57 years his senior, as part of a plot a few months after murdering her neighbour Peter Farquhar, 69, prosecutors allege. A jury heard Mrs Moore-Martin acted if she was ""hypnotised"" by him. Mr Field, 28, and Martyn Smith, 32, deny murder and conspiracy to murder. Mr Farquhar, who died in October 2015 and Miss Moore-Martin, who died in May 2017, lived in the Buckinghamshire village of Maids Moreton. Peter Farquhar was a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, told an Oxford Crown Court jury: ""Ann Moore-Martin was gushing about Benjamin Field. ""She sounded like a love-struck teenager."" Jurors were told Mr Field bought her a sex toy and took a picture of a sex act. Mr Field, the son of a Baptist minister, is accused alongside Mr Smith of plotting to make the church-going pensioner's death look like an accident, such as dying during sex, falling down the stairs or choking on her dentures, the court heard. Mr Saxby told the jury that Mr Field suffocated Mr Farquhar and tried to kill Miss Moore-Martin ""by a manner of means"". She died of natural causes, the court was told. Peter Farquhar lived at the house circled on the left, and Ann Moore-Martin on the right Mr Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, possessing an article for the use in fraud and an alternative charge of attempted murder. He has admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. His brother Tom Field, 24, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denies a single charge of fraud. Mr Smith, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, two charges of fraud and one of burglary. The trial continues.

Houses on graves plan 'appalling'Plans for the Isle of Wight church include building on graves interred as recently as 2012.,"Colin Wilcox said several of his great aunts and uncles were buried at Wellow Baptist Church between 1932 and 1964 Plans to build homes on the graves of people buried as recently as 2012 have been branded ""appalling"" by their relatives. Wellow Baptist Church on the Isle of Wight has not been used in two years and has been earmarked for development. Tony Daniell, whose wife died seven years ago, said he had been assured he could be buried alongside her behind the chapel. So far, 46 objections against the plans have been raised. Many residents who have relatives buried at Wellow are among the complainants, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.,external Colin Wilcox, from Brighstone, discovered his great aunts and uncles were buried at Wellow when researching his family history. ""I think it's appalling really, that they want to build houses here. These are my relatives,"" he said. The church said it was taking concerns seriously but was confident ""agreeable responses"" could be reached. The church said Wellow Baptist Church was in need of urgent structural repair and renovation According to the plans, Wellow Baptist Church - which was built in 1815 - would be replaced by two semi-detached houses and a further disused property next to Colwell Baptist Church would be knocked down and three houses built in its place. The profit from the sale of the new housing would go towards redeveloping the church at Colwell. Susan Aggio, from Newport, said: ""My nan, Sylvia Fitzgerald, was buried here in 2010 and my granddad has a letter giving him permission to be buried with her. This is already causing the family upset â my granddad especially. ""I feel very sad that this is even being considered due to the amount of pain it is causing, and will continue to cause."" According the plans up to 50 graves could be built on if the plans are approved Colwell Baptist minister Dave Burton said the chapel was in need of urgent structural repair and renovation. He said: ""Understandably, there are many legal restrictions around what can and can't be built over, or near to, a private burial ground and the project would, obviously, have to comply with all these restrictions if it were to proceed.""

"Assault investigation after Robinson visitPolice ""will not tolerate disorder"" following trouble after Tommy Robinson's visit to Warrington.","This video can not be played Milkshake thrown over Tommy Robinson while campaigning. Police have started an investigation into a number of assaults in Warrington following a visit by the founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson. Mr Robinson, who is standing as a candidate for the European Parliament, had a milkshake thrown over him in the town centre on Thursday. Two people were taken to hospital in the hours that followed. ""We will not tolerate disorder... whatever the motivation,"" said Ch Insp Simon Meegan of Cheshire Constabulary. ""We are aware there has been a lot of talk, videos and speculation about what happened on social media but we need to hear from people who were there at the time and witnessed what happened. ""In particular, we want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and recorded any of the incidents on their mobile phone,"" he said. It was the second time in two days Mr Robinson had a milkshake thrown over him on the campaign trail. He is running as an independent to become an MEP for the north-west England,one of eleven candidates in the constituency. Footage posted on social media appeared to show Mr Robinson arguing with another man before a milkshake is thrown. There is then an altercation. Other footage showed a further altercation between a number of people in central Warrington later that afternoon. ""This is a complex investigation, which involves a large number of people and we are treating this matter seriously and asking for the public's help in tracing those responsible,"" said Ch Insp Meegan.

One woman found dead in freezer identifiedPolice say one of the women found in a flat in east London is mother-of-three Mihrican Mustafa.,"Police say one of the women found in a flat in east London was mother-of-three Mihrican Mustafa A woman who was found in a freezer along with another female has been formally identified as mother-of-three Mihrican Mustafa. The two bodies were found frozen, clothed and on top of each other at the flat in Vandome Close, Canning Town, east London, on 26 April. The Met confirmed they had been able to identify the 38-year-old but have not yet identified the other woman. A man has been charged with two counts of preventing a lawful burial. Zahid Younis, 34, of Vandome Close, is due to appear at Kingston Crown Court on 29 May. The two bodies were found in Canning Town on 26 April Ms Mustafa, who was also known as MJ, had been reported missing on 10 May last year, according to police. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said investigators did not yet know how she died, adding post-mortem tests were ""ongoing"". He said the death had been ""devastating"" for the 38-year-old's family and urged anybody who knew what happened to her to come forward. He added that since Ms Mustafa was a missing person, the Met had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct ""in accordance with agreed protocols"". A 50-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released while inquiries continue.

New Zealand PM Ardern gets engagedNews of the engagement emerged after she was seen attending a ceremony with a ring on her left hand.Asia,"Ms Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford are now engaged New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is engaged to her long-term partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, a spokesman has confirmed. News of the couple's engagement emerged after Ms Ardern was seen at a ceremony on Friday wearing a diamond ring on the middle finger of her left hand. A hawk-eyed journalism intern spied the new addition and asked the prime minister's office about it. Her spokesman then confirmed that the pair got engaged over Easter. Last year, Ms Ardern gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Neve Te Aroha. Earlier this January, Ms Ardern was asked by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire if she would ever propose to Mr Gayford. ""No I would not ask, no. I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonise about that question himself,"" she said. Ms Ardern was the second world leader to give birth while in office. The first was the late Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's two-time prime minister. The couple have one child together, a baby girl named Neve Te Aroha She said at the time that Mr Gayford would assume the role of a stay-at-home dad. Ardern and Bhutto: Two different pregnancies in power The Jacinda Ardern we know ""I'm very, very lucky,"" she told Radio NZ. ""I have a partner who can be there alongside me, who's taking up a huge part of that joint responsibility because he's a parent too, he's not a babysitter.""

HMRC deletes five million voice filesThe UK's tax authority broke a privacy law and is told to delete recordings of taxpayers' voices.Business,"The voice records of five million taxpayers are being deleted by the UK's tax authority, as the way they were collected broke privacy rules. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) failed to gain explicit consent from individuals before signing them up to the voice ID system for telephone enquiries. Campaigners accused HMRC of creating ""biometric ID cards by the back door"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said there had been a ""significant"" breach of data laws. ""Innovative digital services help make our lives easier but it must not be at the expense of people's fundamental right to privacy,"" said Steve Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO. Now the BBC has learned that the tax authority's system will continue despite the deletions. Sir Jon Thompson, HMRC chief executive, said: ""I am satisfied that HMRC should continue to use voice ID."" ""It is popular with our customers, is a more secure way of protecting customer data, and enables us to get callers through to an adviser faster,"" he saidin a letter,externalto HMRC's data protection officer. In a bid to speed up the much-criticised HMRC helpline, people were invited to use the voice recognition system, rather than the normal security checks. The scheme, launched in 2017, asks callers to repeat the phrase ""my voice is my password"" to register. Once this task is complete, they can use the phrase to confirm their identity when managing their taxes. HMRC passes the voice through an algorithm to instantly confirm their ID. Similar projects have been launched by banks and other providers, although they have not always been entirely successful,as this BBC investigation found. Privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch complained about the audio signatures system, claiming users were ""railroaded"" into using it as they were not given the choice to opt out. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force across the European Union in May last year, requires organisations to obtain explicit consent before they use biometric data to identify someone, including voice recordings. HMRC has been told by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) that it was not adhering to the data protection rules. In effect, it had automatically pushed people into the system without explicit consent. The commissioner is issuing the first enforcement notice of its kind to HMRC, under GDPR rules, to ensure the data is deleted. As a result, no fine will be levied. The tax authority changed the way it sought permission for voice ID in October. Some 1.5 million people have called HMRC since then, and said they wanted to continue using the service. Their records have been retained. But HMRC has started to delete the voice records of the remaining five million who enrolled into the system before October and who have not called or used the service since. It said the records would be deleted ""well before"" the Information Commissioner's deadline of 5 June. Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ""This is a massive success for Big Brother Watch, restoring data rights for millions of ordinary people around the country. ""To our knowledge, this is the biggest ever deletion of biometric IDs from a state-held database. This sets a vital precedent for biometrics collection and the database state, showing that campaigners and the ICO have real teeth and no government department is above the law."" Mr Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: ""We welcome HMRC's prompt action to begin deleting personal data that it obtained unlawfully. Our investigation exposed a significant breach of data protection law. HMRC appears to have given little or no consideration to it with regard to its voice ID service.""

Prince heckled at nuclear deterrent service,"The Duke of Cambridge arrives at Westminster Abbey with John Hall, Dean of Westminster The Duke of Cambridge has been booed as he arrived at a service marking 50 years of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) greeted Prince William with chants of ""shame on you"" as he arrived at Westminster Abbey. He was joined at the service by Penny Mordaunt, in her first official engagement as defence secretary. Earlier, Ms Mordaunt praised the ""incredible crews"" who had manned the UK's nuclear submarines over the years. She also announced the fourth of the new Dreadnought class submarines - which are replacing the existing Vanguard class submarines - would be called HMS King George VI. The Ministry of Defence has previously been criticised over its failure to dispose of nuclear submarines Anti-nuclear campaigners gathered outside the abbey and staged a ""die-in"" - lying on the ground pretending to be dead - to commemorate victims of nuclear war. Omar Ahmed, an activist from Nelson, Lancashire, said: ""I'm surprised that he would come and support something that could destroy our planet."" CND's head Kate Hudson has described the commemoration as ""disappointing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today Programme, she said: ""A thanksgiving for nuclear weapons is completely inappropriate, and we're not alone in thinking this."" The memorial service was organised under Gavin Williamson beforehe was sacked as defence secretary following an inquiry into a security leak. By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor In a packed Westminster Abbey, with the Duke of Cambridge and newly installed Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt seated close to the High Altar, the dean delivered a brief but pointed address. Acknowledging that he had received a large amount of personal correspondence and emails asking him to cancel the service, he said he was ""proud that it is taking place here in the abbey"". Penny Mordaunt replaced Gavin Williamson as defence secretary after he was sacked this week It was not a celebration of nuclear power, he said, for ""we cannot celebrate weapons of mass destruction"".  But he added: ""We do owe a debt of gratitude to those responsible for maintaining the peace."" Across the road from Westminster Abbey, a cluster of about 200 protesters stood quietly - holding banners which read ""Trust in God not in Nuclear Weapons"" and ""Blessed are the peacemakers"". Musician Brian Eno joined protesters and asked: ""Why are we wasting so much of our resources on weapons that we're never likely to use?"" The Chaplain of the Fleet, the Venerable Martin Gough, who offered the Naval Prayer during the service, said: ""This was an opportunity to acknowledge the sheer sacrifice that naval personnel and their families have to make when they join the sea deterrent service.""

Assault investigation after Robinson visit,"This video can not be played Milkshake thrown over Tommy Robinson while campaigning. Police have started an investigation into a number of assaults in Warrington following a visit by the founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson. Mr Robinson, who is standing as a candidate for the European Parliament, had a milkshake thrown over him in the town centre on Thursday. Two people were taken to hospital in the hours that followed. ""We will not tolerate disorder... whatever the motivation,"" said Ch Insp Simon Meegan of Cheshire Constabulary. ""We are aware there has been a lot of talk, videos and speculation about what happened on social media but we need to hear from people who were there at the time and witnessed what happened. ""In particular, we want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and recorded any of the incidents on their mobile phone,"" he said. It was the second time in two days Mr Robinson had a milkshake thrown over him on the campaign trail. He is running as an independent to become an MEP for the north-west England,one of eleven candidates in the constituency. Footage posted on social media appeared to show Mr Robinson arguing with another man before a milkshake is thrown. There is then an altercation. Other footage showed a further altercation between a number of people in central Warrington later that afternoon. ""This is a complex investigation, which involves a large number of people and we are treating this matter seriously and asking for the public's help in tracing those responsible,"" said Ch Insp Meegan. No arrests have been made and inquiries are ongoing, police said.

The main parties punished,"The local election results are disappointing for both the Conservatives and for Labour, while the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents prospered, writes Prof Sir John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. ""A plague on both your houses."" That seems to have been the key message to emerge from the ballot boxes. On the basis of the detailed voting figures in 40 local authorities, we estimate that if the pattern of voting in the local council elections were to be replicated across the whole of Great Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would have won 28% of the vote. This is only the second time that this calculation has put both those parties below 30%. The elections always looked set to be difficult for the Conservatives. The party was defending seats that were mostly last up for grabs four years ago, on the same day David Cameron won the 2015 general election. That, coupled with the party's recent freefall in the polls, clearly pointed to significant Conservative losses. May 2019 local election results in maps and charts Laura Kuenssberg: Two main parties, one key message What happens when councils change hands? And that proved to be the case. The party has suffered net losses of more than 1300 seats. On average the party's share of the vote was down by six points, both compared with 2015 and with last year's local election results. However, despite the government's difficulties, Labour also slipped back - on average, by no less than seven points compared with last year's local election results. As a result, the party has found itself suffering net losses of around 80 seats, when opposition parties are normally expected to post gains. The party's performance would seem to confirm the message of a number of polls that Labour's support has been slipping in the wake of the Brexit impasse, a fall in Jeremy Corbyn's popularity, and a continuing row about anti-Semitism. Compared with last year, the party lost ground more heavily in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-voting ones, a pattern that it shared with the Conservatives (who in previous years have tended to perform better in such areas). This has been seized on by pro-Leave Labour MPs as evidence that the party should reach an agreement with the government which would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU. What the two parties also had in common was a tendency for their support to fall more heavily in their heartlands. Labour's vote fell back most heavily in the north, the Conservatives in the south. Equally, Labour's vote fell more heavily in wards where it was previously strong, while the Conservative vote fell most heavily where they were strongest. It was as though voters vented their frustration with the Brexit process by punishing whichever party represented the political establishment locally. This mood perhaps also helps account for the remarkable success of independent candidates. Those not standing on a party label were on average winning as much as a quarter of the vote where they stood. More than 900 independent councillors have been elected - a net gain of more than 500. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats, who before they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 were often a vehicle for protest votes, also appear to have profited from voters' disenchantment with the two largest parties. The party, which has made net gains of more than 600 seats, advanced particularly strongly in Conservative-held wards where it was previously in second place. Double digit swings from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats were common in such seats. The party seemed to be successful in reinvigorating some of the bastions of local strength where its support had been badly eroded in the wake of the coalition government. This pattern added significantly to the tally of Conservative losses. Theresa May insisted the local election results showed voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. In contrast, and despite the party's pro-Remain stance, there was only limited evidence that the Lib Dems' advance was stronger in areas that voted heavily for Remain in the 2016 referendum. For example, while support for the party rose on average by three points on last year in areas where more than half voted for Remain, it also increased by two points in areas where the Remain vote was less than 45%. Thanks in part to the fact that in 2015 the Liberal Democrats had recorded its worst ever local election performance, the party was able to make so many gains, due to an increase in its vote since then, of eight points. More significant, perhaps, was the fact that its vote was also up by three points on last year's local elections. When the party's performance is projected into a national vote, it is estimated to be worth 19% of the vote. This represents its best local election performance since the party entered into coalition in 2010, but was still well below the party's performance in any round of local votes between 1993 and 2010. Overall, the party's performance is best seen as evidence of a partial recovery from the depths to which the party sank during the coalition years. At the same time, the Greens had one of their best local election results ever. The party made net gains of more than 180 seats. The Greens posted an average of 12% of the vote in the wards they contested, up five points on their performance where they stood four years ago. That equals the party's previous highest average, 12% in 2009, when local elections were held on the same day as European Parliament elections. The party may have been helped by the recent protests about climate change. Fighting just one in six wards, there was little opportunity for UKIP to make much impact on these elections. Where it did stand, the party's vote was down by four  points on its relative high point of 2015, but up eight points on its poor position last year. However, the challenge from the Eurosceptic parties may be more formidable in the European elections in three weeks time, when Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on the ballot paper.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

Local elections: 6 things you may have missed,"Both Labour and the Conservatives have suffered losses in the local elections, with voters turning to smaller parties and independents in a backlash against the Brexit deadlock. But beyond the immediate headlines lie smaller storylines you may have missed - here are seven of them. A poll on Hambleton Council was decided by lot - and the result saw Labour take its first seat there in more than a decade. The seat, Northallerton South, was tied on 527 votes for Labour and the Conservatives - so the seat was settled by the returning officer choosing between two blank envelopes, one candidate's name in each. Labour's Gerald Ramsden was the lucky winner of the draw. This video can not be played Gerald Ramsden was elected after a dead heat in Hambleton. The Tories won the Tetbury Town ward by just one vote - after officials looked through the spoiled ballots and accepted one where the voter had put ""Brexit"" and an arrow to the Conservative Party candidate. Stephen Hirst retained his seat in the Cotswolds town after defeating independent Kevin Painter by 232 votes to 231. The Conservatives and the independents had been tied before the returning officer, who is in charge of overseeing elections, decided to settle the matter by using the rejected ballot paper. Mr Painter has confirmed he contacted the Electoral Commission for advice and he will be taking legal action over the decision. Cotswold District Council said it had consulted the guidelines in the Electoral Commission's booklet on doubtful papers and examples within election law books. Local elections: Tories and Labour hit by Brexit backlash in polls Reaction as the remaining results come in Theresa May heckled by ex-councillor Jacob Rees-Mogg - represented by a Liberal Democrat Leading Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg now has a Liberal Democrat councillor representing him in Somerset. Liberal Democrat candidate Dave Wood defeated Conservative Tim Warren, leader of Bath and North East Somerset Council, in the Mendip ward.

"Actor Sir Tony Robinson quits LabourThe party stalwart blames its poor leadership, Brexit ""duplicity"" and the anti-Semitism row for his decision.UK Politics","Actor Sir Tony Robinson, a former member of Labour's governing National Executive Committee, says he has quit the party over its current direction. He said he was leaving after nearly 45 years because of Labour's stance on Brexit, its handling of anti-Semitism allegations and its poor leadership. Sir Tony, 72, is best known for playing Baldrick in the comedy Blackadder. The political activist has spoken at rallies for the People's Vote campaign, which is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. His decision comes as Labour lost seats in Thursday's local elections, with voters turning to smaller parties and independents. Announcing his move on Twitter, Sir Tony said it was partly down to the party's ""continued duplicity on Brexit"". He has previously writtena tweet to deputy leader Tom Watson,external, saying: ""Our party members are overwhelmingly in favour of a second referendum. To campaign on a platform of constructive ambiguity would be unprincipled, duplicitous and rather sinister."" Labour has refused to fully endorse a further referendum on Brexit - as supported by many ordinary members - instead sayingit would do so under certain circumstances. Sir Tony, who has frequently criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter, also raised the issue of anti-Semitism and swore when describing the leadership in his tweet. Labour has been dogged by criticism of how it has handled allegations of anti-Semitism since Mr Corbyn became leader. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New Zealand PM Ardern gets engaged,"Ms Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford are now engaged New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is engaged to her long-term partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, a spokesman has confirmed. News of the couple's engagement emerged after Ms Ardern was seen at a ceremony on Friday wearing a diamond ring on the middle finger of her left hand. A hawk-eyed journalism intern spied the new addition and asked the prime minister's office about it. Her spokesman then confirmed that the pair got engaged over Easter. Last year, Ms Ardern gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Neve Te Aroha. Earlier this January, Ms Ardern was asked by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire if she would ever propose to Mr Gayford. ""No I would not ask, no. I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonise about that question himself,"" she said. Ms Ardern was the second world leader to give birth while in office. The first was the late Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's two-time prime minister. The couple have one child together, a baby girl named Neve Te Aroha She said at the time that Mr Gayford would assume the role of a stay-at-home dad. Ardern and Bhutto: Two different pregnancies in power The Jacinda Ardern we know ""I'm very, very lucky,"" she told Radio NZ. ""I have a partner who can be there alongside me, who's taking up a huge part of that joint responsibility because he's a parent too, he's not a babysitter.""

Corbyn 'sorry' despite key Labour win,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to local election results after Labour suffers losses Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""very sorry"" the party has lost control of three heartland councils in the North despite a significant victory in Trafford. Labour took full control of the former Conservative flagship council, gaining six seats as the Tories lost nine. But he said the party should have done better in Hartlepool, Wirral and Bolsover where they lost control. So far Labour has lost 83 seats across the country. But the victory in Trafford is the first time Labour has taken control there since 2003. Jeremy Corbyn visited Sale following Labour's success in Trafford Sir Graham Brady, Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West, indicated the Brexit deadlock in Westminster had been a factor for the Tories. ""It has undoubtedly been harder for us to get our vote out because of dissatisfaction with the national scene,"" said Sir Graham, who is chairman of the 1922 Committee, which represents Conservative backbenchers. He added: ""I think the overwhelming view on the doorsteps has been 'for heaven's sake, get on with it'. ""I think there is massive frustration that we have yet to see the whole thing through.""

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Speaking in Sale, Labour leader Mr Corbyn told the BBC: ""We have won Trafford to an overall majority. ""We have had swings to Labour across a number of councils across the whole of the country and that gives us a basis on which we can win marginal seats in places such as Swindon, Thurrock and other places."" He said the achievement in Trafford was ""amazing"" but added that he was ""very sorry"" about losing so many councillors across the country. Mr Corbyn said: ""We will fight back and we will win them back."" ""Of course we wanted to do better. We always want to do better. That's what we are in politics for."" In Trafford, Labour gained Ashton-upon-Mersey, which has always voted Conservative, while the Greens took a seat from the Tories in Altrincham and the Liberal Democrats also added two seats. Sean Anstee, the former Tory leader of the council, told the BBC: ""We need to rethink who we are. The prime minister has to think about her position."" He added: ""It was a very painful night overall. Not just for the party as a whole, but for those dedicated and hardworkingÂ councillors who have served the community for a number of years, but lost out tonight."" The new Labour leader of Trafford Council Andrew Western said: ""It's a stunning set of results tonight. We've won a ward that we've never won before. ""I think this is an endorsement of our first year in office and I could not be happier with the result."" The new Labour leader of Trafford Council Andrew Western said it was a ""stunning"" night for his party The story was not so positive for Labour in Bolton, where the party lost seven seats and its grip on the council which now has no overall control. Independent groups Farnworth and Kearsley First and Horwich and Blackrod First Independents took four of those, promising to fight for their area. In Wigan, Labour won 20 out of 25 available seats but saw their number in the council chamber reduce by three. Independent candidates won seats in Bryn, Atherton and Hindley while the Conservatives took Orrell from Labour. Labour lost seats in Bolton to the Lib Dems, Conservatives and four independent candidates Elsewhere in Greater Manchester, Labour held on to Tameside, Oldham, Bury, Salford and Rochdale. Labour maintained its tight grip on Manchester City Council, despite losing one of the 33 seats it was defending to the Lib Dems. In Stockport, both Labour and the Lib Dems made small gains at the expense of the Conservatives but the council remains in No Overall Control.

"US jobless rate at lowest since 1969The world's largest economy added 263,000 jobs in April, while the jobless rate fell to 3.6%.Business","The US unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level for more than 49 years in April, according to official figures. The jobless rate fell from 3.8% to 3.6%,the US Labor Department said,external, the lowest since December 1969. However, the fall was due to a large number of people - 490,000 - leaving the labour force during April. The data also showed that the world's largest economy added a stronger-than-expected 263,000 jobs during last month. Wage data showed that average earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2%. Analysts said the figures indicated that the economy remained healthy, but was not running at a pace that might cause the US Federal Reserve to alter interest rates. Hiring gains were seen in nearly all sectors of the economy during April. Professional and business services- added 76,000 new jobs Construction- added 33,000 Healthcare- added 27,000 Social assistance- added 26,000 Financial activities- added 12,000 However, there was little change in the numbers of involuntary part-time workers. The number of people working part time because their hours had been reduced or because they were unable to find full-time jobs remained at 4.7 million. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, called it a ""strong"" jobs report, ""but payroll gains can't continue at this pace"". ""What can continue, though, is the downshift in unemployment, and that means more power to scarce labour and faster wage gains in due course."" He added that while there were no immediate implications to monetary policy, it would be possible that similar data in future could ""prompt something of a rethink at the Fed"". By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent It's a strong jobs report and certainly undermines the concerns expressed in recent months that the US might be heading for a recession soon. The unemployment rate puts the US close to, though not at, the top ofthe international league table,external. That is a little flattering however. It reflects not just job creation, but also the number of people not seeking to work. They are classified not as unemployed but as ""not in the labour force"". The percentage who are either working or trying to get work (known as the participation rate,external) puts the US much closer to mid-table,as does the percentage who do have jobs,external. The Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, (speaking to CBS television) has referred to ""an unusually large number of people in their prime working years who are not in the labour force"".  There are a number of factors behind that but one possible contributor is a major US public health problem; the misuse of opioid drugs. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: ""Unemployment is at a multi-decade low, the trade talks with China are progressing well, and Chinese stimulus is in place, which should boost global demand. All of this bodes well for the US economy continuing to build momentum."" Despite the strong jobs growth, US inflation remains below the Fed's target of 2%. ""Business spending is going towards digital transformation rather than investment in labour, which is proving deflationary,"" said Ms Curtin. ""What this means for expansion is unclear, but so long as [US Fed chairman] Powell remains pragmatic and flexible with his policy the US is in a good position for the second half of the year."" The US Federal Reserve indicated earlier this year that it would not change rates for the rest of 2019.

Houses on graves plan 'appalling',"Colin Wilcox said several of his great aunts and uncles were buried at Wellow Baptist Church between 1932 and 1964 Plans to build homes on the graves of people buried as recently as 2012 have been branded ""appalling"" by their relatives. Wellow Baptist Church on the Isle of Wight has not been used in two years and has been earmarked for development. Tony Daniell, whose wife died seven years ago, said he had been assured he could be buried alongside her behind the chapel. So far, 46 objections against the plans have been raised. Many residents who have relatives buried at Wellow are among the complainants, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.,external Colin Wilcox, from Brighstone, discovered his great aunts and uncles were buried at Wellow when researching his family history. ""I think it's appalling really, that they want to build houses here. These are my relatives,"" he said. The church said it was taking concerns seriously but was confident ""agreeable responses"" could be reached. The church said Wellow Baptist Church was in need of urgent structural repair and renovation According to the plans, Wellow Baptist Church - which was built in 1815 - would be replaced by two semi-detached houses and a further disused property next to Colwell Baptist Church would be knocked down and three houses built in its place. The profit from the sale of the new housing would go towards redeveloping the church at Colwell. Susan Aggio, from Newport, said: ""My nan, Sylvia Fitzgerald, was buried here in 2010 and my granddad has a letter giving him permission to be buried with her. This is already causing the family upset â my granddad especially. ""I feel very sad that this is even being considered due to the amount of pain it is causing, and will continue to cause."" According the plans up to 50 graves could be built on if the plans are approved Colwell Baptist minister Dave Burton said the chapel was in need of urgent structural repair and renovation. He said: ""Understandably, there are many legal restrictions around what can and can't be built over, or near to, a private burial ground and the project would, obviously, have to comply with all these restrictions if it were to proceed.""

Indians shelter from powerful storm,"This video can not be played Cyclone Fani lashes India's eastern coast A powerful cyclone has slammed into India's eastern coastline, bringing torrential rains and winds of up to 200 km/h (125mph). Cyclone Fani, one of the most severe storms to hit the region in recent years, made landfall at 08:00 local time (02:30 GMT) on Friday. More than one million people have been evacuated from the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha. A state official said two people had been killed. Flooding has also been reported in several areas, and forecasters say a storm surge of 1.5m (5ft) could threaten low-lying homes. Around 800,000 people were evacuated along the eastern coast of India The cyclone made landfall in the tourist town of Puri, which is home to the 858-year-old Jagannath temple. What is a cyclone? In profile: India Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external It is expected to hit 15 districts in Orissa, one of India's poorest states, before weakening on Saturday. This video can not be played BBC Weather's Ben Rich has the latest update on the cyclone Numerous flights and train services in and out of the state have been cancelled, while schools and government offices are shut. Operations at three ports on India's eastern coast have also been shut down. Naval warships and helicopters are on standby with medical teams and relief materials. The country's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has also deployed several teams there. India's National Disaster Management Authority has warned people along the east coast, especially fishermen, not to go out to sea becausethe conditions are ""phenomenal"",external. The agency said the ""total destruction of thatched houses"" was possible, as well as ""extensive damage"" to other structures. Cyclone Fani made landfall in Puri district and will continue moving to West Bengal and Tamilnadu ""I can confirm two deaths for now,"" Orissa special relief commissioner Bishnupada Sethi told AFP news agency. ""[A] man in one of the shelters died because of a heart attack. Another person went out in the storm despite our warnings and died because a tree fell on him,"" he said. The cyclone is expected to move towards Chittagong in Bangladesh in a weaker form on Saturday. It coincides with high tides in the country, which may exacerbate potential flooding issues there. The port city of Cox's Bazar, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees live in camps with minimal shelter, is also on alert. But the cyclone is currently not expected to hit the camps unless it changes path, which is not thought likely. In Februarythe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) began distributing tarpaulins,externalahead of the region's ""cyclone season"" - but warned that if a deadly storm rolls in, shelters made of battered bamboo and shredded plastic would offer little protection. The navy, the coast guard and the National Disaster Response Force have all been prepared for deployment. Two ships with divers and doctors have been stationed at the southern port cities of Vishakapatnam and Chennai (formerly Madras), an official told local media. Train services have been cancelled In 2017, Cyclone Ockhi killed more than 200 people and displaced hundreds. In October last year, officials in Orissa evacuated hundreds of thousands of people when another cyclone struck. But India has improved its protections and responses to these disasters in recent years. The state's most deadly cyclone on record took place in 1999, killing almost 10,000 people. India's electoral commission has relaxed its rules about what the government can do during election periods so that the authorities can carry out relief work. The country is in the middle of a multi-phased election which started last month. Under normal circumstances the incumbent government has certain powers suspended, so that it can't announce new schemes or take new decisions during the voting period. Although the election will continue until the end of May, Orissa has already voted. Cyclone Fani lashes India's eastern coast.

However, the fall was due to a large number of people - 490,000 - leaving the labour force during April. The data also showed that the world's largest economy added a stronger-than-expected 263,000 jobs during last month. Wage data showed that average earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2%. Analysts said the figures indicated that the economy remained healthy, but was not running at a pace that might cause the US Federal Reserve to alter interest rates. Hiring gains were seen in nearly all sectors of the economy during April. Professional and business services- added 76,000 new jobs Construction- added 33,000 Healthcare- added 27,000 Social assistance- added 26,000 Financial activities- added 12,000 However, there was little change in the numbers of involuntary part-time workers. The number of people working part time because their hours had been reduced or because they were unable to find full-time jobs remained at 4.7 million. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, called it a ""strong"" jobs report, ""but payroll gains can't continue at this pace"". ""What can continue, though, is the downshift in unemployment, and that means more power to scarce labour and faster wage gains in due course."" He added that while there were no immediate implications to monetary policy, it would be possible that similar data in future could ""prompt something of a rethink at the Fed"". By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent It's a strong jobs report and certainly undermines the concerns expressed in recent months that the US might be heading for a recession soon. The unemployment rate puts the US close to, though not at, the top ofthe international league table,external. That is a little flattering however. It reflects not just job creation, but also the number of people not seeking to work. They are classified not as unemployed but as ""not in the labour force"". The percentage who are either working or trying to get work (known as the participation rate,external) puts the US much closer to mid-table,as does the percentage who do have jobs,external. The Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, (speaking to CBS television) has referred to ""an unusually large number of people in their prime working years who are not in the labour force"".  There are a number of factors behind that but one possible contributor is a major US public health problem; the misuse of opioid drugs. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: ""Unemployment is at a multi-decade low, the trade talks with China are progressing well, and Chinese stimulus is in place, which should boost global demand. All of this bodes well for the US economy continuing to build momentum."" Despite the strong jobs growth, US inflation remains below the Fed's target of 2%. ""Business spending is going towards digital transformation rather than investment in labour, which is proving deflationary,"" said Ms Curtin. ""What this means for expansion is unclear, but so long as [US Fed chairman] Powell remains pragmatic and flexible with his policy the US is in a good position for the second half of the year."" The US Federal Reserve indicated earlier this year that it would not change rates for the rest of 2019. On Wednesday, the Fedvoted to hold interest rates, keeping borrowing costs at between 2.25%-2.5%.

Mourners gather to remember Billy McNeill,"This video can not be played Thousands of fans paid their last respects to the former Celtic captain and manager Fans and football greats have paid their final respects to Celtic and Scotland legend Billy McNeill. A funeral mass for the first British man to lift the European Cup took place at St Aloysius' Church in Glasgow. Afterwards the cortege made its way to Celtic Park, where thousands of fans gathered to remember the club's former captain and manager. McNeill, who had lived with dementia since 2010,died aged 79 on 22 April. The funeral service was attended by many famous names from the world of football, including former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Liverpool legend Sir Kenny Dalglish and the surviving members of the Lisbon Lions. In pictures: Billy McNeill funeral McNeill 'remains everything Celtic want to be' 'Legend is not a big enough word' Celtic manager Neil Lennon and club captain Scott Brown were joined by the first team squad and members of the board, including chief executive Peter Lawwell and largest shareholder Dermot Desmond. Former Celtic managers Brendan Rodgers, Gordon Strachan and Martin O'Neill also turned out to pay their respects to the man known as Cesar. Sir Kenny Dalglish and wife Marina arrive for the service Alex Ferguson was among those paying tribute Players from the current Celtic team also attended Old Firm rivals Rangers were represented by Ibrox legend John Greig, Gordon Smith, Willie Henderson and former boss Walter Smith. The funeral was also attended by other figures from Scottish football, players who were managed by McNeill, and mourners from the world of politics. Archbishop Philip Tartaglia began his homily by offering ""heartfelt and prayerful sympathies"" to McNeill's wife of 56 years, Liz, and children Susan, Carol, Libby, Paula and Martyn. He told the congregation the former defender, who had eight grandchildren, endured his ill health with ""dignity and courage"". Archbishop Tartaglia added: ""As Glasgow Celtic's most famous captain, Billy also belonged to another family, the Celtic family, who adored him as their hero and who mourn his passing."" McNeill's son Martyn described his parents as the ""the original Posh and Becks"" and shared anecdotes of a loving family life. He concluded: ""We are not here to mourn the passing of a legend. ""We are here to say thank you for having so much more."" This video can not be played Archie Macpherson delivered the eulogy at Billy McNeill's funeral. Broadcaster Archie Macpherson, who worked with McNeill for the BBC, recalled watching him lift the European Cup in Lisbon in May 1967. Macpherson told the congregation: ""When I saw him appearing he looked slightly dishevelled, a bit weary also, I think, wearing a puzzled look as if he had not really taken in what these local lads from around Glasgow had achieved in reaching the pinnacle of European football. ""It just did not seem real until he had his hands on the cup. ""And, believe you me, even the most talented Hollywood agency could not have cast a better man for that particular role of lifting the cup. The mass took place at St Aloysius' Church in Glasgow ""Tall. Handsome. Now you can be plug ugly and still lift a cup. Nevertheless, he did have the looks. ""As soon as he got the cup in his hands he was enlivened. It was as if he had been transfixed."" Macpherson said McNeill believed the Celtic story was ""part fairytale"". He also described McNeill and manager Jock Stein as ""one of the most powerful duos in the history of the British game"". And he added: ""He was simply a decent human being."" The service was broadcast on a screen outside Celtic Park Macpherson said McNeill seemed to rise above the rivalry of the Old Firm and he could not recall anyone in the media having a bad word to say about him. The congregation was also told McNeill's daughters used to use his medals as currency when they played a grocery game with the neighbours. Macpherson joked: ""I had visions of the European medal being changed for a couple of chocolate biscuits."" Thousands of fans gathered at Celtic Park on Friday After the service the cortege was greeted with a standing ovation as it passed through Glasgow city centre. But the loudest reception of all was reserved for Celtic Park where fans had gathered to watch the service on a big screen. Supporters clapped and cheered as the coffin was driven past the front of the stadium and down Celtic Way to McNeill's bronze statute, which is surrounded by hundreds of floral tributes. There was also a rousing chorus of In the Heat of Lisbon before the McNeill family stepped out of the funeral cars to applaud the crowd. The Bellshill-born defender enjoyed a glittering career and led the Parkhead club to nine successive league titles, seven Scottish Cups and six League Cups. McNeill lifted the European Cup as Celtic captain in 1967 But his finest hour came in Lisbon on 25 May 1967 when Celtic defeated Italian giants Inter Milan 2-1 to become the first British team to lift the European Cup. McNeill went on to have two spells at the club as manager and led the club to eight honours. These included a league and cup double in 1988, the club's centenary year. Tributes have been paid at the statue outside Celtic Park His nickname was a nod to actor Cesar Romero, who starred as the getaway driver in the original Ocean's Eleven, as McNeill had the same car at the time. The former Scotland defender, who won 29 caps for his country, also managed Clyde, Aberdeen, Manchester City and Aston Villa in the 1970s and 80s. Tens of thousands of fans have already paid their respects to McNeill at his bronze statue outside Celtic Park, which was unveiled in 2015. Celtic's players will wear McNeill's former number five on their shorts when they face Hearts in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park on Saturday 25 May.

Turner Prize drops Stagecoach sponsorshipThe arts prize faced criticism for the deal with a company linked to an anti-gay rights campaigner.Entertainment & Arts,"The artists shortlisted tackle issues such as oppression and marginalised communities The Turner Prize has ended a sponsorship deal with Stagecoach South East - a day after it was announced. The firm was to support an exhibition of the four shortlisted artists at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. But there was criticism as the chairman of its parent company had backed a ban on teaching LGBT issues. The local bus company said the decision had been ""mutually agreed"" and while it was committed to diversity did not want anything to distract from the artists. The bus company says the decision to end its partnership was mutually agreed Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was among those against the prize's partnership with Stagecoach South East. He toldthe Daily Telegraph,externalhe was ""surprised and disappointed"" when he heard the announcement. Sir Brian Souter, who backed a failed campaign 19 years ago to keep Section 28 - a law banning teachers discussing gay rights in schools - is the co-founder and chairman of the Stagecoach Group. In a statement, Turner Contemporary and the Tate gallery - which organises the annual prize - said its priority was to ""show and celebrate"" artists and their work. Turner Prize criticised over sponsor Turner Prize 2019 shortlist is announced It said: ""The Turner Prize celebrates the creative freedoms of the visual arts community and our wider society. ""By mutual agreement, we will not proceed with Stagecoach South East's sponsorship of this year's prize."" In a later statement, Tate said it didn't know about Sir Brian's views on gay rights when it agreed the deal. ""The corporate agreement was between Turner Contemporary and Stagecoach,"" it said. ""The relevant legal and financial due diligence was observed. Neither Turner Contemporary nor Tate were aware of the wider issues."" Stagecoach South East said: ""We are absolutely committed to diversity in our company, however we do not want anything to distract from celebrating the Turner Prize artists and their work."" Clockwise from top left: Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani The winner of the Â£40,000 prize will be announced on 3 December. This year's Turner Prize nominees are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani. The shortlist of artists was announced on Wednesday and their work tackles issues including oppression and marginalised communities. Last year's Turner Prize was won by artist Charlotte Prodger for her film on her experience of coming out as gay in rural Scotland. In March, the Sackler Trustsuspended new charitable donationsin the UK amid claims that the Sackler family fortune was linked to US company Purdue Pharma and its controversial opioid painkiller OxyContin. The announcement followed theNational Portrait Galleryandthe Taterejecting donations from the Trust. Last year, defence giant BAE Systemswithdrew its sponsorshipof the Great Exhibition of the North. The move came after two actspulled out of the event in protest. According to The Art Newspaper,external, the annual Photo London photography fair is seeking to remove itself from a partnership with two London hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei. Brunei is facing international condemnation for passing strict new laws that make gay sex an offence punishable by death. Life has never been easy for arts fundraisers. Typically sport takes the lion's share of corporate sponsorship, with arts organisations feeding off any scraps of company cash that might be left over. There is not a history of companies queuing around the block to financially support exhibitions and gallery refurbishments. It is a small pool in which fundraisers have to fish, and it's now in danger of evaporating altogether. The public scrutiny museums, theatres, orchestras and other arts bodies now find themselves under is unprecedented. The effect is two-fold. Firstly, corporate sponsorship deals nowadays must be able to withstand forensic examination by stakeholders and the media, which Turner Contemporary's deal with Stagecoach could not. Secondly, the negativity surrounding arts sponsorship - from the Sackler Trust controversy to BAE Systems withdrawal from supporting the Great Exhibition of the North - is extremely off-putting for companies that might be thinking of entering the arts arena. What has also become absolutely clear over the past 12 months is that arts organisations have to up their game when it comes to basic due diligence before accepting a sponsor's money. It is no longer good enough to check the credentials of the sponsoring company. They now have to make sure the personal values of those who run and own it are compatible with their own charitable objectives. A quick Google search won't do. Twitter feeds, Instagram posts and other platforms for public comment all have to be rigorously checked. All of which means more work for already hard-pressed fundraising departments operating in arts institutions that are still feeling the chill wind of austerity. Theirs is a difficult and thankless job that has now become much, much harder. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Turner Prize drops Stagecoach sponsorshipThe arts prize faced criticism for the deal with a company linked to an anti-gay rights campaigner.,"The artists shortlisted tackle issues such as oppression and marginalised communities The Turner Prize has ended a sponsorship deal with Stagecoach South East - a day after it was announced. The firm was to support an exhibition of the four shortlisted artists at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. But there was criticism as the chairman of its parent company had backed a ban on teaching LGBT issues. The local bus company said the decision had been ""mutually agreed"" and while it was committed to diversity did not want anything to distract from the artists. The bus company says the decision to end its partnership was mutually agreed Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was among those against the prize's partnership with Stagecoach South East. He toldthe Daily Telegraph,externalhe was ""surprised and disappointed"" when he heard the announcement. Sir Brian Souter, who backed a failed campaign 19 years ago to keep Section 28 - a law banning teachers discussing gay rights in schools - is the co-founder and chairman of the Stagecoach Group. In a statement, Turner Contemporary and the Tate gallery - which organises the annual prize - said its priority was to ""show and celebrate"" artists and their work. Turner Prize criticised over sponsor Turner Prize 2019 shortlist is announced It said: ""The Turner Prize celebrates the creative freedoms of the visual arts community and our wider society. ""By mutual agreement, we will not proceed with Stagecoach South East's sponsorship of this year's prize."" In a later statement, Tate said it didn't know about Sir Brian's views on gay rights when it agreed the deal. ""The corporate agreement was between Turner Contemporary and Stagecoach,"" it said. ""The relevant legal and financial due diligence was observed. Neither Turner Contemporary nor Tate were aware of the wider issues."" Stagecoach South East said: ""We are absolutely committed to diversity in our company, however we do not want anything to distract from celebrating the Turner Prize artists and their work."" Clockwise from top left: Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani The winner of the Â£40,000 prize will be announced on 3 December. This year's Turner Prize nominees are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani. The shortlist of artists was announced on Wednesday and their work tackles issues including oppression and marginalised communities. Last year's Turner Prize was won by artist Charlotte Prodger for her film on her experience of coming out as gay in rural Scotland. In March, the Sackler Trustsuspended new charitable donationsin the UK amid claims that the Sackler family fortune was linked to US company Purdue Pharma and its controversial opioid painkiller OxyContin. The announcement followed theNational Portrait Galleryandthe Taterejecting donations from the Trust. Last year, defence giant BAE Systemswithdrew its sponsorshipof the Great Exhibition of the North. The move came after two actspulled out of the event in protest. According to The Art Newspaper,external, the annual Photo London photography fair is seeking to remove itself from a partnership with two London hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei. Brunei is facing international condemnation for passing strict new laws that make gay sex an offence punishable by death. Life has never been easy for arts fundraisers. Typically sport takes the lion's share of corporate sponsorship, with arts organisations feeding off any scraps of company cash that might be left over. There is not a history of companies queuing around the block to financially support exhibitions and gallery refurbishments. It is a small pool in which fundraisers have to fish, and it's now in danger of evaporating altogether. The public scrutiny museums, theatres, orchestras and other arts bodies now find themselves under is unprecedented. The effect is two-fold. Firstly, corporate sponsorship deals nowadays must be able to withstand forensic examination by stakeholders and the media, which Turner Contemporary's deal with Stagecoach could not. Secondly, the negativity surrounding arts sponsorship - from the Sackler Trust controversy to BAE Systems withdrawal from supporting the Great Exhibition of the North - is extremely off-putting for companies that might be thinking of entering the arts arena. What has also become absolutely clear over the past 12 months is that arts organisations have to up their game when it comes to basic due diligence before accepting a sponsor's money. It is no longer good enough to check the credentials of the sponsoring company. They now have to make sure the personal values of those who run and own it are compatible with their own charitable objectives. A quick Google search won't do. Twitter feeds, Instagram posts and other platforms for public comment all have to be rigorously checked. All of which means more work for already hard-pressed fundraising departments operating in arts institutions that are still feeling the chill wind of austerity.

Football greats pay respects to Billy McNeill,"This video can not be played Thousands of fans paid their last respects to the former Celtic captain and manager Fans and football greats have paid their final respects to Celtic and Scotland legend Billy McNeill. A funeral mass for the first British man to lift the European Cup took place at St Aloysius' Church in Glasgow. Afterwards the cortege made its way to Celtic Park, where thousands of fans gathered to remember the club's former captain and manager. McNeill, who had lived with dementia since 2010,died aged 79 on 22 April. The funeral service was attended by many famous names from the world of football, including former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Liverpool legend Sir Kenny Dalglish and the surviving members of the Lisbon Lions. In pictures: Billy McNeill funeral McNeill 'remains everything Celtic want to be' 'Legend is not a big enough word' Celtic manager Neil Lennon and club captain Scott Brown were joined by the first team squad and members of the board, including chief executive Peter Lawwell and largest shareholder Dermot Desmond. Former Celtic managers Brendan Rodgers, Gordon Strachan and Martin O'Neill also turned out to pay their respects to the man known as Cesar. Sir Kenny Dalglish and wife Marina arrive for the service Alex Ferguson was among those paying tribute Players from the current Celtic team also attended Old Firm rivals Rangers were represented by Ibrox legend John Greig, Gordon Smith, Willie Henderson and former boss Walter Smith. The funeral was also attended by other figures from Scottish football, players who were managed by McNeill, and mourners from the world of politics. Archbishop Philip Tartaglia began his homily by offering ""heartfelt and prayerful sympathies"" to McNeill's wife of 56 years, Liz, and children Susan, Carol, Libby, Paula and Martyn. He told the congregation the former defender, who had eight grandchildren, endured his ill health with ""dignity and courage"". Archbishop Tartaglia added: ""As Glasgow Celtic's most famous captain, Billy also belonged to another family, the Celtic family, who adored him as their hero and who mourn his passing."" McNeill's son Martyn described his parents as the ""the original Posh and Becks"" and shared anecdotes of a loving family life. He concluded: ""We are not here to mourn the passing of a legend. ""We are here to say thank you for having so much more."" This video can not be played Archie Macpherson delivered the eulogy at Billy McNeill's funeral. Broadcaster Archie Macpherson, who worked with McNeill for the BBC, recalled watching him lift the European Cup in Lisbon in May 1967. Macpherson told the congregation: ""When I saw him appearing he looked slightly dishevelled, a bit weary also, I think, wearing a puzzled look as if he had not really taken in what these local lads from around Glasgow had achieved in reaching the pinnacle of European football. ""It just did not seem real until he had his hands on the cup. ""And, believe you me, even the most talented Hollywood agency could not have cast a better man for that particular role of lifting the cup. The mass took place at St Aloysius' Church in Glasgow ""Tall. Handsome. Now you can be plug ugly and still lift a cup. Nevertheless, he did have the looks. ""As soon as he got the cup in his hands he was enlivened. It was as if he had been transfixed."" Macpherson said McNeill believed the Celtic story was ""part fairytale"". He also described McNeill and manager Jock Stein as ""one of the most powerful duos in the history of the British game"". And he added: ""He was simply a decent human being."" The service was broadcast on a screen outside Celtic Park Macpherson said McNeill seemed to rise above the rivalry of the Old Firm and he could not recall anyone in the media having a bad word to say about him. The congregation was also told McNeill's daughters used to use his medals as currency when they played a grocery game with the neighbours. Macpherson joked: ""I had visions of the European medal being changed for a couple of chocolate biscuits."" Thousands of fans gathered at Celtic Park on Friday After the service the cortege was greeted with a standing ovation as it passed through Glasgow city centre. But the loudest reception of all was reserved for Celtic Park where fans had gathered to watch the service on a big screen. Supporters clapped and cheered as the coffin was driven past the front of the stadium and down Celtic Way to McNeill's bronze statute, which is surrounded by hundreds of floral tributes. There was also a rousing chorus of In the Heat of Lisbon before the McNeill family stepped out of the funeral cars to applaud the crowd. The Bellshill-born defender enjoyed a glittering career and led the Parkhead club to nine successive league titles, seven Scottish Cups and six League Cups. McNeill lifted the European Cup as Celtic captain in 1967 But his finest hour came in Lisbon on 25 May 1967 when Celtic defeated Italian giants Inter Milan 2-1 to become the first British team to lift the European Cup. McNeill went on to have two spells at the club as manager and led the club to eight honours. These included a league and cup double in 1988, the club's centenary year. Tributes have been paid at the statue outside Celtic Park His nickname was a nod to actor Cesar Romero, who starred as the getaway driver in the original Ocean's Eleven, as McNeill had the same car at the time. The former Scotland defender, who won 29 caps for his country, also managed Clyde, Aberdeen, Manchester City and Aston Villa in the 1970s and 80s. Tens of thousands of fans have already paid their respects to McNeill at his bronze statue outside Celtic Park, which was unveiled in 2015. Celtic's players will wear McNeill's former number five on their shorts when they face Hearts in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park on Saturday 25 May.

India country profile,"India is the world's largest democracy and, according to UN estimates, its population is expected to overtake China's in 2028 to become the world's most populous nation. As a rising economic powerhouse and nuclear-armed state, India has emerged as an important regional power. But it is also tackling huge, social, economic and environmental problems. Home to some of the world's most ancient surviving civilisations, the Indian subcontinent - from the mountainous Afghan frontier to the jungles of Burma and the coral reefs of the Indian Ocean - is both vast and varied in terms of people, language and cultural traditions.

A teacher and former governor of Jharkhand State, she is the first person from a tribal community to serve as India's head of state. She is a member of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but can play a significant role if, for example, no party wins an outright majority in elections. Prime Minister: Narendra Modi Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi was elected for a third term as India's prime minister in June 2024. Mr Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won the general election with 293 seats, a much lower margin than predicted by exit polls. The election saw a resurgence of India's opposition, which won 234 seats. Mr Modi is only the second Indian leader to win a third consecutive term after the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Polls had projected outright victory for his Hindu Nationalist BJP party, which has ruled India for a decade, but it lost its parliamentary majority and Mr Modi's bloc relied on two key allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) JD(U), to cross the 272-seat mark needed to form the government. During the election, critics accused Mr Modi and his party of using hate speech, attacking the country's Muslim minority, and jailing opposition figures. Following the election result, Mr Modi said his alliance was ""committed to the principle of ""sarva panth sambhava"" (religious equality). The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part.

Counting begins in NI council elections,"This video can not be played Alison Bennington was congratulated by DUP colleagues after her election The election of the DUP's first openly gay politician was welcomed by one of the party's senior politicians. Alison Bennington was elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey. Belfast East MP Gavin Robinson said it was a ""good news story"", despite assembly member Jim Wells claiming members were ""shocked by the decision"" to let her run. Elsewhere there were some surprising gains for Alliance and some smaller parties. Sinn FÃ©in had a mixed set of results on the first day of counting, while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost a number of seats. There are 11 councils in Northern Ireland and a total of 462 seats up for grabs. Live from the Northern Ireland count centres Northern Ireland results so far What do councils in NI do? School friends battle it out Alison Bennington has been elected as a councillor for the party which has consistently opposed the legalisation of same-sex marriage. It remains against the law in Northern Ireland. The DUP's founder and leader for almost 40 years, Ian Paisley, was also the founder of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, a fundamentalist and evangelical denomination which many DUP politicians are still associated with. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Ms Bennington's election did not necessarily mean a shift in the party's policy. Jim Wells, who has been one of the party's most vocal opponents of same-sex marriage, said: ""This marks a watershed change in DUP party policy and none of the members were consulted about it. ""Many thousands of people in Northern Ireland are depending on the DUP to hold the line on these moral issues. ""They feel very let down and very concerned about what has happened.""

But DUP MP for East Belfast, Gavin Robinson, said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job. ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Former DUP special advisor Timothy Cairns said he felt he spoke for many in the party who were ""quite angry"" at Mr Well's comments. He said: ""Most right-thinking people are disgusted at Jim Well's comments. ""It is time for the leadership to take action. It is beyond time. ""What Jim has said this evening about a fellow colleague is wrong"". There were a number of gains for the Alliance Party and smaller parties including the Greens and People Before Profit. Alliance won three seats in the Ormiston district electoral area (DEA) in Belfast and took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Titanic, securing a second councillor in that DEA. The party also topped the poll in every DEA in Lisburn and Castlereagh - with all nine candidates being elected - and won seats outside its traditional greater Belfast heartlands with victories in Coleraine, Lurgan and Faughan. Alliance's Ross McMullan (centre) got almost 1,000 votes over the quota The Green Party's Ãine Groogan topped the poll in the Botanic DEA and has become her party's first councillor in that area. Ms Groogan, who was a first-time candidate in the local government elections, told BBC News NI her party had made gains because voters were ""fed up with old-style politics"". Elsewhere in Belfast another smaller party, People Before Profit took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Collin and also gained a councillor in Oldpark. This video can not be played Ãine Groogan: 'People are fed up with old-style politics' However the Progressive Unionist Party lost a seat as Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston was defeated in Oldpark. As well as losing out to People Before Profit in Collin and Alliance in Titanic, Sinn FÃ©in's former Derry and Strabane mayor MaolÃ­osa McHugh lost his seat. Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Raymond McCartney said his party was set to lose ""a couple of seats"" on that council. Mr McCartney said the party fought a strong campaign but that the absence of devolved government at Stormont was an issue on the doorsteps. He said it would inform Sinn FÃ©in's position going intotalks aimed at restoring devolution which are due to starton Tuesday. This video can not be played Voters have shown that they want equality, says Mary Lou McDonald Party president Mary Lou McDonald added that the election had demonstrated to her that the political deadlock was ""unacceptable"". The SDLP's Mary Durkan has been elected in the Foyleside District of Derry and Strabane Council after her first foray into politics. The barrister is the sister of assembly member Mark H Durkan. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had done ""very, very well"" in Derry and Strabane and was pleased with the performance overall. This video can not be played The SDLP's ""renewal project"" is working ""very well"", says Colum Eastwood He said: ""We are very happy, we have had some difficult years but I think this is a positive day for the party. ""What we are seeing is that new candidates with good campaigns and hard work on the ground are actually winning and winning well."" A difficult day for the UUP The UUP lost a number of seats on Friday, including in Ormiston, where Peter Johnston lost out and in Botanic. So far the party's first preference vote share is down by 2% compared to the last council election in 2014, but this could improve after more results are declared on Saturday. The UUP enjoyed a better day in Lisburn and Castlereagh, where their first preference vote share rose by 1.9%. They also had a narrow victory in Cusher DEA in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon where Gordon Kennedy beat DUP candidate Quincey Dougan to the last seat by 1.84 votes. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Where else would you find such electoral excitement on a Friday night? There have been gains for the smaller parties including Alliance, the Greens and People Before Profit at the expense of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The two biggest parties say their vote has held up - and even improved - in some of their traditional stronghold areas. But there's no denying both have taken gambles that haven't paid off, running more candidates in some areas in a bid to increase their presence only for it not to work out. The SDLP are pleased with their performance in some areas, but across the board the UUP vote looks much poorer than the strong result they polled in 2014. As ever, transfers are key for those final nail-biter seats in each area. As one candidate put it to me: ""Every transfer matters, it's like Game of Thrones!"" In Mid-Ulster, Kyle Black, the son of prison officer David Black who was murdered by dissident republicans, was elected in Carntogher. He said: ""Out of absolutely devastating circumstance that will impact out lives forever, I wanted to try and do something positive - to give back to the community."" This video can not be played Kyle Black says he entered politics after his father's murder showed him the ""worst"" of Northern Ireland It will be late on Saturday before the full results are confirmed. As of Friday night, turnout was recorded as 52%, but this is not the final figure. Thursday's good weather appears to have boosted voter numbers, but there is a wide variation across the different District Electoral Areas (DEAs). In County Fermanagh, the turnout was almost 72% in the Erne East DEA. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Counting begins in NI elections,"This video can not be played Alison Bennington was congratulated by DUP colleagues after her election The election of the DUP's first openly gay politician was welcomed by one of the party's senior politicians. Alison Bennington was elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey. Belfast East MP Gavin Robinson said it was a ""good news story"", despite assembly member Jim Wells claiming members were ""shocked by the decision"" to let her run. Elsewhere there were some surprising gains for Alliance and some smaller parties. Sinn FÃ©in had a mixed set of results on the first day of counting, while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost a number of seats. There are 11 councils in Northern Ireland and a total of 462 seats up for grabs. Live from the Northern Ireland count centres Northern Ireland results so far What do councils in NI do? School friends battle it out Alison Bennington has been elected as a councillor for the party which has consistently opposed the legalisation of same-sex marriage. It remains against the law in Northern Ireland. The DUP's founder and leader for almost 40 years, Ian Paisley, was also the founder of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, a fundamentalist and evangelical denomination which many DUP politicians are still associated with. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Ms Bennington's election did not necessarily mean a shift in the party's policy. Jim Wells, who has been one of the party's most vocal opponents of same-sex marriage, said: ""This marks a watershed change in DUP party policy and none of the members were consulted about it. ""Many thousands of people in Northern Ireland are depending on the DUP to hold the line on these moral issues. ""They feel very let down and very concerned about what has happened.""

But DUP MP for East Belfast, Gavin Robinson, said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job. ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Former DUP special advisor Timothy Cairns said he felt he spoke for many in the party who were ""quite angry"" at Mr Well's comments. He said: ""Most right-thinking people are disgusted at Jim Well's comments. ""It is time for the leadership to take action. It is beyond time. ""What Jim has said this evening about a fellow colleague is wrong"". There were a number of gains for the Alliance Party and smaller parties including the Greens and People Before Profit. Alliance won three seats in the Ormiston district electoral area (DEA) in Belfast and took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Titanic, securing a second councillor in that DEA. The party also topped the poll in every DEA in Lisburn and Castlereagh - with all nine candidates being elected - and won seats outside its traditional greater Belfast heartlands with victories in Coleraine, Lurgan and Faughan. Alliance's Ross McMullan (centre) got almost 1,000 votes over the quota The Green Party's Ãine Groogan topped the poll in the Botanic DEA and has become her party's first councillor in that area. Ms Groogan, who was a first-time candidate in the local government elections, told BBC News NI her party had made gains because voters were ""fed up with old-style politics"". Elsewhere in Belfast another smaller party, People Before Profit took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Collin and also gained a councillor in Oldpark. This video can not be played Ãine Groogan: 'People are fed up with old-style politics' However the Progressive Unionist Party lost a seat as Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston was defeated in Oldpark. As well as losing out to People Before Profit in Collin and Alliance in Titanic, Sinn FÃ©in's former Derry and Strabane mayor MaolÃ­osa McHugh lost his seat. Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Raymond McCartney said his party was set to lose ""a couple of seats"" on that council. Mr McCartney said the party fought a strong campaign but that the absence of devolved government at Stormont was an issue on the doorsteps. He said it would inform Sinn FÃ©in's position going intotalks aimed at restoring devolution which are due to starton Tuesday. This video can not be played Voters have shown that they want equality, says Mary Lou McDonald Party president Mary Lou McDonald added that the election had demonstrated to her that the political deadlock was ""unacceptable"". The SDLP's Mary Durkan has been elected in the Foyleside District of Derry and Strabane Council after her first foray into politics. The barrister is the sister of assembly member Mark H Durkan. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had done ""very, very well"" in Derry and Strabane and was pleased with the performance overall. This video can not be played The SDLP's ""renewal project"" is working ""very well"", says Colum Eastwood He said: ""We are very happy, we have had some difficult years but I think this is a positive day for the party. ""What we are seeing is that new candidates with good campaigns and hard work on the ground are actually winning and winning well."" A difficult day for the UUP The UUP lost a number of seats on Friday, including in Ormiston, where Peter Johnston lost out and in Botanic. So far the party's first preference vote share is down by 2% compared to the last council election in 2014, but this could improve after more results are declared on Saturday. The UUP enjoyed a better day in Lisburn and Castlereagh, where their first preference vote share rose by 1.9%. They also had a narrow victory in Cusher DEA in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon where Gordon Kennedy beat DUP candidate Quincey Dougan to the last seat by 1.84 votes. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Where else would you find such electoral excitement on a Friday night? There have been gains for the smaller parties including Alliance, the Greens and People Before Profit at the expense of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The two biggest parties say their vote has held up - and even improved - in some of their traditional stronghold areas. But there's no denying both have taken gambles that haven't paid off, running more candidates in some areas in a bid to increase their presence only for it not to work out. The SDLP are pleased with their performance in some areas, but across the board the UUP vote looks much poorer than the strong result they polled in 2014. As ever, transfers are key for those final nail-biter seats in each area. As one candidate put it to me: ""Every transfer matters, it's like Game of Thrones!"" In Mid-Ulster, Kyle Black, the son of prison officer David Black who was murdered by dissident republicans, was elected in Carntogher. He said: ""Out of absolutely devastating circumstance that will impact out lives forever, I wanted to try and do something positive - to give back to the community."" This video can not be played Kyle Black says he entered politics after his father's murder showed him the ""worst"" of Northern Ireland It will be late on Saturday before the full results are confirmed. As of Friday night, turnout was recorded as 52%, but this is not the final figure. Thursday's good weather appears to have boosted voter numbers, but there is a wide variation across the different District Electoral Areas (DEAs). In County Fermanagh, the turnout was almost 72% in the Erne East DEA. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Local elections: The main parties punished,"The local election results are disappointing for both the Conservatives and for Labour, while the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents prospered, writes Prof Sir John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. ""A plague on both your houses."" That seems to have been the key message to emerge from the ballot boxes. On the basis of the detailed voting figures in 40 local authorities, we estimate that if the pattern of voting in the local council elections were to be replicated across the whole of Great Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would have won 28% of the vote. This is only the second time that this calculation has put both those parties below 30%. The elections always looked set to be difficult for the Conservatives. The party was defending seats that were mostly last up for grabs four years ago, on the same day David Cameron won the 2015 general election. That, coupled with the party's recent freefall in the polls, clearly pointed to significant Conservative losses. May 2019 local election results in maps and charts Laura Kuenssberg: Two main parties, one key message What happens when councils change hands? And that proved to be the case. The party has suffered net losses of more than 1300 seats. On average the party's share of the vote was down by six points, both compared with 2015 and with last year's local election results. However, despite the government's difficulties, Labour also slipped back - on average, by no less than seven points compared with last year's local election results. As a result, the party has found itself suffering net losses of around 80 seats, when opposition parties are normally expected to post gains. The party's performance would seem to confirm the message of a number of polls that Labour's support has been slipping in the wake of the Brexit impasse, a fall in Jeremy Corbyn's popularity, and a continuing row about anti-Semitism. Compared with last year, the party lost ground more heavily in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-voting ones, a pattern that it shared with the Conservatives (who in previous years have tended to perform better in such areas). This has been seized on by pro-Leave Labour MPs as evidence that the party should reach an agreement with the government which would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU. What the two parties also had in common was a tendency for their support to fall more heavily in their heartlands. Labour's vote fell back most heavily in the north, the Conservatives in the south. Equally, Labour's vote fell more heavily in wards where it was previously strong, while the Conservative vote fell most heavily where they were strongest. It was as though voters vented their frustration with the Brexit process by punishing whichever party represented the political establishment locally. This mood perhaps also helps account for the remarkable success of independent candidates. Those not standing on a party label were on average winning as much as a quarter of the vote where they stood. More than 900 independent councillors have been elected - a net gain of more than 500. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats, who before they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 were often a vehicle for protest votes, also appear to have profited from voters' disenchantment with the two largest parties. The party, which has made net gains of more than 600 seats, advanced particularly strongly in Conservative-held wards where it was previously in second place. Double digit swings from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats were common in such seats. The party seemed to be successful in reinvigorating some of the bastions of local strength where its support had been badly eroded in the wake of the coalition government. This pattern added significantly to the tally of Conservative losses. Theresa May insisted the local election results showed voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. In contrast, and despite the party's pro-Remain stance, there was only limited evidence that the Lib Dems' advance was stronger in areas that voted heavily for Remain in the 2016 referendum. For example, while support for the party rose on average by three points on last year in areas where more than half voted for Remain, it also increased by two points in areas where the Remain vote was less than 45%. Thanks in part to the fact that in 2015 the Liberal Democrats had recorded its worst ever local election performance, the party was able to make so many gains, due to an increase in its vote since then, of eight points. More significant, perhaps, was the fact that its vote was also up by three points on last year's local elections. When the party's performance is projected into a national vote, it is estimated to be worth 19% of the vote. This represents its best local election performance since the party entered into coalition in 2010, but was still well below the party's performance in any round of local votes between 1993 and 2010. Overall, the party's performance is best seen as evidence of a partial recovery from the depths to which the party sank during the coalition years. At the same time, the Greens had one of their best local election results ever. The party made net gains of more than 180 seats. The Greens posted an average of 12% of the vote in the wards they contested, up five points on their performance where they stood four years ago. That equals the party's previous highest average, 12% in 2009, when local elections were held on the same day as European Parliament elections. The party may have been helped by the recent protests about climate change. Fighting just one in six wards, there was little opportunity for UKIP to make much impact on these elections. Where it did stand, the party's vote was down by four  points on its relative high point of 2015, but up eight points on its poor position last year. However, the challenge from the Eurosceptic parties may be more formidable in the European elections in three weeks time, when Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on the ballot paper.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

Spain 'won't hand over' fugitive Venezuelan,"Leopoldo LÃ³pez sought refuge at the Spanish diplomatic mission after Tuesday's dramatic events Spain has said it will not allow Venezuelan authorities to enter its embassy in Caracas and arrest a leading opposition figure, Leopoldo LÃ³pez. Mr LÃ³pez sought refuge there on Tuesday after appearing with opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ to call for a rebellion to oust President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. Speaking to reporters, he said more ""military movements"" were on the way. A defiant Mr Maduro has said ""any coup plotter"" would be defeated. Four people have died in clashes since Tuesday.

Frustrated protesters await next opportunity Venezuela crisis in 300 words In January, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader and he has the support of more than 50 countries including the US, UK and most Latin America nations. But Mr Maduro - who is backed by Russia and China - has refused to cede power. In a statement, the Spanish foreign ministry said that under no circumstance would it force Mr LÃ³pez to leave the embassy building. Spain's government also said that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy but had not claimed political asylum. Speaking from the diplomatic mission, Mr LÃ³pez said he had met senior Venezuelan military officers before Tuesday's events.

Pharma boss convicted in US opioid case,"The founder of Insys Therapeutics John Kapoor has become the first pharmaceutical boss to be convicted in a case linked to the US opioid crisis. A Boston jury found Kapoor and four colleagues conspired to bribe doctors to prescribe addictive painkillers, often to patients who didn't need them. The former billionaire was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy for his role in a scheme which also misled insurers. Tens of thousands of deaths have been caused by opioid overdoses in the US. Indian-born Kapoor founded drugmaker Insys Therapeutics in 1990 and built it into a multi-billion dollar company. The jury found Kapoor had also misled medical insurance companies about patients' need for the painkillers in order to boost sales of the firm's fentanyl spray, Subsys. What are opioids and what are the risks? US schools prepare for overdoses The court heard that Kapoor - who was arrested in 2017 on the same day PresidentDonald Trump declared the opioid crisis a ""national emergency""- ran a scheme that paid bribes to doctors to speak at fake marketing events to promote Subsys. During the 10-week trial, jurors were also shown a rap video made by Insys for its employees on ways to boost sales of Subsys. Kapoor and his co-defendants - Michael Gurry, Richard Simon, Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan - face up to 20 years in prison. A statement from Kapoor's lawyer said he was ""disappointed"" with the verdict. The men had denied the charges and have indicated that they plan to appeal. Forbes listed Kapoor's net worth as $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn) in 2018, before dropping off the publication's billionaire rankings this year. His conviction marks a victory for US government efforts to target companies seen to have accelerated the opioid crisis. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said that opioids - a class of drug which includes everything from heroin to legal painkillers - were involved in almost 48,000 deaths in 2017. The epidemic started with legally prescribed painkillers, including Percocet and OxyContin. It intensified as these were diverted to the black market. There has also been a sharp rise in the use of illegal opioids including heroin, while many street drugs are laced with powerful opioids such as Fentanyl, increasing the risk of an overdose.

Election results in maps and charts,"Voters have delivered a stinging rebuke to the two main parties at Westminster in the local elections in England, with ballots still being counted in Northern Ireland. See the results below in our interactive map. Either search using your postcode or council name or click around the map to show local results.  By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. Click or tap here if you cannot see the map.,external With all the results declared in England the Conservatives have lost over 1,300 councillors while Labour has also seen dozens of losses. The Lib Dems and Greens have both made significant gains, with the Lib Dems gaining more than 700 councillors and the Greens nearly 200. Independent candidates have also made unusually large gains, as shown by the rise of ""Others"" in the above chart. Professor Sir John Curtice has calculated how Thursday's vote would translate across Britain. This projection of the national vote share puts Labour and the Conservatives both on 28%. The Lib Dems were the big winners in terms of councils, taking over 10, seven of which were at the expense of the Conservatives. Their most impressive victory was inChelmsfordwhere they flipped a majority of 23. The Conservatives saw big losses in the south west, particularly the new councils ofBournemouth, Christchurch & PooleandSomerset West & Taunton. Labour suffered its biggest loss inAshfield, where it lost 20 councillors and the control of the council passed to Independents. Labour won seats in many parts of the country, and the party's largest gain was 16 councillors in the former UKIP stronghold ofThanet. The Conservatives' largest gain was inNorth East Derbyshire. Support for the major parties fell more heavily in their heartlands, according toProf Curtice, with Tories losing most seats in the south of England and Labour in the north. The Green Party were one of the beneficiaries of the main parties' misfortune, gaining nearly 200 new councillors across the country and only failing to defend seats in two areas. Meanwhile, UKIP lost councillors in many areas. The biggest loss came in their old heartland ofThanet, where former-leader Nigel Farage campaigned unsuccessfully to become an MP in 2015.

Polls close in NI council elections,"This video can not be played A guide to voting in the local elections The polls have closed in the elections for 462 new members of Northern Ireland's 11 district councils. Earlier the Electoral Office described voting as ""steady"". A total of 819 candidates were standing. Polling stations opened at 07:00 BST and closed at 22:00 BST in the proportional representation election. Turnout reports from polling stations at 17:00 BST ranged from a low of 15% in east Belfast to as high as 36% in one venue in the north of the city. The final turnout in the last council elections five years ago was just over 51%. Full lists of the candidates standing in each council areacan be found on the Electoral Office's website,external. A total of 1,305,553 people were eligible to vote. How the BBC reports polling day The single transferable vote (STV) system is used in council elections, in which voters rank candidates by numerical preference. Voters marked their ballot with 1, 2, 3 and so on and could indicate as many or as few preferences as they wanted. Voters will decide who takes the 462 seats that are available across 11 councils Candidates are then elected according to the share of the vote they receive. By Mark Devenport, BBC News NI Political Editor In advance of this election there had been some concern expressed that the turnout might be down, perhaps due to public disenchantment with politics, perhaps because for the first time in more than two decades these council elections were not happening in tandem with another contest. In the event the good weather seems to have brought the voters out in force, with reports of people having to queue to get into some polling stations. So it may be we will match the turnout in the last council election five years ago, which was 51%. Counting begins in the morning, and results will start to be declared during the afternoon. But the full makeup of our new councils won't be clear until Saturday. The number of candidates was down from the 905 people who put their names forward for the previous council elections five years ago. Counting in the elections will begin on Friday morning. BBC News NI will cover the latest election results and analysis on its website, mobile app and onFacebook,externalandTwitter,externalon Friday and throughout the weekend. There will also be special election programmes on BBC Radio Ulster from16:00 on Fridayand10:00 on Saturdayand on BBC Radio Foyle from17:00 on Friday.
