Duke of Edinburgh to have hip surgery,"The Duke of Edinburgh is to have surgery on his hip under general anaesthetic at a London hospital. Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital in Marylebone on Tuesday afternoon for the planned procedure. The 96-year-old retired from royal duties last August. Exact details of the duke's condition have not been issued but his absence at the Easter service at Windsor was said to have been because of a hip problem. He also did not attend two other recent events at Windsor Castle - the Royal Maundy Service at St George's Chapel on 29 March and a parade on 22 March to mark Prince Andrew's appointment as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. Prince Philip's decades of royal duty Philip honoured on wedding anniversary A statement released by Buckingham Palace to announce the treatment said: ""Further updates will be issued when appropriate."" The surgery comes ahead of a busy time for the royal family, with the Duchess of Cambridge due to give birth to her third child this month, and the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May. The duke announced his retirement in May 2017, after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. Prince Philip made his final solo engagement in August But he has continued to accompany the Queen at events A month later he was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as ""a precautionary measure"" following an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. His final solo engagement was on 2 August last year, when he reviewed a parade of Royal Marines outside Buckingham Palace in his capacity as Captain General of the corps. He has since appeared several times at engagements alongside the Queen and was seen with other members of the royal family at the Christmas Day service at Sandringham. By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond When he first met the then-Princess Elizabeth, he is said to have showed off by leaping over the tennis court nets at Dartmouth Naval College. His spin bowling was so good that the Australian cricketing legend Sir Don Bradman said he should play for England. In the 1960s he was one of the top four polo players in Britain. When he gave up polo, he took up carriage driving. And all the while he encouraged others to lead a sporting and active life, as president of the National Playing Fields Association, a patron of Outward Bound and through the establishment of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. Much of that activity has come to an end as age has taken its toll. The Duke is 96. But in early March he was seen carriage driving at Windsor. Incapacity will be a torment to a man so used to activity. His doctors will want him up and about as soon as possible after the operation, to kick-start the healing process. They will find it difficult to restrain him. King Edward VII's Hospital was founded in 1899 and has treated other senior royals including the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. Prince Philip has spent much of his life in good health, but was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection a year later. In June 2013 he spent 11 nights at the London Clinic, another private hospital in central London, where he underwent exploratory abdominal surgery. In May 2014, he had a ""minor procedure"" on his right hand, with the treatment carried out inside Buckingham Palace. By BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher Surgery at any stage of life carries risks. But patients are not ruled out of surgery based on their age alone. For patients like Prince Philip, overall fitness is a bigger factor than how old they are. This will be a decision between patient and surgeon assessing the benefits and the risks of the planned procedure. In general, frailty increases with age and does increase the risks of major surgery. We do not know what type of hip operation Prince Philip is having. Most hip replacement operations in the UK take place on patients between the ages of 60 and 80. However, such operations do take place even later in life. Back in 1995, the Queen Mother had a successful hip replacement at the age of 95.

The unspoken UK Punjabi alcohol problem,"For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need. Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room. The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her. Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says. So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps. There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique. A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community. More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool: Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking. The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated. Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness."" Indian woman fights off tiger with stick Malaysians roast MasterChef over chicken rendang Parents find lost daughter after 24-year search Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped. By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem. Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous. ""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone."" When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families. The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions. Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services. For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help. She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal. Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having. ""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it."" Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?"" TheShanti Project,external, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham. Others include a volunteer-ledSikh Helpline,external, theDerby Recovery Network,external,BAC-IN,external, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband. Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home. But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on."" Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him. ""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen."" Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed. If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this article, please see the resources listed onBBC Action Line.

Spotify shares dip on first day of tradingThe music streaming firm is valued at about $26bn after making its New York Stock Exchange debut.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Shares in Spotify fell back on the first day of trading on the US stock market after the music streaming firm's highly anticipated launch. The shares opened at $165.90 (Â£118) - more than a quarter higher than the $132 guide price set by the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. After going as high as $169, they lost ground to close at $149.01. That makes the Swedish company worth about $26bn - well above the value of other tech firms such as Twitter. Spotify used an unconventional process to go public: instead of issuing new shares, early investors sold their existing holdings. That move gave the firm's early backers a chance to cash in on its growth. Traders huddled on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning, gauging interest from buyers and sellers to determine the opening price. By the end of the day, about 30 million shares had traded hands. Despite their retreat the shares remain well above the prices Spotify said they fetched in recent private transactions. Spotify's first-day valuation ranks among the 10 largest for a technology company's debut, behind firms including Facebook and Alibaba. Is Spotify really worth $30bn? What Spotify must do to survive How Spotify came to be worth billions Spotify, which started offering its music service in 2008 as an upstart music platform, is now available in 65 countries. It has added millions of users to its free-to-use ad-funded service in recent years, converting many of them to its more lucrative subscription service. It is now the global leader with about 71 million paying customers, almost twice as many as Apple Music, but is still yet to make a profit. Spotify posted a loss of â¬1.23bn last year despite making revenues of â¬4bn. Like an angsty teenager, Spotify has begrudgingly made its stock market debut. The ten year old streaming music company eschewed the normal pomp that comes with a New York Stock Exchange listing, choosing not to ring the opening bell or even send Daniel Ek, Spotify's co-founder. Although a few traders sported vests with the Spotify logo and the traditional gigantic banner hung outside the NYSE building, most of the morning's activity was focused on a very unusual task: trying to figure out the opening share price. The process had started at 6:30 in the morning and continued for hours after the opening bell. The drawn-out process was a result of Spotify's decision to go public using an unusual strategy known as a direct listing that cut out the bankers and meant early investors and employees could immediately sell their shares. When the music finally stopped, shares in Spotify started trading at $165.90, valuing the company at $29.5bn. That should net the company's early founders many millions of dollars. Presumably, to quote fellow Swede Robyn, they're somewhere else, still dancing on their own. What is Spotify really worth?

"Girl, 17, shot dead in drive-by attack","The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Two shootings in London in the space of an hour - including a drive-by attack - have left a 17-year-old girl and a boy, 16, dead. Friends said the girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, was killed ""for no reason"" in Tottenham on Monday night. The Met has confirmed she died when ""shots were fired"" from a vehicle as it drove past a group of young people. Two miles away, in Walthamstow, the boy was found with gunshot wounds, with another boy, 15, who had stab injuries. The boy who suffered gunshot wounds died later in hospital, police said. Both attacks come amid concernsover rising violent crime in London. Police say the shootings are not linked. Tanesha, whose name has not been officially confirmed, was pronounced dead at 22:43 BST near Northumberland Park, Tottenham. Police remain at the scene. Grieving family members and friends left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road on Tuesday. One friend described her as a ""very lovable little girl in the community, she was not involved in any sort of problems with anyone"". Friends and family members left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road Tyesha, 21, who knew Tanesha, told the BBC she was ""just chilling with her friends"" when she was shot. ""The car just pulled up and just started shooting,"" she said. ""Her friend came banging on my door so I came out quickly. I even tried to save her - had to, had to."" She said the gunshot wound, below the victim's breast, was not immediately visible and it looked like she was ""having a fit"". ""I put her on her side and I was just rubbing her back, saying 'Everything's going to be OK'. I just can't believe it - so young. It's ridiculous now."" A witness said a woman, believed to be the victim's mother, began ""screaming"" when she discovered the girl shortly after the shooting. Det Ch Supt Richard Wood described the attack as ""terrible"". ""At this stage we're keeping a completely open mind, it's too early to say what the motive is or indeed if it's just a case of wrong place, wrong time,"" he said. ""We do know that a vehicle drove past a group of young people, shots were fired from the vehicle and sadly the young lady lost her life."" Are black knife deaths being ignored? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was ""deeply worried"" about London's rise in violent crime - particularly in his area. ""There is no single cause, but there has been a big spike in both gun crime and knife crime across London,"" he said. ""Certainly my constituency finds itself at the epicentre of that."" He said cuts to police budgets meant fewer neighbourhood officers on the streets who were ""able to pick up intelligence"" within communities. The 17-year-old girl is the ninth teenager to be murdered in London this year Two teenagers were shot and stabbed in a separate incident in Walthamstow, east London A local resident, who did not want to be named, said she heard multiple shots, which sounded like a ""bomb"" exploding. She said: ""It's not nice. I've lived here for 40 years, and in the last two or three years it's become not a nice place. ""There are so many drugs, stabbings and killings."" Greg McKenzie, BBC London The community in Tottenham has already been gripped with grief and shock that a young woman has had her life ended so tragically. I'm told there were dozens of people out until 02:00 BST consoling each other, while other residents woke to see police cordons and press at the scene. There was a poignant silence when the body of the 17-year-old was taken away, broken only by the sound of people crying. In this area there are people - no matter what age - who are fearful. Residents spoke about self-imposed curfews and mothers not letting their children out after 19:00. Amid the sadness, there is also anger and questions over what the Mayor of London is doing. David Lammy MP claimed Tottenham was at the ""epicentre"" of London's rising violent crime Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said stabbings were common in the area. The Tottenham resident said: ""It's so violent around here. I nearly got stabbed the other day. If you've been around Tottenham a long time you get it."" Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Watch: ""My kids don't see this side of me"" One witness, who works in a nearby shop, said he heard three distinct bangs, which sounded like ""fireworks"". He said he saw the victim with blood on her chest sitting with friends following the shooting, before police cars and ambulances arrived. Close to the scene, residents held an impromptu celebration of Tanesha's life until the early morning. ""We were out here until one o'clock in the morning,"" a neighbour said. ""It was really heart-breaking. We were here for ages but clearly she was already gone."" Forensic officers have spent most of the day at the scene gathering any evidence School friend Candice Hassan said she found out about the murder on social media just half-an-hour after the shooting. ""It was shocking. Everyone's upset obviously - one minute I see her and the next minute I don't,"" she said. ""One hour before her death, I saw her on Snapchat - one hour before she got shot. Everyone knows Tanesha, she's just a humble girl. ""It was just the wrong place at the wrong time. She didn't deserve any of that."" The 17-year-old, who went to the Gladesmore Community School with Tanesha, added: ""I have heard it was a drive-by shooting - obviously gang-related - Wood Green and Tottenham."" Formal identification has yet to take place. However, Tanesha's next-of-kin have been informed of her death. The Walthamstow crime scene, in Markhouse Road, is just over two miles (3.5km) from the site of the Tottenham killing. A police cordon remains in place around Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where the girl was pronounced dead Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the 16-year-old boy was taken to a hospital in east London. He had been in ""intensive care"". Scotland Yard said the 15-year-old boy who was stabbed in Walthamstow has life-changing but not life-threatening injuries. There have been no arrests in either investigation. It brings the total of fatal shootings in London this year to seven, including one man who died after being shot and stabbed. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle. ""We have already consulted on new laws on offensive and dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in private.""

Second teen dies after London shootings,"Amaan Shakoor was shot and another boy stabbed in Walthamstow, east London A 16-year-old boy found with bullet wounds within an hour of another fatal shooting in London has died. Amaan Shakoor, from Leyton, was left critically ill after he was shot in the face in Walthamstow on Monday. A 15-year-old boy was also injured. His death follows that of a17-year-old girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, who was killed in Tottenham. The killings, which police say are not linked, take the number of murders in the capital this year to 48. The faces of those killed in the capital Are black knife deaths being ignored? Amaan died in hospital at 17:45 BST on Tuesday with his next of kin at his side, becoming the youngest murder victim to die in London this year. Friends and family laid flowers at the scene of the shooting outside Walthamstow Leisure Centre The 15-year-old boy who was stabbed in the same attack has been released from hospital. Amaan was shot in a case of ""mistaken identity"", a family friend said. Speaking outside the scene of the shooting at Walthamstow Leisure Centre, Osman, 32, said Amaan had ""got caught up"" in ""gang wars"" in the area. Another friend, who did not want to give his name, told the BBC he no longer feels safe in the area. He said: ""There's nothing to do for the youths. It's getting out of control. ""The youth centre's football pitches are the one place people can come to get away from whatever they're getting away from."" Extra police are on the streets of Walthamstow and officers said they were using stop-and-search powers to seize weapons. DCI Gary Holmes said: ""This is a tragic murder of a young man which has shocked the local community and the rest of London."" David Rhodes, BBC England Data Unit Overall, recorded gun crime in London is down by a third over 10 years. Yet the latest available figures, for 2016-17, showed an increase. There were 2,136 firearms offences recorded by the Metropolitan Police, a rise of 580 in a year. Across England and Wales the number of people dying due to injuries from firearms is also down significantly compared with a decade ago, although the most recent figures show a rise. There were 32 homicides involving guns in 2016-17, compared with 53 in 2007-08. Yet the number of people dying has risen every year for the past three years. Reality Check: Has the UK's capital become more dangerous than New York? The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Tanesha, whose name has not been officially confirmed, was pronounced deadat 22:43 on Monday after a drive-by shooting in Chalgrove Road near Northumberland Park, Tottenham. Her death came as police were already at the scene two miles away in Markhouse Road, Walthamstow, after being called at about 22:00. There have been no arrests in either investigation. Friends and family members left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road Acting Det Ch Insp Glenn Butler, who is investigating the Walthamstow shooting, said: ""I fully appreciate the alarm, shock and revulsion caused by this murder and other fatal shootings we have seen across London over the last few months. ""We are doing everything we can to identify the culprits and bring them to justice."" He added ""the recovery of local CCTV footage is in hand and my officers will be knocking on doors"". Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence Acting Ch Supt Tania Coulson said officers had met community leaders about the murder investigation. ""Section 60 - an intelligence-led pre-authorised power to stop and search - has been continually reviewed and put in place since the evening of Monday 2 April,"" she said. ""My officers have been on the streets using this power really effectively, seizing knives, stopping cars of young men carrying weapons and making arrests. That will continue... if necessary."" Greg McKenzie, BBC London The police tents and forensic officers who were outside Walthamstow Leisure Centre yesterday have gone but there are remnants of police tape around the area. Flowers and tributes have been laid near the site where 16-year-old Amaan was shot.  One card simply reads: ""I'm so sorry this has happened to you."" One resident described him as ""a beautiful young boy"". Another local resident said the increasing number of murders which have happened in the area was worrying. ""It's getting out of control. It used to feel like a safe neighbourhood but everything has changed,"" he said. A police cordon was in place around Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where the girl was pronounced dead London's Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Sophie Linden described the murders as ""truly shocking and worrying"" and said City Hall was ""prioritising tackling this violence"". ""We're not pretending there isn't a problem in London but we will get on top of it,"" she said. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott warned against the use of random stop and search tactics, saying it ""poisoned relationships"" between police and the community. Speaking to the BBC, the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP suggested lessons could be learned from how Scotland dealt with knife crime. ""They implemented a public health approach to knife crime - where police worked with education and other parts of the state, and last year... there were no deaths from knife crime in Scotland,"" she said. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn called for an end to cuts in police budgets. He said: ""We need to make sure there's complete prosecution for anyone holding a weapon; but also much better police and community support arrangements and no longer cuts in London's policing."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle. ""We have already consulted on new laws on offensive and dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in private.""

Spotify shares surge on market debut,"Shares in Spotify fell back on the first day of trading on the US stock market after the music streaming firm's highly anticipated launch. The shares opened at $165.90 (Â£118) - more than a quarter higher than the $132 guide price set by the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. After going as high as $169, they lost ground to close at $149.01. That makes the Swedish company worth about $26bn - well above the value of other tech firms such as Twitter. Spotify used an unconventional process to go public: instead of issuing new shares, early investors sold their existing holdings. That move gave the firm's early backers a chance to cash in on its growth. Traders huddled on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning, gauging interest from buyers and sellers to determine the opening price. By the end of the day, about 30 million shares had traded hands. Despite their retreat the shares remain well above the prices Spotify said they fetched in recent private transactions. Spotify's first-day valuation ranks among the 10 largest for a technology company's debut, behind firms including Facebook and Alibaba. Is Spotify really worth $30bn? What Spotify must do to survive How Spotify came to be worth billions Spotify, which started offering its music service in 2008 as an upstart music platform, is now available in 65 countries. It has added millions of users to its free-to-use ad-funded service in recent years, converting many of them to its more lucrative subscription service. It is now the global leader with about 71 million paying customers, almost twice as many as Apple Music, but is still yet to make a profit. Spotify posted a loss of â¬1.23bn last year despite making revenues of â¬4bn. Like an angsty teenager, Spotify has begrudgingly made its stock market debut. The ten year old streaming music company eschewed the normal pomp that comes with a New York Stock Exchange listing, choosing not to ring the opening bell or even send Daniel Ek, Spotify's co-founder. Although a few traders sported vests with the Spotify logo and the traditional gigantic banner hung outside the NYSE building, most of the morning's activity was focused on a very unusual task: trying to figure out the opening share price. The process had started at 6:30 in the morning and continued for hours after the opening bell. The drawn-out process was a result of Spotify's decision to go public using an unusual strategy known as a direct listing that cut out the bankers and meant early investors and employees could immediately sell their shares. When the music finally stopped, shares in Spotify started trading at $165.90, valuing the company at $29.5bn. That should net the company's early founders many millions of dollars. Presumably, to quote fellow Swede Robyn, they're somewhere else, still dancing on their own. What is Spotify really worth?

Vlogger in Joshua boxing ring investigated,"Zac Alsop appeared in the ring at the end of Anthony Joshua's bout in Cardiff A YouTuber who appeared in the boxing ring after Anthony Joshua's heavyweight title defence is being investigated by police over an alleged security breach. Vlogger Zac Alsop posted footage online claiming he made a fake pass to get inside the Principality Stadium in Cardiff whereJoshua beat Joseph Parkeron Saturday. The stadium condemned the ""irresponsible behaviour"" as police investigate whether a criminal offence has taken place. Mr Alsop has been asked for a comment. Anthony Joshua won his third world title after beating New Zealand boxer Joseph Parker on Saturday More than 80,000 watched Joshua's bout against New Zealander Parker, in which tickets for the anticipated clash ranged from Â£40 to Â£600 - with VIP passes costing about Â£2,000. Following the fight, Mr Alsop claimed he had got in to the sell-out event for free. Manchester Olympic blaggers 'meant no harm' Comic warned over England send-off A spokesman for South Wales Police said: ""These irresponsible actions are a clear breach of stadium security protocols and could have placed this individual and others attending the event at risk. ""We are currently investigating whether any criminal offences have been committed."" A spokesman for the Principality Stadium said: ""We strongly condemn this sort of irresponsible behaviour. ""In conjunction with all event promoters, we will be investigating the process around the issuing and management of credentials for third party events at the stadium.""

Police force with 'highest gender pay gap' named,"Derbyshire Police has the largest gender pay gap of any force in England and Wales, new figures show. The 28.8% gap, the difference between the median average salaries of male and female staff, compares to 27.5% in Kent and 27% in Durham and Dorset. All forces recorded a gap that favours men apart from Cleveland Police which had no difference. Figures from the Government Equalities Office showed only seven out of 44 forces had a gap in single figures. When comparing hourly rates, women at Derbyshire Constabulary earn 71p for every Â£1 men earn. After Cleveland, the next smallest gaps are City of London Police with 0.3%, Devon & Cornwall with 5.3%, Lincolnshire with 7.6% and West Midlands with 8.0%. The Metropolitan Police is among the forces with the lowest pay gap, with women being paid 12.5% less than men on average. The Police Federation, which represents frontline police, said pay to its members was regulated by law and the issue was one that affected senior police staff. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which represents senior officers, acknowledged these roles were still male dominated - while there were more women in lower paid posts. The gender pay gap is the difference between the median average hourly earnings for men and women. It is not the same thing as equal pay. Equal pay has been a legal requirement for 47 years and means men and women doing the same job have to be paid the same. There are numerous reasons why a company may have a gender pay gap. One might be if a majority of men are in the top paid jobs while women make up a larger share of lower paid jobs. If all men and women working at a firm are put in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap would be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. But Chief Constable Dee Collins, the NPPC's lead for gender, said: ""From a service that has in the past been portrayed as male dominated and masculine, we've seen a sea change and today some the UK's most high profile senior police officers are women. ""Women now making up 30 per cent of senior police officers. But clearly we need to be enabling more women to fulfil their careers in policing."" Derbyshire Police said it believed its result was heavily skewed, as it employed so many police staff directly rather than through external agencies, which are not included in the new figures. The national median gender pay gap is 18.4%. Derbyshire Constabulary - 28.8% Kent Police - 27.5% Dorset Police- 27.0% Durham Constabulary - 27.0% Cheshire Constabulary - 26.2% Lancashire Constabulary - 24.7% Leicestershire Police - 24.5% Warwickshire Police - 22.0% Humberside Police - 21.8% South Yorkshire Police - 21.7% West Mercia Police Authority - 21.7% North Yorkshire Police - 20.8% Essex Police - 20.7% West Yorkshire Police - 20.7% Avon & Somerset Constabulary - 20.4% Suffolk Constabulary - 20.3% South Wales Police - 20.2% Northamptonshire Police - 19.5% Thames Valley Police - 19.2% Cumbria Constabulary - 19.1% Hampshire Constabulary - 18.7% Hertfordshire Constabulary - 18.4% Staffordshire Police Headquarters - 17.9% Wiltshire Constabulary - 17.6% Gwent Police - 17.3% North Wales Police - 17.3% Merseyside Police - 16.4% Northumbria Police - 15.0% Sussex Police - 15.0% Bedfordshire Police - 14.6% Norfolk Constabulary - 14.5% Greater Manchester Police - 14.1% Cambridgeshire Police - 13.1% Metropolitan Police Service - 12.5% Surrey Police - 12.2% Nottinghamshire Police - 11.6% British Transport Police - 10.0% Gloucestershire Constabulary - 9.1% Dyfed Powys Police - 8.0% West Midlands Police - 8.0% Lincolnshire Police - 7.6% Devon & Cornwall Police - 5.3% City of London Police - 0.3% Cleveland Police - 0.0% NHS trust reveals 40.6% gender pay gap Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt Government Equalities Office The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) Derbyshire Constabulary - Homepage List of Derbyshire roads closed as council issues key warning Bridge still closed as police 'astonished' after drivers move road closure signs Drug raids uncover large scale cannabis grows inside Chesterfield homes â with hundreds of plants seized by police Group of girls attacked in Derbyshire town centre takeaway â as police launch appeal to trace man in connection with incident Stonehouse Business Consultancy launches in High Peak The Royal Mint has launched a new Â£1,000 coin - and you won't believe how much it costs Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Shooting reported at YouTube HQ in US,"This video can not be played How the attack on YouTube's HQ in San Bruno unfolded A woman shot and wounded three people at YouTube's headquarters in Northern California before killing herself, police say. Police have named the suspect as Nasim Aghdam, 39, and say they are still investigating a motive. They say there is no evidence yet that she knew the victims, a 36-year-old man said to be in a critical condition, and two women aged 32 and 27. Aghdam had in the past posted material venting anger at YouTube. Such ""active shooter"" incidents are overwhelmingly carried out by men - an FBI report found thatout of 160 incidents between 2000-2013 only six of the people who opened fire were women,external. How YouTube shooting unfolded online The suspect is reported to have approached an outdoor patio and dining area at the offices in San Bruno, near San Francisco, at about lunchtime and opened fire with a handgun. San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said officers arrived at the offices at 12:48 (19:48 GMT) local time to find a ""chaotic scene"", with numerous people fleeing. Images broadcast on local TV stations showed employees leaving with their hands raised. Other footage showed evacuees forming a queue before being individually frisked by police. People gathered outside the YouTube building with their arms raised as the incident unfolded One person with a bullet wound was found at the front of the company headquarters, Mr Barberini said. Minutes later officers found a woman who appeared to have shot herself, he said. Two further victims were later discovered at an adjacent business. An employee at a nearby fast food restaurant told Fox station KTVU he had treated a young woman who suffered a bullet wound to the leg. He said he had fashioned a makeshift tourniquet from a bungee cord as they waited for first responders. Several YouTube employees tweeted about the attack as it was taking place. Product manager Todd Sherman said people fled the building in panic as the shooting unfolded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The three wounded were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Officials said the 32-year-old woman's condition was serious and the 27-year-old's condition was fair. A fourth person was also taken to hospital with an ankle injury sustained while trying to escape, Mr Barberini said. Some 1,700 people work at the YouTube HQ. The company is owned by Google and is the area's biggest employer. San Bruno police identified the suspect as Nasim Aghdam, a Californian resident of Iranian descent. She appeared often on YouTube and in one of her videos criticised the platform for discriminating against and filtering her posts. Nasim Aghdam railed against YouTube on her personal website YouTube terminated her account following the shooting. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have also been removed. On her personal website she accused YouTube of taking steps to prevent her videos from getting views. ""There is no equal growth opportunity on YouTube or any other video sharing site. Your channel will grow if they want to!"" she wrote. There had been earlier media reports that the man shot was her boyfriend, but police later said; ""At this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted."" YouTube spokesman Chris Dale praised the police response to the incident. ""Today it feels like the entire community of YouTube and all of the employees were victims of this crime. Our hearts go out to those who suffered in this particular attack,"" he said.

Reality Check: London's murder rate,"Police in Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where a 17-year old girl was shot dead in a drive-by attack Claim:London has overtaken New York for murders for the first time in modern history after a surge in knife crime across the capital. Verdict:A selective use of statistics from the start of 2018 appears to bear this out - but the reality is that New York still appears to be more violent than London. Criminologists and police chiefs love studying the differences and similarities in violence between big cities because the huge amounts of data can give clues as to what works best to keep people safe. There has been no end of comparisons down the decades of London and New York because, on the face of things, the cities are broadly comparable. They're both cosmopolitan ""world cities"" with broadly similar populations of more than 8 million people. They also have big gaps between rich and poor inhabitants. But there has always been one significant difference: the crime rate. So this weekend'sreport,externalin the Sunday Times, which could be interpreted as suggesting that London was now more dangerous than New York, needs some unpicking. And, as you may have come to expect from BBC Reality Check, the truth is a little more complex. New York police have opened 50 murder files so far this year - this compares with 48 in London According to the newspaper, London overtook New York's ""murder rate"" in February ""as the capital endured a dramatic surge in knife crime"". That is true. The New York Police Department dealt with 11 homicides in February - while London's Metropolitan Police opened investigations into 15 deaths. And in March, there were 22 killings in London and one fewer on the other side of the Atlantic. But that grim month-by-month tally is not quite the whole story. The one thing that's always true about statistics is that there will be blips - sudden rises or falls in the data. These two high months for London could ultimately turn out to be outliers. We don't yet know. But older data shows why we should be cautious. In January, for example, the Met investigated eight murders in London. The NYPD looked into 18 killings. And that means that while Scotland Yard has opened 48 homicide inquiries so far this year, New York has in fact opened 50 murder files. Looking at 2017, the homicide rate per 100,000 population stood at 1.2 in London and 3.4 in New York. While the difference between the two cities has definitely narrowed - the trend is far from fixed. And even older figures are also quite revealing. In 2007, New York witnessed 496 homicides. That was three times more than in London. Last year, the American city suffered 292 killings and London 130. The rate of killings so far this year in London is higher than it was during the same period last year. The fatalities include five shootings and 31 stabbings. Nine of those killed were teenagers and crimes involving knives and sharp instruments across England and Wales are at their highest level since 2011. Why the rate is going up in London, so far this year, is unclear. There's a push for police to stop and search more suspects for weapons after a big fall in the use of the power since 2010. But New York police have also reduced their use of similar powers over the same period - and their murder rate has fallen. New York is definitely a much safer place than in 1990 when there were 2,262 murders. But it's not remotely clear yet that London is becoming more murderous than its American cousin.

Source of nerve agent 'not identified ',"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok The precise source of the nerve agent used to poison a Russian ex-spy and his daughter has not been verified, says the head of Porton Down laboratory. The defence research facility, which identified the substance in Salisbury as Novichok, said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The UK said further intelligence led to its belief that Russia was responsible. Russia's president has said he hopes a line can be drawn when the chemical weapons watchdog meets on Wednesday. Expressing surprise at the ""pace"" of what he described as an ""anti-Russia campaign"", Vladimir Putin added that Russia wants to be part of the investigation and hopes ""a line can be drawn under"" the incident. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. ""We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to [the] government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions,"" Mr Aitkenhead said. ""It is our job to provide the scientific evidence of what this particular nerve agent is - we identified that it is from this particular family and that it is a military grade, but it is not our job to say where it was manufactured."" A UK government spokesperson said that identifying the substance at Porton Down was ""only one part of the intelligence picture"". It maintained Russia was responsible, adding there was ""no other plausible explanation"". Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the nerve agent on 4 March. The BBC understands Miss Skripal, 33, is now conscious and talking. Salisbury District Hospital has said her father, 66, remained critically ill but stable. Mr Aitkenhead said he had been advising those treating the Skripals. ""Unfortunately this is an extremely toxic substance. There is not, as far as we know, any antidote that you can use to negate the effects of it,"" he added. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The man who runs the government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down chose his words carefully today. Speaking strictly as a scientist, Gary Aitkenhead said that his staff had not yet verified that the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals had come from Russia. It was not his scientists' role, he said, to work out the source of the poison, implying that the government had reached the conclusion that Russia was to blame from other sources - notably secret intelligence. His comments come a day before an extraordinary meeting - called by Russia - with the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). ""We hope to discuss the whole matter and call on Britain to provide every possible element of evidence they might have in their hands,"" said the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov. ""Russia is interested in establishing the whole truth of the matter and we hope certainly that this meeting will help to return to at least the realm of normality within the realm of international law and...decency in international relations."" A Foreign Office spokesman called the meeting a ""diversionary tactic, intended to undermine the work of the OPCW in reaching a conclusion"". ""There is no requirement in the chemical weapons convention for the victim of a chemical weapons attack to engage in a joint investigation with the likely perpetrator,"" he added. The Skripals were found on a bench in Salisbury So far 29 nations have expelled diplomats over the poisoning, which the British government holds Russia responsible for. Russia has now told the UK thatmore than 50 of its diplomats have to leavethe country. In a news conference on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested the poisoning could be ""in the interests of the British government"" because of the ""uncomfortable situation"" they had found themselves in with Brexit. ""There could be a whole number of reasons and none of them can be ruled out,""Mr Lavrov said.

Delays warning over air traffic change,"There are up to 300 controllers in one operation who will be changing from a paper to a digital system Passengers are being warned that the introduction of a new digital air traffic information system could lead to delays at airports from Wednesday. After 40 years of using paper strips to record instructions passed to pilots, National Air Traffic Services says it can ""no longer deal with the demand"". It says it needs to reduce the amount of air traffic in south-east England as controllers get used to the new system. Nats' Pete Dawson said delays at Heathrow would be around 20 minutes. The UK's air traffic provider says the electronic tool - called EXCDS - is part of a plan to ""meet forecast growth"" and ""improve efficiency"". The London Air Traffic Control Centre, based in Swanwick, Hampshire, will need to manage the controllers' workload while EXCDS is being introduced, so they can build confidence in the new system. To ensure that this can be done safely, the centre will be limiting the number of aircraft that fly into Heathrow and Gatwick for three weeks, resulting in some delays. Air traffic controllers previously used these paper flight strips Mr Dawson says: ""It's very difficult to predict exactly what that delay will be - there are many other factors like the weather andindustrial action in France. ""Broadly speaking, as a rough rule of thumb, we anticipate that where aircraft are delayed - going into Heathrow, for example - the average delay per aircraft will be about 20 minutes. ""It'll be about half of that at Gatwick - about 10 minutes."" People living under flight paths will also be affected, as overnight curfews for landing and departing aircraft will be relaxed. Nats has asked for permission to land some planes ""slightly earlier and slightly later than usual"". The paper strips system is very well-established, and according to Mr Dawson, integrating a new electronic system is more complex than it seems. He says the digital system has ""completely changed the way air traffic controllers in London do their job - it's a very new way of working"". ""We are not the only air traffic control organisation that uses paper strips. They do function, and have done very successfully for many years, and will continue to do so in many other places across the world,"" said Mr Dawson. ""We have a timeline of technology change. This is where this particular current transition fits into that timeline, so now is a good time to do it.""

Trump to send military to Mexican border,"This video can not be played Trump: 'We will be guarding our wall with military' President Donald Trump has vowed to send the US military to secure the nation's southern border with Mexico. ""We are going to be doing things militarily,"" Mr Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, adding that it would be a ""big step"". Earlier Mr Trump threatened to cut aid to Honduras as a ""caravan"" of asylum seekers makes its way north to the US. Both of his predecessors in the White House also deployed National Guard troops to help secure the US border. The border, including the Rio Grande River, is policed by US Border Patrol President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 soldiersto guard the boundary, while President George W Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol in what was called Operation Jump Start. During a working lunch with leaders of Baltic countries on Tuesday, Mr Trump told reporters the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was at risk unless Mexico stopped the flow of migrants. He tweeted earlier for the third day about the ""caravan"" of migrants heading north from Central America. ""The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

""Cash cow Nafta is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen."" The president has been tweeting about illegal immigration for the last few days, accusing Democrats of allowing ""open borders, drugs and crime"". A Mexican police officer pours a soft drink for a migrant Mr Trump began tweeting on Sunday about the ""caravan"" of about 1,100 mostly Honduran immigrants, following a report on Fox News' morning show that used the term. The group, which has been marching along roadsides and railways in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, is being organised by US-based Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders). The migrants gathered in the south of the country on 25 March. The Mexican government said on Monday evening around 400 of the migrants had already been sent back home. Mexican officials told Reuters news agency they were determining whether the remaining migrants had the legal right to remain in Mexico. According to recent reports,external, the caravan stopped at a football field as participants decided whether to continue 800 miles north to the US, return south, or seek asylum in Mexico. Migrants taking part in the caravan to the US queue for food in Oaxaca, Mexico on Tuesday Constructing a ""big, beautiful wall"" along the Mexican border was a signature campaign promise for Mr Trump, but so far the plan to erect a new physical barrier has been thwarted by lawmakers and appears to have stalled. A major government spending bill which he signed last month included $1.6bn for the border wall - far short of the $25bn the White House sought. This video can not be played Trump: 'These are, like, professional mountain climbers' And there were strings attached to the funding Congress did approve. Most of it can only be used to repair stretches of the border where there already is a wall, not to build new segments.

Corbyn has no regrets over Jewish event,"This video can not be played Leaders ""have to listen"", says Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to attend a dinner organised by a left-wing Jewish group following criticism from mainstream Jewish leaders. Asked if he had any regrets about being at the Jewdas event, the Labour leader said: ""Not in the slightest."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups said it cast fresh doubts on Mr Corbyn's commitment to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour. Jewdas has previously suggested anti-Semitism claims were right-wing smears. Speaking on a campaign visit to Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: ""I went to a very interesting and very enjoyable Seder supper and I spent a lot of time talking to young Jewish people about their life in Britain and experiences of anti-Semitism they have had and how they view the future of our country. ""I think that is what political leaders should do - listen to people."" He added: ""Anti-Semitism is a cancer and awful in our society and has to be eradicated wherever it rears its head."" A spokesman for the Labour leader said Mr Corbyn had attended the Seder event, a ritual service held on Passover, ""with Jewish members of his local community"" in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the party. This video can not be played Jon Lansman told the Today programme ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist"" ""He wrote to the Board of Deputies and Jewish Leadership Council last week to ask for an urgent formal meeting to discuss tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and in society,"" the spokesman added. Jewdas, which describes itself as a ""radical"" and ""alternative"" Jewish collective, is at odds with mainstream Jewish groups over allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour. It has accused the Jewish Board of Deputies, Jewish Leadership Council and Jewish Labour Movement of ""playing a dangerous game"" and previously dismissed anti-Semitism allegations as right-wing smears. Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""If Jeremy Corbyn goes to their event, how can we take his stated commitment to be an ally against anti-Semitism seriously?"" Momentum: Labour failed on anti-Semitism How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded The Jewish Labour Movement said Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas event ""topped off the worst week on record of awful relations between the Labour Party and the Jewish community"". Spokesman Ivor Caplin, a former MP, said: ""When we called on the leader of our party to show moral leadership and take decisive action to stamp out anti-Semitism, this is not what we had in mind."" Leading Corbyn supporter Jon Lansman said the Labour leader's attendance at the event was ""not as significant as it's being made out."" Mr Lansman, founder of Momentum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It was his night off, he had nothing in his official diary, his office didn't know he was there."" Mr Lansman said past comments by Jewdas about Israel were ""certainly not helpful to Jeremy or the cause of opposing anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"". But he said Mr Corbyn was keen to meet the leaders of ""mainstream Jewish organisations"", adding: ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist."" He said accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour could not be dismissed as ""smears"" against Mr Corbyn, and there was a widespread problem of ""unconscious bias"" in the party which needed to addressed by a ""programme of education and training"". In a tweet, Labour MP John Woodcock. a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said meeting the group gave the message that ""extreme views are OK"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Angela Smith said Mr Corbyn's attendance was a ""blatant dismissal"" of the case to tackle anti-Semitism in the party. The chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, Jonathan Goldstein, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had ""no issue"" with Jewdas and its opinions. However, he criticised Mr Corbyn for meeting the group ""in his first act towards the Jewish community""since his organisation had written to the leader regarding anti-Semitism, because Jewdas had called the letter a ""cynical plot"". Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, Karen Pollock, said on Twitter itwas ""mocking and disrespectful"".,external But Ian Saville, a member of the Jewish Voice for Labour group, told the BBC he did not see Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas dinner as an error in judgement or provocative, as some have suggested, adding that it was a ""religious event"". Writing in the Guardian,external, Jewdas said it was ""delighted"" that Mr Corbyn was at the group's Passover Seder along with about 100 others. It said the Labour leader ""was happy to join us"". ""The idea that there is a ""mainstream Jewish community"" is a fiction, promoted by a group of self-selecting individuals and institutions who have run out of ideas,"" the group said. ""No single organisation can speak for us all. To claim that we in Jewdas are somehow not real Jews is offensive, and frankly anti-Semitic."" On Twitter, Jewdas said it did not believe accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour were ""nothing more than smears"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour has been engulfed in a row about attitudes towards the Jewish community after it emerged there was a backlog of some 70 complaints of anti-Semitism within the party that had not been dealt with. Mr Corbyn has previously apologisedfor the ""hurt"" in the failures to address complaints and insisted the party does not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form. Labour hasdropped one council candidateover allegedly sharing posts on social media urging followers to ""question the Holocaust"".

Up to half of European flights delayed,"An error with European air traffic co-ordination was set to affect up to half of Tuesday's 29,500 flights The organisation responsible for co-ordinating European air traffic says it has fixed an earlier fault which led to widespread flight delays. Eurocontrol earlier said that delays could affect up to half of all flights in Europe - about 15,000 trips. It said the faulty system was restarted at 19:00 GMT, and normal operations had resumed. Tuesday's fault was only the second failure in 20 years, Eurocontrol said - the last happened in 2001. The unspecified problem was with the Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System, which helps to manage air traffic by comparing demand and capacity of different air traffic control sectors. It manages up to 36,000 flights a day. Some 29,500 were scheduled on Tuesday when the fault occurred. When the system failed,Eurocontrol's contingency plan for a failure in the system,externaldeliberately reduced the capacity of the entire European network by 10%. It also added what it calls ""predetermined departure intervals"" at major airports. In a statement, the group said it ""very much regrets the disruption that has been caused to passengers and airlines due to today's outage."" ""We have never had anything like this before,"" a Eurocontrol spokesman told the AFP news agency. But air traffic control itself was not directly affected, and Eurocontrol said ""safety was not compromised at any time"". Earlier in the day, several European airports had warned passengers to expect delays, with Brussels Airport saying it was limited to just 10 departures every hour. Schiphol in Amsterdam, Helsinki, and Dublin airports also warned passengers about delays of varied lengths. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Have I Got News For You 'too vicious' for women,"Nadine Dorries made her appearance on the show in 2012 MP Nadine Dorries says Have I Got News For You is ""too vicious"" for most female guests, and does not ""lend itself to women feeling comfortable"". Ms Dorries appeared on the BBC panel show in 2012 - but said she has turned down all further offers. She was speaking after team captain Ian Hislop said female politicians were ""more reticent"" to be the guest host. Ten male politicians have sat in the host's seat, but Anne Widdecombe is the only female politician to have done so. Ms Dorries told BBC News: ""I just don't think Have I Got News For You is a programme which lends itself to women feeling comfortable. I find it too vicious. ""I know people like that. That's why they love the programme - it's so successful. I just find it too vicious, too abrasive. ""It's all about banter - women don't banter in that way, or very rarely. You might get the odd woman who would, but most women don't banter in that way, don't have that degree of aggression."" The Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire said her agent had turned down all offers from the show after her original appearance, and she wasn't sure whether any of those had been to host. Politicians were normally invited after some controversy, when ""the only reason they're asking you is to shred you"", she added. ""And why would you put yourself up for that? Whereas, men don't seem to mind being shredded most of the time."" Boris Johnson first hosted the show in 2002 The MP, who also appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2012, said she does appear on political programmes where ""the debate is fair and the host is fair and it's not just for someone to score points off you by belittling you"". She said: ""Women don't like that - women see that as a naturally unjust and unfair way to treat someone even for laughs, whereas I think men think that's fair game."" Her comments come after Hislop and fellow team captain Paul Merton told Radio Times magazine the producers had tried to get more female politicians on the show. Malaysians roast MasterChef over chicken recipe UK passports: Firm appeals move to make them in France 'One-stop shops' set to speed up cancer diagnosis Merton said: ""The producers always ask more women than men. More women say no."" He added that ""right from the early days, that's been the case"". Hislop said: ""And everyone you think should have been asked has been. Really, they really have."" Boris Johnson, Ed Balls, Nick Clegg, John Prescott and William Hague are among the male politicians who have filled the host's seat over the years. Left-right: Kirsty Young, Victoria Coren Mitchell and Jo Brand have hosted the show 39 times between them Hislop told Radio Times: ""There was a period when people said, 'Why haven't you had French and Saunders on? Why haven't you had the following people?' ""And you say, 'Well, it's not compulsory.' And on the whole, women are slightly more reticent and think, maybe modestly, 'I can't do that.' Maybe more men in public life say, 'Yes, I can do that.""' Guardian columnist Marina Hyde tweeted that women were not too ""modest"" to go on the show - but they can see ""how women always end up being dealt with"". Allow Twitter content?

No. ""Being that kind of funny - I don't think it's my skill set. They can be very nice to people, but basically they eat people alive who think they can compete, and I know I can't compete."" Dame Margaret accepted that it may be true that women ""worry whether they could do something and men don't"". ""But on the other hand, not everybody can do everything, and I'm pretty confident that it would be a big mistake for me to say yes and go on that programme."" Conservative MP Anna Soubry tweeted that she had declined to go back on the panel ""not because I'm a woman but because I'm a politician & not daft!"" She added: ""I offered to present it but he turned me down! I'm still available boys.""

Dutch lawyer jailed in Trump-Russia inquiry,"Alex van der Zwaan (left) worked for an international law firm in London The first person has been jailed as part of the FBI inquiry into alleged collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign team and Russia. Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, 33, was sentenced to 30 days in prison for lying to investigators about contacts with ex-Trump aide Rick Gates. He struck a plea deal in February. Van der Zwaan is the son-in-law of one of Russia's richest men and was the 19th person to be charged by special counsel Robert Mueller. The indictment against him did not refer to the 2016 election campaign. Mr Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In March, the US imposed sanctions on 19 Russians, including 13 people charged by Mr Mueller's inquiry, over accusations of interference in the 2016 election and alleged cyber-attacks. In court on Tuesday, Van der Zwaan was also fined $20,000 and sentenced to two months of supervised release. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? The Dutchman is a London-based lawyer who formerly worked at international law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The firm, which is co-operating with the investigation and which fired him last year, worked with former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort and his ex-colleague Mr Gates at a time when they were both political consultants in Ukraine. Van der Zwaan, who speaks French and Russian and graduated from King's College London in 2006, is married to the daughter of Russian billionaire German Khan. What does the special counsel do? His wedding to art critic Eva Khan featured in Russian Tatler magazine,externallast year. His lawyers had asked the US District Court judge in Washington to let him return to London by August, when his wife is due to give birth. German Khan controls Alfa Group, one of Russia's largest investment groups. Alfa Bank, which he co-founded, is the largest non-state owned bank in Russia, according to Forbes. Van der Zwaan admitted to making false statements to the special counsel's office in November 2017 as part ofa plea deal reached in February.,external ""What I did was wrong. I apologise to this court, and I apologise to my wife,"" he said at the hearing. According to court documents, Van der Zwaan ""wilfully and knowingly"" made false statements to investigators while answering questions about a report prepared in 2012 by his former law firm for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice on the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko. Ms Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister, was jailed in 2011 over a gas deal with Russia, in charges she said were politically motivated. The report prepared by Skadden was used to defend Ukraine's then pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych from international criticism over the jailing of Ms Tymoshenko, a bitter rival who he defeated to become president in 2010. Mr Mueller's indictment said Van der Zwaan ""deleted and otherwise did not produce emails sought by the special counsel's office"" and made a false statement about when he was last in contact with Mr Gates and ""Person A"", who has not been identified but is described as a long-term business associate of Mr Gates and Mr Manafort. US media have identified Person A as a former Russian intelligence operative. The mystery professor behind Trump-Russia inquiry Republicans warn Trump over Russia probe Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Mr Gates and Mr Manafort have been hit with a number of charges, including conspiracy to launder money and acting as ""unregistered agents"" of Mr Yanukovych and his party. Mr Manafort has denied all charges against him. Mr Gates has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators in a plea deal. Analysis by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher Special counsel Robert Mueller has brought charges against 19 individuals and he has obtained five guilty pleas. Now, with Alex van der Zwaan's 30-day prison sentence, he has closed his first case. The lawyer's ordeal appears somewhat tangential to the central thrust of Mr Mueller's investigation, but the special counsel's office made clear that lying to government investigators must have consequences. In addition, information prosecutors obtained from him may have been key to securing the co-operation of former Trump campaign and transition aide Rick Gates, who could in turn help seal former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort's legal fate. For the moment, at least, Mr Manafort continues to be the central figure in this investigation. Based on information released by Mr Mueller's office on Monday night, his ties to Russia - while he was involved with the Trump campaign - are squarely under the microscope. While Van der Zwaan's sentencing is a milestone in Mr Mueller's inquiry, Paul Manafort is the biggest and most important domino currently standing. Nineteen people - including Mr Manafort and Mr Gates - have been indicted by the special counsel: Michael Flynn, a former US national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIover meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador, Sergei Kislyak George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBIabout his contacts with Russians In March,13 Russians were charged with tampering in the 2016 US electionand a California man, Richard Pinedo, admitted an identity theft charge Mr Trump has insisted there was no collusion.

Parents find daughter after 24-year search,"This video can not be played Kang Ying, 27, was reunited with her mother after 24 years A Chinese couple have been reunited with their daughter who went missing 24 years ago. Wang Mingqing and his wife Liu Dengying had looked for Qifeng since she disappeared aged three in 1994. His tireless search included becoming a taxi driver, in the hope he might one day pick her up as a passenger. His daughter made contact earlier this year after coming across an online post about him. At the tearful reunion he hugged her and said: ""Daddy loves you."" The incredible story has swept China, where many are celebrating the reunion. Wang Mingqing and Liu Dengying were fruit sellers, selling their wares at a roadside stall in the south-western city of Chengdu. On one particularly busy day,Mr Wang ran out of change, and briefly went to a neighbouring stall to change money,externalfor a customer. When he was back minutes later,his daughter was nowhere to be found,external, Chinese media reported. For years Wang Mingqing handed out leaflets appealing for information about his missing daughter Mr Wang and his wife spent years searching for her in the city and surrounding areas, taking out advertisements in newspapers and setting up online appeals. The couple, who have another daughter and a son, never left Chengdu, in the hope that Qifeng would find her way back to them. In 2015, Mr Wang decided to broaden the search by signing up as a driver with ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing. He put up a large sign appealing for information on his rear window, and also gave out cards with information about Qifeng to every passenger he ferried. Mr Wang did not have a picture of Qifeng as a toddler so he used a picture of his other daughter in his leaflets, as they looked similar. His unique method gained attention from the Chinese media. ""One day, my daughter may just be the person sitting in my car!"" he was quoted as saying. Kang Ying flew to Chengdu with her husband and children to meet her parents Supporters gave her bouquets of flowers Over the years Chinese police identified several women who could have been Qifeng, but DNA tests showed they were not his daughter. But a breakthrough finally came late last year, when a police sketch artist read about Mr Wang and decided to help by producing a drawing of what Qifeng might look like as an adult. The picture was circulated online. Thousands of kilometres away, on the other side of the country, a woman called Kang Ying saw the picture - and was shocked by how much it resembled her. She had been raised by adoptive parents in a nearby town just 20km (12 miles) away, Chinese media reported. Her adoptive family had told her thatshe was found on the side of a road in Chengdu as a child,external, Shanghaiist said. Kang Ying's family greeted her with signs with messages including ""welcome back, child"" and ""sister, I really miss you"" Discovering the truth about my parents after 20 years The adopted girl claimed by 50 birth families Malala's homecoming: Brief but revealing She contacted Mr Wang earlier this year, and found that she shared some unusual traits with his missing daughter, including a small scar on her forehead and a tendency to get nauseous whenever she cried. They quickly arranged for a DNA test. This time, the result was positive - Mr Wang had finally found his long-lost child. On Monday,Mr Wang and Kang Ying spoke for the first time via a voice messenger app, thecover.cn reported,external(in Chinese). ""From now on, Dad is here - you don't need to worry about anything - Dad will help you,"" Mr Wang said. He also shared the news with his friends on social media, telling them: ""My efforts of 24 years were not wasted! My daughter has been found - thank you everyone."" Kang Ying's younger sister (left) holds up her new-found niece On Tuesday, the pair were reunited in person when Kang Ying, who lives in northern Jilin province, flew to Chengdu with her husband, son and daughter. Kang Ying and her mother, Liu Dengyeng, hugged each other tightly and cried as they were reunited - and were quickly joined by the rest of the family. Kang Ying told reporters tearfully: ""The whole world told me I didn't have a mother - but I do!"" thecover.cn reported. ""I can't tell you how much hope, disappointment and despair we have gone through these past 24 years. Now we can finally meet again,"" Mr Wang was quoted as saying in the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. The family gathered for a photo after their reunion BBC report helps HK actor find brothers.

Scientists use astronomy to save speciesResearchers use astronomical techniques used to study distant stars to survey endangered species.5m6 minutes agoScience & Environment,"Elephants are easier to spot from the heat they give off. Researchers are using astronomical techniques used to study distant stars to survey endangered species. The team of scientists is developing a system to automatically identify animals using a camera that has been mounted on a drone. It is able to identify them from the heat they give off, even when vegetation is in the way. Details of the system were presented at theannual meeting of the European Astronomical Society,externalin Liverpool, UK. The idea was developed by Serge Wich, a conservationist at Liverpool John Moores University, and Dr Steve Longmore, an astrophysicist at the same university. He says that the system has the potential to greatly improve the accuracy of monitoring endangered species and so help save endangered species. ""Conservation is not only about the numbers of animals but also about political will and local community supporting conservation. But better data always helps to move good arguments forward. Solid data on what is happening to animal populations is the foundation of all conservation efforts"". Astronomers routinely identify the size and age of stars from infrared images. Now the technique is being used to identify animals Currently, conservationists estimate numbers of endangered species by physically counting them or the signs they leave. This is an inexact science, as the animals can be in areas inaccessible to observers. Further problems can arise if species have migrated to another area since the previous census. Signs of their presence, such as abandoned nests, rely on assumptions such as the number of animals that share the nest and the frequency with which the species build and abandon their nests. The process is time consuming, expensive and inaccurate. So Dr Wich developed a system to monitor them using infrared cameras mounted on drones. Trials at Chester Zoo and Knowsley Safari Park showed that the system could pick up animals on the ground from the heat they gave off, even through tree cover. Each species has its own unique pattern of heat distributed accross its body. But the problem was that they couldn't always identify the species - especially when they were far away. Dr Wich needed a system that could identify different species from their heat signatures. He explained his problem to his neighbour, Dr Steve Longmore, while chatting over the fence. The neighbour was an astronomer and he explained that he knew someone who identified the size and age of far away stars from their heat signatures. ""I collaborated with quite a few people during my career but astrophysicists were not on my list of potential collaborators,"" Dr Wich told BBC News. ""But here we are. It shows how the serendipity of how science works."" Conservationist Serge Wich tests out his system in South Africa Dr Wich worked with astrophysicist Dr Claire Burke, also at Liverpool John Moores University. She told BBC News that her work in identifying the most massive galaxies in the Universe from the light they emit helped her devise software that could identify different types of animal from the pattern of the heat they give off. Each species, she said, has distinct warmer and colder areas that are unique. ""When we look at animals in the thermal infrared, we're looking at their body heat and they glow in the footage. That glow is very similar to the way that stars and galaxies in space glow,"" Dr Burke explained. ""So we can apply techniques and software used in astronomy for decades to automatically detect and measure this glow"". The system can also give information about the health of animals. If an animal is injured then that part of the animal's body will be glowing brighter than the rest. Similarly, diseased animals also have a different heat profile, according to Dr Burke. Drones could automatically give accurate numbers of endangered species ""The real advantage this gives you is that if you know how many animals you have and where they are and what kind of health they are in, then you can you can formulate a good conservation strategy for looking after them,"" she said. ""And if you can track them as well, then you can tell what they need to survive and thrive and this helps us. If, for example, we needed to relocate animal because its habitat was being destroyed then you would know better what it needed to be relocated to.""

Pupils on US trip hit by 'virulent' bugForty-eight children and three teachers from a school in Hampshire were taken to hospital in the US.,"Ambulance crews took 48 children and three teachers to hospital Dozens of pupils and three teachers from a British school were rushed to hospital in the US after the outbreak of a ""virulent"" stomach bug. The party from Crookhorn College in Waterlooville, Hampshire, were in Washington DC when ambulances were called to Hotel Harrington on Sunday. One parent told the BBC her daughter showed symptoms after eating at a branch of Planet Hollywood in New York. The restaurant said it did not believe it was the cause of the mass sickness. The group is expected to land in the UK on Wednesday. In total, 48 children and three teachers were treated, with 13 found to be suffering ""gastrointestinal distress"". The rest were treated as a precaution, according to the District of Columbia Fire and EMS. The Department of Health, Washington, DC said it was ""investigating this outbreak of illness"". Parent Susan Crowle said her 16-year-old daughter Nicola was the first pupil to fall ill shortly after the group arrived in New York. Two days later, other students also started to feel poorly, she said. The only meal Nicola had eaten during the trip was at Planet Hollywood on the first day, Ms Crowle said. Nicola had been admitted to hospital with stomach problems, where she spent two nights before being discharged. Ms Crowle said her daughter then tried to ""sleep off"" the illness on the coach trip to Washington, but collapsed when she arrived and was again admitted to hospital as other students started to fall ill. She added that Nicola's condition was improving and she expected to make the flight back to the UK with her fellow pupils. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the school confirmed a ""virulent gastro virus"" had affected ""most"" of those attending the six-night trip, which had started in New York on Wednesday. It said an additional member of staff had flown to Washington DC to provide ""further support to the students"". Two students remained in hospital on Tuesday, the school said. It praised school staff in the US for doing ""the most amazing job at looking after the children"" adding its main priority was ""to ensure that all the students and staff get home safe and well"". Jackie Branson, chair of governors at the school, said all students were expected to be able to fly back to the UK later. She added that Public Health England had been informed. In a statement, Planet Hollywood said: ""As the rest of the group became sick 48 hours after their visit, we can pretty safely assume that it is extremely unlikely that Planet Hollywood was involved.""

RAC breaks rules on insurance renewals,"The RAC has been forced to apologise to more than a million of its breakdown customers, after failing to meet the rules on insurance renewals. Some of those customers will receive financial compensation. The Financial Conduct Authority - which introduced new guidelines a year ago - said such behaviour was ""unacceptable"". When customers receive a renewal, they should be told prominently what they paid in the previous year. They should also be encouraged to shop around. However, when the RAC sent out breakdown policy renewal letters, they failed to do either. ""It is simply unacceptable to see that some firms are still not being properly transparent with their customers a year on from the introduction of the rules,"" said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision at the FCA. ""Firms failing to get this right may have led to consumers losing out as they do not have the right information to decide whether or not to shop around."" It is not known how many people will receive compensation. Insurers 'burying price rises' Admiral gave customers wrong information An RAC spokesperson said: ""While our breakdown policy renewal documentation did accurately contain all the necessary information, we recognise that some of the key information in our letters was not as prominently displayed as it should have been. ""We continue to be committed to giving members clear and fair information so they can make the right decision, and are contacting those affected to ensure they are satisfied."" Other firms, including Admiral and M&S Insurance, have previously been criticised for failing to comply with the rules. The BBC has also highlighted problems with John Lewis Insurance.

Parents find daughter after 24-year searchThe father Wang Mingqing became a taxi driver so he could search for his missing child.3h3 hours agoChina,"This video can not be played Kang Ying, 27, was reunited with her mother after 24 years A Chinese couple have been reunited with their daughter who went missing 24 years ago. Wang Mingqing and his wife Liu Dengying had looked for Qifeng since she disappeared aged three in 1994. His tireless search included becoming a taxi driver, in the hope he might one day pick her up as a passenger. His daughter made contact earlier this year after coming across an online post about him. At the tearful reunion he hugged her and said: ""Daddy loves you."" The incredible story has swept China, where many are celebrating the reunion. Wang Mingqing and Liu Dengying were fruit sellers, selling their wares at a roadside stall in the south-western city of Chengdu. On one particularly busy day,Mr Wang ran out of change, and briefly went to a neighbouring stall to change money,externalfor a customer. When he was back minutes later,his daughter was nowhere to be found,external, Chinese media reported. For years Wang Mingqing handed out leaflets appealing for information about his missing daughter Mr Wang and his wife spent years searching for her in the city and surrounding areas, taking out advertisements in newspapers and setting up online appeals. The couple, who have another daughter and a son, never left Chengdu, in the hope that Qifeng would find her way back to them. In 2015, Mr Wang decided to broaden the search by signing up as a driver with ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing. He put up a large sign appealing for information on his rear window, and also gave out cards with information about Qifeng to every passenger he ferried. Mr Wang did not have a picture of Qifeng as a toddler so he used a picture of his other daughter in his leaflets, as they looked similar. His unique method gained attention from the Chinese media. ""One day, my daughter may just be the person sitting in my car!"" he was quoted as saying. Kang Ying flew to Chengdu with her husband and children to meet her parents Supporters gave her bouquets of flowers Over the years Chinese police identified several women who could have been Qifeng, but DNA tests showed they were not his daughter. But a breakthrough finally came late last year, when a police sketch artist read about Mr Wang and decided to help by producing a drawing of what Qifeng might look like as an adult. The picture was circulated online. Thousands of kilometres away, on the other side of the country, a woman called Kang Ying saw the picture - and was shocked by how much it resembled her. She had been raised by adoptive parents in a nearby town just 20km (12 miles) away, Chinese media reported. Her adoptive family had told her thatshe was found on the side of a road in Chengdu as a child,external, Shanghaiist said. Kang Ying's family greeted her with signs with messages including ""welcome back, child"" and ""sister, I really miss you"" Discovering the truth about my parents after 20 years The adopted girl claimed by 50 birth families Malala's homecoming: Brief but revealing She contacted Mr Wang earlier this year, and found that she shared some unusual traits with his missing daughter, including a small scar on her forehead and a tendency to get nauseous whenever she cried. They quickly arranged for a DNA test. This time, the result was positive - Mr Wang had finally found his long-lost child. On Monday,Mr Wang and Kang Ying spoke for the first time via a voice messenger app, thecover.cn reported,external(in Chinese). ""From now on, Dad is here - you don't need to worry about anything - Dad will help you,"" Mr Wang said. He also shared the news with his friends on social media, telling them: ""My efforts of 24 years were not wasted! My daughter has been found - thank you everyone."" Kang Ying's younger sister (left) holds up her new-found niece On Tuesday, the pair were reunited in person when Kang Ying, who lives in northern Jilin province, flew to Chengdu with her husband, son and daughter. Kang Ying and her mother, Liu Dengyeng, hugged each other tightly and cried as they were reunited - and were quickly joined by the rest of the family. Kang Ying told reporters tearfully: ""The whole world told me I didn't have a mother - but I do!"" thecover.cn reported. ""I can't tell you how much hope, disappointment and despair we have gone through these past 24 years. Now we can finally meet again,"" Mr Wang was quoted as saying in the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. The family gathered for a photo after their reunion BBC report helps HK actor find brothers.

Apple Watch provides murder case cluesMotion and heart rate data from a smartwatch has been presented in court as part of a murder trial.4h4 hours agoTechnology,"Smartwatches can track movement and heart rate Police in Australia have presented data gathered from an Apple Watch as evidence in a murder trial. Grandmother Myrna Nilsson was wearing the device when she was killed in 2016. Her daughter-in-law Caroline Nilsson is accused of staging an ambush, after claiming she was tied up by a group of men who entered the house. But data from the victim's smartwatch suggests that she was ambushed as she arrived home, and died hours earlier than Ms Nilsson claims. Ms Nilsson told police that her mother-in-law had been followed home by a group of men in a car. According toABC News,external, Ms Nilsson said her mother-in-law had argued with the men outside the house for about 20 minutes, but she did not hear the fatal attack because she was in the kitchen with the door closed. A neighbour called the police when Ms Nilsson emerged from the house gagged and distressed after 22:00. Ms Nilsson says the attackers had tied her up and that she had made her way out of the house as soon as they had left. But prosecutor Carmen Matteo said evidence from the victim's smartwatch suggested Ms Nilsson had staged the home invasion. The body of 57-year-old Myrna Nilsson was found in the laundry room of her home in Valley View, Adelaide, in September 2016. ""The evidence from the Apple Watch is a foundational piece of evidence for demonstrating the falsity of the defendant's account to police,"" said Ms Matteo. ""A watch of this typeâ¦ contains sensors capable of tracking the movement and rate of movement of the person wearing it... it also measures the heart rate."" The prosecution alleged that the watch had recorded data consistent with a person going into shock and losing consciousness. ""The deceased must have been attacked at around 6:38pm and had certainly died by 6:45pm,"" she said. ""If that evidence is accepted, it tends to contradict the accused's version of an argument occurring between the deceased and these men outside the laundry for a period of up to 20 minutes. ""Her emergence from the house was well after 10:00pm and if the Apple Watch evidence is accepted, that is over three hours after the attack on the deceased."" Magistrate Oliver Koehn denied Ms Nilsson bail based on the ""apparent strength of the prosecution's case"". The trial will continue in June.

"Corbyn has no regrets over Jewish eventMainstream Jewish groups say the Labour leader should not have attended ""radical"" Jewish event.3m4 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Leaders ""have to listen"", says Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to attend a dinner organised by a left-wing Jewish group following criticism from mainstream Jewish leaders. Asked if he had any regrets about being at the Jewdas event, the Labour leader said: ""Not in the slightest."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups said it cast fresh doubts on Mr Corbyn's commitment to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour. Jewdas has previously suggested anti-Semitism claims were right-wing smears. Speaking on a campaign visit to Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: ""I went to a very interesting and very enjoyable Seder supper and I spent a lot of time talking to young Jewish people about their life in Britain and experiences of anti-Semitism they have had and how they view the future of our country. ""I think that is what political leaders should do - listen to people."" He added: ""Anti-Semitism is a cancer and awful in our society and has to be eradicated wherever it rears its head."" A spokesman for the Labour leader said Mr Corbyn had attended the Seder event, a ritual service held on Passover, ""with Jewish members of his local community"" in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the party. This video can not be played Jon Lansman told the Today programme ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist"" ""He wrote to the Board of Deputies and Jewish Leadership Council last week to ask for an urgent formal meeting to discuss tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and in society,"" the spokesman added. Jewdas, which describes itself as a ""radical"" and ""alternative"" Jewish collective, is at odds with mainstream Jewish groups over allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour. It has accused the Jewish Board of Deputies, Jewish Leadership Council and Jewish Labour Movement of ""playing a dangerous game"" and previously dismissed anti-Semitism allegations as right-wing smears. Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""If Jeremy Corbyn goes to their event, how can we take his stated commitment to be an ally against anti-Semitism seriously?"" Momentum: Labour failed on anti-Semitism How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded The Jewish Labour Movement said Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas event ""topped off the worst week on record of awful relations between the Labour Party and the Jewish community"". Spokesman Ivor Caplin, a former MP, said: ""When we called on the leader of our party to show moral leadership and take decisive action to stamp out anti-Semitism, this is not what we had in mind."" Leading Corbyn supporter Jon Lansman said the Labour leader's attendance at the event was ""not as significant as it's being made out."" Mr Lansman, founder of Momentum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It was his night off, he had nothing in his official diary, his office didn't know he was there."" Mr Lansman said past comments by Jewdas about Israel were ""certainly not helpful to Jeremy or the cause of opposing anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"". But he said Mr Corbyn was keen to meet the leaders of ""mainstream Jewish organisations"", adding: ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist."" He said accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour could not be dismissed as ""smears"" against Mr Corbyn, and there was a widespread problem of ""unconscious bias"" in the party which needed to addressed by a ""programme of education and training"". In a tweet, Labour MP John Woodcock. a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said meeting the group gave the message that ""extreme views are OK"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Angela Smith said Mr Corbyn's attendance was a ""blatant dismissal"" of the case to tackle anti-Semitism in the party. The chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, Jonathan Goldstein, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had ""no issue"" with Jewdas and its opinions. However, he criticised Mr Corbyn for meeting the group ""in his first act towards the Jewish community""since his organisation had written to the leader regarding anti-Semitism, because Jewdas had called the letter a ""cynical plot"". Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, Karen Pollock, said on Twitter itwas ""mocking and disrespectful"".,external But Ian Saville, a member of the Jewish Voice for Labour group, told the BBC he did not see Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas dinner as an error in judgement or provocative, as some have suggested, adding that it was a ""religious event"". Writing in the Guardian,external, Jewdas said it was ""delighted"" that Mr Corbyn was at the group's Passover Seder along with about 100 others. It said the Labour leader ""was happy to join us"". ""The idea that there is a ""mainstream Jewish community"" is a fiction, promoted by a group of self-selecting individuals and institutions who have run out of ideas,"" the group said. ""No single organisation can speak for us all. To claim that we in Jewdas are somehow not real Jews is offensive, and frankly anti-Semitic.""

Have I Got News For You 'too vicious' for womenMP Nadine Dorries talks about why female politicians turn down Have I Got News For You.,"Nadine Dorries made her appearance on the show in 2012 MP Nadine Dorries says Have I Got News For You is ""too vicious"" for most female guests, and does not ""lend itself to women feeling comfortable"". Ms Dorries appeared on the BBC panel show in 2012 - but said she has turned down all further offers. She was speaking after team captain Ian Hislop said female politicians were ""more reticent"" to be the guest host. Ten male politicians have sat in the host's seat, but Anne Widdecombe is the only female politician to have done so. Ms Dorries told BBC News: ""I just don't think Have I Got News For You is a programme which lends itself to women feeling comfortable. I find it too vicious. ""I know people like that. That's why they love the programme - it's so successful. I just find it too vicious, too abrasive. ""It's all about banter - women don't banter in that way, or very rarely. You might get the odd woman who would, but most women don't banter in that way, don't have that degree of aggression."" The Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire said her agent had turned down all offers from the show after her original appearance, and she wasn't sure whether any of those had been to host. Politicians were normally invited after some controversy, when ""the only reason they're asking you is to shred you"", she added. ""And why would you put yourself up for that? Whereas, men don't seem to mind being shredded most of the time."" Boris Johnson first hosted the show in 2002 The MP, who also appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2012, said she does appear on political programmes where ""the debate is fair and the host is fair and it's not just for someone to score points off you by belittling you"". She said: ""Women don't like that - women see that as a naturally unjust and unfair way to treat someone even for laughs, whereas I think men think that's fair game."" Her comments come after Hislop and fellow team captain Paul Merton told Radio Times magazine the producers had tried to get more female politicians on the show. Malaysians roast MasterChef over chicken recipe UK passports: Firm appeals move to make them in France 'One-stop shops' set to speed up cancer diagnosis Merton said: ""The producers always ask more women than men. More women say no."" He added that ""right from the early days, that's been the case"". Hislop said: ""And everyone you think should have been asked has been. Really, they really have."" Boris Johnson, Ed Balls, Nick Clegg, John Prescott and William Hague are among the male politicians who have filled the host's seat over the years. Left-right: Kirsty Young, Victoria Coren Mitchell and Jo Brand have hosted the show 39 times between them Hislop told Radio Times: ""There was a period when people said, 'Why haven't you had French and Saunders on? Why haven't you had the following people?' ""And you say, 'Well, it's not compulsory.' And on the whole, women are slightly more reticent and think, maybe modestly, 'I can't do that.' Maybe more men in public life say, 'Yes, I can do that.""' Guardian columnist Marina Hyde tweeted that women were not too ""modest"" to go on the show - but they can see ""how women always end up being dealt with"". Allow Twitter content?

Former Deputy Labour Leader Dame Margaret Beckett said she had always turned down requests to appear. ""It's a brilliant programme, it's very, very funny and I watch it when I can,"" she told BBC News. ""Do I wish to be one of its victims? No. ""Being that kind of funny - I don't think it's my skill set. They can be very nice to people, but basically they eat people alive who think they can compete, and I know I can't compete."" Dame Margaret accepted that it may be true that women ""worry whether they could do something and men don't"". ""But on the other hand, not everybody can do everything, and I'm pretty confident that it would be a big mistake for me to say yes and go on that programme."" Conservative MP Anna Soubry tweeted that she had declined to go back on the panel ""not because I'm a woman but because I'm a politician & not daft!"" She added: ""I offered to present it but he turned me down! I'm still available boys.""

Rail chaos in three-month French strike,"This video can not be played Strikers held a protest inside Gare du Nord station in Paris France's rail network has been severely disrupted, as a wave of strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's labour reforms gets under way. The start of the strike has been dubbed ""Black Tuesday"", but the action will spread over three months, affecting two days in every five. Staff at state railway SNCF are leading the strike, but the energy and waste collection sectors are also affected. The unrest presents Mr Macron's biggest challenge since his election last May. The unions say some of the plans to overhaul the heavily indebted SNCF would pave the way for its privatisation. But Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe denied this, saying the proposals aim to change the status quo that was ""no longer tenable"". In parliament, he added: ""If the strikers are to be respected, the millions of French people who want to go to work, because they have no choice, because they want to go to work, must also be respected."" SNCF warned that major disruptions were expected on Wednesday. With the four main rail unions observing the strike, services have been severely curtailed. Some 77% of SNCF drivers were believed to be on strike. The company said 34% of its staff overall were striking. Only one in eight high-speed TGVs is scheduled to run,externalwhile only one in five regional trains is operating. Commuter lines into Paris have also been slashed and bus services have been hugely overcrowded. Some stations were crammed for the few trains available, others were deserted. The website that measures car traffic around the capital,externalrecorded about 420km (260 miles) of jams at rush hour. How this could affect your train journey (in French),external International services are more sketchily affected.Eurostar,externalhas 75% of trains running and the Thalys services to Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are almost normal, but there are no services to Spain, Switzerland or Italy. Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris Employees of Air France, who are demanding a 6% pay rise, are into the fourth day of industrial action. The airline is operating 75% of its flights. Travellers across Europe suffered more disruption as up to 15,000 flights across the continent were facing delays due to a technical problem. Eurocontrol, which runs the EU's air traffic system,said the fault in the system had been identifiedand that moves were under way to return the situation to normal. Unions have also called out all rubbish collectors, to push for the creation of a national collection service and better retirement options. Workers blockaded some waste treatment plants. Energy sector unions have also called strikes to demand, among other things, an end to the liberalisation of the energy markets and a review of deregulation. Thousands of students are also reportedly taking part in the strikes, in opposition to the toughening up of university entry regulations. Analysis by the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris There are three reasons why President Macron feels relatively optimistic about the rail strike. First, unlike in the last massive (and successful) general strike in 1995, this time there can have been no mistaking the government's intention to reform. Neither the public nor SNCF staff can pretend the planned changes come out of the blue. They are clearly part of the broad reform agenda for which Mr Macron was elected. Second, there is far less automatic sympathy for the SNCF than there used to be. The level of rail services has declined sharply, especially for commuters, who are as a result more open to calls for reform. Third, new options have opened up for commuters. There is home-working; car-pooling; expanded coach services. This should make it easier for workers to get round the inconvenience. All that said, these will be tense weeks for the government. Nerves are going to fray. People will get angry. Daily life will not be easy. In these circumstances, plans can go badly awry. A wrong move and public opinion could easily shift back behind the strikers. SNCF workers enjoy generous conditions, including automatic annual pay rises, early retirement, 28 days of paid annual leave and protection from dismissal. Their close relatives are also entitled to free rail tickets. The Macron government wants to phase out the special SNCF contracts, proposing to put new hires on contracts like those that apply elsewhere in industry. Platforms at Gare de Lyon station in Paris got crowded in the morning The aim is to open up the state railways to competition from 2023, in line with EU requirements. SNCF has â¬46.6bn ($57.5bn; Â£40bn) of debt. French unions strike over labour reforms Macron launches overhaul of labour laws Macron's meteoric rise - in-depth analysis The rail unions also feel their action goes beyond rail workers' conditions and marks a major test of union clout. Just over 11% of the French workforce is unionised - one of the lowest levels in the EU - but the unions traditionally punch above their weight, economically and politically. ""We're defending the French public service, not just rail workers,"" said Emmanuel Grondein, head of union Sud Rail. But Gare du Nord was empty Mr Macron's Republic On The Move party also feels the strike has wider connotations. ""We need to rid this country of its strike culture,"" spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Opposition to Mr Macron's agenda was shown on 22 March, whentens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other workers joined rail staff on strike. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says many union members see Mr Macron as the man who wants to break the power of the unions. But strikes in September failed to stop Mr Macron passing laws that make it easier for firms to hire and fire, and the majority of the public are opposed to industrial action this time. The usual mix of support, anger, disappointment, humour and resignation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Source of nerve agent 'not identified 'Porton Down says it cannot verify the precise source of the substance used to poison a Russian ex-spy.3m3 minutes agoUK,"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok The precise source of the nerve agent used to poison a Russian ex-spy and his daughter has not been verified, says the head of Porton Down laboratory. The defence research facility, which identified the substance in Salisbury as Novichok, said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The UK said further intelligence led to its belief that Russia was responsible. Russia's president has said he hopes a line can be drawn when the chemical weapons watchdog meets on Wednesday. Expressing surprise at the ""pace"" of what he described as an ""anti-Russia campaign"", Vladimir Putin added that Russia wants to be part of the investigation and hopes ""a line can be drawn under"" the incident. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. ""We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to [the] government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions,"" Mr Aitkenhead said. ""It is our job to provide the scientific evidence of what this particular nerve agent is - we identified that it is from this particular family and that it is a military grade, but it is not our job to say where it was manufactured."" A UK government spokesperson said that identifying the substance at Porton Down was ""only one part of the intelligence picture"". It maintained Russia was responsible, adding there was ""no other plausible explanation"". Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the nerve agent on 4 March. The BBC understands Miss Skripal, 33, is now conscious and talking. Salisbury District Hospital has said her father, 66, remained critically ill but stable. Mr Aitkenhead said he had been advising those treating the Skripals. ""Unfortunately this is an extremely toxic substance. There is not, as far as we know, any antidote that you can use to negate the effects of it,"" he added. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The man who runs the government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down chose his words carefully today. Speaking strictly as a scientist, Gary Aitkenhead said that his staff had not yet verified that the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals had come from Russia. It was not his scientists' role, he said, to work out the source of the poison, implying that the government had reached the conclusion that Russia was to blame from other sources - notably secret intelligence. His comments come a day before an extraordinary meeting - called by Russia - with the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). ""We hope to discuss the whole matter and call on Britain to provide every possible element of evidence they might have in their hands,"" said the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov. ""Russia is interested in establishing the whole truth of the matter and we hope certainly that this meeting will help to return to at least the realm of normality within the realm of international law and...decency in international relations."" A Foreign Office spokesman called the meeting a ""diversionary tactic, intended to undermine the work of the OPCW in reaching a conclusion"". ""There is no requirement in the chemical weapons convention for the victim of a chemical weapons attack to engage in a joint investigation with the likely perpetrator,"" he added. The Skripals were found on a bench in Salisbury So far 29 nations have expelled diplomats over the poisoning, which the British government holds Russia responsible for. Russia has now told the UK thatmore than 50 of its diplomats have to leavethe country. In a news conference on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested the poisoning could be ""in the interests of the British government"" because of the ""uncomfortable situation"" they had found themselves in with Brexit. ""There could be a whole number of reasons and none of them can be ruled out,""Mr Lavrov said.

Spotify to list $20bn shares in New YorkThe Swedish music streaming business is on track for a new phase of its development.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"Daniel Ek co-founded Swedish streaming company Spotify in 2006 Shares in Spotify have started trading in the New York, valuing the music streaming service at about $26bn. In an unconventional move, the firm has not issued new shares, with those held by its private investors being sold. The flotation marks a turning point for Spotify, which is the global market leader but is yet to make a profit. In anopen letter,external, chief executive Daniel Ek said: ""We are still early in our journey and we have room to learn and grow."" Once an small upstart Swedish music platform, Spotify has grown rapidly in recent years, adding millions of users to its free-to-use ad-funded service and converting many of them to its more lucrative subscription service. It is now the global leader among music streaming companies, boasting 71 million paying customers, twice as many as Apple Music. What Spotify must do to survive How Spotify came to be worth billions So far costs and fees to recording companies for the rights to play their music, have exceeded Spotify's revenues, although that gap is narrowing. The firm made a commitment to investors who backed it as the company was growing, that they would be given the chance to cash in their investment. So Spotify had to list its shares sooner or later. But it could also herald a new phase for the firm. Being publicly traded will put pressure on the management, and could provide the excuse they need to make changes, says Mark Mulligan at at MIDia Research. ""Once you're a tech stock - more than with a normal listed company - [investors] expect you to do stuff fast, change fast,"" he says. ""So far they've been treading a very fine line between being the dramatic new future of the music business but simultaneously being the biggest friend of the old music industry by giving record labels a platform to build out of decline,"" says Mr Mulligan. ""To go to the next phase [Spotify] will have to stop talking out of both sides of its mouth, which it does at the moment. And stop being so friendly to the record companies."" More than half of Spotify's revenue goes directly to the record companies. But they are not likely to make any bold moves immediately, since the labels also control two thirds of the music that Spotify plays. Taylor Swift has released recent videos exclusively on Spotify Chris Hayes at Enders Analysis says while it may not be as a direct result of the share listing, he also expects Spotify to evolve. ""I think over time they're going to have to diversify their offering,"" he says, helping to set them apart from a sea of rival streaming services. They have already moved into podcasts and producing original music. They may well start to offer more original content, such as Taylor Swift's recent video that was only made available on the platform, says Chris Hayes. It could also be thinking about emulating Berlin-based Soundcloud, which offers a social media forum for lower-profile content creators, he adds. Mark Mulligan thinks it could offer documentaries, information about artists, special music features, news articles and even comedy. One of the thorniest issues for Spotify in the past has been a backlash from artists, who say only the biggest stars make enough income from the streaming subscription model. ""At the moment it's all about record labels. Spotify doesn't have a place for artists,"" Mulligan says. ""The bigger bolder things post [the share listing] will be doing something very clear for artists."" He thinks in time Spotify could start offering places for artists to build their own creative spaces and profile pages - so that there are ways to bypass the record labels and go straight to Spotify to reach fans. UK pop star Dua Lipa was one of Spotify's most-streamed artists this year Chris Hayes thinks it will be some time before record labels are sidelined. But he says if Spotify can attract more subscription customers, payments to artists will increase automatically through the current pay-per-listen model. The firm's first operating profit (not including debt financing) is on the horizon for 2019 based on current trends, according to Mr Hayes. ""The strategy has always been, the free tier is not very lucrative but it is a funnel through which to persuade free users to upgrade to the subscription tier, which is lucrative."" As long as subscriptions continue to grow it should eventually become profitable. Mr Mulligan thinks as the business matures it will learn to make money from its loyal customers by offering more services. Above all there is scope to exploit the data gleaned from fans' playlists, and the company could sell its data tools back to the music industry. For example Spotify's insights into people's listening habits could inform an artist planning a route for their next tour. Spotify may be the current market leader, but in the long-term there are threats on the horizon in the shape of the Apple, Amazon, Google and possibly even Facebook. ""Ultimately Spotify's biggest risk is: what is it like to be the only company in a marketplace that  has to turn a profit?"" says Mr Mulligan. The tech giants wield vast resources and have ready-built ecosystems from smart speakers to social networks. ""Spotify's rivals are the biggest companies in the world with bottomless pockets,"" he says, and they are using music as a way to sell their core products, not as a business proposition in itself. They could offer the record labels more money than Spotify can afford to pay. ""That would be my biggest worry if I were Daniel Ek,"" he says, referring to Spotify's co-founder.

Pupils on US trip hit by 'virulent' bug,"Ambulance crews took 48 children and three teachers to hospital Dozens of pupils and three teachers from a British school were rushed to hospital in the US after the outbreak of a ""virulent"" stomach bug. The party from Crookhorn College in Waterlooville, Hampshire, were in Washington DC when ambulances were called to Hotel Harrington on Sunday. One parent told the BBC her daughter showed symptoms after eating at a branch of Planet Hollywood in New York. The restaurant said it did not believe it was the cause of the mass sickness. The group is expected to land in the UK on Wednesday. In total, 48 children and three teachers were treated, with 13 found to be suffering ""gastrointestinal distress"". The rest were treated as a precaution, according to the District of Columbia Fire and EMS. The Department of Health, Washington, DC said it was ""investigating this outbreak of illness"". Parent Susan Crowle said her 16-year-old daughter Nicola was the first pupil to fall ill shortly after the group arrived in New York. Two days later, other students also started to feel poorly, she said. The only meal Nicola had eaten during the trip was at Planet Hollywood on the first day, Ms Crowle said. Nicola had been admitted to hospital with stomach problems, where she spent two nights before being discharged. Ms Crowle said her daughter then tried to ""sleep off"" the illness on the coach trip to Washington, but collapsed when she arrived and was again admitted to hospital as other students started to fall ill. She added that Nicola's condition was improving and she expected to make the flight back to the UK with her fellow pupils. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the school confirmed a ""virulent gastro virus"" had affected ""most"" of those attending the six-night trip, which had started in New York on Wednesday. It said an additional member of staff had flown to Washington DC to provide ""further support to the students"". Two students remained in hospital on Tuesday, the school said. It praised school staff in the US for doing ""the most amazing job at looking after the children"" adding its main priority was ""to ensure that all the students and staff get home safe and well"". Jackie Branson, chair of governors at the school, said all students were expected to be able to fly back to the UK later. She added that Public Health England had been informed. In a statement, Planet Hollywood said: ""As the rest of the group became sick 48 hours after their visit, we can pretty safely assume that it is extremely unlikely that Planet Hollywood was involved.""

UK firm given more time on new passportsThe UK's passport supplier gets a two-week extension to challenge a move to a new maker post-Brexit.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments,"This video can not be played De La Rue boss Martin Sutherland The government has granted a two-week extension in the process to decide who will make UK passports after Brexit. British company De La Rue - which had lost the Â£490m contract to French-Dutch Gemalto in March - had requested the longer ""standstill period"", which has now been agreed by the Home Office. It means a final decision will now be made on Tuesday 17 April. De La Rue is also taking initial steps ""towards initiating appeal proceedings against the provisional decision"". However, it has refused to clarify what this means legally or how any appeal process might proceed. The firm says the time extension will give it more time for close scrutiny of the criteria that the Home Office used in coming to its decision to award the contract to Gemalto. It says it will assess that information and whether it might help it in its arguments. De La Rue's bid was not the cheapest, but it said it was ""the highest quality and technically most secure"". ""We have a preferred bidder, which demonstrated it was best able to meet the needs of the passport service, delivering a high quality and secure product and providing best value for money for the taxpayerâ¦ that remains the government's position,"" said the prime minister's official spokesman. But the extension ""will give all bidders the chance to find out more detail and get more information from the Home Officeâ¦ this is standard process."" The spokesman added: ""This has been a rigorous, fair and open process."" The current EU-themed burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. However, people are expected to keep their current passports until they expire. Brexit: All you need to know Growth 'more important than Brexit' Brexit boost for consumers short-lived, says IFS Before the bidding process extension, a spokesperson for De La Rue had said: ""We can accept that we weren't the cheapest, even if our tender represented a significant discount on the current price. ""It has also been suggested that the winning bid was well below our cost price, which causes us to question how sustainable it is."" This video can not be played Why British passports are changing colours after Brexit â and do Brits welcome the switch? The decision to give a foreign company the contract had been criticisedby pro-Brexit government figures. Under EU procurement rules, the Home Office was required to open up the bidding process to European firms, although De La Rue has manufactured UK passports since 2009. Church sign proclaims 'Chris is Risen' Teens need Saturday jobs says minister April tax changes: Will I be better or worse off? The Home Office had said the proposed Gemalto deal could save the taxpayer Â£100m-Â£120m and that 70 new jobs would be created in the UK, at sites in Fareham, in Hampshire, and Heywood in Lancashire. It comes as a Daily Mail petition calling for the Home Office to give the contract to a British firm reached 273,000 signatures. The Home Office issues more than six million passports annually and is the only provider of passports to British citizens. Passport procurement process not complete.

Pupils on US trip hit by 'virulent' bugForty-eight children and three teachers from a school in Hampshire were taken to hospital in the US.1han hour agoHampshire & Isle of Wight,"Ambulance crews took 48 children and three teachers to hospital Dozens of pupils and three teachers from a British school were rushed to hospital in the US after the outbreak of a ""virulent"" stomach bug. The party from Crookhorn College in Waterlooville, Hampshire, were in Washington DC when ambulances were called to Hotel Harrington on Sunday. One parent told the BBC her daughter showed symptoms after eating at a branch of Planet Hollywood in New York. The restaurant said it did not believe it was the cause of the mass sickness. The group is expected to land in the UK on Wednesday. In total, 48 children and three teachers were treated, with 13 found to be suffering ""gastrointestinal distress"". The rest were treated as a precaution, according to the District of Columbia Fire and EMS. The Department of Health, Washington, DC said it was ""investigating this outbreak of illness"". Parent Susan Crowle said her 16-year-old daughter Nicola was the first pupil to fall ill shortly after the group arrived in New York. Two days later, other students also started to feel poorly, she said. The only meal Nicola had eaten during the trip was at Planet Hollywood on the first day, Ms Crowle said. Nicola had been admitted to hospital with stomach problems, where she spent two nights before being discharged. Ms Crowle said her daughter then tried to ""sleep off"" the illness on the coach trip to Washington, but collapsed when she arrived and was again admitted to hospital as other students started to fall ill. She added that Nicola's condition was improving and she expected to make the flight back to the UK with her fellow pupils. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the school confirmed a ""virulent gastro virus"" had affected ""most"" of those attending the six-night trip, which had started in New York on Wednesday. It said an additional member of staff had flown to Washington DC to provide ""further support to the students"". Two students remained in hospital on Tuesday, the school said. It praised school staff in the US for doing ""the most amazing job at looking after the children"" adding its main priority was ""to ensure that all the students and staff get home safe and well"". Jackie Branson, chair of governors at the school, said all students were expected to be able to fly back to the UK later. She added that Public Health England had been informed. In a statement, Planet Hollywood said: ""As the rest of the group became sick 48 hours after their visit, we can pretty safely assume that it is extremely unlikely that Planet Hollywood was involved.""

Soldier vows to defy Iraqi death inquiry,"A British soldier who has been repeatedly investigated over an Iraqi teenager's death in 2003 says he will refuse to take part in another inquiry. Saeed Shabram's family say he drowned after being forced into a river by UK soldiers. No-one has ever been charged. The Iraq Fatality Investigations team is due to look at the case again. But Maj Robert Campbell told the BBC he and two other soldiers had already been investigated seven times over the death and that proceedings should be dropped. He said he expected to be called as a witness but that he was ""never going to discuss that day again with anybody"". He told Radio 4's Today programme that his mental health was ""not the best"" and that he had not had a good night's sleep for 15 years. He said the case had been thrown out by ""three separate prosecutors"", adding: ""It is perfectly unreasonable for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to expect me to be able to go over these things over and over and over."" Lawyer struck off over misconduct Iraq war allegations probe to end Also speaking on the programme ex-Army chief Lord Richard Dannatt said Maj Campbell had gone through ""a 15-year nightmare"". He said the situation had been brought about by the lack of ""a clear legal framework underpinning the intervention"" in Iraq and the MoD being ""overfearful"" of the International Criminal Court investigating soldiers. He argued that repeated investigations of soldiers long after the event ""offends natural justice"". The Iraq Fatality Investigations (IFI) team said it was not concerned with determining the criminal or civil liability of any personnel involved in the case but rather establishing the facts of the cases and what lessons could be learnt. It also said those who failed to comply with the investigations could be liable to a fine or prison sentence. The IFI was set up after the High Court ruled that investigations conducted by the Iraq Historical Allegations Team (IHAT) should be followed up in the form of an inquest. IHAT had been looking into allegations made against Iraq war veterans but wasshut down after the human rights lawyer Phil Shiner, involved in many of the abuse allegation cases, was struck off for misconduct. The Â£34m probe did not lead to any prosecutions and was branded as an ""unmitigated failure"" by MPs on the House of Commons Defence Committee. Phil Shiner admitted acting recklessly by publicly claiming UK troops unlawfully killed, tortured and mistreated Iraqis A military lawyer has called for an inquiry into the relationship between Mr Shiner and the MoD after it emerged Mr Shiner's firm, Public Interest Lawyers, had been paid Â£2.3m by the government in the three years before it was declared bankrupt. Hilary Meredith said: ""This scandal goes to the very heart of the MoD. Too many questions remain unanswered. ""Why did the MoD feel it had to pay for evidence against its own service personnel?  Who was in charge of this flawed process?  Why did the MoD totally fail to support servicemen and women falsely accused?"" An MoD spokesman said: ""It's right that we hold our armed forces to the highest standards and we have a legal obligation to investigate allegations of wrong doing. ""We deplore false or unfair allegations against our service personnel and when they have been made we've taken action, supplying evidence to have Phil Shiner struck off and closing IHAT.""

"Corbyn has no regrets over Jewish eventMainstream Jewish groups say the Labour leader should not have attended ""radical"" Jewish event.1han hour agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Leaders ""have to listen"", says Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to attend a dinner organised by a left-wing Jewish group following criticism from mainstream Jewish leaders. Asked if he had any regrets about being at the Jewdas event, the Labour leader said: ""Not in the slightest."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups said it cast fresh doubts on Mr Corbyn's commitment to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour. Jewdas has previously suggested anti-Semitism claims were right-wing smears. Speaking on a campaign visit to Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: ""I went to a very interesting and very enjoyable Seder supper and I spent a lot of time talking to young Jewish people about their life in Britain and experiences of anti-Semitism they have had and how they view the future of our country. ""I think that is what political leaders should do - listen to people."" He added: ""Anti-Semitism is a cancer and awful in our society and has to be eradicated wherever it rears its head."" A spokesman for the Labour leader said Mr Corbyn had attended the Seder event, a ritual service held on Passover, ""with Jewish members of his local community"" in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the party. This video can not be played Jon Lansman told the Today programme ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist"" ""He wrote to the Board of Deputies and Jewish Leadership Council last week to ask for an urgent formal meeting to discuss tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and in society,"" the spokesman added. Jewdas, which describes itself as a ""radical"" and ""alternative"" Jewish collective, is at odds with mainstream Jewish groups over allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour. It has accused the Jewish Board of Deputies, Jewish Leadership Council and Jewish Labour Movement of ""playing a dangerous game"" and previously dismissed anti-Semitism allegations as right-wing smears. Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""If Jeremy Corbyn goes to their event, how can we take his stated commitment to be an ally against anti-Semitism seriously?"" Momentum: Labour failed on anti-Semitism How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded The Jewish Labour Movement said Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas event ""topped off the worst week on record of awful relations between the Labour Party and the Jewish community"". Spokesman Ivor Caplin, a former MP, said: ""When we called on the leader of our party to show moral leadership and take decisive action to stamp out anti-Semitism, this is not what we had in mind."" Leading Corbyn supporter Jon Lansman said the Labour leader's attendance at the event was ""not as significant as it's being made out."" Mr Lansman, founder of Momentum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It was his night off, he had nothing in his official diary, his office didn't know he was there."" Mr Lansman said past comments by Jewdas about Israel were ""certainly not helpful to Jeremy or the cause of opposing anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"". But he said Mr Corbyn was keen to meet the leaders of ""mainstream Jewish organisations"", adding: ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist."" He said accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour could not be dismissed as ""smears"" against Mr Corbyn, and there was a widespread problem of ""unconscious bias"" in the party which needed to addressed by a ""programme of education and training"". In a tweet, Labour MP John Woodcock. a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said meeting the group gave the message that ""extreme views are OK"". Allow Twitter content?

The chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, Jonathan Goldstein, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had ""no issue"" with Jewdas and its opinions. However, he criticised Mr Corbyn for meeting the group ""in his first act towards the Jewish community""since his organisation had written to the leader regarding anti-Semitism, because Jewdas had called the letter a ""cynical plot"".

Writing in the Guardian,external, Jewdas said it was ""delighted"" that Mr Corbyn was at the group's Passover Seder along with about 100 others. It said the Labour leader ""was happy to join us"". ""The idea that there is a ""mainstream Jewish community"" is a fiction, promoted by a group of self-selecting individuals and institutions who have run out of ideas,"" the group said.

Skye dinosaur prints 'globally important'Researchers find that the footprints belonged to sauropods and therapods from the Middle Jurassic period.16h16 hours agoHighlands & IslandsComments,"This video can not be played Skye boasts world-class dinosaur prints New light has been shed on a little understood period of dinosaur evolution after giant prehistoric footprints were discovered on the Isle of Skye. Researchers, including some from Edinburgh University, have been analysing dozens of the footprints, left about 170 million years ago. They found that the tracks belonged to sauropods and therapods from the Middle Jurassic period. The discovery has been described as being ""globally important"". Few fossil sites have been found around the world from the Middle Jurassic period. The footprints, left in a muddy, shallow lagoon, are helping the researchers build a more accurate picture of an important period in dinosaur evolution. The Sauropod footprints were left in a muddy, shallow lagoon Most of the prints were made by long-necked sauropods - which stood up to 2m (6.5ft) tall - and by theropods, which were the older cousins of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Researchers measured, photographed and analysed about 50 footprints in a tidal area at Brothers' Point - Rubha nam Brathairean - a headland on Skye's Trotternish peninsula. The footprints were difficult to study owing to tidal conditions, the impact of weathering and changes to the landscape but the scientists identified two trackways in addition to many isolated footprints. Analysis of the clearest prints enabled scientists to ascribe them to sauropods and theropods. The footprints were discovered at Brothers' Point on the Isle of Skye The study, carried out by the University of Edinburgh, Staffin Museum, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published in theScottish Journal of Geology,external. Paige dePolo, who led the study said: ""This tracksite is the second discovery of sauropod footprints on Skye. It was found in rocks that were slightly older than those previously found at Duntulm on the island and demonstrates the presence of sauropods in this part of the world through a longer timescale than previously known. ""This site is a useful building block for us to continue fleshing out a picture of what dinosaurs were like on Skye in the Middle Jurassic."" Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led the field team, said: ""The more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur footprints we find. ""This new site records two different types of dinosaurs-long-necked cousins of Brontosaurus and sharp-toothed cousins of T-Rex-hanging around a shallow lagoon, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march to global dominance.""

Murdoch proposes Sky News sale to Disney,"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has said it would sell off Sky News to Disney or ring-fence it to try to allay regulatory concerns over its proposed acquisition of Sky. Fox wants to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. But it faces regulatory problems after the Competition and Markets Authority found the Â£11.7bn deal was not in the public interest. Fox had already pledged to ensure the independence of Sky News. The Murdoch family's news outlets are currently consumed by nearly a third of the UK's population across TV, radio, online and newspapers. The Murdoch Family Trust controls News Corporation, which publishes newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. Sky was the top gainer on the FTSE 100 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with shares up about 2%. Under the proposed new deal, the news channel would become a distinct company within Sky, run by the head of Sky News. Funding for Sky News would also be guaranteed for 15 years. Previously, Fox had said it would be funded for 10 years. The executive chairmen of Sky, Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, and the chief executive, Chase Carey, would not try to influence editorial decisions made by the head of Sky News, according to a statement by 21st Century Fox. The company had already proposed remedies to the CMA's concerns, includinghaving an independent board for Sky News. However, critics of that proposal, including politicians such as Ed Miliband, Vince Cable and Kenneth Clarke, had said that the head of Sky News would still be appointed by the head of 21st Century Fox and so could be influenced by the Murdochs. Fox hit back at those politicians on Tuesday, saying their assertions were ""unsupported and fanciful"". Fox also proposed selling off Sky News to Disney, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox goes through. Disney's proposed takeover of 21st Century Fox, which has yet to be approved by regulators, includes Fox's current 39% stake in Sky. Even if that takeover gets knocked back, Sky News would still be sold off under the new proposal. Disney chief executive Bob Iger is keen on Sky and has said he is ""committed"" to Sky News, which is loss-making. US media giant Comcasthas also thrown its hat into the ring for Skywith a Â£22.1bn bid in February. Comcast has a broadband division serving 29 million US customers. It also owns NBC and Universal Pictures and wants to buy a majority stake in Sky. Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor This is great news for Sky shareholders. If Sky News is sold to Disney or legally separated from the rest of Sky, then the thorny issue of Murdoch control over Sky News - to add to the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times - is finally laid to rest. What we will then have is a straight shoot out between 21st Century Fox and US rival Comcast to acquire Sky. A proper auction between those two bidders will mean a higher price for Sky. Currently Fox is offering Â£10.75 per share and Comcast has indicated it would be prepared to bid Â£12.50. Directors at Sky are pretty confident that Fox will have to come in with a better offer. At that point, we will see how serious Comcast really is in its bid to derail Rupert Murdoch's carefully laid plans to sell Fox to Disney and effectively dismantle a media empire it has taken a lifetime to build.

Apple Watch provides murder case clues,"Smartwatches can track movement and heart rate Police in Australia have presented data gathered from an Apple Watch as evidence in a murder trial. Grandmother Myrna Nilsson was wearing the device when she was killed in 2016. Her daughter-in-law Caroline Nilsson is accused of staging an ambush, after claiming she was tied up by a group of men who entered the house. But data from the victim's smartwatch suggests that she was ambushed as she arrived home, and died hours earlier than Ms Nilsson claims. Ms Nilsson told police that her mother-in-law had been followed home by a group of men in a car. According toABC News,external, Ms Nilsson said her mother-in-law had argued with the men outside the house for about 20 minutes, but she did not hear the fatal attack because she was in the kitchen with the door closed. A neighbour called the police when Ms Nilsson emerged from the house gagged and distressed after 22:00. Ms Nilsson says the attackers had tied her up and that she had made her way out of the house as soon as they had left. But prosecutor Carmen Matteo said evidence from the victim's smartwatch suggested Ms Nilsson had staged the home invasion. The body of 57-year-old Myrna Nilsson was found in the laundry room of her home in Valley View, Adelaide, in September 2016. ""The evidence from the Apple Watch is a foundational piece of evidence for demonstrating the falsity of the defendant's account to police,"" said Ms Matteo. ""A watch of this typeâ¦ contains sensors capable of tracking the movement and rate of movement of the person wearing it... it also measures the heart rate."" The prosecution alleged that the watch had recorded data consistent with a person going into shock and losing consciousness. ""The deceased must have been attacked at around 6:38pm and had certainly died by 6:45pm,"" she said. ""If that evidence is accepted, it tends to contradict the accused's version of an argument occurring between the deceased and these men outside the laundry for a period of up to 20 minutes. ""Her emergence from the house was well after 10:00pm and if the Apple Watch evidence is accepted, that is over three hours after the attack on the deceased.""

Skye dinosaur prints 'globally important',"This video can not be played Skye boasts world-class dinosaur prints New light has been shed on a little understood period of dinosaur evolution after giant prehistoric footprints were discovered on the Isle of Skye. Researchers, including some from Edinburgh University, have been analysing dozens of the footprints, left about 170 million years ago. They found that the tracks belonged to sauropods and therapods from the Middle Jurassic period. The discovery has been described as being ""globally important"". Few fossil sites have been found around the world from the Middle Jurassic period. The footprints, left in a muddy, shallow lagoon, are helping the researchers build a more accurate picture of an important period in dinosaur evolution. The Sauropod footprints were left in a muddy, shallow lagoon Most of the prints were made by long-necked sauropods - which stood up to 2m (6.5ft) tall - and by theropods, which were the older cousins of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Researchers measured, photographed and analysed about 50 footprints in a tidal area at Brothers' Point - Rubha nam Brathairean - a headland on Skye's Trotternish peninsula. The footprints were difficult to study owing to tidal conditions, the impact of weathering and changes to the landscape but the scientists identified two trackways in addition to many isolated footprints. Analysis of the clearest prints enabled scientists to ascribe them to sauropods and theropods. The footprints were discovered at Brothers' Point on the Isle of Skye The study, carried out by the University of Edinburgh, Staffin Museum, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published in theScottish Journal of Geology,external. Paige dePolo, who led the study said: ""This tracksite is the second discovery of sauropod footprints on Skye. It was found in rocks that were slightly older than those previously found at Duntulm on the island and demonstrates the presence of sauropods in this part of the world through a longer timescale than previously known. ""This site is a useful building block for us to continue fleshing out a picture of what dinosaurs were like on Skye in the Middle Jurassic."" Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led the field team, said: ""The more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur footprints we find. ""This new site records two different types of dinosaurs-long-necked cousins of Brontosaurus and sharp-toothed cousins of T-Rex-hanging around a shallow lagoon, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march to global dominance.""

French mayor sorry for Ikea April Fool,"A French mayor has apologised after her April Fool's joke about Swedish furniture giant Ikea coming to town with 4,000 new jobs hit a sour note. Caroline Cayeux used Facebook and Twitter to announce the arrival of a new superstore to Beauvais residents, many of whom believed her ""great news"". Locals were not amused when the mayor, hours later, clarified that the news about job opportunities was not true. Ms Cayeux regretted the ""not very wise"" joke, which social media amplified. 10 stories that look like April Fool's but aren't Parents fool children with Easter 'treats' BBC Breakfast falls for April Fool's joke The mayor told French media she was sorry that ""the sense of humour was not shared by everyone"", adding that a new commercial development outside the northern town (population 54,000) would indeed bring 4,000 jobs in the future. She wrote on her Facebook page that the message had been intended to ""attract the attention of potential investors, including Ikea"" and insisted she had ""too much respect"" for jobseekers to mock those out of work. But her apology was too late for many. Opposition councillor Mehdi Rahoui told French radio station RTL that the joke ""once again shows the mayor's disdain for the people of Beauvais"" and said that Ms Cayeux should concentrate on lowering the town's high unemployment rate. Social media users were also unforgiving, with one Twitter user saying: ""We will all vote for you in the next election... April Fool's."" BBC Breakfast falls for April Fools joke.

Labour mayoral candidate can remain MP,"The 45-year-old ex-soldier was elected as Labour candidate for the Sheffield City Region mayoral election Dan Jarvis has been told he will be able to remain an MP if he is elected as Sheffield City Region mayor. Labour's National Executive Committee ruled last week that no-one could serve in two elected roles. A Labour source revealed both parties had now agreed the Barnsley Central MP would be able to remain in parliament. Mr Jarvis said: ""I am honoured to be Labour's candidate for the Sheffield City Region mayoral election and I am looking forward to the campaign."" More stories from Yorkshire Following Labour's National Executive Committee ruling, party general secretary Iain McNicol and incoming general secretary Jennie Formby outlined its position in a letter to Mr Jarvis. He wastold he must stand down from parliament if elected mayor. The Yorkshire and Humber Parliamentary Labour Group, with 36 MPs, had backed Mr Jarvis, saying he was selected in the ""full knowledge"" he would do both jobs. Mr Jarvis is the favourite to win the May 3 contest as all 14 South Yorkshire constituencies taking part in the election were won by Labour at the last general election. The elected role will cover Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils. Anybody registered to vote in these areas will be eligible to vote for the new mayor. In the end, Labour couldn't really do anything else. They had to endorse Dan Jarvis as their candidate and concede that this is an exceptional election. Had they enforced their one elected role rule - they would have had a host of local MPs exercising their thumbs in a series of terse, ticked off tweets. That wouldn't do just before an election. So Dan Jarvis can do both jobs. That hasn't gone down well with everyone, but it's how he pitched for the job in the first place. Official nominations come out on Friday so we'll know exactly where we stand. But the choice for voters isn't just on party lines, it's also about what sort of devolution should happen in the future. Stick with just money and power for South Yorkshire? Or twist and try and widen that deal to the whole of Yorkshire? The four-year mayoral post has been controversial because, unlike similar roles in Manchester and the West Midlands, no devolution and funding deal has yet been agreed. The full list of candidates for the election is to be revealed on Friday afternoon after nominations have closed, said the Sheffield City Region.

Grindr defends HIV-related data sharing,"The gay dating app has almost four million members around the world Gay dating app Grindr has defended itself after an outcry over how it shared data with two external companies. On Monday it emerged the app had, among other things, provided information on HIV status, including date last tested. Grindr said the data was shared in line with standard industry practices,external, and that it felt the app had been unfairly singled out. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it was investigating. In a statement, it said it was working to ""establish the scale of any impact on UK users"". Grindr said the information was not shared with any advertisers. The companies that did get the data - Apptimize and Localytics - are paid to monitor how users interact with the software to see what could be improved. The most sensitive information was encrypted, Grindr said - though a Norwegian campaign group said the sharing of other unencrypted data amounted to a potential privacy intrusion. ""The HIV status is linked to all the other information. Thatâs the main issue,â said Antoine Pultier from the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research,in an interview with BuzzFeed,external. âI think this is the incompetence of some developers that just send everything, including HIV status.â However Grindrâs security boss Bryce Caselater told US news site Axios,externalthat data sharing with third-party companies with the goal of improving the app, rather than selling data, was commonplace. ""I understand the news cycle right now is very focused on these issues,â Mr Case said. ""I think whatâs happened to Grindr is, unfairly, weâve been singled out."" The BBC understands the Grindr had already stopped sharing information with Apptimize, and was in the process of winding down its work with Localytics. Users on Grindr are given the option to share their HIV status along with the time they were last tested - an option backed, the company said, by LGBTQ groups and international health organisations. The information is made available to potential suitors in the app. It is also used to power other features,such as reminders to be tested, and where to go,external. ""It is up to each user to determine what, if anything, to share about themselves in their profile,"" Grindr said in a statement. It added: ""Grindr has never, nor will we ever sell personally identifiable user information - especially information regarding HIV status or last test date - to third parties or advertisers.""

When cops become robbers," Parts of this story are reconstructed from trial testimony, evidence and publicly available records. It contains strong language throughout. Four vehicles fly down a darkened, rain-soaked street. It’s summertime, nearly midnight in downtown Baltimore. The lead car, a white Chevrolet, is driven by a 34-year-old man, his foot pressed to the pedal. On his tail are three unmarked police cars driven by members of the Gun Trace Task Force, a plainclothes gun recovery unit. The chase started after the Chevrolet ran a red light. Pursuing the vehicle would be a violation of Baltimore Police Department policy, but the detectives suspect the man in the Chevy has guns, drugs, cash or all three. “Might be able to get somethin’ dirty,” detective Daniel Hersl says excitedly. “Light him up,” detective Jemell Rayam responds. The pursuit proceeds to the sounds of revving engines and heavy rain pelting the windows - there are no sirens. The Chevrolet blows through another red light. He almost makes it across the intersection when a Hyundai Sonata going through the green collides with the driver’s side of the Chevy, launching both cars up on to the pavement. The Chevy crumples into a motionless wreck. “Shit!” exclaims detective Momodu Gondo from behind the wheel. “Damn.” “Keep going,” responds his partner, Rayam. “I don’t know.” “Shit!” “I don’t know,” repeats Rayam. “I don’t know.” Without stopping, the detectives radio back and forth between their cars. “We ain’t look too crazy, did we?” asks Gondo. “They got cameras all up and down that shit.” “I can get on the air and say I just got a report of an accident,” says Rayam. “No, Wayne said - I wouldn’t say nothin’ yet,” responds Hersl. Several blocks away, two of the three police vehicles pull to the side of the road and the officers confer. Gondo thinks he only had his lights on at the very beginning of the chase - maybe no one noticed them. “That’s the thing with Wayne. He’s a little too much with this shit,” says Hersl. “These car chases. This is what happens.” Eventually it strikes the officers that they never called for aid. “How about we just go on scene and just act like, ‘Oh, is everything OK?’” asks Rayam. “That dude unconscious, he ain’t sayin’ shit,” responds detective Marcus Taylor. Listen to the Gun Trace Task Force before and after the car crash 
        (WARNING - contains strong language) Over half an hour after the crash, they’ve still done nothing. Hersl suggests they change their time cards to make it appear they stopped work hours earlier. Wayne Jenkins, the unit’s leader, stops to scope out the accident, but also does nothing to help. “I wonder what was in that car,” says Hersl. “I don’t care,” Jenkins snaps. “Go back to HQ.” A year and a half later, in a federal courthouse in downtown Baltimore, a prosecutor switches off the audio recording from that night, captured on a FBI listening device hidden in Gondo’s police vehicle. On the witness stand sits Rayam, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a smooth pate. Instead of his police uniform, he wears bright orange prison garb. Facing him from the defendants’ table are two of his former colleagues, Daniel Hersl and Marcus Taylor. “None of us stopped to render aid or see if anyone was hurt,” Rayam tells the courtroom in a faltering voice. “We were foolish, I don’t know, we just didn’t… we just didn’t stop.” In the case of United States versus Daniel Hersl and Marcus Taylor, the car accident is the least of the men’s legal worries. They are facing multiple counts of extortion, racketeering and fraud for their part in what prosecutors call a “perfect storm” of police officers gone rogue. Rayam, Gondo, Jenkins, as well as two other officers from the Gun Trace Task Force have already pleaded guilty. When the prosecutor finishes his questions, Rayam seems to completely fall apart. He shields his eyes from the jury. In an already exceptionally dramatic trial, it is a disorientating moment. As Rayam - a once-respected police detective, a college-educated father with a nice house in the suburbs - sobs silently on the witness stand, it is impossible not to wonder... What happened to these police officers? On the day of Aaron Anderson’s arrest, Detective David McDougall of the Harford County Sheriff’s Department rose around dawn and crept out of his house in rural Maryland before his family awoke. He drove south to meet his team in the rear car park of a Red Roof motel perched on a busy intersection in the suburbs of Baltimore. McDougall pulled on a tactical vest, preparing for just “another day at the office”. But nothing about the arrest of Anderson went as expected. As a part of his work on the county’s narcotics task force, McDougall had been watching the 27-year-old suspected heroin dealer for weeks. David McDougall He’d sat outside Anderson’s drab apartment complex in northwest Baltimore as he came and went. He'd also placed a GPS tracking device on the undercarriage of Anderson's Jeep Cherokee. He’d observed surprisingly open drug sales at a strip mall, where Anderson was trailed by a small group of young men palming tiny plastic packets into the hands of drivers streaming in and out of the car park in full view of McDougall and his camera lens. The very fact the arrest team was gathered at a motel that morning was the first surprise. Days earlier, they were ready to arrest Anderson at his apartment when he stopped going home. The GPS tracker on the Jeep was going to the Red Roof instead. They snapped photos of Anderson and his girlfriend as they stood on the balcony talking on their phones. When it became clear the pair were not checking out anytime soon, McDougall rewrote his warrants for the motel. On the morning of 19 October 2015, he and his team sat in the car park waiting for the door to room 207 to crack open. Anderson was the first in a series of dominoes McDougall hoped to topple. A major narcotics investigation concluded there were two Baltimore-based drug dealers supplying the bulk of the far more rural Harford County’s heroin: Anderson and a rival dealer named Antonio “Brill” Shropshire. The two men had distinguished themselves in the eyes of law enforcement by peddling a particularly lethal product. In the last year, overdoses had skyrocketed in Harford County and McDougall believed as much as 80% were caused by heroin supplied by Anderson or Shropshire’s organisations. The deaths went as far back as 2011. 19-year-old Alyssa died of a heroin overdose in Harford County in 2011 And something had always bothered McDougall about the way the men operated, the openness of the drug dealing he had witnessed after weeks of surveillance. He likened it to a “fog” around the investigation. “It’s right out in front of us and nothing's being done,” he recalls. “I'm like, ‘There's something wrong here.’” Anderson finally emerged from the room a little after 11am. As he and his girlfriend walked towards the Jeep, McDougall and his men surrounded them. With the pair in handcuffs, McDougall radioed to a second team positioned outside Anderson’s apartment, and confirmed that it was safe to go inside. As the secondary team searched the apartment, McDougall sat Anderson in the back of a squad car and asked what he was doing at the Red Roof motel in the first place. “He’s like, ‘Two guys kicked in my door while my girl was home, stole stuff from me, they had handguns, I didn’t feel safe,’” recalls McDougall. “As he tells me that I get a phone call.” It was the team at Anderson’s apartment - it was trashed. There was a boot print on the front door, the lock shattered. Drawers were pulled out of dressers. There were no drugs, just some digital scales and roughly 10 different mobile phones. Someone had beaten the officers there. Anderson’s girlfriend told McDougall that two weeks earlier, a man with a hoodie pulled tight around his face ran into her bedroom, pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her. He took jewellery, $10,000 in cash, a Rolex watch and a gun from their dresser. The second masked man headed for the kitchen. Anderson eventually revealed that 800g of heroin was stolen that day. Rather than call the police, the pair fled to the motel. The same strange fog crept over McDougall. Something about the description of the way the apartment was tossed seemed oddly familiar. The arrest team was wrapping up loose ends when one of the officers called out to McDougall. He was underneath Anderson’s Jeep, pulling off the magnetic GPS tracker McDougall had placed there weeks earlier. “Hey Dave,” the detective said. “Do you have two on here? There’s another one.” About eight inches away from McDougall’s GPS tracker was a second device. He was stunned. McDougall knew for a fact no other law enforcement agency was investigating Anderson. In order to avoid stepping on one another’s toes, agencies enter the names and personal information of their investigative targets into what’s called a “deconfliction database”. It’s a tool that allows local and federal agencies to see what investigations are already under way. McDougall had listed Anderson in deconfliction databases from “here to California” and nothing popped up. “Right away it was kind of like, ‘Whoa, what's going on here?’” says McDougall. “Whose tracker is this?” As soon as he returned to headquarters, McDougall wrote a subpoena for the company that manufactured the mystery tracker, asking them to identify the owner. Within days he had a name: John Clewell. A driver’s licence photo showed a bald, moustached man in his 30s. When McDougall put the name into the Maryland court database to look for a criminal history, dozens of cases came up. But it didn’t list Clewell as the defendant. Rather, it showed Clewell as a witness for the government. He was a cop. A detective with the Baltimore Police Department’s Gun Trace Task Force. McDougall formed a rough theory about what had happened - a Baltimore police officer, using the tracker, waited until Anderson’s vehicle was far away from his home, then used the opportunity to rob the apartment. The home invasion had some of the hallmarks of a police raid - the kicked-in door, the methodically tossed apartment. McDougall picked up the phone and called the FBI. “I thought it was limited to maybe one or two guys,” he says. “That was going to be the end of the story.” McDougall had no idea that what he had uncovered would lead to the arrest and indictment of eight police officers, nor that it would implicate at least a dozen more and point to a mole within the local prosecutor's office. He had no inkling that it would unravel hundreds, and potentially thousands of criminal investigations, and free men from prison who’d sworn from the very beginning that they were framed, robbed, or both. It would one day explain the murder of a young father in front of his family, and raise endless questions about the death of a homicide detective, shot dead the day before he was supposed to testify against the rogue officers. In the autumn of 2015, all of that was still to come. Here’s what the public was led to believe about the Gun Trace Task Force, before the FBI arrested almost every member of the squad: That in a city still reeling from the civil unrest that followed the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in police custody, the GTTF was a bright spot in a department under a dark cloud. The 25-year-old African-American man’s death after a ride in a police transport ignited a build up of decades of tension between Baltimore's black residents and the police, touching off days of demonstrations, including looting and violence. That while the homicide rate was on a historic rise, this elite, eight-officer team was getting guns off the streets at an astonishing rate - their supervising lieutenant praised “a work ethic that is beyond reproach” that resulted in 110 arrests and 132 guns confiscated in a 10-month period. That the GTTF’s leader, a former Marine and amateur MMA fighter named Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, was a hero who’d plunged into a violent crowd during the unrest to rescue injured officers, an act of bravery that earned him a departmental Bronze Star. But when the sun came up on 1 March 2017, the city awoke to a vastly different reality. Seven officers were arrested and indicted for racketeering, extortion and fraud: Sergeant Jenkins; Detective Daniel Hersl, a 17-year veteran of the force; longtime partners Detectives Momodu Gondo and Jemell Rayam; and Detectives Maurice Ward, Evodio Hendrix and Marcus Taylor. Only one member - oddly enough, John Clewell, the man whose name triggered the entire investigation - escaped indictment. The FBI found he was never a part of the criminal enterprise. “They were involved in a pernicious conspiracy scheme that included abuse of power,” the US Attorney for Maryland told reporters that day. Police commissioner Kevin Davis, who’d once praised the men’s work, now likened them to 1930s-style gangsters. “It’s disgusting,” he said. The public soon learned that the GTTF stole from drug dealers, but also from a homeless man, a car salesman, a construction worker and many others. The victims were overwhelmingly African-American. Evodio Hendrix, Daniel Hersl, Jemell Rayam That they received hundreds of hours of overtime, when they were actually at the bar or on the beach, from a city that struggles to keep the heat working in its schools. Maurice Ward, Marcus Taylor, Momodu Gondo That during the unrest, Jenkins was stealing garbage bags of opiates from pharmacies, and that he also stole and re-sold heroin, Ecstasy, crack and cocaine. That he planted drugs on innocent people, and was slowly building up the courage and the arsenal to commit fully-fledged burglaries. Wayne Jenkins “They owned the city,” shrugged one witness who admitted to acting as the fence for Jenkins’ stolen goods. “It was a front for a criminal enterprise.” The revelations crescendoed in an explosive three-week trial in federal court which drew back the curtain on a phenomenon extensively explored by Hollywood but rarely witnessed in real life: the inner workings of a police unit gone rogue, and the path of human destruction left behind it. In a city just coming off the highest murder rate in its recorded history, some residents wonder how much of that violence can be attributed to a citizenry that felt abandoned by its police force. “Their behaviour had to have contributed to the uptick in violence, there’s no way it didn’t,” says one retired BPD detective. “The police department thinks they can kind of push right past it.” Even after the arrests, victims of the GTTF say they don’t believe that they are safe, and that there are members of the Baltimore Police Department who have yet to be exposed. “I was a black man with a past history,” one victim said. “That’s why I’m so bitter and angry about this… Y’all put so many people away for things I know they didn’t do."" On a hot July afternoon in 2016, detective Momodu Gondo dialled his new boss’s mobile from the front seat of an unmarked police sedan. Sitting silently behind him was a professorial man with a trim beard and glasses, his hands cuffed behind him. “What’s up, G?” Sergeant Wayne Jenkins answered. “We got the package,” Gondo said. “Is he in the car with you?” Jenkins asked. “Did you tell him anything at all?” “No.” “Alright,” Jenkins said. “When I get there… introduce me as the US attorney.” “I got you.” Listen to Jenkins and Gondo planning during Ronald Hamilton's arrest A short while earlier, Gondo, Rayam and Hersl had been following Ronald Hamilton and his wife up and down the aisles of a Home Depot as the couple shopped for window blinds. When the Hamiltons left the car park in their pick-up truck, the detectives followed in three separate, unmarked police vehicles. Rayam hit the lights and sirens, and Hamilton pulled to the side of the road. The GTTF had had their eyes on the Hamiltons for some time. An informant told Rayam that Hamilton was a high-level drug dealer. After only two years out of federal prison on a previous drugs conviction, Hamilton moved his family into a resplendent, seven-bedroom house on a winding dead-end street in the Baltimore suburbs, complete with a manicured lawn and a swimming pool. If they raided the place, the informant said, they’d find it stuffed with guns, drugs and cash. The officers drove the Hamiltons to a dilapidated building behind the Baltimore police academy, nicknamed “The Barn”. Inside, they grilled the couple about Hamilton’s supposed drug dealing, while he insisted that the only things he sold were used cars. When Jenkins arrived, he told Hamilton he observed him on three separate occasions making drug deals. Hamilton said it was a lie. But he did tell them he had cash in his home. Though they had no evidence the Hamiltons had done anything illegal, Rayam stuffed the couple back into a car and led Gondo, Jenkins and Hersl on a high-speed convoy towards the mansion in the suburbs. As Rayam sped through the streets, Hamilton whispered to his wife. “Just don’t say nothing,” he said. “They trying to rob me.” It had only been a month since Jenkins became the new head of the Gun Trace Task Force. Detective Gondo had been on the GTTF since 2010 and knew plenty about Jenkins - that he was “protected”, somebody who had “pull” from on high. He knew less about some of the other detectives Jenkins brought over from his former Special Enforcement Section unit - Ward, Hendrix and Taylor, and from the eastern district, Hersl. But Gondo said Jenkins made it perfectly clear to him who his new team members were. “If money is taken, they’ll be with it,” Gondo remembered Jenkins telling him. “They’ll keep their mouth shut.” For Gondo, that meant business as usual. Gondo grew up in a rough part of north-east Baltimore, and though he joined the police academy in 2005, he did not sever ties to Glen Kyle Wells, a lifelong friend and heroin dealer. They spent lavishly on nights out, ordering bottle service at local clubs. Gondo also formed a friendship with Wells’ heroin connection, Antonio Shropshire. Gondo didn’t hide his relationship with Wells from other officers and regarded Wells as a brother. “We through thick and thin, man,” Gondo told Wells at one point. “It’s always going to be like that.” When Wells came to Gondo and told him that some of his business associates wanted to rob and murder a rival dealer named Aaron Anderson, it was Gondo who proposed that he and Rayam assist, and use the GPS trackers to avoid a violent confrontation. They borrowed the tracker from Clewell, and it was Gondo who sat outside as the lookout, listening to a police scanner while Rayam and Wells pulled on masks and ransacked the apartment. They split the heroin and the $10,000, and Gondo gave the gun to Wells. When Wells felt he was being tailed by police, Gondo gave him precise details about the location of other officers in the area. When Shropshire found a GPS tracker underneath his car, he called Gondo for help. So naturally, Gondo was furious when Wells showed Gondo text messages he was receiving from a mysterious number, asking to buy drugs. Gondo looked at the awkward use of slang and was certain it was his new boss, Wayne Jenkins, trying to set Wells up. “That’s my friend,” Gondo fumed privately. “There’s plenty of other people out here you can target.” Before Jenkins crossed that line, Gondo enjoyed the copious overtime and short working hours. Instead of putting together complicated investigations and targeted raids, Jenkins preferred “door pops” - speeding towards large groups of young black men on street corners and throwing open the doors. Whoever ran got chased, arrested and, occasionally, robbed. They could do as many as 50 door pops in a single night and as soon as they found a gun, they went home. Bodycam footage of a GTTF arrest Jenkins didn’t care if his men built trust or big cases - as long as they were making gun arrests, they worked a few hours a day, sometimes less, and got paid for far more. When the detectives arrived at the Hamiltons’ home on that July evening, Gondo, Rayam, Jenkins and Hersl went inside for what the squad called a “sneak and peek” - an improper, warrantless search of a home to see what was inside. In the bedroom, they found $50,000 cash in a heat-sealed plastic bag. Gondo went into a closet and found another bag containing $20,000. Later, accounts varied on who actually decided to take it - Rayam said it was Jenkins, Gondo said it was Rayam. Typically, Gondo didn’t like to steal money if there was no other evidence discovered in the house. His logic went that a drug dealer is unlikely to complain about missing drugs and money if it only made his operation look bigger. But the Hamiltons’ house was clean. Ultimately he decided that didn't matter. “Give it back to me so I can take one stack out of there,"" Gondo said. The men went back outside and waited for the state police to give the veneer of a legitimate law enforcement operation. But after hours of combing the home and questioning the Hamiltons, the officers came up empty. The state police took possession of the $50,000 in the heat-sealed bag, but there was no reason to charge the Hamiltons with any crime. Rayam unhandcuffed them, handed them a business card and headed for the door. As Gondo was getting back into his car, he saw Ronald Hamilton run back out of the house, a distraught expression on his face. “You robbed me,” Hamilton called after the officers as they drove away. Over celebratory drinks afterwards, Gondo confronted Jenkins about the text messages on his friend Wells’ behalf. Jenkins agreed to back off. They drank together, and Jenkins advised his men not to “get greedy”. It’s hard to find another word to describe the summer that followed. Next came the high-speed pursuit of Dennis Armstrong, who sent snowballs of cocaine sailing out of his van windows as he fled the GTTF. When they finally stopped him, the officers found $8,000 in a glove box. Only $2,800 made it back to the police station as evidence. A month after that, the GTTF stopped a wiry homeless man named Sergio Summerville as he was leaving a storage locker where he kept all his belongings. The officers pilfered $2,000 from the sock where Summerville stashed his money from drug sales without bothering to arrest him. In a seemingly unrelated incident in July, a 31-year-old man named Davon Robinson was shot multiple times in front of his horrified girlfriend and their young daughter. The shooter jumped into a waiting vehicle and disappeared. Robinson was declared dead at the scene. At the time, the death generated scant media attention - just another murder at the height of a bloody summer in Baltimore. As autumn drew closer, something started bothering Gondo. There was the night that he could have sworn a car near his home was watching him. Next came the rumours. Something about a federal investigation. Something about a wiretap. Eventually he confided in Rayam as they sat together in Gondo’s police car. By the end of the conversation, they’d both decided there was nothing to worry about. “What case?” Gondo muttered loud enough that an FBI listening device planted in the car picked it up. “It’s no Pablo Escobar. It’s police.” As the video begins, the mobile phone camera shakes and shadowy figures hover around the frame. A gloomy basement with a concrete floor comes into focus, children’s bicycles piled on top of one another, a washer and dryer pushed against a wall. In the middle of the floor lies a battered safe. Two men’s figures stand over it, one with a pry bar wedged under the lock, the second with a ram. “Hey Sarge!” one of the men calls. “Come downstairs right quick. They about to get it open.” Within seconds, the lock on the safe cracks. It’s dark inside and the camera loses focus. When a torch snaps on, it reveals that the safe is filled with bundle after rubber-banded bundle of cash. “Oh shit,” one of the men says. “Stop right now,” snaps a third voice, swearing. “Nobody touch it.” The video was intended to document the successful investigative handiwork of Jenkins, Ward, Hendrix and Taylor. It was, in fact, an encore performance. The video didn’t show the first time they broke open the safe, or that when they did, it was twice as full. It didn’t capture Jenkins strolling up the basement stairs and out of the home carrying two kilos of cocaine and a bag filled with cash. When he came back down, the officers re-closed the safe door, and re-enacted the moment of discovery with Taylor’s phone recording. “We’re calling the feds,” Jenkins proclaims for the camera. “No one's touching this money.” The basement belonged to Oreese Stevenson, a man with a long criminal history dating back to the mid-1990s. But ensnaring Stevenson was pure dumb luck, according to Ward. Jenkins had been using one of his favourite tactics - stopping any man over the age of 18 wearing a backpack. When Jenkins, Ward, Hendrix and Taylor saw a man with a backpack climb inside Stevenson’s van, Jenkins pulled up the one-way street where Stevenson was parked the wrong way, and the officers jumped out. The backpack was stuffed with cash, and an old oatmeal box in the backseat contained a half-kilo of cocaine. According to Ward, Jenkins became “obsessed” with Stevenson after his arrest, and listened to Stevenson’s jail calls to his wife. As they talked, the couple realised what had happened, that $100,000 had gone missing from the safe, that their watches had disappeared.  Stevenson was livid. He told his wife to find him a good lawyer. After hearing this, Ward said Jenkins decided to write a letter in neat handwriting from an imaginary, pregnant mistress to drive a wedge between the couple. The officers drove to Stevenson’s house and dropped it inside the door. It didn’t work. The Stevensons hired Ivan Bates, a defence lawyer who knew the sergeant well. “It had gotten to the point with Sergeant Jenkins and that crew, the constitution didn’t even apply,” says Bates. “They were just going to grab you.” Bates declared his intention to run for Baltimore City State’s Attorney several months after the officers were indicted, and has placed the case at the centre of his campaign against the incumbent, Marilyn Mosby. But he says his history with Jenkins far predates a desire for the office. In 2010, he took the case of a distraught young couple charged with slew of gun and narcotics possession offences. The officer who made the arrest, Jenkins, made an odd omission in his probable cause statement, which he submitted for a warrant at 4:30am. According to the wife, Jenkins tried to barge into the house hours earlier, without a warrant, prompting her to press a silent alarm on her keychain. When Bates showed the prosecutor the report from the alarm company, which torpedoed Jenkins’ timeline of events, he says the state dropped the case (the case predates Mosby’s administration and her office did not comment on the outcome). To Bates, the case was a huge red flag. “It was such a brazen lie,” he says. “If they lied about this, what else have they lied about?” Ivan Bates: 'There was nobody who had their back' Bates says he noticed a pattern. Jenkins liked to arrest people on the street and find a way to go back to their houses. Once they got into the house, his clients - who were overwhelmingly young black men - kept telling him the officers stole money, drugs, jewellery. Because they were charged with crimes, the victims were ignored when they complained. After the GTTF robbed Shawn Whiting of $16,000 in cash, spiriting away two pairs of high-end shoes and video games for his children, he wrote multiple letters of complaint from his prison cell. Internal Affairs told him he lacked sufficient evidence. “This is what I’ve been saying since 2014,” says Whiting, who was able to withdraw his guilty plea and leave prison after the officers were indicted. “What you do in the dark come to light sometimes.” Shawn Whiting Although they were lauded for their arrest numbers, it was common for the cases to get dropped - a BBC analysis found under Jenkins, roughly half of their cases were never prosecuted. Bates was able to get Stevenson’s charges dropped after he showed that Jenkins violated Stevenson’s constitutional rights during the initial stop. Bates says of the 20 cases he took with GTTF officers, 17 were dropped due to similar violations. Nevertheless, an encounter with the GTTF could still have life-altering consequences. In 2016, Jenkins and his men pulled over 28-year-old Andre Crowder Jr and charged him with gun possession. The case against Crowder was dropped after the officers were indicted. But in the three days he was locked up after his arrest, he learned his three-year-old son Ahmeer had contracted a serious case of pneumonia. As soon as he bailed out, Crowder went straight to the hospital and says he was only in the room for 30 minutes before machines started beeping and the room filled with doctors. Eventually someone emerged from the operating room to deliver terrible news. At the same time he was fighting the case, Crowder had to bury his son. “I just wish that I can get the time that they took from me,” says Crowder. “I just wish that I could get that back.” Listen to Andre Crowder talk about what the GTTF took from him It wasn’t just defendants and their lawyers who raised the alarm early about Jenkins or his officers. Members of the Baltimore Police Department, the Baltimore City State's Attorney’s office, and city judges flagged the officers for lying - but it never seemed to be enough to derail their careers. In the state of Maryland, the contents of police officers’ Internal Affairs files are protected by law. However, after the GTTF indictments, fragments of the files began leaking to journalists. For example, in 2009, a motorist accused Jemell Rayam, along with another officer, of stealing $11,000 from him. According to the Internal Affairs file, Rayam pretended that he’d never met the other officer, until investigators pulled records showing that Rayam called his phone almost every day. Rayam later admitted the two were close friends, and on the stand in 2018, he admitted he took the money. In November 2015, a woman complained to Internal Affairs that members of the GTTF held her at gunpoint to stop her from dialling 911. A leaked internal memo shows that the head of the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s police integrity unit referred the case to Internal Affairs, requesting an investigation and pointing out that a judge ruled Rayam’s account of what happened “intentionally or recklessly false”. Internal memo on Rayam's ""intentionally or recklessly false"" testimony In 2014, an assistant state’s attorney named Molly Webb told “anybody that would listen” that Jenkins was untrustworthy. It stemmed from the traffic stop of a man named Walter Price. According to the police report, Jenkins and other officers found seven grams of cocaine tucked into the visor of Price’s van. But Webb says she was floored by the inconsistencies between a closed circuit video of the incident and the probable cause statement, written by a subordinate officer of Jenkins’. She dropped the case and says she notified her superiors. An Internal Affairs investigation into the incident sustained a charge of “failure to supervise” against Jenkins. During this process, Webb says Jenkins sent her a lengthy text message she found frightening. “States attorneys are informing me that you believe I’m a dirty cop that should be fired,” a text from a number associated with Jenkins' family from May 2015 reads. “It’s slander and hurtful to me what is being said. This is not a promise, nor is it a threat to you in anyway shape or form this is just hurting me and my reputation.” At the same time, multiple defence lawyers have complained about getting access to Internal Affairs files from the Baltimore Police Department and the State’s Attorney’s Office, and asked why officers with problematic histories were still allowed to testify. Through statements provided to the BBC, a spokeswoman for Mosby strongly disagreed that their office failed to readily disclose Internal Affairs files when required, and wrote that they “started providing an additional disclosure on Rayam” to defence lawyers after a 2015 complaint. “We made disclosures in every case in which credibility was an issue,” she wrote. “We did not have knowledge of anything with the IA files that would suggest that a larger criminal conspiracy was afoot.” Mosby’s office also pointed out that before the officers’ indictments, the Baltimore Police Department did not regularly provide them with updates on Internal Affairs investigations. Under a new agreement, they now receive a report on Internal Affairs complaints every week and a monthly list of suspensions. A spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department called it “revisionist history” to think the files could have predicted the GTTF’s misconduct. In June 2016, Jenkins took over the GTTF, giving him citywide jurisdiction, and brought several officers along with him who had internally documented problems with money and truth-telling. Bates, who thought Jenkins would be permanently sidelined by the outcome of the Price case, was dismayed. “It’s sort of almost like a bad horror movie,” says Bates. “Every time you kill the villain, it comes back to life.” The first of March, 2017, should have been a good day for Sergeant Wayne Jenkins. He was up for a promotion - a big one. The vetting process was already under way, but there was just one tiny problem. To obtain the rank of lieutenant, he could not have any open or pending Internal Affairs complaints against him. The open case Jenkins had was relatively small - a department car had been damaged and he needed to clear up how it had happened. An appointment was set with Internal Affairs officers and Jenkins called in the entire squad to vouch for him: Hersl, Gondo, Ward, Taylor and Hendrix. One by one the men arrived to the squat brick building. They hit the buzzer to enter the lobby, where - per standard Internal Affairs procedures - they were directed to check their guns into tiny, post office box-like lockers. Each officer took the elevator to the command investigation unit on the second floor. As the elevator doors slid open, the officers met the stony-faced gazes of a FBI Swat team. It was a trap. The agents had seven sets of handcuffs ready. Jenkins had been warned multiple times that this could happen - first by a fellow officer, then from a contact in the state’s attorney’s office. Not long after the Stevenson case was dismissed, Jenkins took a 90-day leave of absence to help care for his newborn son. But when he returned three months later, it seemed to the members of his squad that he was back to his old tricks. Ward and Hendrix said Jenkins started reminiscing about the Stevenson case, and wondering if they couldn’t go back to his house again. He told the officers he wanted to go looking for “monsters” - anyone with a lot of drugs and cash. Hendrix thought Jenkins meant in a police capacity - until Jenkins opened up the rear doors of his police issued van to show them two large black duffel bags. In the first, a green-headed sledgehammer, an 18-inch black-bladed machete, a four-pronged grappling hook, heavy-duty bolt cutters, various knives and pry bars, and an axe. In the second, an array of black clothing, black shoes, black gloves, a set of binoculars, ski masks and ski goggles, and two sneering, full-face masks that looked like characters from Alien. “Once I seen all that, I came to the conclusion he was talking about robbing him,” said Hendrix. After the arrest at Internal Affairs, the FBI executed search warrants on all seven officers’ homes and vehicles. In Jenkins’ van they found the two duffel bags, and in the driver’s side door, a set of well-worn brass knuckles. That night, the entire squad slept in the Howard County Detention Center, 20 minutes south of the city. Some of them compared stories and vowed not to crack under pressure from the feds. But as days became weeks and then months, one by one the officers took plea deals. Ward and Hendrix were the first, then Rayam and two days later, his old partner Gondo. Jenkins held out the longest, pleading guilty just weeks away from the start of the trial. As the former colleagues started to turn on one another, investigators gathered enough new information to charge Jenkins’ predecessor, former GTTF officer-in-charge Thomas Allers, with racketeering and robbery. The indictment detailed not only years of robberies committed with Gondo and Rayam, but a tragic connection to the death of Davon Robinson. Two months before he was murdered, Robinson was arrested by Rayam, Gondo, Hersl and Allers for a slew of handgun possession charges. The 31-year-old had been in court for his arraignment the morning he was shot. The alleged shooter, a 25-year-old man known by the street name “Sticky”, was arrested 20 days later. The mother of Robinson’s children told the FBI that back when Robinson was arrested by the GTTF, the officers stole $10,000 in cash, money that Robinson desperately needed to repay a debt. When he couldn’t, she says, he was murdered. (The BBC was unable to reach members of Robinson’s family.) Allers pleaded guilty on 6 December 2017. As the trial date grew closer, the public learned of yet another death connected to the GTTF. On 15 November 2017, Baltimore homicide detective Sean Suiter went to the site of a triple murder he was investigating and was shot to death in broad daylight. The weapon used was his own. There were three shots fired, and the description of the suspect was vague - an African-American male in a black and white coat who left no DNA and no fingerprints. Police locked down the neighbourhood around the site for five days, an action the ACLU called “constitutionally suspect”, as they combed the area for clues. A memorial where Suiter was found Police commissioner Davis revealed that the day after his death, Suiter was scheduled to testify in front of a grand jury about his time working with Jenkins, Ward and Gondo. Davis denied that Suiter himself was under investigation, calling him a “stellar detective, great friend, loving husband and dedicated father”. The killing remains unsolved. On the first day of the highly anticipated Gun Trace Task Force trial, former detective Hersl emerged from a wooden door at the back of Judge Catherine Blake’s courtroom, a US Marshal by his side, dressed in khakis and a navy blazer. He nodded to his parents and siblings, seated in a row near the top of the stadium-style seating gallery. Marcus Taylor followed in a navy coat and tie, with a small wave to his parents and extended family. Both men had been incarcerated since the day of their arrest. Hersl (centre) and Taylor (right) in court.Court sketch by Tom Chalkley The government was represented by two over six-foot-tall assistant US attorneys, Leo Wise and Derek Hines, dubbed the “Twin Towers of Justice” as much for their stature as for their rigid, methodical style in court. “The police officers in this case were entrusted with these,” Wise told the jury, holding the men’s badges and guns aloft. “They can be used for good. They can be used for evil.” The first witness was former detective Maurice Ward. He entered in a bright green prison shirt, loose pants and rubber shoes, his hair and beard overgrown. As he waited to be sworn in, his bleary eyes scanned the audience for a familiar face. He did not appear to find one. Over the course of two days, Ward walked the jury through years of robbery incidents going back to 2009, ones committed with Taylor, Hendrix and Jenkins when they were on a narcotics squad together, and ones committed with Hersl, Gondo and Rayam when they all joined the GTTF. Ward explained the door-pops and the profiling. He said that Jenkins advised them to carry BB guns to plant if they ever shot an unarmed person. After the Stevenson robbery, Ward claimed he scattered the cash in a field behind his house, too scared of getting caught to spend or save it. “You don’t want to be the one in the squad saying, ‘I’m not with that,’” he said. “You don’t want to be blackballed.” The former officers testified in the same order in which they had pleaded guilty. Day after day they confessed to their crimes, and clashed with defence lawyers who tried to undermine their credibility. Gondo on the stand.Court sketch by Tom Chalkley “You lied on at least 13 probable cause statements,” said William Purpura, Hersl’s lawyer, as he cross-examined Rayam. “I totally understand my faults, sir.” “You lied to juries, juries like this one,” Purpura continued. “You stole money. You stole narcotics. You stole guns… You can’t stop lying.” “I’m not lying now,” Rayam said. “It’s never too late to do the right thing.” The jury heard from eight robbery victims. Shawn Whiting displayed the letters he wrote in prison. Oreese Stevenson, who had to be subpoenaed to get him to show up for court, testified tersely about his experience. Ronald Hamilton told the story of his long night with the GTTF. For his final question, Wise approached him with a watch in a plastic evidence bag - Hamilton identified it as a Breitling watch that went missing from his bedroom during the raid. The defence lawyers went after Hamilton particularly hard. They showed the courtroom how much money he lost gambling each year, they put up photos of his home and demanded to know how he could afford such a place. As Taylor’s lawyer ticked through a series of photos of the finished basement and the gleaming kitchen countertops, Hamilton snapped. “They came in my house and destroyed my life. My kids are scared to come in the house, I’m getting divorced because of this,” he yelled, swearing. “This right here destroyed my whole family!” Judge Blake instructed the jury to disregard his outburst, though it seemed like an impossible request. The following day, like a man stepping out from behind the curtain in Oz, a 51-year-old bail bondsman named Donald Stepp took the stand. Nattily dressed in a grey suit and rectangular glasses, Stepp explained matter-of-factly that in addition to being a co-founder of Double D Bail Bonds, he was also a cocaine dealer now facing the possibility of life in prison. Stepp had known the Jenkins family for 40 years, and met Wayne at a cops’ card game. They became friends. They partied together at strip clubs with Stepp’s Dominican cocaine source. When the Baltimore Ravens went to the Super Bowl in 2013, they travelled to the game in New Orleans together. Stepp and Jenkins at the Super Bowl At some point, Jenkins asked Stepp if he’d be willing to help re-sell stolen drugs. “I thought it was a winner,” said Stepp. “It was greed.” Jenkins would deliver large quantities of narcotics on an almost nightly basis to a shed Stepp left unlocked. Stepp was most interested in cocaine, but said Jenkins left every conceivable type of drug, from crack cocaine to Ecstasy to heroin. At one point, Hines pulled up Stepp’s Amazon purchase history which included orders for the sledgehammer, the masks, the grappling hook, the machete - just about everything that was found in the back of Jenkins’ van. Hines also showed the jury multiple pictures from Stepp’s mobile phone, including a blurry picture of some of the GTTF officers standing outside Stevenson’s home during the raid. That day, Stepp said Jenkins called to tell him: “I got a monster”. When Stepp arrived, Jenkins walked out of the house with his Baltimore police vest stuffed with cocaine. “He come out the door looking like Santa Claus.” After the indictments, Stepp got nervous and threw seven watches worth about $200,000 into the lake behind his home. Hines produced Ronald Hamilton’s watch, which Stepp confirmed was one that he threw into the water, only to be retrieved later by an FBI dive team. “I thought I was going to get through, to be honest,” said Stepp. “I didn’t think [Jenkins] would reveal me.” Stepp wears Jenkins' vest and holds his gun at BPD headquarters. Hersl’s lawyer, Purpura, admitted his client had taken money, but argued that it was theft, not robbery, and the government had overcharged him. He got current Baltimore police officers to admit on the stand there was a long-standing department practice of offering overtime as a reward for seizing a gun. Taylor’s lawyer tried to convince the jury that “he sits before you, innocent”. When word came that, after two days, the jury had a verdict, a tremulous man named Alex Hilton walked into the courthouse. He’d been arrested by Hersl multiple times, and was clearly disturbed by what he went through. “If he was to get convicted, it would be some semblance of justice for me, I could have some closure, move on with my life without being afraid,” he said, his whole body trembling with emotion. “These are cops we’re talking about, for crying out loud.” In the courtroom, Judge Blake read down the list of charges, and the jury foreman rose. “We, the jury, find the defendant Daniel Thomas Hersl, guilty,” he read. “We, the jury, find the defendant Marcus Roosevelt Taylor, guilty.” Jovonne Walker was arrested by Jenkins and the case was later dropped. She talks about her reaction to his arrest As the officers’ family members silently held on to one another, Hilton clasped his hands together. “Thank you, Jesus.” The jury convicted Hersl and Taylor on most, but not all charges. They determined the men had committed robbery, extortion and fraud, but cleared them of firearms charges. As the US marshals clicked the handcuffs closed on their wrists, Hersl’s family called out to him. “Stay strong, Danny,” and “I love you, Danny.” While the Taylor family walked briskly out of the courthouse without saying a word, Stephen Hersl, a retired firefighter and Daniel’s older brother, broke down in front of the television cameras. “My brother was innocent and it was obvious,” he said, his face wet with tears. “Let’s talk about the corruption on top - everybody starts from the bottom, the little guy. My brother was a little guy.” He vowed that someday, Daniel would write a book and out the superiors who’d allowed the GTTF to happen. “Baltimore city, they can’t run a school system, they can’t run a police department, they can’t even run a zoo, Baltimore city!” He abruptly turned and walked off into the night, as the sound of a lone, plaintive siren filled the night air. Four days after the verdict, now-Corporal David McDougall sat in his black SUV outside of the federal courthouse as a cold rain misted the windows. He had eschewed his typical plaid shirt and jeans for a suit. “This is an important day for the investigation,” he said. “It’s been a crazy journey.” Moments earlier, Antonio “Brill” Shropshire was sentenced in front of a packed audience, including his mother, father, his two grandmothers and dozens of other friends and family who watched the proceeding with red-rimmed eyes. Several begged Judge Blake to spare Shropshire the maximum sentence so he could one day come home to his young son. McDougall sat at the prosecution’s table, alongside Wise and Hines. Shropshire, a tall, bearded man in a maroon prison uniform, called McDougall and the government’s lawyers “liars”, and continued to deny he was ever the leader of a large-scale heroin operation. But he also promised to lead a crime-free life if he were allowed to return home. “Heroin kills people, Mr Shropshire,” said Judge Blake. “Mr Shropshire continued to sell this poison. Does that mean he’s a monster? Of course not.” She sentenced him to 25 years in prison. Both Shropshire and Glen Kyle Wells are appealing against their convictions. McDougall said he thought the sentence was fair, and was pleased by the guilty verdicts at the GTTF trial. But he doesn’t get too emotional about this stuff. “It’s just part of the job. Just going through the steps now.” None of the eight officers has been sentenced - Judge Blake is expected to make those decisions in spring. Hendrix, Ward, Allers and Rayam are facing 20 years; Gondo, Hersl and Taylor could get up to 60 years. Wayne Jenkins is expected to receive between 20 and 30 years in federal prison. Should he choose to make a statement, the sentencing would be the first time the public will hear directly from him. Through his lawyer, he declined to comment for this story. It will also be the first opportunity his victims will have to address him, a day that Ronald Hamilton is eagerly awaiting. “I’ll be the first one,” he said. “This has ruined me. This has crushed me.” In the course of testimony, the names of an additional 11 current and former Baltimore city police officers came out, including a former partner of Jenkins’ and a high-ranking deputy commissioner. None has been charged, and a spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department says they are actively investigating the allegations raised at trial. One commander was demoted. Two lieutenants who directly supervised Jenkins remain on the force. “It ain’t over. It’s just begun,” says Shawn Whiting, who pointed out his arrest involved additional officers. “It’s way far bigger than people think.” Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh fired Commissioner Kevin Davis the Friday before the GTTF trial began, citing “impatience” with the climbing homicide rate. Davis was replaced by his deputy commissioner Darryl De Sousa, who announced a slew of reforms, including random ethics tests and polygraphs for officers. According to a spokesman, new checks and balances will be implemented to make sure gun cases are tracked from “arrest to adjudication”, and an anti-corruption unit will be established to focus specifically on the misconduct of the Gun Trace Task Force officers. Critics have questioned how an investigative unit housed within the BPD will be any different than the current Internal Affairs division, which failed to root out the GTTF officers. “We still believe we have the capability to investigate on our own - we have to, that’s the bottom line,” says TJ Smith, chief of media relations. After years of fighting for the right to view officers’ Internal Affairs files, Deborah Katz Levi, in charge of the public defender's special litigation projects, says that a month after the end of the trial she’s suddenly been granted “unparalleled access” to 21 officers’ files, including some members of the GTTF. Levi says they're now working with the State's Attorney's Office to expand the number of convictions ""that need to be undone"". The office says their initial assessment concluded that 284 cases - active or closed - have been affected by the seven originally indicted GTTF officers. Mosby's office will only proceed on three active cases. She has also told the media that after factoring in the expanded timeline and additional officers whose names arose at trial, the number of cases involved could rise to “thousands”. Mosby fired an assistant state’s attorney from her staff in February, but has never said whether this person leaked information to Jenkins. “The [US Attorney's office] has shared components of its GTTF investigation with our office and we are not at liberty to comment,” Mosby’s spokeswoman wrote. The ripple effects of the case are constant and ongoing. Andre Crowder and other victims of the GTTF moved away from the city of Baltimore for fear of retaliation. Sticky, the alleged murderer of Davon Robinson, will go on trial this spring. He has pleaded not guilty. Among Baltimore citizens and police officers alike, there is sharp disagreement on how Sean Suiter died. Earlier this year, the FBI declined to take the case. A state senator proposed the creation of a special commission with subpoena power to perform a detailed two-year investigation into the GTTF, and answer the lingering questions surrounding the BPD. However, Mayor Pugh says the police department is already under federal oversight, and that her changes to the upper ranks will be sufficient to address the GTTF’s impact. “I believe in the work that is currently already under way,” she says. Back in Harford County, new dealers have stepped into the vacuum left by Shropshire and Anderson. There have been 103 overdoses in 2018, so far, putting the county on track for another record breaking year. McDougall continues to investigate overdoses. He arrives on the scene of parents’ worst nightmares, he removes bodies from childhood bedrooms. He admits there’s a feeling he’s chasing his own tail, sometimes. “Somebody’s got to do the job,” he says. ”That’s me.” Built with Shorthand"
'One-stop shops' for cancer diagnosis,"The aim is for patients to get all the checks they need under one roof ""One-stop shops"" aimed at speeding up cancer diagnosis are being introduced across England. The aim is to catch the disease earlier and prevent patients from being referred for several tests for different forms of the illness. Patients often face delays when they have non-specific symptoms. NHS England says this is a ""step change"" in the way people with suspected cancer are diagnosed and treated. The rapid diagnosis and then treatment of cancer can be vital in saving lives. While cancer survival rates have improved dramatically over recent decades, patients who are not displaying very obvious signs of the illness sometimes struggle to access quickly the help they need. Those with more vague symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss, reduced appetite or abdominal pain can be referred several times for different tests for different cancers, all wasting valuable opportunities to start treatment. Other symptoms can include fatigue, unexplained sweats or generally feeling unwell. NHS England is now adopting an approach first developed in Denmark - introducing 10 specialist rapid diagnostic and assessment centres where patients will receive all the necessary investigations under one roof. Cally Palmer, national director for cancer at NHS England, says the new centres could play a key role in improving diagnosis and treatment. ""Early diagnosis is crucial to saving lives and providing peace of mind for patients, which is why we are driving forward plans to revolutionise our approach to cancer in this country,"" she said. ""These new one-stop shops represent a real step change in the way people with unclear symptoms are identified, diagnosed and treated."" NHS England has developed the centres in collaboration with the cancer charities Macmillan and Cancer Research UK. Sara Hiom,  director of early diagnosis at CRUK, said: ""We're confident that these 10 pilot centres will give us a much better understanding of what's needed to speed up the diagnosis and treatment of people with less obvious symptoms, improve their experience of care and, ultimately, survival rates. ""This is a first for this country and Cancer Research UK is delighted to be partnering with NHS England in this innovative initiative. ""The knowledge gained will support others looking to roll out similar approaches in future."" The new centres will be spread across England, with the first 10 being located at: Royal Free Hospital, London North Middlesex Hospital, London, University College Hospitals London Southend University Hospital Queens Hospital, Romford St James University Hospital, Leeds Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire University Hospital, South Manchester Royal Oldham Hospital, Greater Manchester Churchill Hospital, Oxford The aim is that every patient is either diagnosed or given the all-clear within 28 days. If the project is a success, more of the centres will be established across England.

UK ivory ban to be 'toughest' in the world,"Prince William condemned illegal wildlife trading during a trip to China in 2015 A British ban on ivory sales is to be one of the toughest in the world, the environment secretary has said. Michael Gove said the sale of ivory of any age, with limited exceptions, will be banned in an effort to reduce elephant poaching. The move, which is still to be signed into law, comes after a consultation in which more than 60,000 people supported the introduction of a complete ban. Campaigners say about 20,000 elephants are killed each year for their tusks. Previous bans only applied to ivory produced after 1947. The new law is even tougher than the changes proposed in the October 2017 consultation. Prince William plea on ivory trade Animals poached in 'horrifying numbers' Can China's ban save elephants? Mr Gove added that the new law would ""reaffirm the UK's global leadership on this critical issue, demonstrating our belief that the abhorrent ivory trade should become a thing of the past"". He said: ""Ivory should never be seen as a commodity for financial gain or a status symbol."" Those breaking the ban by selling ivory will face a maximum penalty of five years in jail or an unlimited fine, said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It added that the measure was tougher than rules in China and the US. The US currently bans ivory apart from items older than 100 years, as well as items with up to 50% ivory. The Chinese ban exempts ""relics"", with no specific date before which these must have been made. There will still be some exemptions to the ban, designed to provide ""balance to ensure people are not unfairly impacted"" and for ""items which do not contribute to the poaching of elephants"", the department said. These will include: Items comprising less than 10% ivory (by volume) and made before 1947. Musical instruments made before 1975 and comprising less than 20% ivory. Rare or important items, at least 100 years old, will be assessed by specialist institutions before exemption permits are issued. There will be specific exemptions for portrait miniatures painted on thin ivory bases and for commercial activity between accredited museums WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said the UK stance made it a ""global leader in tackling this bloody trade"" and called for ""global action"" to stop elephant poaching. This video can not be played Alastair Leithead on ivory trade Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of the Tusk Trust which funds conservation and environmental education across Africa, welcomed the announcement. ""The ban will ensure there is no value for modern day ivory and the tusks of recently poached elephants cannot enter the UK market,"" he said. Alexander Rhodes, founder of Stop Ivory, also praised the strength of the ban and its tighter regulations. He did however urge the EU to ""move fast"" as a bloc to address the issue. ""Since the UK government held the Illegal Wildlife Conference in 2014, the US and China have both enacted bans on their domestic ivory trade, so the UK doing this now is extraordinarily important,"" he said. ""The EU on the other hand has been very resistant - I am hopeful that the UK's strong position will lead to change.""

Rail chaos in three-month French strikeTransport misery for commuters as strikes challenging President Macron's labour reform begin.15m15 minutes agoEurope,"This video can not be played Strikers held a protest inside Gare du Nord station in Paris France's rail network has been severely disrupted, as a wave of strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's labour reforms gets under way. The start of the strike has been dubbed ""Black Tuesday"", but the action will spread over three months, affecting two days in every five. Staff at state railway SNCF are leading the strike, but the energy and waste collection sectors are also affected. The unrest presents Mr Macron's biggest challenge since his election last May. The unions say some of the plans to overhaul the heavily indebted SNCF would pave the way for its privatisation. But Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe denied this, saying the proposals aim to change the status quo that was ""no longer tenable"". In parliament, he added: ""If the strikers are to be respected, the millions of French people who want to go to work, because they have no choice, because they want to go to work, must also be respected."" SNCF warned that major disruptions were expected on Wednesday. With the four main rail unions observing the strike, services have been severely curtailed. Some 77% of SNCF drivers were believed to be on strike. The company said 34% of its staff overall were striking. Only one in eight high-speed TGVs is scheduled to run,externalwhile only one in five regional trains is operating. Commuter lines into Paris have also been slashed and bus services have been hugely overcrowded. Some stations were crammed for the few trains available, others were deserted. The website that measures car traffic around the capital,externalrecorded about 420km (260 miles) of jams at rush hour. How this could affect your train journey (in French),external International services are more sketchily affected.Eurostar,externalhas 75% of trains running and the Thalys services to Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are almost normal, but there are no services to Spain, Switzerland or Italy. Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris Employees of Air France, who are demanding a 6% pay rise, are into the fourth day of industrial action. The airline is operating 75% of its flights. Travellers across Europe suffered more disruption as up to 15,000 flights across the continent were facing delays due to a technical problem. Eurocontrol, which runs the EU's air traffic system,said the fault in the system had been identifiedand that moves were under way to return the situation to normal. Unions have also called out all rubbish collectors, to push for the creation of a national collection service and better retirement options. Workers blockaded some waste treatment plants. Energy sector unions have also called strikes to demand, among other things, an end to the liberalisation of the energy markets and a review of deregulation. Thousands of students are also reportedly taking part in the strikes, in opposition to the toughening up of university entry regulations. Analysis by the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris There are three reasons why President Macron feels relatively optimistic about the rail strike. First, unlike in the last massive (and successful) general strike in 1995, this time there can have been no mistaking the government's intention to reform. Neither the public nor SNCF staff can pretend the planned changes come out of the blue. They are clearly part of the broad reform agenda for which Mr Macron was elected. Second, there is far less automatic sympathy for the SNCF than there used to be. The level of rail services has declined sharply, especially for commuters, who are as a result more open to calls for reform. Third, new options have opened up for commuters. There is home-working; car-pooling; expanded coach services. This should make it easier for workers to get round the inconvenience. All that said, these will be tense weeks for the government. Nerves are going to fray. People will get angry. Daily life will not be easy. In these circumstances, plans can go badly awry. A wrong move and public opinion could easily shift back behind the strikers. SNCF workers enjoy generous conditions, including automatic annual pay rises, early retirement, 28 days of paid annual leave and protection from dismissal. Their close relatives are also entitled to free rail tickets. The Macron government wants to phase out the special SNCF contracts, proposing to put new hires on contracts like those that apply elsewhere in industry. Platforms at Gare de Lyon station in Paris got crowded in the morning The aim is to open up the state railways to competition from 2023, in line with EU requirements. SNCF has â¬46.6bn ($57.5bn; Â£40bn) of debt. French unions strike over labour reforms Macron launches overhaul of labour laws Macron's meteoric rise - in-depth analysis The rail unions also feel their action goes beyond rail workers' conditions and marks a major test of union clout. Just over 11% of the French workforce is unionised - one of the lowest levels in the EU - but the unions traditionally punch above their weight, economically and politically. ""We're defending the French public service, not just rail workers,"" said Emmanuel Grondein, head of union Sud Rail. But Gare du Nord was empty Mr Macron's Republic On The Move party also feels the strike has wider connotations. ""We need to rid this country of its strike culture,"" spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Opposition to Mr Macron's agenda was shown on 22 March, whentens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other workers joined rail staff on strike. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says many union members see Mr Macron as the man who wants to break the power of the unions. But strikes in September failed to stop Mr Macron passing laws that make it easier for firms to hire and fire, and the majority of the public are opposed to industrial action this time.

Corbyn attends left-wing Jewish event,"This video can not be played Leaders ""have to listen"", says Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to attend a dinner organised by a left-wing Jewish group following criticism from mainstream Jewish leaders. Asked if he had any regrets about being at the Jewdas event, the Labour leader said: ""Not in the slightest."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups said it cast fresh doubts on Mr Corbyn's commitment to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour. Jewdas has previously suggested anti-Semitism claims were right-wing smears. Speaking on a campaign visit to Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: ""I went to a very interesting and very enjoyable Seder supper and I spent a lot of time talking to young Jewish people about their life in Britain and experiences of anti-Semitism they have had and how they view the future of our country. ""I think that is what political leaders should do - listen to people."" He added: ""Anti-Semitism is a cancer and awful in our society and has to be eradicated wherever it rears its head."" A spokesman for the Labour leader said Mr Corbyn had attended the Seder event, a ritual service held on Passover, ""with Jewish members of his local community"" in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the party. This video can not be played Jon Lansman told the Today programme ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist"" ""He wrote to the Board of Deputies and Jewish Leadership Council last week to ask for an urgent formal meeting to discuss tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and in society,"" the spokesman added. Jewdas, which describes itself as a ""radical"" and ""alternative"" Jewish collective, is at odds with mainstream Jewish groups over allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour. It has accused the Jewish Board of Deputies, Jewish Leadership Council and Jewish Labour Movement of ""playing a dangerous game"" and previously dismissed anti-Semitism allegations as right-wing smears. Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""If Jeremy Corbyn goes to their event, how can we take his stated commitment to be an ally against anti-Semitism seriously?"" Momentum: Labour failed on anti-Semitism How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded The Jewish Labour Movement said Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas event ""topped off the worst week on record of awful relations between the Labour Party and the Jewish community"". Spokesman Ivor Caplin, a former MP, said: ""When we called on the leader of our party to show moral leadership and take decisive action to stamp out anti-Semitism, this is not what we had in mind."" Leading Corbyn supporter Jon Lansman said the Labour leader's attendance at the event was ""not as significant as it's being made out."" Mr Lansman, founder of Momentum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It was his night off, he had nothing in his official diary, his office didn't know he was there."" Mr Lansman said past comments by Jewdas about Israel were ""certainly not helpful to Jeremy or the cause of opposing anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"". But he said Mr Corbyn was keen to meet the leaders of ""mainstream Jewish organisations"", adding: ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist."" He said accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour could not be dismissed as ""smears"" against Mr Corbyn, and there was a widespread problem of ""unconscious bias"" in the party which needed to addressed by a ""programme of education and training"". In a tweet, Labour MP John Woodcock. a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said meeting the group gave the message that ""extreme views are OK"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Angela Smith said Mr Corbyn's attendance was a ""blatant dismissal"" of the case to tackle anti-Semitism in the party. The chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, Jonathan Goldstein, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had ""no issue"" with Jewdas and its opinions.

"Girl, 17, shot dead in north London","The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Two shootings in London in the space of an hour - including a drive-by attack - have left a 17-year-old girl and a boy, 16, dead. Friends said the girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, was killed ""for no reason"" in Tottenham on Monday night. The Met has confirmed she died when ""shots were fired"" from a vehicle as it drove past a group of young people. Two miles away, in Walthamstow, the boy was found with gunshot wounds, with another boy, 15, who had stab injuries. The boy who suffered gunshot wounds died later in hospital, police said. Both attacks come amid concernsover rising violent crime in London. Police say the shootings are not linked. Tanesha, whose name has not been officially confirmed, was pronounced dead at 22:43 BST near Northumberland Park, Tottenham. Police remain at the scene. Grieving family members and friends left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road on Tuesday. One friend described her as a ""very lovable little girl in the community, she was not involved in any sort of problems with anyone"". Friends and family members left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road Tyesha, 21, who knew Tanesha, told the BBC she was ""just chilling with her friends"" when she was shot. ""The car just pulled up and just started shooting,"" she said. ""Her friend came banging on my door so I came out quickly. I even tried to save her - had to, had to."" She said the gunshot wound, below the victim's breast, was not immediately visible and it looked like she was ""having a fit"". ""I put her on her side and I was just rubbing her back, saying 'Everything's going to be OK'. I just can't believe it - so young. It's ridiculous now."" A witness said a woman, believed to be the victim's mother, began ""screaming"" when she discovered the girl shortly after the shooting. Det Ch Supt Richard Wood described the attack as ""terrible"". ""At this stage we're keeping a completely open mind, it's too early to say what the motive is or indeed if it's just a case of wrong place, wrong time,"" he said. ""We do know that a vehicle drove past a group of young people, shots were fired from the vehicle and sadly the young lady lost her life."" Are black knife deaths being ignored? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was ""deeply worried"" about London's rise in violent crime - particularly in his area. ""There is no single cause, but there has been a big spike in both gun crime and knife crime across London,"" he said. ""Certainly my constituency finds itself at the epicentre of that."" He said cuts to police budgets meant fewer neighbourhood officers on the streets who were ""able to pick up intelligence"" within communities. The 17-year-old girl is the ninth teenager to be murdered in London this year Two teenagers were shot and stabbed in a separate incident in Walthamstow, east London A local resident, who did not want to be named, said she heard multiple shots, which sounded like a ""bomb"" exploding. She said: ""It's not nice. I've lived here for 40 years, and in the last two or three years it's become not a nice place. ""There are so many drugs, stabbings and killings."" Greg McKenzie, BBC London The community in Tottenham has already been gripped with grief and shock that a young woman has had her life ended so tragically. I'm told there were dozens of people out until 02:00 BST consoling each other, while other residents woke to see police cordons and press at the scene. There was a poignant silence when the body of the 17-year-old was taken away, broken only by the sound of people crying. In this area there are people - no matter what age - who are fearful. Residents spoke about self-imposed curfews and mothers not letting their children out after 19:00. Amid the sadness, there is also anger and questions over what the Mayor of London is doing. David Lammy MP claimed Tottenham was at the ""epicentre"" of London's rising violent crime Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said stabbings were common in the area. The Tottenham resident said: ""It's so violent around here. I nearly got stabbed the other day. If you've been around Tottenham a long time you get it."" Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Watch: ""My kids don't see this side of me"" One witness, who works in a nearby shop, said he heard three distinct bangs, which sounded like ""fireworks"". He said he saw the victim with blood on her chest sitting with friends following the shooting, before police cars and ambulances arrived. Close to the scene, residents held an impromptu celebration of Tanesha's life until the early morning. ""We were out here until one o'clock in the morning,"" a neighbour said. ""It was really heart-breaking. We were here for ages but clearly she was already gone."" Forensic officers have spent most of the day at the scene gathering any evidence School friend Candice Hassan said she found out about the murder on social media just half-an-hour after the shooting. ""It was shocking. Everyone's upset obviously - one minute I see her and the next minute I don't,"" she said. ""One hour before her death, I saw her on Snapchat - one hour before she got shot. Everyone knows Tanesha, she's just a humble girl. ""It was just the wrong place at the wrong time. She didn't deserve any of that."" The 17-year-old, who went to the Gladesmore Community School with Tanesha, added: ""I have heard it was a drive-by shooting - obviously gang-related - Wood Green and Tottenham."" Formal identification has yet to take place. However, Tanesha's next-of-kin have been informed of her death. The Walthamstow crime scene, in Markhouse Road, is just over two miles (3.5km) from the site of the Tottenham killing. A police cordon remains in place around Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where the girl was pronounced dead Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the 16-year-old boy was taken to a hospital in east London. He had been in ""intensive care"". Scotland Yard said the 15-year-old boy who was stabbed in Walthamstow has life-changing but not life-threatening injuries. There have been no arrests in either investigation. It brings the total of fatal shootings in London this year to seven, including one man who died after being shot and stabbed. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle. ""We have already consulted on new laws on offensive and dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in private.""

Labour 'failed on anti-Semitism',"Christine Shawcroft, who quit the NEC amid a row over anti-Semitism, is part of the Momentum leadership Momentum, the Labour movement backing Jeremy Corbyn, has said that anti-Semitism in the party is more widespread than it had understood. It said in a statement: ""Accusations of anti-Semitism should not and cannot be dismissed simply as right-wing smears."" It acknowledged the ""upset and despair"" of the Jewish community and the party's ""failure"" to deal with anti-Semitism. The move came as the Labour leader promised ""watertight"" investigations into allegations of anti-Semitism. Row over Corbyn left-wing Jewish event visit Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue The Labour leader told Channel 4 News: ""We are not tolerating anti-Semitism in any form in the Labour Party."" He said the first task of the party's new general secretary, Jennie Formby, would be to appoint an in-house lawyer and ensure effective procedures were in place to deal with allegations of anti-Semitism. A Jewish member of Labour's National Executive Committee, Rhea Wolfson, said she was ""frustrated"" at the pace of action to confront anti-Semitism. But she welcomed the latest commitment. ""Jeremy has specifically asked her to make this her number one priority... so I think we'll see a speeding up of these changes,"" she said. By Eleanor Garnier, BBC News political correspondent It's been a bad week for Labour. Throughout, the party has condemned anti-Semitism and criticised those behind it - and Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for the hurt that has been caused. This warning from Momentum, a left wing campaign group set up to support the Labour leader, is significant. It follows claims from some of Mr Corbyn's supporters that allegations of anti-Semitism are a smear designed to damage him. While Momentum's National Co-ordinating Group said anti-Semitism was a problem in parts of the Left, it also said that some of Mr Corbyn's opponents were opportunistically using the issue as a way to undermine his leadership - though it added that the action of others does not reduce the group's responsibility to challenge anti-Semitism. But it will take more than words for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn to recover from the trouble the party has found itself in over anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn has faced demands to speed up investigations into a backlog of about 70 complaints of anti-Semitism, including one against former London mayor Ken Livingstone.He has previously apologisedfor the ""hurt"" caused by the failure to address cases of anti-Semitism. The party has dropped one council candidate, Roy Smart in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, who was accused of sharing posts on social media urging followers to ""question the Holocaust"". How the anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The statement from Momentum's National Co-ordinating Group acknowledges the failure to deal with cases in a ""sufficiently decisive, swift and transparent manner"". Among those on the NCG isChristine Shawcroft, who quitLabour's disputes panel and the National Executive Committee after criticism of her opposition to the suspension of another council candidate, Alan Bull in Peterborough. Mr Bull had been due to stand in the May local elections, but was accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. The NCH statement said: ""Current examples of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party are not only a problem of a few, extreme 'bad apples' but also of unconscious bias which manifests itself in varied, nuanced and subtle ways and is more widespread in the Labour Party than many of us had understood even a few months ago."" While it suggested that Jeremy Corbyn's opponents may be ""opportunistically using this issue as a way to undermine his leadership"", that did not diminish ""our responsibility to challenge anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it occurs"". The movement promised to explore partnerships for awareness training open to all Labour members, to back party initiatives against anti-Semitism and to push forward a programme of political education aimed at challenging conspiratorial thinking. Momentum leaders also pledged to review its constitution and procedures and to support local groups in its aim of eradicating anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination.

Anti-Semitism saga unfolds,"Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party A row about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has been prompted by Jeremy Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. But this is not the first time the Labour leader has faced calls to deal with anti-Semitism in recent years. The current row can be traced back to two allegations in 2016 - a year after Mr Corbyn became leader. The first was against the MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah. It was revealed that the year before she became the MP,she shared a graphicshowing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"", with the comment ""problem solved"". A number of other posts emerged, with her comparing Israel to the Nazis and saying ""the Jews are rallying"". She apologised and resigned from her post as John McDonnell's parliamentary private secretary. This video can not be played 2016: Naz Shah blames ignorance for posts she admits were anti-Semitic Mr Corbyn said Ms Shah's remarks were ""offensive and unacceptable"", andshe was suspended from the party. She was reinstated in July and blamed her ""ignorance"" for the posts, admitting they were anti-Semitic. Labour's National Executive Committee gave her a formal warning, told her to apologise for bringing the party into disrepute and warned that if there was another incident she would be expelled. It was during the row over Ms Shah that the former London Mayor Ken Livingstone made his own comments that were alleged to have been anti-Semitic. Mr Livingstone appeared on BBC Radio London defending the MP and said he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic. He added: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" This led to widespread criticism of Mr Livingstone, with Labour MP John Mann accusing him of being a ""Nazi apologist"" in front of a media scrum. This video can not be played 2016: Ken Livingstone said Naz Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic Mr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding that the Nazi leader was ""a monster from start to finish"". But he said he had simply been quoting historical ""facts"". The long-time ally of Mr Corbyn wassuspended by the party for a year, but he refused to apologise and continued to repeat his comments. He was then suspended for a further 12 months in April 2017 after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Mr Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. His suspension hasnow been extended againpending the outcome of an internal investigation. It was after Ms Shah's comments and Mr Livingstone's defence thatMr Corbyn announced an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the partyat the end of April 2016. It was led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of human rights campaign group Liberty. She announced she had joined the Labour Party after her appointment as chair on the inquiry. The inquiry lasted for two months and at the end of June 2016, Ms Chakrabarti concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism,there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Ms Chakrabarti made 20 recommendations,external, including: Abusive references to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics and racial or religious tropes and stereotypes should have no place in Labour Party discourse. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. There should be procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure. The appointment of a general counsel to the Labour Party to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. The party should increase the ethnic diversity of its staff. However, she said she did not approve of lifetime bans for party membership. Two months later, she became a Labour peer - the only appointment to the House of Lords Mr Corbyn has so far made. Around the same time,allegations of anti-Semitism arose from the Oxford University Labour Club. They claimed that members of the club had discussed Zionists rigging British elections, frequently used the term ""Zio"" and said that European attacks on Jews were justified because of Gaza. The allegations led to the Labour Party's national student organisation conducting their own inquiry, and its report was leaked to the press in the summer of 2016. In it,Baroness Royall concluded there had been ""some incidents"" of anti-Semitic behaviourand ""behaviour and language that would once have been intolerable is now tolerated"" in the club. However, she said there was ""no evidence the club is itself institutionally anti-Semitic"". Just under a year later, two students were cleared by the NEC's disputes committee of being anti-Semitic. 'Anti-Semitic behaviour' was said to have taken place at the Oxford University Labour Club Despite the inquiries,promises to adopt tough new rulesto tackle anti-Semitism at its conference and pledges from Mr Corbyn that racism would be ""rooted out"", a number of other allegations have come to light during his tenure. These included: Labour activist Jackie Walker being suspended from the party in 2016 forclaiming Jewish people were ""financiers of the sugar and slave trade"" Author Miko Peled allegedly saying during a speech at a fringe conference event that party membersshould be able to debate whether or not the Holocaust happened,external- he is not a member of the party Brighton and Hove Labour housing campaigner Daniel Harris being suspended afterposting a video on Facebook,externalfeaturing the faces of three Labour councillors superimposed on the heads of dancing Jewish figures A member from Barnet, London, being suspendedfor writing anti-Semitic posts on social media, leading to a councillor receiving abuse for reporting it Now, Mr Corbyn himself is facing criticism aftersending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockefeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Allow Twitter content?

The Labour leader has since called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by anti-Semitism in the party. Aftera letter from Jewish groupsthat held Mr Corbyn personally responsible for the ""hostile"" environment Jews in the Labour Party face, he is facing calls from some of his own MPs to take tougher action. But members of the Jewish Voice for Labour group claim the two organisations behind the letter do not represent the views of the ""great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness"" and that there is ""massively more anti-Semitism on the right of politics than on the left"". Responding to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council with a letter of his own, Mr Corbyn said he would not ""tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in or around our party and movement"". He acknowledged that anti-Semitic attitudes had ""surfaced more often in [Labour's] ranks in recent years"" and emphasised the need for a ""deeper understanding of what constitutes anti-Semitism"". Mr Corbyn also said he recognised the ""overdue"" need for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Chakrabarti report and apologised for ""not having studied the content of the [Mear One] mural more closely"".

Labour's anti-Semitism issue,"""Occasionally toxic."" That's not Jeremy Corbyn's description of what he now admits are ""pockets"" of the Labour Party where prejudice against Jews can be found. It's the description of the atmosphere in the Labour Party inan official 2016 report,externalthat investigated claims of anti-Semitism inside the party after concerns were raised over many, many months. There lies the problem. Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015 and even in the heat of that summer's Corbynmania fears were raised about the attitude of some of the activists and campaigners he had associated with over the years towards the Jewish people. Jewish groups in scathing attack on Corbyn How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded As one senior Labour figure says, the concern was then - as it is believed to be now by many people in the party - that ""he is not anti-Semitic but he has been seen to tolerate it"". Back then, after some months of agitation, that report was undertaken to stamp out the problem, and recommended a series of ideas to root out anti-Semitic prejudice and other forms of racism too. That was in June 2016. But it was not to be what many hoped at the time - the final page of a hot and difficult debate. Since then many Labour MPs feel that an almost continuous flow of allegations have emerged, including evidence of Mr Corbyn's own unwitting participation in some online debates, with the party leadership accused of being slow and reluctant to take a strong stance, and the Labour machine crawling, rather than racing, to close down the problem. The issue is not helped by the suspicion that exists between different wings of the Labour Party. Some of Mr Corbyn's most ardent supporters believe that this is the latest attempt to undermine his leadership, rather than genuine concern. That includes some members of the Jewish community themselves, some of whom are planning their own demonstration in response to what they see as ""cynical, selective outrage"", from the Board of Deputies of British Jews. But the distress felt by many in the Labour movement about what's been happening is real. Talk to any of the MPs who have been victims of it and that much is clear. Jeremy Corbyn has always said that he condemns all forms of racism. But the perception that it has taken nearly three years to drag himto apologise for this specific form of prejudicethat will lead tonight to the extraordinary sight of the leaders of a major religion protesting outside Parliament against the attitude of the leader of the UK's main opposition party.

Father finds daughter after 24-year search,"This video can not be played Kang Ying, 27, was reunited with her mother after 24 years A Chinese couple have been reunited with their daughter who went missing 24 years ago. Wang Mingqing and his wife Liu Dengying had looked for Qifeng since she disappeared aged three in 1994. His tireless search included becoming a taxi driver, in the hope he might one day pick her up as a passenger. His daughter made contact earlier this year after coming across an online post about him. At the tearful reunion he hugged her and said: ""Daddy loves you."" The incredible story has swept China, where many are celebrating the reunion. Wang Mingqing and Liu Dengying were fruit sellers, selling their wares at a roadside stall in the south-western city of Chengdu. On one particularly busy day,Mr Wang ran out of change, and briefly went to a neighbouring stall to change money,externalfor a customer. When he was back minutes later,his daughter was nowhere to be found,external, Chinese media reported. For years Wang Mingqing handed out leaflets appealing for information about his missing daughter Mr Wang and his wife spent years searching for her in the city and surrounding areas, taking out advertisements in newspapers and setting up online appeals. The couple, who have another daughter and a son, never left Chengdu, in the hope that Qifeng would find her way back to them. In 2015, Mr Wang decided to broaden the search by signing up as a driver with ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing. He put up a large sign appealing for information on his rear window, and also gave out cards with information about Qifeng to every passenger he ferried. Mr Wang did not have a picture of Qifeng as a toddler so he used a picture of his other daughter in his leaflets, as they looked similar. His unique method gained attention from the Chinese media. ""One day, my daughter may just be the person sitting in my car!"" he was quoted as saying. Kang Ying flew to Chengdu with her husband and children to meet her parents Supporters gave her bouquets of flowers Over the years Chinese police identified several women who could have been Qifeng, but DNA tests showed they were not his daughter. But a breakthrough finally came late last year, when a police sketch artist read about Mr Wang and decided to help by producing a drawing of what Qifeng might look like as an adult. The picture was circulated online. Thousands of kilometres away, on the other side of the country, a woman called Kang Ying saw the picture - and was shocked by how much it resembled her.

Ex-health secretary reveals bowel cancer,"The former Conservative health secretary, Lord Lansley, has revealed he is being treated for bowel cancer. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, he said he was having chemotherapy after being diagnosed nine months ago but had ""every reason to hope"" he will recover. Lord Lansley called for improvements to bowel cancer screening after he introduced a scheme in 2010. He said funding cuts and staff shortages meant it was only available to 50% of the population. Lord Lansley told the paper he was ""lucky"" to have been diagnosed early and that the stage 3 tumours had not spread to his liver. He said he went to his GP after ""much nagging"" from his wife with spreading back pain. The 61-year-old also revealed he had had a seven-hour operation on his bowel. Bowel cancer 'never crossed my mind' 'One-stop shops' for cancer diagnosis As health secretary between 2010 and 2012, he put forward a bowelscope screening to test for cancer from the age of 55 which he meant to roll out nationally in England by the end of 2016. He said: ""A lack of endoscopists and difficulties with IT have frustrated delivery."" Lord Lansley said he would have been been called up automatically if the scheme had been fully implemented. He added: ""I want to know that for others like me in future, with better knowledge about symptoms, with earlier improved screening in place, and with a new focus on personalised preventative medicine, it really isn't about luck."" His comments come after BBC presenter George Alagiah, who is receiving treatment for bowel cancer for the second time, saidhis disease may have been spotted sooner if he had been screened. The Department of Health said it was working to make the screening programme more effective with plans for a new test, called Fit, to be rolled out this year.

Universities 'not confronting racism',"Ms Martin said the government and universities needed to do more to confront racism Universities are more concerned about their reputations than confronting the racist abuse of students, the National Union of Students president has said. Shakira Martin told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she received calls from students reporting racist incidents on a daily basis. Former Universities Minister David Lammy said incidents needed to be cracked down on ""very aggressively"". Universities UK said there was no place for racism on a university campus. The issue hit the headlines earlier this month when a student at Nottingham Trent University tweeted footage of alleged racist abuse outside her room at her halls of residence. There are no overall figures for the number of racist incidents at universities, but a report by the NUS in 2011 found one in six black students had experienced racism at their institution. But the NUS president said the real number could be a lot higher, as racism was one of the biggest issues black and other ethnic minority students were facing on campus. ""They're not prioritising it and taking it seriously... universities are more concerned about their reputation than the wellbeing of their students,"" Ms Martin said. ""I speak to students on a daily basis that tell me that they have been called the N-word or been discriminated against because of their colour or not let into a club because of their race."" She said both the government and universities needed to do more to resolve the problem. ""People feeling unsafe on campus, people feeling not welcome on campus, has a detrimental impact to how they feel to study and their outcomes,"" she said. ""This is something that we need to tackle, not because it's in the headlines of the media, but every student has the needs to be safe on campus."" Ms Martin said there should be a conversation about solutions led by the students who were experiencing racial abuse. ""It should be a standard procedure on our institutions that there is a zero tolerance to any forms of racism and discrimination,"" she said. ""And I think that the government needs to work with institutions and give them the money and the funding that is needed to support students that are going through this."" Labour MP and former Universities Minister, David Lammy, also said institutions must act. ""Universities have to redouble their efforts to support students on campus and have to have a zero-tolerance approach to anything that comes anywhere near racial hatred,"" he said. He said the increase in race hate on campus was a reflection of wider issues in society. ""I'm afraid there are young people arriving on university campuses listening to some of the xenophobia and racist conversations that they might have heard in the communities from which they're coming from, even sadly in their own family homes, and replicating this behaviour in the freedom of university,"" he said. ""So, we have seen a spike. It is a problem and it needs to be cracked down on very very aggressively."" The umbrella group Universities UK said universities had a vital role to play in promoting a ""safe and inclusive environment in which students and staff of all backgrounds and ethnicities can flourish"". ""The sector is clear that there is no place for racism on a university campus, nor anywhere else,"" said a spokesman. ""These issues are not isolated to universities. However, UK universities are in a position to lead the way in preventing and responding to hate crime. ""Ultimately, a long-term commitment by senior leaders will be vital to ensuring our universities are safe places to live, work and study."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said there was ""absolutely no place"" for any form of hatred, discrimination or racism in society. ""Universities have clear responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 in this regard. ""I expect institutions to act swiftly to investigate and address hate crime, including racist related incidents reported to them."" Jordan, a maths student at the University of Surrey, was a victim of a racially aggravated assault last February. ""Fifteen students beat me up because of my skin, the colour of my skin,"" he says. Jordan couldn't walk for two weeks after the attack The group swore at him using racially abusive language as they walked past on campus. They then attacked him and he passed out, before they were chased off. ""The next thing I know I was in an ambulance being rushed to hospital because I had received quite severe blows - muscular injuries, some ligament injuries as well, to my head, my neck, my spine. ""I went home and I cried for a solid two hours,"" he says. Jordan could not walk for two weeks after the beating, but his physical injuries have now healed. The emotional impact took a little longer. ""I felt unsafe, scared to be alone, especially at night time. So for a lot of months I struggled, sort of trying to leave alone, encouraging myself - you know, 'You can go to this lecture. You can walk that distance,'"" he says. ""If I saw a rowdy group of white students, maybe at night time or otherwise, and I was alone, I'd instantly feel a sense of fear."" There was not enough evidence to press charges against those arrested, who were students at a different university. The University of Surrey said it remained appalled by the assault and racism was not tolerated in its community.

Fox proposes Sky News sale to DisneyThe firm says it would sell Sky News to Disney in an effort to ease its proposed acquisition of Sky.3m3 minutes agoBusiness,"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has said it would sell off Sky News to Disney or ring-fence it to try to allay regulatory concerns over its proposed acquisition of Sky. Fox wants to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. But it faces regulatory problems after the Competition and Markets Authority found the Â£11.7bn deal was not in the public interest. Fox had already pledged to ensure the independence of Sky News. The Murdoch family's news outlets are currently consumed by nearly a third of the UK's population across TV, radio, online and newspapers. The Murdoch Family Trust controls News Corporation, which publishes newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. Sky was the top gainer on the FTSE 100 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with shares up about 2%. Under the proposed new deal, the news channel would become a distinct company within Sky, run by the head of Sky News. Funding for Sky News would also be guaranteed for 15 years. Previously, Fox had said it would be funded for 10 years. The executive chairmen of Sky, Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, and the chief executive, Chase Carey, would not try to influence editorial decisions made by the head of Sky News, according to a statement by 21st Century Fox. The company had already proposed remedies to the CMA's concerns, includinghaving an independent board for Sky News. However, critics of that proposal, including politicians such as Ed Miliband, Vince Cable and Kenneth Clarke, had said that the head of Sky News would still be appointed by the head of 21st Century Fox and so could be influenced by the Murdochs. Fox hit back at those politicians on Tuesday, saying their assertions were ""unsupported and fanciful"". Fox also proposed selling off Sky News to Disney, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox goes through. Disney's proposed takeover of 21st Century Fox, which has yet to be approved by regulators, includes Fox's current 39% stake in Sky. Even if that takeover gets knocked back, Sky News would still be sold off under the new proposal. Disney chief executive Bob Iger is keen on Sky and has said he is ""committed"" to Sky News, which is loss-making. US media giant Comcasthas also thrown its hat into the ring for Skywith a Â£22.1bn bid in February. Comcast has a broadband division serving 29 million US customers. It also owns NBC and Universal Pictures and wants to buy a majority stake in Sky. Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor This is great news for Sky shareholders. If Sky News is sold to Disney or legally separated from the rest of Sky, then the thorny issue of Murdoch control over Sky News - to add to the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times - is finally laid to rest. What we will then have is a straight shoot out between 21st Century Fox and US rival Comcast to acquire Sky. A proper auction between those two bidders will mean a higher price for Sky. Currently Fox is offering Â£10.75 per share and Comcast has indicated it would be prepared to bid Â£12.50. Directors at Sky are pretty confident that Fox will have to come in with a better offer. At that point, we will see how serious Comcast really is in its bid to derail Rupert Murdoch's carefully laid plans to sell Fox to Disney and effectively dismantle a media empire it has taken a lifetime to build.

"Facebook chief fires back at Apple bossMark Zuckerberg says it is ""extremely glib"" to suggest Facebook does not care about its users.11h11 hours agoTechnology","Mr Zuckerberg has seen shares in his company fall steeply since the start of the Cambridge Analytical scandal Facebook's chief executive has defended his leadership following criticism from his counterpart at Apple. Mark Zuckerberg said it was ""extremely glib"" to suggest that because the public did not pay to use Facebook that the firm did not care about them. Last week, Apple'sTim Cook said it was,externalan ""invasion of privacy"" to traffic in users' personal lives. And when asked what he would do if he were Mr Zuckerberg, Mr Cook replied: ""I wouldn't be in that situation."" Facebook has faced intense criticism after it emerged that it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from about 50 million of its users, but had relied on the political consultancy to self-certify that it had deleted the information. Channel 4 Newshas since reported that at least,externalsome of the data in question is still in circulation despite Cambridge Analytica insisting it had destroyed the material. Mr Zuckerberg was asked about Mr Cook's comments during a lengthy interview given to news site Voxabout the privacy scandal,external. He also acknowledged that Facebook was still not transparent enough about some of the choices it had taken, and floated the idea of an independent panel being able to override some of its decisions. Mr Cook has spoken in public twice since Facebook's data-mining controversy began. Tim Cook had said he would not have let himself be in Mr Zuckerberg's current situation On 23 March, he took part in the China Development Forum in Beijing. ""I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,"" news agencyBloomberg quoted him as saying,externalin response to a question about the social network's problems. ""The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life - from my own point of view it shouldn't exist."" Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo Facebook privacy settings revamped after scandal Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Then in an interview with MSNBC and Recode on 28 March, Mr Cook said: ""I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation. However, I think we're beyond that here."" During this second appearance,external- which has yet to be broadcast in full - he added: ""We could make a tonne of money if we monetised our customer, if our customer was our product. We've elected not to do that... Privacy to us is a human right."" Apple makes most of its profits from selling smartphones, tablets and other computers, as well as associated services such as online storage and its various media stores. This contrasts with other tech firms whose profits are largely derived from advertising, including Google, Twitter and Facebook. Facebook's reputation has been tarnished by the Cambridge Analytica revelations Mr Zuckerberghad previously told CNN,externalthat he was ""open"" to new regulations. But he defended his business model when questioned about Mr Cook's views, although he mentioned neither Apple nor its leader by name. ""I find that argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth,"" he said. ""The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can't afford to pay."" He added: ""I think it's important that we don't all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you, because that sounds ridiculous to me."" Mr Zuckerberg also defended his leadership by invoking Amazon's chief executive. ""I make all of our decisions based on what's going to matter to our community and focus much less on the advertising side of the business,"" he said. ""I thought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying: ""There are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less."" Elsewhere in the 49-minute interview, Mr Zuckerberg said he hoped to make Facebook more ""democratic"" by giving members a chance to challenge decisions its own review team had taken about what content to permit or ban. Eventually, he said, he wanted something like the ""Supreme Court"", in which people who did not work for the company made the ultimate call on what was acceptable speech. Mr Zuckerberg also responded to recent criticism from a UN probe into allegations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar Last month,one of the human rights investigators saidFacebook had ""turned into a beast"" and had ""played a determining role"" in stirring up hatred against the group. Mr Zuckerberg claimed messages had been sent ""to each side of the conflict"" via Facebook Messenger, attempting to make them go to the same locations to fight. But he added that the firm had now set up systems to detect such activity. ""We stop those messages from going through,"" he added. ""But this is certainly something that we're paying a lot of attention to."" Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo Zuckerberg's snub to MPs 'astonishing' Facebook data sharing - time to act?

""Universities have to redouble their efforts to support students on campus and have to have a zero-tolerance approach to anything that comes anywhere near racial hatred,"" he said. He said the increase in race hate on campus was a reflection of wider issues in society. ""I'm afraid there are young people arriving on university campuses listening to some of the xenophobia and racist conversations that they might have heard in the communities from which they're coming from, even sadly in their own family homes, and replicating this behaviour in the freedom of university,"" he said. ""So, we have seen a spike. It is a problem and it needs to be cracked down on very very aggressively."" The umbrella group Universities UK said universities had a vital role to play in promoting a ""safe and inclusive environment in which students and staff of all backgrounds and ethnicities can flourish"". ""The sector is clear that there is no place for racism on a university campus, nor anywhere else,"" said a spokesman. ""These issues are not isolated to universities. However, UK universities are in a position to lead the way in preventing and responding to hate crime. ""Ultimately, a long-term commitment by senior leaders will be vital to ensuring our universities are safe places to live, work and study."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said there was ""absolutely no place"" for any form of hatred, discrimination or racism in society. ""Universities have clear responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 in this regard. ""I expect institutions to act swiftly to investigate and address hate crime, including racist related incidents reported to them."" Jordan, a maths student at the University of Surrey, was a victim of a racially aggravated assault last February. ""Fifteen students beat me up because of my skin, the colour of my skin,"" he says. Jordan couldn't walk for two weeks after the attack The group swore at him using racially abusive language as they walked past on campus. They then attacked him and he passed out, before they were chased off. ""The next thing I know I was in an ambulance being rushed to hospital because I had received quite severe blows - muscular injuries, some ligament injuries as well, to my head, my neck, my spine. ""I went home and I cried for a solid two hours,"" he says. Jordan could not walk for two weeks after the beating, but his physical injuries have now healed. The emotional impact took a little longer. ""I felt unsafe, scared to be alone, especially at night time. So for a lot of months I struggled, sort of trying to leave alone, encouraging myself - you know, 'You can go to this lecture. You can walk that distance,'"" he says. ""If I saw a rowdy group of white students, maybe at night time or otherwise, and I was alone, I'd instantly feel a sense of fear."" There was not enough evidence to press charges against those arrested, who were students at a different university. The University of Surrey said it remained appalled by the assault and racism was not tolerated in its community.

Israel puts UN migrant deal on holdPM Benjamin Netanyahu suspends a plan that would see African migrants sent to Western countries.22m23 minutes agoMiddle East,"African migrants at a detention facility in southern Israel Israel's prime minister has cancelled a deal with the UN to relocate African migrants living in the country, a day after reaching the agreement. Benjamin Netanyahu said he had taken the decision after consulting residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants live. He said he would now consider ""all options... to remove the infiltrators"". The fate of more than 30,000 migrants, who entered the country illegally, has long been a hugely contentious issue.

Corbyn attends left wing Jewish event,"This video can not be played Leaders ""have to listen"", says Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to attend a dinner organised by a left-wing Jewish group following criticism from mainstream Jewish leaders. Asked if he had any regrets about being at the Jewdas event, the Labour leader said: ""Not in the slightest."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups said it cast fresh doubts on Mr Corbyn's commitment to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour. Jewdas has previously suggested anti-Semitism claims were right-wing smears. Speaking on a campaign visit to Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: ""I went to a very interesting and very enjoyable Seder supper and I spent a lot of time talking to young Jewish people about their life in Britain and experiences of anti-Semitism they have had and how they view the future of our country. ""I think that is what political leaders should do - listen to people."" He added: ""Anti-Semitism is a cancer and awful in our society and has to be eradicated wherever it rears its head."" A spokesman for the Labour leader said Mr Corbyn had attended the Seder event, a ritual service held on Passover, ""with Jewish members of his local community"" in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the party. This video can not be played Jon Lansman told the Today programme ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist"" ""He wrote to the Board of Deputies and Jewish Leadership Council last week to ask for an urgent formal meeting to discuss tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and in society,"" the spokesman added. Jewdas, which describes itself as a ""radical"" and ""alternative"" Jewish collective, is at odds with mainstream Jewish groups over allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour. It has accused the Jewish Board of Deputies, Jewish Leadership Council and Jewish Labour Movement of ""playing a dangerous game"" and previously dismissed anti-Semitism allegations as right-wing smears. Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""If Jeremy Corbyn goes to their event, how can we take his stated commitment to be an ally against anti-Semitism seriously?"" Momentum: Labour failed on anti-Semitism How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded The Jewish Labour Movement said Mr Corbyn's attendance at the Jewdas event ""topped off the worst week on record of awful relations between the Labour Party and the Jewish community"". Spokesman Ivor Caplin, a former MP, said: ""When we called on the leader of our party to show moral leadership and take decisive action to stamp out anti-Semitism, this is not what we had in mind."" Leading Corbyn supporter Jon Lansman said the Labour leader's attendance at the event was ""not as significant as it's being made out."" Mr Lansman, founder of Momentum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It was his night off, he had nothing in his official diary, his office didn't know he was there."" Mr Lansman said past comments by Jewdas about Israel were ""certainly not helpful to Jeremy or the cause of opposing anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"". But he said Mr Corbyn was keen to meet the leaders of ""mainstream Jewish organisations"", adding: ""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist."" He said accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour could not be dismissed as ""smears"" against Mr Corbyn, and there was a widespread problem of ""unconscious bias"" in the party which needed to addressed by a ""programme of education and training"". In a tweet, Labour MP John Woodcock. a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said meeting the group gave the message that ""extreme views are OK"". Allow Twitter content?

US winemakers feel crushed,"A threat of tariffs from China is causing ferment in America's wine industry In California's Livermore Valley, about an hour east of San Francisco, some 5,000 cases of Wente Vineyards wine are waiting in a warehouse, their journey to China suddenly suspended. The bottles have been caught up in a larger trade dispute, in which the US and China have exchanged threats to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of products, including American wine. Wine might seem like a bit player in the fight, which revolves around American concerns about Chinese state subsidies and rules they say pressure US technology firms and car-makers to hand over intellectual property. But as the two countries settle down to negotiate, the industry offers a glimpse of what's at stake in the confrontation, which has led to unease on financial markets and prompted warnings of a trade war. ""It's a wait-and-see game right now,"" says Michael Parr, vice president of international sales for Wente Family Estates, which counts China as one of its top 10 markets and put its shipment on hold as the tariff talk flared. American officials have downplayed the dangers of retaliation to the US economy. Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained WTO: US-China trade war would have 'severe' economic impact But China, which included wine on a list of 128 products worth $3bn targeted for potential tariffs, is confident that its growing market power, fuelled by a rising middle class, will give America pause. That's true even when it comes to wine, which represents a tiny fraction of the trade between the two countries. Exports represent only 5% of overall US wine sales. And only about 5% of wine exports, some $79m, are destined for China. Wine-makers are worried about tariffs anyway. They say even if they can afford to lose business in China now, the country is critical to the industry's future. ""We're not in a position to lose market share,"" Mr Parr says. Wine consumption in China has increased almost five-fold since 2000 and sales of foreign wines have surged When Mr Parr started in the business in China in 1994, working for the country's first importer of foreign wine, most products were aimed at expats and foreign businessmen. But Chinese tastes have changed. Wine consumption in China has increased almost five-fold since 2000, with imports surging from 1% to about a third of the market, says Chuan Zhou, a research director at UK-based Wine Intelligence. Interest in wine is also helping to drive tourism, making China the biggest source of foreign visitors to Napa Valley in 2016. China is the Napa Valley Wine Train's third largest international market; at the Beringer and Sterling vineyards in California, 20% of tours purchased are in Mandarin. The Australian wine lessons bound for China Chinese wine-tasters scoop surprise win in France Wente, a family-owned vineyard that produces roughly 700,000 cases of wine a year and exports about a fifth, has benefited from the surge in demand, with exports to China rising 80% this year before the talk of tariffs. ""It's one of the top [markets] in terms of growth rates and growth potential,"" Mr Parr says. Michael Parr says America can't afford to fall behind in the Chinese wine market In some ways, American wines are playing catch-up in China, where French wines have long dominated. US bottles account for less than 5% of foreign wine sales, their appeal hurt in part by high prices tied to hefty fees China levies on most alcohol imports. Australia and Chile signed free trade deals with China in recent years to reduce those taxes, helping their sales. Ridge Vineyards, which got a boost in China after one of its wines was served at a 2013 dinner hosted by President Barack Obama for President Xi Jinping, says the proposed 15% tariff would raise prices further, putting American firms at another disadvantage. ""We were already fighting an uphill battle in a way, and now if you tag an additional 15% on top of that .... I don't see how this doesn't have an impact on our business,"" says David Amadia, the vineyard's president. The California Wine Institute, which represents about 1,000 vineyards and wineries in the US, has been pushing to raise  the profile of California wines, spending on social media campaigns in China, trade missions and offering master classes. The organisation, which argues the White House should support wine exports, says a new 15% tax could be ""catastrophic"" to its efforts to make inroads in the market. ""Something like an additional 15% in tariffs could really knock the feet out from under us,"" says Linsey Gallagher, the institute's vice president of international marketing. China has met US plans for tariffs with counter-threats, but some hope the dispute will end in compromise Despite the concerns about the future, analysts expect the economic damage to be limited in the short-term. Inside China, tariffs would likely mean higher prices. But Jim Boyce, a Beijing-based wine consultant who writes on the Grape Wall of China blog, says American brands are likely to be able to hold onto many of their customers, who were already prepared to spend more. ""Of course, no tariff is better than a tariff, but the impact isn't nearly as bad as it would be for some,"" he says. If demand in China does slip, many wine-makers say they are confident they will find buyers for those bottles in other markets. The volumes are small enough that no change in prices is expected. Most US wine is consumed in America If the damage is limited, what is the point of the threat? Gary Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the threat of tariffs reminds the US that China is willing to retaliate - and has kept its options open when it comes to bigger items such as aircraft. But he says China's list of targeted items, filled with high-profile products like wine, is intended to inflict political rather than economic pain, creating the conditions for a compromise. The wine industry - and many others - have their fingers crossed.

How the anti-Semitism saga unfolded,"Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party A row about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has been prompted by Jeremy Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. But this is not the first time the Labour leader has faced calls to deal with anti-Semitism in recent years. The current row can be traced back to two allegations in 2016 - a year after Mr Corbyn became leader. The first was against the MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah. It was revealed that the year before she became the MP,she shared a graphicshowing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"", with the comment ""problem solved"". A number of other posts emerged, with her comparing Israel to the Nazis and saying ""the Jews are rallying"". She apologised and resigned from her post as John McDonnell's parliamentary private secretary. This video can not be played 2016: Naz Shah blames ignorance for posts she admits were anti-Semitic Mr Corbyn said Ms Shah's remarks were ""offensive and unacceptable"", andshe was suspended from the party. She was reinstated in July and blamed her ""ignorance"" for the posts, admitting they were anti-Semitic. Labour's National Executive Committee gave her a formal warning, told her to apologise for bringing the party into disrepute and warned that if there was another incident she would be expelled. It was during the row over Ms Shah that the former London Mayor Ken Livingstone made his own comments that were alleged to have been anti-Semitic. Mr Livingstone appeared on BBC Radio London defending the MP and said he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic. He added: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" This led to widespread criticism of Mr Livingstone, with Labour MP John Mann accusing him of being a ""Nazi apologist"" in front of a media scrum. This video can not be played 2016: Ken Livingstone said Naz Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic Mr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding that the Nazi leader was ""a monster from start to finish"". But he said he had simply been quoting historical ""facts"". The long-time ally of Mr Corbyn wassuspended by the party for a year, but he refused to apologise and continued to repeat his comments. He was then suspended for a further 12 months in April 2017 after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Mr Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. His suspension hasnow been extended againpending the outcome of an internal investigation. It was after Ms Shah's comments and Mr Livingstone's defence thatMr Corbyn announced an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the partyat the end of April 2016. It was led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of human rights campaign group Liberty. She announced she had joined the Labour Party after her appointment as chair on the inquiry. The inquiry lasted for two months and at the end of June 2016, Ms Chakrabarti concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism,there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Ms Chakrabarti made 20 recommendations,external, including: Abusive references to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics and racial or religious tropes and stereotypes should have no place in Labour Party discourse. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. There should be procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure. The appointment of a general counsel to the Labour Party to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. The party should increase the ethnic diversity of its staff. However, she said she did not approve of lifetime bans for party membership. Two months later, she became a Labour peer - the only appointment to the House of Lords Mr Corbyn has so far made. Around the same time,allegations of anti-Semitism arose from the Oxford University Labour Club. They claimed that members of the club had discussed Zionists rigging British elections, frequently used the term ""Zio"" and said that European attacks on Jews were justified because of Gaza. The allegations led to the Labour Party's national student organisation conducting their own inquiry, and its report was leaked to the press in the summer of 2016. In it,Baroness Royall concluded there had been ""some incidents"" of anti-Semitic behaviourand ""behaviour and language that would once have been intolerable is now tolerated"" in the club. However, she said there was ""no evidence the club is itself institutionally anti-Semitic"". Just under a year later, two students were cleared by the NEC's disputes committee of being anti-Semitic. 'Anti-Semitic behaviour' was said to have taken place at the Oxford University Labour Club Despite the inquiries,promises to adopt tough new rulesto tackle anti-Semitism at its conference and pledges from Mr Corbyn that racism would be ""rooted out"", a number of other allegations have come to light during his tenure. These included: Labour activist Jackie Walker being suspended from the party in 2016 forclaiming Jewish people were ""financiers of the sugar and slave trade"" Author Miko Peled allegedly saying during a speech at a fringe conference event that party membersshould be able to debate whether or not the Holocaust happened,external- he is not a member of the party Brighton and Hove Labour housing campaigner Daniel Harris being suspended afterposting a video on Facebook,externalfeaturing the faces of three Labour councillors superimposed on the heads of dancing Jewish figures A member from Barnet, London, being suspendedfor writing anti-Semitic posts on social media, leading to a councillor receiving abuse for reporting it Now, Mr Corbyn himself is facing criticism aftersending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockefeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Allow Twitter content?

The Labour leader has since called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by anti-Semitism in the party. Aftera letter from Jewish groupsthat held Mr Corbyn personally responsible for the ""hostile"" environment Jews in the Labour Party face, he is facing calls from some of his own MPs to take tougher action. But members of the Jewish Voice for Labour group claim the two organisations behind the letter do not represent the views of the ""great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness"" and that there is ""massively more anti-Semitism on the right of politics than on the left"". Responding to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council with a letter of his own, Mr Corbyn said he would not ""tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in or around our party and movement"". He acknowledged that anti-Semitic attitudes had ""surfaced more often in [Labour's] ranks in recent years"" and emphasised the need for a ""deeper understanding of what constitutes anti-Semitism"".

Should I worry about a trade war?,"President Trump has imposed tariffs on a range of Chinese goods US President Donald Trump has shaken the foundations of global trade, slapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China. All these countries are responding in kind, retaliating with levies on thousands of US products. This puts the world's largest economies at each other's throats. But what is a trade war? How does protectionism work? And how will it all affect you? It's what it sounds like - a trade war is when countries try to attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas. One country will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation. This can hurt other nations' economies and lead to rising political tensions between them. US President Donald Trump reckons trade wars are ""good"" and easy. He's not afraid to raise tariffs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade It's a tax on a product made abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into the country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. The intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting your country's economy. The president has placed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from around the world, in particular China. He's imposed a 10% levy on $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of Chinese products so far. In May, he announcedplans to impose a 25% tariff on $325bn of other Chinese goods,external. Mr Trump said the $100bn gained from the tariffs will be used to buy US agricultural products, which will then be sent to ""poor and starving countries"" for ""humanitarian assistance"". He also wants to cut the trade deficit with China - a country he has accused of unfair trade practices since before he became president. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump made a big point on the campaign trail about cutting the country's trade deficits. He's convinced it hurts US manufacturing, and has said time and time again on the stump and on Twitter thatthe US must do more to tackle them,external. It's a term meaning the difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country. And the US has a massive trade deficit with China. Last year,it widened by $43.6bn to $419.2bn. He wants to cut back this trade deficit, and he intends to use tariffs to do it. But while the president hates them, trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing. Many wealthier countries have in recent decades shifted from manufacturing economies to service economies - focusing on areas like banking, travel and tourism. Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? Services contribute to the majority of the US economy's net income. China, in contrast, doesn't export nearly as many services as it does manufactured goods. So the president's obsession with trade deficits is not always popular, with critics damning the administration's moves as protectionism. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Protectionism is trying to use restrictions such as tariffs to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition. Take Mr Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. In May 2018, the president announceda 25% tariff on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. The Trump administration claims the US relies too much on other countries for its metals, and that it couldn't make enough weapons or vehicles using its own industry if a war broke out. Critics point out the US gets most of its steel from Canada and the EU - staunch US allies. In theory, taxing foreign steel and aluminium will mean US companies will buy local steel instead. The thinking is that will boost the US steel and aluminium industries, as more companies will want to buy their goods. Steel and aluminium prices will go up in the US because there will be less of these goods coming in from abroad - so the greater demand for local steel will push up the price, lifting profits for steel makers. Protectionism: What Trump has in common with Lincoln and Ferris Bueller The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 Sort of. US steel makers could get a boost - demand will drive new hires and bigger profits. But the US companies that need raw materials, like car and aeroplane makers, will see their costs rise. Could Trump tariffs damage US steel? Steel tariffs - what impact will they really have? That means they might have to put up the prices on their finished products. That would hurt consumers. So car prices could go up in the US. As could prices for gadgets, plane tickets and even beer - the price of making a can could rise. Making beer cans could become more pricey - and that cost could be pushed onto consumers They could affect people around the world - especially since China has retaliated. The world's second-largest economy has taxed US agricultural and industrial products, from soybeans, pork and cotton to aeroplanes, cars and steel pipes. It has also pledged to take ""necessary countermeasures"" over Trump's latest proposed tariffs. Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all In theory, China could also tax US tech companies like Apple. That would hit the tech giant, and it could be forced to raise its prices to compensate. A global trade war could hurt consumers around the world by making it harder for all companies to operate, forcing them to push higher prices onto their customers. Depends who you ask. Free trade is the opposite of protectionism - it means as few tariffs as possible, giving people the freedom to buy cheaper or better-made products from anywhere in the world. This is great for companies trying to cut costs, and that's helped drive prices down and boost the world economy. Free trade has led to a vast expansion of shipping and transfer of goods around the world Cars, smart phones, food, flowers - free trade has brought affordable products from around the world to your home. But at the same time, that means companies are less likely to buy local products. Why buy domestic when you can get more, cheaper, from a different country? This means the loss of jobs in wealthier countries, and uneven growth - while free trade has made some people richer, it's made others poorer. No idea. Historians have pointed out that tariffs often lead to higher costs for the consumer, while economists across the board are against the plans. The Republican Party is also overwhelmingly against Mr Trump on tariffs - they're big supporters of free trade. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK firm challenges blue passport decision,"This video can not be played De La Rue boss Martin Sutherland The government has granted a two-week extension in the process to decide who will make UK passports after Brexit. British company De La Rue - which had lost the Â£490m contract to French-Dutch Gemalto in March - had requested the longer ""standstill period"", which has now been agreed by the Home Office. It means a final decision will now be made on Tuesday 17 April. De La Rue is also taking initial steps ""towards initiating appeal proceedings against the provisional decision"". However, it has refused to clarify what this means legally or how any appeal process might proceed. The firm says the time extension will give it more time for close scrutiny of the criteria that the Home Office used in coming to its decision to award the contract to Gemalto. It says it will assess that information and whether it might help it in its arguments. De La Rue's bid was not the cheapest, but it said it was ""the highest quality and technically most secure"". ""We have a preferred bidder, which demonstrated it was best able to meet the needs of the passport service, delivering a high quality and secure product and providing best value for money for the taxpayerâ¦ that remains the government's position,"" said the prime minister's official spokesman. But the extension ""will give all bidders the chance to find out more detail and get more information from the Home Officeâ¦ this is standard process."" The spokesman added: ""This has been a rigorous, fair and open process."" The current EU-themed burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. However, people are expected to keep their current passports until they expire. Brexit: All you need to know Growth 'more important than Brexit' Brexit boost for consumers short-lived, says IFS Before the bidding process extension, a spokesperson for De La Rue had said: ""We can accept that we weren't the cheapest, even if our tender represented a significant discount on the current price. ""It has also been suggested that the winning bid was well below our cost price, which causes us to question how sustainable it is."" This video can not be played Why British passports are changing colours after Brexit â and do Brits welcome the switch? The decision to give a foreign company the contract had been criticisedby pro-Brexit government figures. Under EU procurement rules, the Home Office was required to open up the bidding process to European firms, although De La Rue has manufactured UK passports since 2009. Church sign proclaims 'Chris is Risen' Teens need Saturday jobs says minister April tax changes: Will I be better or worse off? The Home Office had said the proposed Gemalto deal could save the taxpayer Â£100m-Â£120m and that 70 new jobs would be created in the UK, at sites in Fareham, in Hampshire, and Heywood in Lancashire. It comes as a Daily Mail petition calling for the Home Office to give the contract to a British firm reached 273,000 signatures. The Home Office issues more than six million passports annually and is the only provider of passports to British citizens. Passport procurement process not complete.

"Girl, 17, shot dead in north LondonThe victim was pronounced dead at the scene in Tottenham after being found with a gunshot wound.4m4 minutes agoLondon","The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Two shootings in London in the space of an hour - including a drive-by attack - have left a 17-year-old girl and a boy, 16, dead. Friends said the girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, was killed ""for no reason"" in Tottenham on Monday night. The Met has confirmed she died when ""shots were fired"" from a vehicle as it drove past a group of young people. Two miles away, in Walthamstow, the boy was found with gunshot wounds, with another boy, 15, who had stab injuries. The boy who suffered gunshot wounds died later in hospital, police said. Both attacks come amid concernsover rising violent crime in London. Police say the shootings are not linked. Tanesha, whose name has not been officially confirmed, was pronounced dead at 22:43 BST near Northumberland Park, Tottenham. Police remain at the scene. Grieving family members and friends left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road on Tuesday. One friend described her as a ""very lovable little girl in the community, she was not involved in any sort of problems with anyone"". Friends and family members left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road Tyesha, 21, who knew Tanesha, told the BBC she was ""just chilling with her friends"" when she was shot. ""The car just pulled up and just started shooting,"" she said. ""Her friend came banging on my door so I came out quickly. I even tried to save her - had to, had to."" She said the gunshot wound, below the victim's breast, was not immediately visible and it looked like she was ""having a fit"". ""I put her on her side and I was just rubbing her back, saying 'Everything's going to be OK'. I just can't believe it - so young. It's ridiculous now."" A witness said a woman, believed to be the victim's mother, began ""screaming"" when she discovered the girl shortly after the shooting. Det Ch Supt Richard Wood described the attack as ""terrible"". ""At this stage we're keeping a completely open mind, it's too early to say what the motive is or indeed if it's just a case of wrong place, wrong time,"" he said. ""We do know that a vehicle drove past a group of young people, shots were fired from the vehicle and sadly the young lady lost her life."" Are black knife deaths being ignored? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was ""deeply worried"" about London's rise in violent crime - particularly in his area. ""There is no single cause, but there has been a big spike in both gun crime and knife crime across London,"" he said. ""Certainly my constituency finds itself at the epicentre of that."" He said cuts to police budgets meant fewer neighbourhood officers on the streets who were ""able to pick up intelligence"" within communities. The 17-year-old girl is the ninth teenager to be murdered in London this year Two teenagers were shot and stabbed in a separate incident in Walthamstow, east London A local resident, who did not want to be named, said she heard multiple shots, which sounded like a ""bomb"" exploding. She said: ""It's not nice. I've lived here for 40 years, and in the last two or three years it's become not a nice place. ""There are so many drugs, stabbings and killings."" Greg McKenzie, BBC London The community in Tottenham has already been gripped with grief and shock that a young woman has had her life ended so tragically. I'm told there were dozens of people out until 02:00 BST consoling each other, while other residents woke to see police cordons and press at the scene. There was a poignant silence when the body of the 17-year-old was taken away, broken only by the sound of people crying. In this area there are people - no matter what age - who are fearful. Residents spoke about self-imposed curfews and mothers not letting their children out after 19:00. Amid the sadness, there is also anger and questions over what the Mayor of London is doing. David Lammy MP claimed Tottenham was at the ""epicentre"" of London's rising violent crime Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said stabbings were common in the area. The Tottenham resident said: ""It's so violent around here. I nearly got stabbed the other day. If you've been around Tottenham a long time you get it."" Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Watch: ""My kids don't see this side of me"" One witness, who works in a nearby shop, said he heard three distinct bangs, which sounded like ""fireworks"". He said he saw the victim with blood on her chest sitting with friends following the shooting, before police cars and ambulances arrived. Close to the scene, residents held an impromptu celebration of Tanesha's life until the early morning. ""We were out here until one o'clock in the morning,"" a neighbour said. ""It was really heart-breaking. We were here for ages but clearly she was already gone."" Forensic officers have spent most of the day at the scene gathering any evidence School friend Candice Hassan said she found out about the murder on social media just half-an-hour after the shooting. ""It was shocking. Everyone's upset obviously - one minute I see her and the next minute I don't,"" she said. ""One hour before her death, I saw her on Snapchat - one hour before she got shot. Everyone knows Tanesha, she's just a humble girl. ""It was just the wrong place at the wrong time. She didn't deserve any of that."" The 17-year-old, who went to the Gladesmore Community School with Tanesha, added: ""I have heard it was a drive-by shooting - obviously gang-related - Wood Green and Tottenham."" Formal identification has yet to take place. However, Tanesha's next-of-kin have been informed of her death. The Walthamstow crime scene, in Markhouse Road, is just over two miles (3.5km) from the site of the Tottenham killing. A police cordon remains in place around Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where the girl was pronounced dead Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the 16-year-old boy was taken to a hospital in east London. He had been in ""intensive care"". Scotland Yard said the 15-year-old boy who was stabbed in Walthamstow has life-changing but not life-threatening injuries. There have been no arrests in either investigation. It brings the total of fatal shootings in London this year to seven, including one man who died after being shot and stabbed. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle. ""We have already consulted on new laws on offensive and dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in private.""

Professor says Â£773 to fill Panini albumMum's tough love lesson divides parentsTeen hits lottery jackpot on 18th birthdayVideoVideo,"Filling this year's Panini World Cup sticker book costs Â£773.60, twice the cost for Euro 2016, according to maths expert Prof Paul Harper. The pages contain 32 squads of players, plus managers, stadiums and World Cup legends, totalling 682 stickers. A pack of five stickers has risen from 50p to 80p - a 60% increase. If you buy 137 packets and never get the same sticker twice, it will cost Â£109.60, but this is ""extremely unlikely"", says the professor. Prof Harper, from Cardiff University's School of Mathematics, worked out a formula to include the least probable number of duplicate stickers. In the end, he demonstrated that on average you would need to buy 4,832 stickers - or 967 packets - to complete the Italian-made book. One cost-saving measure is swapping stickers between friends, but even with that tactic, filling the album would be expensive. With 10 friends swapping, it could still cost them an average of Â£247 each to complete the album, according to the professor's calculations. 'Plastic attack' packaging protesters hit Tesco 'Youngest councillor' dies suddenly aged 21 Canadian buys lottery ticket on 18th birthday and wins jackpot In a statement, Panini said: ""If you have difficulty swapping, you can send off to Panini for your missing stickers."" ""The theoretical cost calculated by the academics assumes that the collector is in a bubble with no one to swap with or no access to the internet to send off to our missing stickers service."" In 2016, he made the same calculations for the 680-space Euro sticker book. It was Â£374, meaning the cost has more than doubled. While the Euro competition only had 24 squads - fewer than the World Cup - there were only two fewer stickers in the book printed two years ago. ""I can still recall the joy of finally completing my first Panini album as a young boy for the 1982 World Cup in Spain,"" said Prof Harper. ""Filling an album has become progressively more expensive over the years since then, not just because there are typically more teams competing now, but because Panini have become more creative about allocating spaces.""

Mum's tough love lesson divides parentsTeen hits lottery jackpot on 18th birthdayVideoVideo,"Cierra Brittany Forney with her son Anthony (R), daughter and youngest son What should you do if your child has become a bit, let's say, accustomed to the finer things in life? It's an issue that one mum in Georgia, US, tried to resolve when she realised her 13-year-old son was acting ""a little entitled"". Anthony was ""acting like he's too good to shop at Walmart, or making snarky comments about kids at school who shop at the Goodwill [a second-hand shop]. I don't tolerate that,"" Cierra Brittany Forney, 28, wrote in a Facebook post. She decided to teach him a lesson. ""It's the first time I've ever done anything like this,"" Cierra, an entrepreneur, told the BBC. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

She decided that Anthony should wear second-hand clothes to school for a week and took him to charity shop Goodwill with $20 (Â£14). ""Whatever he found is what he would have to wear. He isn't happy and shed a few tears but I firmly believe in 15 years he will look back and laugh at the day his Mom made him shop at Goodwill. ""I want to teach my kids that money isn't everything and if you have to degrade other people because of where they shop, then you too will shop there. ""We have had multiple discussions about how having nice things is a privilege, not a right, and he can have it all taken away in a second,"" Cierra explained.

However some people criticised her decision to showcase the lesson on social media. ""I'm concerned that you shamed your child to teach him a lesson in taking him to the store and in sharing his story so publicly,"" commented Jamie Bryant. Others responded that Cierra behaved as though shopping in charity shops is a punishment, pointing out that they routinely buy second-hand clothes for their families. On TuesdayCierra posted a response to some of the criticism,external, clarifying that her son had given permission to share the story.
