Husband with dementia 'drew the short straw',"Lynda Basford cared for her husband Michael at home for 13 years until last year ""It is like Michael walking into a fog,"" says Lynda Basford, describing the 13 years during which her husband Michael has descended into dementia. She has been at his side throughout. ""You can't quite hold on to him,"" she says, ""and as the years go by, he gets deeper and deeper into that fog and you can't do anything about it."" Michael needs a lot of support. He doesn't really know where he is and he no longer recognises his wife. Even remembering to eat requires encouragement. She looked after him for years in their own home with little support but, last year, it all became too much. She felt she could no longer keep him safe and reluctantly agreed he should move into a residential home. However, the financial support they get from their local authority does not cover the cost and their savings are rapidly disappearing. Now Lynda's strain over her husband's condition is compounded by money worries. ""I didn't realise"", she says, ""that if you have a terminal illness, your level and quality of care would be dependent on your bank balance."" This video can not be played Lynda Basford: ""Because he drew the short straw... he's having to pay for his treatment."" A new report produced for the BBC from the Health Foundation and three other leading research organisations says the failure by successive governments to reform social care has left many people without the support they need in care homes or in their own homes. It describes the current council-run means-tested system as a fundamental source of unfairness. An ageing population, more younger people with disabilities needing support, and budget cuts combine to leave local authorities struggling to meet the demand for help. The report highlights how budget pressure means the social care system is nearing crisis: councils already have to focus spending on people with the most severe needs 400,000 fewer people received publicly funded care in 2014 than in 2010 the funding shortfall is expected to reach Â£18bn by 2030 almost 7% of care worker jobs were vacant last year The report says this means that three-quarters of relatives of people who need care at home get no support and have not been able to take a respite break of even an hour from caring in the last 12 months. Lynda Basford questions why the support Michael needs is not provided by the NHS. ""Michael has drawn the short straw and has dementia and not some other terminal illness, so he is having to pay for his treatment - because his treatment is social care,"" she says. Michael gets some help from his local authority because he has less than Â£23,250 in savings, but the rate the council pays does not cover the Â£800-a-week fees of the  care home. It means that each week, Lynda pays Â£550 from their savings to make up the difference. She says it is only a matter of time before they run out of money and then she does not know what will happen. Next week, like the NHS, the care system will mark its seventieth anniversary. While the health service was set up as a separate institution delivering support that is free to those who need it, from the start services provided by councils for people struggling with daily tasks such as washing, dressing and taking medication, were means-tested. But in 1948, people did not survive with the sort of complex conditions that meant long-term social care was needed in the way it is now. Then, charities like the Alzheimer's Society did not exist - it was established 40 years ago because of the increasing number of people with dementia. The society's chief executive Jeremy Hughes says: ""When the funding system was set up in 1948, no-one intended to set up a separate system for one disease rather than another, we've got that by accident rather than design. It needs to change now if we are going to be fair and equitable for people over the next 10, 20, even the next 70 years."" The couple have been together for 40 years Last week, after announcing more money for the health service, the government said it was delaying the publication of long-awaited plans for the funding of the social care system until the autumn. Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, welcomed the extra cash for the NHS, but pointed to the urgent need for more money for social care. ""The NHS was founded 70 years ago to replace fear with security, so that people did not face bills they couldn't pay in time of illness. ""But that security is just not there for many of those who need social care today,"" said Ms Dixon. ""Many people assume social care is free of charge like the NHS, and it is a huge shock when they find out it isn't and the bills mount up. ""As local authority budgets are squeezed, more people are having to go without, pay themselves or rely on unpaid care from friends and families. The situation is unfair, stressful and inefficient and is long overdue for reform."" In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the social care system was under pressure and reforms would ""ensure it is sustainable for the future"". ""Health and social care are two sides of the same coin and any reforms must be aligned. That's why our forthcoming Green Paper will be published in the autumn, with the NHS plan. ""We have provided local authorities with Â£9.4bn in dedicated funding for social care over three years and will agree a sustainable funding settlement at the forthcoming spending review.""

Sudan court scraps teen's death sentence,"Noura Hussein was sentenced to five years in jail An appeals court in Sudan has overturned the death sentence of a woman who killed her husband after he allegedly raped her, her lawyer says. Noura Hussein, 19, was instead sentenced to five years in jail, lawyer Abdelaha Mohamad said. Her mother, Zainab Ahmed, told the BBC she was happy her daughter's life had been spared. International celebrities had backed an online campaign, #JusticeforNoura, to demand Ms Hussein's release. Last month, an Islamic court had sentenced her to death by hanging, following her conviction for the premeditated murder of her husband, Abdulrahman Mohamed Hammad. Ms Hussein said her husband had recruited some of his own cousins who allegedly held her down as he raped her. When he allegedly attempted to do the same the following day she lashed out at him with a knife and stabbed him to death. 'Hoping for a miracle to stop our daughter being hanged' Sudan country profile Child marriages declining, says Unicef Ms Hussein was forced into the marriage at the age of 16. Her husband, who was also her cousin, was 16 years her senior. According to a 2017 report by the UN's children's fund Unicef,one third of Sudanese girls are married before they turn 18,external. In a statement, charityAmnesty International called the decision ""hugely welcome news"",external, but said the five years in prison was a ""disproportionate punishment"". It urged the country to reform its laws on marriage and marital rape ""so that victims are not the ones who are penalised"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'I killed my rapist when he came back for my sister' The girl who stopped her own marriage 'I was 12 when I married a 35-year-old' Speaking to the BBC, Ms Hussein's mother said her daughter had ""hated herself"" after her husband first raped her. ""She had got a knife ready to take her own life if he touched her again,"" Zainab Ahmed said. Is a child bride really married every seven seconds? What is it like to be a child bride? After the husband's death, Ms Hussein ran to her family's home to tell them what had happened. Fearing revenge, her father took their whole family to the police station in a bid to protect them - where she was instead arrested. Her jail sentence caused international outrage, with celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Emma Watson tweeting their support for Ms Hussein.

NZ man 'flew to US to attack teen girl',"US police say they know nothing of Mr Skinner's background A New Zealand man flew to the US state of Virginia and was shot after trying to break into the home of a teenage girl whom he met online, police say. Troy George Skinner, 25, was shot in the neck by the girl's mother after smashing his way through a glass door. Goochland County Sheriff James Agnew said the man was also armed with a knife, duct tape and pepper spray. He travelled over 8,500 miles (13,500km) after the girl stopped speaking to him online, police say. ""This was not random, not spontaneous, this was something very planned,"" Sheriff Agnew said on Monday, describing Mr Skinner's two days of travel. ""It's a new world,"" he added. Mr Skinner was carrying a camouflage folding knife, duct tape, and pepper spray A landscaping brick was hurled through the family's glass door, police say Police say the man had taken three flights and a bus, and had from Auckland, New Zealand, to the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia. ""He was not invited here, he was not expected here, he had been told in the past that the daughter no longer wished to communicate with him,"" Sheriff Agnew said, adding that the two had met through Discord, an app that allows video-gamers to speak to each other online. The incident occurred on Friday in the Holland Hills neighbourhood while the mother and her two teenage girls - aged 14 and 18 - were painting inside the house. He knocked on the door, but the mother - whom police did not identify - chose not to answer, telling investigators she was not in the habit of answering the door during the day. After breaking the glass, Mr Skinner allegedly stuck his hand inside to unlatch the door After seeing the mother inside, he yelled that he had hitchhiked 30 miles to the house and needed help. He then attempted to enter the home, and eventually ""he got a brick and attempted to break that door down,"" the sheriff said, adding that he ""attempted to violently get inside her house"". The mother warned Mr Skinner that she had a gun, and waited until he had reached his arm past the broken glass to attempt to unlatch the door before she fired two shots. Allow Twitter content?

""All I can say is the manner in which he attempted to enter that home in the face of a firearm pointed at him and the implements we recovered from him - the only inference is that he had very bad intent,"" Sheriff Agnew said. Mr Skinner was shot once in the neck and fled to a nearby yard where he collapsed. Police found him with a knife, pepper spray, tape and his plane ticket from New Zealand in his pocket. They say he had planned to return to New Zealand on 30 June. Police say the parents knew nothing of the teen's communications with Mr Skinner Police believe the weapons and tape had been purchased hours earlier at a nearby Walmart. Mr Skinner is now in hospital and is expected to survive. He is facing charges of breaking and entering with a deadly weapon and with the intent to commit a serious offence. Goochland County officials say they have contacted the FBI for assistance. The sheriff said that the girl's parents were unaware of her contact with Mr Skinner, and that the girl had tried to cut off communication with him since first meeting online four months earlier. He told reporters that he found it hard to fathom how far the suspect is believed to have travelled. ""When I sit back and think about it, I said: 'You've got to be kidding me.'""

UK swelters on another hottest day,"Sunseekers enjoyed the weather on Weymouth beach on Tuesday The UK has been enjoying - or enduring - another hottest day of the year, with a health warning for heatwave conditions in place for some. Tuesday saw a top temperature of 30.6C in Porthmadog, Gwynedd - beating Monday's peak of 30.1C in west London. Thewarning,external, issued by the Met Office, says there is an 80% chance of temperatures being a risk to health. The hot weather is expected to last until the weekend, when temperatures are forecast to slowly drop off. In pictures: Heatwave hits the UK Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions Five tough places to work in the heat The health warning, for the south-west, north-west and north-east of England, and the West Midlands, lasts until Thursday evening. It is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare for the potential dangers a heatwave can present, especially to the very young, the elderly or those with chronic disease. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather There's also bad news for hay-fever sufferersas very high levels of pollen are forecast across England, Wales and Northern Ireland throughout the week. Some schools have said they are cancelling sports days because of the""extreme heat"",external. In England, the hottest spot on Tuesday was Rostherne, Cheshire, with a temperature of 30.3C. Aviemore recorded Scotland's peak, with 26C, while Castlederg in County Tyrone was Northern Ireland's high point, with 27C. The Met Office says the UK could reach 33C on Thursday. How are you handling the UK heatwave? You can share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.Or fill out the form at the end of the page. But the temperature is expected to fall short of the British record for June of 35.6C, reached in London in 1957 and again in Southampton in 1976. The highest June temperature for Wales is 33.7C, in 2000, and for Northern Ireland it is 30.8C, last recorded in 1983. Scotland's record temperature for June has stood for 125 years. Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross recorded 32.2C in 1893. This video can not be played Drones capture Manchester wildfire BBC Weather presenter Ben Rich said Wednesday could start out ""cloudy and murky"" on the east coast of Scotland and eastern England but that the skies would clear over the course of the morning. He said: ""Then it is another plain sailing day, with long spells of hot sunshine, and by this stage even Northern Ireland and Scotland will be close to 30C."" The heat will continue until the weekend, with cooler weather in eastern areas and the chance of a shower on Sunday, he said. Five tips to manage your hay-fever BBC reporters share their heat-busting tips The heatwave has been attributed to the jet stream looping to the north of the UK, and then back down to eastern Europe, creating an area of high pressure over the country which is not shifting. However, for Greece, the direction of the jet stream has produced very stormy conditions. Fears that railway tracks could buckle in the heat prompted Network Rail to introduce speed restrictions. The railway infrastructure operator said track temperatures could reach as much as 20C above the air temperature, meaning the steel rails can expand markedly. The reduced speeds are intended to lower the force exerted on the track, reducing the risk of buckling. Network Rail said the heat can cause tracks to buckle Meanwhile, police have urged people to be careful of the temptation to swim in open water in the hot weather. The warning came after the body of aman was recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday. A search is continuingfor a missing 13-year-old, named as Ryan Evans, at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent. The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.

The heat also started a wildfireacross two square kilometres of moorland in Greater Manchester. And in York,police officers smashed the windows of two cars to rescue dogs""struggling to breathe"" inside. Police said they had referred the car owners to the RSPCA for prosecution. Homeless people can also be vulnerable if exposed to strong sunshine and heat while sleeping rough, the housing and support charity Evolve said. It called on the public to donate things like suncream, water, and sun hats to homeless people either directly, or through a shelter or charity. Green -minimum state of vigilance during the summer. Yellow - Alert and readiness- Social and healthcare services are on standby to reduce harm. Amber - Heatwave action- Care services target high-risk groups, like the elderly, with specific help. General advice is given to keep homes cool, drink plenty of fluids, and so on. Red - National emergency- Reached when a heatwave is so severe that illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, not just among high-risk groups. Threshold temperatures for triggering these warnings range from 28C in north-east England to 32C in London.

Homes evacuated due to moorland blaze,"This video can not be played Drones capture vast Saddleworth Moor blaze A huge moorland fire is continuing to spread because the land is ""as dry as a tinder box"" and winds are fanning the flames. The blaze covers 3.7miles (6km) of Saddleworth Moor and has been raging since Sunday night. More than 50 homes were evacuated in Carrbrook, near Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, and 150 people affected. One resident described seeing ""ash falling like rain"" and another said it ""looked like the apocalypse"". Dave Keelan, director of emergency response at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said 70 of its firefighters were tackling the blaze. He confirmed talks were ongoing to see if the Army could offer extra teams, four-wheel drive vehicles and air support. Residents described hearing explosions as the fire continued to rage Brenda Warrington, leader of Tameside Council, said firefighters were hoping for a ""really good downpour"" and rain was ""the only thing"" that would quickly deal with the blaze. ""We do need mother nature to help us quite frankly,"" she said. ""It's as dry as a tinder box up there. A lot of winds are fanning the fire."" Saddleworth Moor fire in pictures Army called in to tackle moorlands fire How do you tackle a moorland blaze? Mr Keelan said there were four different areas of fire embedded within peat, which is ""extremely difficult"" for crews to extinguish. ""They are working extremely hard, as they have been for the past couple of days, in really arduous conditions in heat and smoke,"" he said. Members of the public are assisted with face masks being distributed by the council Matt Lomas, 76, who was evacuated with his wife, daughter and eight-month-old granddaughter Isla, said: ""We could see flames 50ft high like a raging ball of fire all on the hill side. ""It was really scary, we were really worried the smoke would hurt Isla so we had to get out."" Angela Brown, 59, said she saw ""ash falling like rain"" from the raging fire. ""It was terrifying. It was getting closer and closer. Every so often there was a crackle and flames would shoot in the air."" Firefighters are tackling the blaze and hoping rain will assist them Pete Woodward, 43, said: ""It looked like the apocalypse. There was a towering inferno of flames."" He said he ""just grabbed a toothbrush and underpants"" and got out with his partner and two young daughters. ""The flames were 500 metres long, it was a raging wildfire. You could hear the odd explosion but thankfully the house survived."" People living in Carrbrook moved animals amid the dense smoke The fire began on Sunday night, reignited on Monday during the hot weather and then spread throughout Tuesday, fanned by evening winds. Police said the homes in Carr Rise, Carr Lane and Calico Crescent were evacuated on Tuesday evening due to the proximity of the flames. The majority of people had returned by Wednesday afternoon. Satellite images give a sense of how far the smoke is spreading Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said a ""request to the military for extra support"" is being prepared ""so there is a back-up plan"" to support firefighters. ""I think everybody feels a great deal of gratitude towards them [firefighters] but it's hit the point where reinforcements are needed and that's what we're arranging,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.

Ash covers a welcome mat at one house, and evacuated neighbours hug each other in the street. Some have tears in their eyes while others shake their heads as the look at the charred hillside. One or two cuddle their precious pet cats and dogs. Thick smoke can still be seen on the hilltops from the fires burning on the moors beyond. Snuggled up to his mother, seven-year-old Oscar McFie sums up the mood: ""It was scary, but we're safe."" Firefighters recommenced ""offensive firefighting"" on Wednesday morning The fire service earlier confirmed the blaze was spreading and said crews had recommenced ""offensive firefighting"". Assistant Chief Fire Officer Leon Parkes said crews planned to ""put a heavy attack"" on the fire, which has been declared a ""major incident"". Heatwave set to last until the weekend In pictures: Heatwave hits the UK Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions Smoke and flames can still be seen for miles but Mr Parkes said crews had ""quelled the risk"" to homes at risk from the flames. He said it had not been established what might have caused the fire. Greater Manchester Police's Saddleworth division said about 2,000 acres of moorland had been destroyed in the fire. Some 65,000 gallons of water were dropped on the blaze by a helicopter on Tuesday to fight the fire which was ""unprecedented in recent times"", it added. Firefighter Ricky Case, who has been out on the hills, said: ""It's just the sheer vastness of it. It's one of the biggest ones I've been on in a long time."" Matt Lomas was evacuated with his eight-month-old granddaughter Isla Farmer Chris Keytes, 58, and his wife Jane, 50, refused to leave despite the fire being just 30ft from his farm and police asking them to go. ""I was concerned [but] we're set up with masks and we put a towel under the door,"" Mr Keytes said. ""We've had fires before but this one was pretty close."" Firefighters continued to battle the fire near Stalybridge at daybreak on Wednesday Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised firefighters ahead of Prime Minster's Questions earlier. Mrs May told MPs the government is keeping the situation ""under constant review"". She offered her sympathy to the firefighters and residents and added that ""operational policy arrangements"" were in place ""to provide support if required"". Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm sure all our thoughts are with the firefighters and the communities and families and the member for Stalybridge and Hyde is there today to support them."" Huge amounts of smoke has drifted westwards, with large parts of Greater Manchester experiencing poor visibility. BBC Weather's Simon King said there was a ""brisk easterly wind"" forecast for Wednesday with ""little to no rain in the forecast for at least a week"". The fire service said it plans ""a heavy attack"" on the fire The fire service said smoke levels in the air were not ""toxic"" but could be an ""irritant"", and advised people to close windows. Public Health England also advised people to wash their faces with soap and water and keep hydrated. Four schools in the Tameside area have been closed, the council said.

Trump says travel ban ruling 'tremendous',"This video can not be played Trump: Travel ban is 'a tremendous victory' US President Donald Trump has hailed a Supreme Court ruling upholding his travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries. Lower courts had deemed the ban unconstitutional, but the US top court reversed the decision in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. At a White House meeting to discuss Mr Trump's proposed border wall he lauded the decision as ""a tremendous success"". The court's reversal is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration. The ban prohibits most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Protesters react to the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Trump administration's travel ban Mr Trump said the Supreme Court decision was a ""great victory"" for the nation and constitution. ""We have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure,"" the Republican president said in Tuesday's meeting with lawmakers. ""The ruling shows that all the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians were wrong, and they turned out to be very wrong,"" he added. He added: ""If you look at the European Union, they're meeting right now to toughen up their immigration policies because they've been over-run, they've been over-run. ""And frankly, a lot of those countries are not the same places anymore."" Protesters against the travel ban held signs outside the Supreme Court The travel ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect in December, has been widely criticised by refugee and human rights groups. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion,external, which said the travel ban was ""squarely within the scope of Presidential authority"". He also rejected arguments that the ban discriminated against Muslims. What Trump team has said about Islam America's 'invisible' Muslims ""The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion."" Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, President Donald Trump shared the news from his Twitter account. Allow Twitter content?

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion, which argues the court failed to uphold the religious liberty guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. ""It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote. The dissent also states that ""a reasonable observer would conclude that [the ban] was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"". The travel ban has been in place since December, when the Supreme Court ruled that it could go into full effect, pending legal challenges. Trump travel ban: All you need to know Coming to America: One translator's harrowing journey The ban prevents most immigrants, refugees and visa holders from five Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - as well as North Korea and Venezuela from entering the US. But the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela were not part of the legal challenge. The ban allows for waivers on a case-by-case basis, but applicants who cannot afford an attorney to go through the waiver process will likely be unable to immigrate to the US, immigration advocates say. Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his dissenting opinion that the State Department reported that only two waivers were approved out of 6,555 applicants during the first month of the travel ban. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' The high court has been issuing a number of decisions this week, including a ruling against a California law that required clinics to inform women of the availability of abortions paid for by the state. The Court ruled that the law violated the free speech rights of Christian facilities. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News- at the scene Despite the controversial nature of Donald Trump's travel ban, there were more abortion rights activists outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning than immigration protesters. Perhaps it's because abortion has been a contentious legal battle for decades, while the president's travel directive had been in effect, and out of the headlines, for months. Attention in recent weeks has been on migrants coming across the southern US border, not visitors and prospective residents from countries like Libya, Iran, Yemen and Syria. Nevertheless, this marks a significant victory for Mr Trump - and for presidential power to set immigration policy in general - albeit by the narrowest of margins. The five court justices said they took the president's order on its face, and separated it from his more bombastic anti-Muslim comments made on the presidential campaign trail and via Twitter. The travel ban was implemented haphazardly at the start of the Trump administration and faced repeated setbacks from the US legal system. In the end, however, the president got his way - or at least enough of his way to claim success. The third time turned out to be the charm. The White House issued a statement saying the ruling was ""a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution"". ""In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country."" Immigration lawyer Cyrus Mehta told the BBC that the majority opinion ""gave in to President Trump's hate and bigotry and will be viewed as a blemish"". This video can not be played Residents of the Republican-leaning Staten Island, New York City, told the BBC last year they ""trust Trump to keep us safe"" He added that Congress could overrule the decision ""so that a future president will not have a blank cheque to block the entire people of a nation - from babies to grandmothers - out of hate, fear or bigotry. That is our only hope for redemption as a nation"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the decision was ""critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump - and all future presidents - to protect the American people"". US residents trapped in legal limbo at airport Islamophobia: New name, old fear Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrant Rights Project called the ruling one of the court's ""great failures"". ""We must make it crystal clear to our elected representatives: If you are not taking action to rescind and dismantle Trump's Muslim ban, you are not upholding this country's most basic principles of freedom and equality."" Mr Trump's ban has seen several iterations. Iraq and Chad were banned in previous versions. Iraq was removed for having ""a close co-operative relationship with the US"" and Chad for having ""sufficiently improved its practices"". The administration said that the ban was the result of carefully considering national security interests, but critics argued it was fulfilling his campaign promise for""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". This video can not be played American Muslims explain how they feel in the United States The state of Hawaii had challenged the ban and a federal judge blocked its implementation. Critics have noted that major attacks such as the 9/11 New York attacks, the Boston marathon bombing and the Orlando nightclub attack were carried out by people from countries not on the list, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan, or by US-born attackers.

Botched Spanish art restoration criticised,"The St George sculpture before and after the restoration attempt A lick of paint can do a lot to lift a drab interior, but when it comes to historic sculptures it turns out the job is best left to experts. That is what a church in Spain discovered after hiring an arts and crafts teacher to freshen up a 16th-Century wooden sculpture of St George. Images shared on social media showed the warrior with a transformed pink face and bright coloured armour. Cultural officials have blasted the botched attempt as ""frightening"". ""We cannot tolerate more attacks on our cultural heritage,"" Spain's art conservation association (ACRE) said in a statement. ""It shows a frightening lack of training of the kind required for this sort of job."" Spanish fresco restoration botched by amateur 'Monkey Christ' fresco boosts tourism Jesus fresco 'destroyer' demands royalties The parish priest in the northern town of Estella simply wanted the sculpture to be cleaned and did not intend for it to be restored, the Efe news agency reports. But the move has enraged local officials who are demanding to know why they were not informed of the church's plans. ""The council wasn't told and neither was the regional government of Navarre,"" the town's Mayor Koldo Leoz told The Guardian newspaper. ""They've used plaster and the wrong kind of paint and it's possible that the original layers of paint have been lost. This is an expert job it should have been done by experts,"" he said. The group in charge of the project - Karmacolor - reportedly uploaded a video to Facebook showing every stage of the project but later deleted it. ""What a great loss,"" one Facebook user commented underneath a photograph of the sculpture. ""Prison sentences would prevent these attacks on our heritage,"" another said. Three images showing the original, deteriorated, and ""restored"" version of the Ecce Homo fresco Others compared it to the now infamous attempt to restore the Ecce Homo (Behold the Man) fresco of Jesus Christ in 2012. Elderly parishioner Cecilia Gimenez took her brush to the 19th-Century artwork following years of deterioration due to moisture, but after much ridicule the result was labelled ""Monkey Christ"". Some positives did come from her efforts however, as the town drew thousands more visitors eager to see her ""restoration"" and she even had her own art exhibited. Gimenez even starred in a music videofor a song she inspired which told the story of her attempt from a more sympathetic angle.

Uber overturns ban on operating in London,"Uber has been granted a short-term licence to operate in London following a court hearing. Transport for London (TfL) refused to renew the licence when it expired last September, saying the US taxi app was not a ""fit and proper"" operator. Uber has now been awarded a licence but it has been put on probation for 15 months. The company had been seeking a five-year licence when it was refused last year. Following a two-day hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said Uber was now considered ""fit and proper"". She ordered the company to pay TfL's legal costs of Â£425,000. Uber changes app following TfL concerns over licensing Uber drops English language test appeal for London drivers Call for women-only Uber Pools for London Uber to introduce limit on drivers' hours London mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""After years of operating poorly in London, Uber has now accepted that TfL's action in refusing to renew their licence was totally justified. Today our stance has been vindicated by the court. ""Uber has been put on probation - their 15 month licence has a clear set of conditions that TfL will thoroughly monitor and enforce."" Tom Elvidge, Uber's UK general manager, said he was pleased with today's decision: ""We will continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust, while providing the best possible service for our customers."" One of the areas of concern that TfL highlighted last year was about how Uber reported crime. The company said that it had made ""wholesale"" changes to the business since last September. This includes reporting crimes directly to the police instead of logging criminal complaints with TfL, which caused delays. During this week's hearing, Helen Chapman, the licensing, regulation and charging director at TfL, said that Uber's behaviour over reporting allegations to police was ""very disturbing"". So in the end the humility strategy worked. When Transport for London denied Uber a new licence last September, the company responded aggressively promising to see the regulator in court over its anti-competitive ruling. But by the time this week's hearing started it was in full retreat. For much of the hearing, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot seemed unconvinced - Uber had shown a gung-ho attitude, determined to grow its business come what may. She wanted reassurance that the people who'd been responsible for statements of questionable honesty in the past had gone and that the culture really had changed. But for the arrival of the ""impressive"" Laurel Powers-Freeling as non-executive chairman she might have been disinclined to grant a new licence. So Uber is now free to continue operating in a very important market - but on probation with Transport for London watching its every move. A taxi-driver who sat through the hearing was unimpressed - ""three strikes and you're in"" he told me. But something has changed. Uber once thought it could go round the world ignoring local rules - now other cities may follow London in attempting to clip its wings. She said: ""I think we have had five years of a very difficult relationship where Uber has felt they haven't required regulation and being operated in the same way as everybody else we regulate."" Ms Chapman said that the changes implemented by Uber ""could, if applied correctly, enhance public safety"". TfL said the way the firm was run had potential public safety and security implications when it decided not to renew its licence to operate in London last year - a decision backed by Mr Khan. In particular, it highlighted Uber's approach to reporting serious criminal offences, how medical certificates are obtained and background checks on drivers. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan backed TfL's decision not to renew Uber licence to operate in the capital last year Among the changes implemented by Uber, drivers can now only use the app in the region in which they hold a private hire licence and their working hours are more tightly regulated. A licensed driver on the app has to now take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of taking passengers or travelling to pick them up. The firm also made changes to its app in London to ""make it clearer"" to passengers that its drivers are licensed by TfL and that it accepts ride requests before allocating drivers. It also dropped an appeal against a move that would make all its drivers in the city take English language tests.

The firm also made changes to its app in London to ""make it clearer"" to passengers that its drivers are licensed by TfL and that it accepts ride requests before allocating drivers. It also dropped an appeal against a move that would make all its drivers in the city take English language tests.

School offers week off for 'enrichment'A secondary school offers parents the chance to take their children out of school for a week in July 2019.,"Simon Cox: ""We're trying to work with our families"" A secondary school is offering parents the chance to take their children out of school for one week in July next year for an ""enrichment week"". Woodlands School in Basildon says this will allow parents of pupils in Years 7, 8 and 9 to give them  ""opportunities that are more affordable"". Pupils will have to complete a booklet outlining what they have learned. The move comes as data shows rising numbers of pupils in England are being taken out of school to go on holiday. More pupils take term-time holidays Term-time holiday: What are the rules? In his letter to parents, head teacher Simon Cox says 15 to 19 July 2019 will be set aside for an ""enrichment week"". ""It is hoped that this will allow you to provide opportunities that are more affordable as they are out of the school holidays,"" the letter says. ""A full list of enrichment activities will be provided in school during this week and full attendance is expected unless the enrichment week documents have been completed."" The letter ends: ""Holidays at any other time of the year will not be granted and this enrichment week is not transferable to any other week in the school year."" Families who take up the offer will need to fill in aleave of absence form,externaland pupils will have to complete an educational booklet while out of school that week. Mr Cox told the BBC News website that the booklet would cover modern languages, history, geography, maths and English. ""If, for example, a family went to Greece, we'd need to see that they have mastered some basic communication, for geography we'd need to see key information around GDP and population, for history, the type of place and how the past has impacted, English would be about literature and maths will centre around currency."" Pupils whose parents do not take up this offer will be expected to attend school as normal. He added: ""We get an awful lot of holiday requests - well over 150 a year. ""Our authorised holiday is already 1% and we've got 2.9% unauthorised absence. ""We're the second highest finer in Essex for unauthorised absence."" Mr Cox says the school, which is the fifth most deprived in Essex and has 44% of pupils eligible for the pupil premium, wants to give its pupils opportunities to be successful. ""We need to give our pupils an opportunity to do enrichment activities and encourage families to do something worthwhile. ""We're trying to work with our families, it's about relationships and we have to pursue that."" More pupils take term-time holidays Term-time holiday: What are the rules?

Firefighter in tears over Grenfell footage,"Michael Dowden left the room after the video was played The firefighter who led the initial response to the Grenfell fire broke down in tears after being shown footage of the disaster at the public inquiry. The video shows people shouting to residents to ""get out of the tower"" as the blaze spreads. Recalling that night, Michael Dowden said he had ""never seen anything"" like it before and had ""no previous knowledge"" to help his decision-making. The hearing was suspended for half an hour after he became emotional. Mr Dowden, watch manager from North Kensington fire station, was the incident commander for about an hour at the fire, which killed 72 people last June. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Fire chief 'untrained' in tower evacuation Grenfell Tower: What happened Giving evidence for a second day, he said he initially believed the fire was contained in flat 16 on the tower's fourth floor. But he began to feel ""uncomfortable"" because ""the fire was behaving in a way I'd not seen it behave before"". He said it was like a magnesium fire, ""sparking and spitting"", adding: ""That's not something I've seen before."" Mr Dowden, who has been with fire brigade for 14 years, was asked what he thought the material falling from the outside of the building was. ""I didn't know at that point what I know now, in terms of flammable cladding... ""If we were aware of that risk and that hazard at that point as we are now as an organisation we would have put things in place, but I wasn't aware of this cladding material put on to the external envelope of the building."" Mr Millett asked whether, when realising the fire was spreading across the exterior, the fire chief considered an ""evacuation"". Mr Dowden said that would have been ""impossible"". ""I didn't have the resources at that time - we're looking at 20 floors above the fire floor with just six fire engines in attendance, one central staircase."" He added: ""At that moment in time, things are rapidly developing and it is a very, very dynamic situation. I wasn't aware what was happening internally in the building. ""I have never seen anything like that but it was almost like I was consumed by that because of the sensory overload."" The inquiry has heard the blaze was spread by the building's exterior cladding which Mr Dowden said he did not see when he arrived at the scene. On Monday he told the inquiryhe was not trained to decide when to abandon the policyof ""stay put"" and evacuate a burning tower instead.

Johnson challenged over 'Brexit expletive',"Boris Johnson has refused to deny claims he used an expletive when asked about business concerns about Brexit. The foreign secretary is reported to have used the swear word at a diplomatic gathering last week. Asked about this in the Commons, he said he may have ""expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business"". Theresa May said it was right the government listened to business voices about the terms of the UK's exit. This story contains language some may find offensive. Airbus, BMW and Siemens have warned about the impact on their UK-based operations if the UK leaves the EU next March without any agreement. Their warnings have prompted different responses from ministers. Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the UK must ""take and act on the advice of business"" but Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a warning from Airbus that it could cease operations entirely in the UK, threatening thousands of jobs, was ""completely inappropriate"". EU Withdrawal Bill officially becomes law Heathrow operator to move base from UK Business Brexit 'threats' wrong says Hunt Asked about corporate concerns over a so-called hard Brexit, at an event for EU diplomats in London last week,Mr Johnson is reported to have replied,external: ""Fuck business."" Mr Johnson, who was reportedly speaking at the time to Rudolf Huygelen, Belgium's ambassador to the EU, was also overheard saying he and others would fight Theresa May's soft Brexit ""and win"". The foreign secretary, who was a key figure in the Leave campaign, was pressed on the issue in Parliament by Labour MP Owen Smith, who asked him if the comments were correct and, if so, whether they could be ""remotely justified"". ""I don't think anybody could doubt the passionate support of this government for business,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It may be that I have, from time to time, expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business."" This video can not be played ""If we don't have a distinctive Conservative approach .. I fear we'll lose and we'll deserve to"" says former business Minister Mr Johnson's comments about Brexit have frequently proved controversial. He was recorded telling Tory donors last month that the UK's strategy lacked ""guts"" and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job. The latest remark has angered some Tory MPs, with former Science Minister George Freeman telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the reported comments were not ""helpful, responsible or statesmanlike"". The prime minister, who will travel to Brussels on Thursday for a summit of EU leaders, told a chief executives summit hosted by the Times she wanted business to be able to speak to the government. ""It's right that we listen to the voice of business,"" she said. ""Business is at the heart of how we are going to develop this country,"" she said. ""We want to ensure we are listening to the business voice because business provides the backbone of our economy."" MPs who favour a clean break with the EU after Brexit, in March 29 2019, have called on Mrs May to walk away from negotiations if the EU does not show willingness to begin trade talks immediately.

Young women 'not having enjoyable sex',"Almost half of women aged 25-34 do not have an enjoyable sex life, a survey byPublic Health England,externalsuggests. About 7,000 women over the age of 16 responded to the first poll of its kind launched by the health body to guide future policy on reproductive health. Sexual satisfaction appeared to increase with age - less than a third of women aged 55-64 reported a lack of enjoyable sex in the past 12 months. Avoiding an unwanted pregnancy was the women's biggest concern overall. Managing painful, heavy periods was the third most common reproductive worry, while having an enjoyable sex life was second. Going for reproductive health screening, including smear tests, was fourth, ""Other"" reproductive health symptoms was fifth. And difficulty getting pregnant was sixth. Catching a sexually transmitted disease was seventh on the list. What happens during a smear test? Different issues took on relatively greater or lesser importance at different stages of a woman's life. The women who responded were aged 16 and older and living in England. Around 65% of the women reported having sex in the last month. A further 12% had had sex in the previous three months. Among other findings: Most women who were sexually active were using at least one method of contraception About a third of women currently using contraception reported using a coil (intra-uterine device) or implant Another third said they were using the pill Condoms were also a popular but not necessarily regular choice 12% of 16- to 24 year-olds said they did not use any regular contraception, compared with 33% of 35- to 44-year-olds and 45% of 45- to 54-year-olds About a third of the women had experienced severe reproductive health symptoms in the past 12 months, ranging from heavy menstrual bleeding to menopause, and incontinence to infertility. In-depth interviews revealed that these symptoms often affected women's ability to carry out daily activities, yet many concealed their symptoms from work colleagues. Embarrassment commonly acted as a barrier to accessing knowledge or support. Angela says reproductive health is still a taboo topic Angela Kilcoyne, who took part in a PHE focus group, said: ""Since I was 13, I have felt embarrassed about having heavy menstrual bleeding - a health issue which has caused me debilitating pain and nausea. I worked for years in banking, which was a very male dominated environment, and I never told my managers that I was off due to horrendous period pain. ""I would have to invent reasons month after month and soldier on. Or I would dose myself up and try and get through the day best I could, then collapse when I got home. Reproductive health should be spoken about in the workplace in the same way as sickness or flu."" Dr Sue Mann, public health consultant in reproductive health, from Public Health England, said: ""Enjoying a fulfilling sex life is important for women's mental and emotional wellbeing. Our data show that sexual enjoyment is a key part of good reproductive health and that while many women are reporting sexual dysfunction, many are not seeking help. ""Our research shows that there is still stigma associated with talking about reproductive health issues which is a barrier to women seeking help. This is particularly true in the workplace where many women do not feel comfortable speaking to their managers about the real reasons for needing to take time off work. We want to empower women to educate themselves about good reproductive health and to feel confident speaking about it.""

'Reprieve' for Sudanese rape case woman,"Noura Hussein was sentenced to five years in jail An appeals court in Sudan has overturned the death sentence of a woman who killed her husband after he allegedly raped her, her lawyer says. Noura Hussein, 19, was instead sentenced to five years in jail, lawyer Abdelaha Mohamad said. Her mother, Zainab Ahmed, told the BBC she was happy her daughter's life had been spared. International celebrities had backed an online campaign, #JusticeforNoura, to demand Ms Hussein's release. Last month, an Islamic court had sentenced her to death by hanging, following her conviction for the premeditated murder of her husband, Abdulrahman Mohamed Hammad. Ms Hussein said her husband had recruited some of his own cousins who allegedly held her down as he raped her. When he allegedly attempted to do the same the following day she lashed out at him with a knife and stabbed him to death. 'Hoping for a miracle to stop our daughter being hanged' Sudan country profile Child marriages declining, says Unicef Ms Hussein was forced into the marriage at the age of 16. Her husband, who was also her cousin, was 16 years her senior. According to a 2017 report by the UN's children's fund Unicef,one third of Sudanese girls are married before they turn 18,external. In a statement, charityAmnesty International called the decision ""hugely welcome news"",external, but said the five years in prison was a ""disproportionate punishment"". It urged the country to reform its laws on marriage and marital rape ""so that victims are not the ones who are penalised"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

French au pair killers jailed for lifeThe couple tortured and killed Sophie Lionnet before dumping her body on a fire in their London garden.London,"Sophie Lionnet from Troyes, France, was killed by ""monsters"", her mother said A couple who tortured and killed their nanny before dumping her body on a fire in their garden have both been jailed for a minimum of 30 years. Deluded Sabrina Kouider, 35, and Ouissem Medouni, 40, became obsessed that Sophie Lionnet, 21, was helping ex-Boyzone singer Mark Walton abuse people at their home in London. French national Ms Lionnet's body was found on 20 September last year. Kouider and Medouni were jailed by Old Bailey judge Nicholas Hilliard QC. The couple were found guilty of murder following a trial in which they blamed one another for Ms Lionnet's killing in their bath, each saying they were asleep at the time. ""Vindictive and overbearing"" Kouider had also attempted to frame her ex-boyfriend Mr Walton for Ms Lionnet's disappearance as ""revenge"", the court heard. Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni had been in an on-off relationship since meeting in 2001 Medouni, a former banker, had been ""indoctrinated"" by his lover to believe in the ""complete fiction"" of her claims about Ms Lionnet and Mr Walton's supposed abusive alliance, the court was told. The couple then subjected Ms Lionnet to ""relentless intimidation"" to make her admit she was in league with the pop star. Au pair killer writes apology letter The 'toxic' couple who murdered their au pair Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' Couple guilty of murdering French au pair As he sentenced them, Judge Hilliard said: ""I'm sure on all the evidence you were both involved in torturing Sophie in the bath in the lead up to her death in making her think she would drown unless you gave her information you wanted which was not in her power to give because it did not exist. ""The suffering and the torture you put her through before her death was prolonged and without pity."" In an unusual move, Koudier penned a letter that was read to the court, in which she apologised to her victim saying she was ""shocked and sad that you are not part of this world any more"". Richard Lister, BBC News Sophie's parents Catherine Devallonne and Patrick Lionnet listened intently, with the help of interpreters, as the judge passed sentence. Nine of the jurors had also returned to court to see the couple they'd convicted sent to prison. Medouni and Kouider were silent and expressionless for most of the proceedings, flanked by security guards, a translator and a paramedic. As he left the dock, Medouni turned and looked directly at Sophie's parents before being led away. Sophie's parents left court without comment. Their daughter's body has already been returned to France. Kouider and Medouni starved Sophie Lionnet, shown here two days before she died Jurors heard more than eight hours of recordings in which Ms Lionnet was slapped and called ""worse than a murderer"" by her tormentors at their home in Southfields. Kouider and Medouni dunked her head into water, starved her, hit her with an electrical cable and beat her so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone, the jury was told. Hours before her death, a film showed an emaciated Ms Lionnet apparently confess that she had drugged Medouni so Mr Walton could sexually assault him. The couple then killed her before throwing her body on the bonfire in their garden as they barbecued chicken nearby. When neighbours alerted firefighters to the pungent smoke, Medouni told them the charred remains were a sheep, the court heard. The defendants later admitted disposing of Ms Lionnet's body but always denied her murder. Sophie's parents Catherine Devallonne and Patrick Lionnet both attended the Old Bailey hearing Speaking when the couple were convicted last month, Ms Lionnet's mother said her daughter was killed by ""self-obsessed monsters"". Catherine Devallonne added: ""They starved, tortured and broke her until she could no longer fight. They took away her dignity and finally her life."" In her apology letter, Kouider went on to say she and Miss Lionnet had ""shared many good times together as well as pains until things went terribly wrong"". ""I am suffering every day thinking of you and what happened to you that dreadful night. I only wish I could turn the clock back,"" she wrote. In mitigation, the 35-year-old's defence lawyer attempted to persuade the judge her actions were ""entirely driven"" by mental disorders. Icah Peart QC said the fashion designer's delusional and personality disorders left her with ""irrational and completely overwhelming fear"" Ms Lionnet had been recruited by Mr Walton. However, Judge Hilliard told Kouider: ""I do not think you thought for one moment you were acting lawfully. ""I'm sure you knew the way you interrogated her was unacceptable in the extreme, that it was unlawful to assault her and she was in a dreadful state by the time of her death and torturing her in the bath was totally and utterly wrong.""

US top court upholds Trump travel ban,"This video can not be played Trump: Travel ban is 'a tremendous victory' US President Donald Trump has hailed a Supreme Court ruling upholding his travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries. Lower courts had deemed the ban unconstitutional, but the US top court reversed the decision in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. At a White House meeting to discuss Mr Trump's proposed border wall he lauded the decision as ""a tremendous success"". The court's reversal is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration. The ban prohibits most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Protesters react to the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Trump administration's travel ban Mr Trump said the Supreme Court decision was a ""great victory"" for the nation and constitution. ""We have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure,"" the Republican president said in Tuesday's meeting with lawmakers. ""The ruling shows that all the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians were wrong, and they turned out to be very wrong,"" he added. He added: ""If you look at the European Union, they're meeting right now to toughen up their immigration policies because they've been over-run, they've been over-run. ""And frankly, a lot of those countries are not the same places anymore."" Protesters against the travel ban held signs outside the Supreme Court The travel ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect in December, has been widely criticised by refugee and human rights groups. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion,external, which said the travel ban was ""squarely within the scope of Presidential authority"". He also rejected arguments that the ban discriminated against Muslims. What Trump team has said about Islam America's 'invisible' Muslims ""The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion."" Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, President Donald Trump shared the news from his Twitter account. Allow Twitter content?

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion, which argues the court failed to uphold the religious liberty guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. ""It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote. The dissent also states that ""a reasonable observer would conclude that [the ban] was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"". The travel ban has been in place since December, when the Supreme Court ruled that it could go into full effect, pending legal challenges. Trump travel ban: All you need to know Coming to America: One translator's harrowing journey The ban prevents most immigrants, refugees and visa holders from five Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - as well as North Korea and Venezuela from entering the US. But the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela were not part of the legal challenge. The ban allows for waivers on a case-by-case basis, but applicants who cannot afford an attorney to go through the waiver process will likely be unable to immigrate to the US, immigration advocates say. Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his dissenting opinion that the State Department reported that only two waivers were approved out of 6,555 applicants during the first month of the travel ban. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' The high court has been issuing a number of decisions this week, including a ruling against a California law that required clinics to inform women of the availability of abortions paid for by the state. The Court ruled that the law violated the free speech rights of Christian facilities. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News- at the scene Despite the controversial nature of Donald Trump's travel ban, there were more abortion rights activists outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning than immigration protesters. Perhaps it's because abortion has been a contentious legal battle for decades, while the president's travel directive had been in effect, and out of the headlines, for months. Attention in recent weeks has been on migrants coming across the southern US border, not visitors and prospective residents from countries like Libya, Iran, Yemen and Syria. Nevertheless, this marks a significant victory for Mr Trump - and for presidential power to set immigration policy in general - albeit by the narrowest of margins. The five court justices said they took the president's order on its face, and separated it from his more bombastic anti-Muslim comments made on the presidential campaign trail and via Twitter. The travel ban was implemented haphazardly at the start of the Trump administration and faced repeated setbacks from the US legal system. In the end, however, the president got his way - or at least enough of his way to claim success. The third time turned out to be the charm. The White House issued a statement saying the ruling was ""a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution"". ""In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country."" Immigration lawyer Cyrus Mehta told the BBC that the majority opinion ""gave in to President Trump's hate and bigotry and will be viewed as a blemish"". This video can not be played Residents of the Republican-leaning Staten Island, New York City, told the BBC last year they ""trust Trump to keep us safe"" He added that Congress could overrule the decision ""so that a future president will not have a blank cheque to block the entire people of a nation - from babies to grandmothers - out of hate, fear or bigotry. That is our only hope for redemption as a nation"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the decision was ""critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump - and all future presidents - to protect the American people"". US residents trapped in legal limbo at airport Islamophobia: New name, old fear Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrant Rights Project called the ruling one of the court's ""great failures"". ""We must make it crystal clear to our elected representatives: If you are not taking action to rescind and dismantle Trump's Muslim ban, you are not upholding this country's most basic principles of freedom and equality."" Mr Trump's ban has seen several iterations. Iraq and Chad were banned in previous versions. Iraq was removed for having ""a close co-operative relationship with the US"" and Chad for having ""sufficiently improved its practices"". The administration said that the ban was the result of carefully considering national security interests, but critics argued it was fulfilling his campaign promise for""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"".

Tuesday saw a top temperature of 30.6C in Porthmadog, Gwynedd - beating Monday's peak of 30.1C in west London. Thewarning,external, issued by the Met Office, says there is an 80% chance of temperatures being a risk to health. The hot weather is expected to last until the weekend, when temperatures are forecast to slowly drop off. In pictures: Heatwave hits the UK Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions Five tough places to work in the heat The health warning, for the south-west, north-west and north-east of England, and the West Midlands, lasts until Thursday evening. It is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare for the potential dangers a heatwave can present, especially to the very young, the elderly or those with chronic disease.

He said: ""Then it is another plain sailing day, with long spells of hot sunshine, and by this stage even Northern Ireland and Scotland will be close to 30C."" The heat will continue until the weekend, with cooler weather in eastern areas and the chance of a shower on Sunday, he said. Five tips to manage your hay-fever BBC reporters share their heat-busting tips The heatwave has been attributed to the jet stream looping to the north of the UK, and then back down to eastern Europe, creating an area of high pressure over the country which is not shifting. However, for Greece, the direction of the jet stream has produced very stormy conditions. Fears that railway tracks could buckle in the heat prompted Network Rail to introduce speed restrictions. The railway infrastructure operator said track temperatures could reach as much as 20C above the air temperature, meaning the steel rails can expand markedly. The reduced speeds are intended to lower the force exerted on the track, reducing the risk of buckling. Network Rail said the heat can cause tracks to buckle Meanwhile, police have urged people to be careful of the temptation to swim in open water in the hot weather. The warning came after the body of aman was recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday. A search is continuingfor a missing 13-year-old, named as Ryan Evans, at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent. The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.

The heat also started a wildfireacross two square kilometres of moorland in Greater Manchester. And in York,police officers smashed the windows of two cars to rescue dogs""struggling to breathe"" inside. Police said they had referred the car owners to the RSPCA for prosecution. Homeless people can also be vulnerable if exposed to strong sunshine and heat while sleeping rough, the housing and support charity Evolve said. It called on the public to donate things like suncream, water, and sun hats to homeless people either directly, or through a shelter or charity. Green -minimum state of vigilance during the summer. Yellow - Alert and readiness- Social and healthcare services are on standby to reduce harm. Amber - Heatwave action- Care services target high-risk groups, like the elderly, with specific help. General advice is given to keep homes cool, drink plenty of fluids, and so on. Red - National emergency- Reached when a heatwave is so severe that illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, not just among high-risk groups. Threshold temperatures for triggering these warnings range from 28C in north-east England to 32C in London.

"US top court upholds Trump travel banThe ban prevents people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US.US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump: Travel ban is 'a tremendous victory' US President Donald Trump has hailed a Supreme Court ruling upholding his travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries. Lower courts had deemed the ban unconstitutional, but the US top court reversed the decision in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. At a White House meeting to discuss Mr Trump's proposed border wall he lauded the decision as ""a tremendous success"". The court's reversal is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration. The ban prohibits most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Protesters react to the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Trump administration's travel ban Mr Trump said the Supreme Court decision was a ""great victory"" for the nation and constitution. ""We have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure,"" the Republican president said in Tuesday's meeting with lawmakers. ""The ruling shows that all the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians were wrong, and they turned out to be very wrong,"" he added. He added: ""If you look at the European Union, they're meeting right now to toughen up their immigration policies because they've been over-run, they've been over-run. ""And frankly, a lot of those countries are not the same places anymore."" Protesters against the travel ban held signs outside the Supreme Court The travel ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect in December, has been widely criticised by refugee and human rights groups. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion,external, which said the travel ban was ""squarely within the scope of Presidential authority"". He also rejected arguments that the ban discriminated against Muslims. What Trump team has said about Islam America's 'invisible' Muslims ""The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion."" Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, President Donald Trump shared the news from his Twitter account. Allow Twitter content?

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion, which argues the court failed to uphold the religious liberty guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. ""It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote. The dissent also states that ""a reasonable observer would conclude that [the ban] was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"". The travel ban has been in place since December, when the Supreme Court ruled that it could go into full effect, pending legal challenges. Trump travel ban: All you need to know Coming to America: One translator's harrowing journey The ban prevents most immigrants, refugees and visa holders from five Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - as well as North Korea and Venezuela from entering the US. But the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela were not part of the legal challenge. The ban allows for waivers on a case-by-case basis, but applicants who cannot afford an attorney to go through the waiver process will likely be unable to immigrate to the US, immigration advocates say. Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his dissenting opinion that the State Department reported that only two waivers were approved out of 6,555 applicants during the first month of the travel ban.

Husband with dementia 'drew the short straw'A wife describes losing a husband to dementia and worrying about how to pay for his care.UK,"Lynda Basford cared for her husband Michael at home for 13 years until last year ""It is like Michael walking into a fog,"" says Lynda Basford, describing the 13 years during which her husband Michael has descended into dementia. She has been at his side throughout. ""You can't quite hold on to him,"" she says, ""and as the years go by, he gets deeper and deeper into that fog and you can't do anything about it."" Michael needs a lot of support. He doesn't really know where he is and he no longer recognises his wife. Even remembering to eat requires encouragement. She looked after him for years in their own home with little support but, last year, it all became too much. She felt she could no longer keep him safe and reluctantly agreed he should move into a residential home. However, the financial support they get from their local authority does not cover the cost and their savings are rapidly disappearing. Now Lynda's strain over her husband's condition is compounded by money worries. ""I didn't realise"", she says, ""that if you have a terminal illness, your level and quality of care would be dependent on your bank balance."" This video can not be played Lynda Basford: ""Because he drew the short straw... he's having to pay for his treatment."" A new report produced for the BBC from the Health Foundation and three other leading research organisations says the failure by successive governments to reform social care has left many people without the support they need in care homes or in their own homes. It describes the current council-run means-tested system as a fundamental source of unfairness. An ageing population, more younger people with disabilities needing support, and budget cuts combine to leave local authorities struggling to meet the demand for help. The report highlights how budget pressure means the social care system is nearing crisis: councils already have to focus spending on people with the most severe needs 400,000 fewer people received publicly funded care in 2014 than in 2010 the funding shortfall is expected to reach Â£18bn by 2030 almost 7% of care worker jobs were vacant last year The report says this means that three-quarters of relatives of people who need care at home get no support and have not been able to take a respite break of even an hour from caring in the last 12 months. Lynda Basford questions why the support Michael needs is not provided by the NHS. ""Michael has drawn the short straw and has dementia and not some other terminal illness, so he is having to pay for his treatment - because his treatment is social care,"" she says. Michael gets some help from his local authority because he has less than Â£23,250 in savings, but the rate the council pays does not cover the Â£800-a-week fees of the  care home. It means that each week, Lynda pays Â£550 from their savings to make up the difference. She says it is only a matter of time before they run out of money and then she does not know what will happen. Next week, like the NHS, the care system will mark its seventieth anniversary. While the health service was set up as a separate institution delivering support that is free to those who need it, from the start services provided by councils for people struggling with daily tasks such as washing, dressing and taking medication, were means-tested. But in 1948, people did not survive with the sort of complex conditions that meant long-term social care was needed in the way it is now. Then, charities like the Alzheimer's Society did not exist - it was established 40 years ago because of the increasing number of people with dementia. The society's chief executive Jeremy Hughes says: ""When the funding system was set up in 1948, no-one intended to set up a separate system for one disease rather than another, we've got that by accident rather than design. It needs to change now if we are going to be fair and equitable for people over the next 10, 20, even the next 70 years."" The couple have been together for 40 years Last week, after announcing more money for the health service, the government said it was delaying the publication of long-awaited plans for the funding of the social care system until the autumn. Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, welcomed the extra cash for the NHS, but pointed to the urgent need for more money for social care. ""The NHS was founded 70 years ago to replace fear with security, so that people did not face bills they couldn't pay in time of illness. ""But that security is just not there for many of those who need social care today,"" said Ms Dixon. ""Many people assume social care is free of charge like the NHS, and it is a huge shock when they find out it isn't and the bills mount up. ""As local authority budgets are squeezed, more people are having to go without, pay themselves or rely on unpaid care from friends and families. The situation is unfair, stressful and inefficient and is long overdue for reform."" In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the social care system was under pressure and reforms would ""ensure it is sustainable for the future"". ""Health and social care are two sides of the same coin and any reforms must be aligned. That's why our forthcoming Green Paper will be published in the autumn, with the NHS plan. ""We have provided local authorities with Â£9.4bn in dedicated funding for social care over three years and will agree a sustainable funding settlement at the forthcoming spending review.""

"Scale of Holocaust terrifying, says Duke","This video can not be played The duke lays a wreath in a simple ceremony The Duke of Cambridge has described the sight of shoes left behind by Jews killed in a Nazi extermination camp as ""terrifying"". On a visit to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Jerusalem, he said he was ""trying to comprehend the scale"" of the atrocity. Later in a speech, he said: ""Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed."" To finish the day he played football at a youth event and watched volleyball. In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour During his visit, part of the first official trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories by a UK royal, the prince laid a wreath where ashes of victims of the Holocaust were buried. He also met two survivors of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered during World War Two. In a speech at a reception hosted by the British ambassador, Prince William said the visit to Yad Vashem was ""profoundly moving"" and said ties between Britain and Israel had ""never been stronger"". He said: ""In the past century, the people of the Middle East have suffered great sadness and loss. Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed. ""I know I share a desire with all of you - and with your neighbours - for a just and lasting peace."" A girls' choir sang at the wreath-laying ceremony Later, the duke was greeted by Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, at his residence. There he met relatives of the late Rachel Cohen, who was hidden from the Gestapo by Princess Alice - mother of the Duke of Edinburgh - in her palace in Greece. ""You must be very proud of your great-grandmother, who saved defenceless Jews,"" Mr Netanyahu told the prince. Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, meet the prince Following the meeting, the Foreign Press Association condemned as ""disgraceful"" an alleged incident of a journalist being barred. The Associated Press's chief television producer, Nebi Qena, who is originally from Albania, said security guards repeatedly asked about his ""extraction"" and only let him in once other reporters were leaving. Afterwards, the security department of the Israeli Prime Minister's Office blamed the incident on ""human error"". ""We regret any distress or discomfort,"" it said. Allow Twitter content?

""It is about time that we have to find together the way to build confidence,"" said Mr Rivlin. ""Build confidence as a first step to bring to understanding that we have to bring to an end the tragedy between us that goes along for more than 120 years."" The duke responded, saying: ""I, like you, am hoping that peace in the area can be achieved."" By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond There were two Prince Williams on display in Israel today. The first, sombre-suited, awed by the enormity of the Holocaust, laid a wreath over the ashes of Jews murdered in the Holocaust. The second, in trainers, sunglasses and rolled-up shirtsleeves, high-fived and grinned his way through football practice with young Israeli and Palestinian kids. The duke shows off his ball skills Both princes wanted to learn about and understand this complicated country. Both clearly impressed their hosts. And each complemented the work of the other. You can overdo the sensitivities of this trip. The prince does not do press conferences, nor question and answer sessions with the public. Much is down to the planning of the visit. But Prince William has showed himself as serious, enthusiastic, versatile and fun. It's hard to imagine anything but good reviews so far. The duke's afternoon was spent visiting the city of Jaffa, where he met young Arab and Jewish Israelis playing football together. They are involved in two charities - the Equaliser and the Peres Centre for Peace - which focus on bringing together youngsters of different religious and ethnic communities through football. Asked to take part in a penalty shoot-out, Prince William joked: ""I'm a defender - it's going to go up there in that tree somewhere."" His first strike was saved but the other two hit the back of the net, prompting celebrations by the duke, who is president of the FA and a keen Aston Villa fan. Later he went to a beach in Tel Aviv where he watched young athletes play volleyball and chatted with beachgoers. Crowds greet the duke as he arrives to watch the volleyball match Kensington Palace has stressed that the five-day trip is non-political, as with all royal visits. But the BBC's Yolande Knell, who is in Jerusalem, said it would be extremely difficult for the prince to keep it that way, despite the careful choreography of the trip. She said Israeli and Palestinian officials had pointed out to her it was a highly politicised place, so people would be scrutinising his every step and every comment.

French au pair killers jailed for life,"Sophie Lionnet from Troyes, France, was killed by ""monsters"", her mother said A couple who tortured and killed their nanny before dumping her body on a fire in their garden have both been jailed for a minimum of 30 years. Deluded Sabrina Kouider, 35, and Ouissem Medouni, 40, became obsessed that Sophie Lionnet, 21, was helping ex-Boyzone singer Mark Walton abuse people at their home in London. French national Ms Lionnet's body was found on 20 September last year. Kouider and Medouni were jailed by Old Bailey judge Nicholas Hilliard QC. The couple were found guilty of murder following a trial in which they blamed one another for Ms Lionnet's killing in their bath, each saying they were asleep at the time. ""Vindictive and overbearing"" Kouider had also attempted to frame her ex-boyfriend Mr Walton for Ms Lionnet's disappearance as ""revenge"", the court heard. Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni had been in an on-off relationship since meeting in 2001 Medouni, a former banker, had been ""indoctrinated"" by his lover to believe in the ""complete fiction"" of her claims about Ms Lionnet and Mr Walton's supposed abusive alliance, the court was told. The couple then subjected Ms Lionnet to ""relentless intimidation"" to make her admit she was in league with the pop star. Au pair killer writes apology letter The 'toxic' couple who murdered their au pair Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' Couple guilty of murdering French au pair As he sentenced them, Judge Hilliard said: ""I'm sure on all the evidence you were both involved in torturing Sophie in the bath in the lead up to her death in making her think she would drown unless you gave her information you wanted which was not in her power to give because it did not exist. ""The suffering and the torture you put her through before her death was prolonged and without pity."" In an unusual move, Koudier penned a letter that was read to the court, in which she apologised to her victim saying she was ""shocked and sad that you are not part of this world any more"". Richard Lister, BBC News Sophie's parents Catherine Devallonne and Patrick Lionnet listened intently, with the help of interpreters, as the judge passed sentence. Nine of the jurors had also returned to court to see the couple they'd convicted sent to prison. Medouni and Kouider were silent and expressionless for most of the proceedings, flanked by security guards, a translator and a paramedic. As he left the dock, Medouni turned and looked directly at Sophie's parents before being led away. Sophie's parents left court without comment. Their daughter's body has already been returned to France. Kouider and Medouni starved Sophie Lionnet, shown here two days before she died Jurors heard more than eight hours of recordings in which Ms Lionnet was slapped and called ""worse than a murderer"" by her tormentors at their home in Southfields. Kouider and Medouni dunked her head into water, starved her, hit her with an electrical cable and beat her so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone, the jury was told. Hours before her death, a film showed an emaciated Ms Lionnet apparently confess that she had drugged Medouni so Mr Walton could sexually assault him. The couple then killed her before throwing her body on the bonfire in their garden as they barbecued chicken nearby. When neighbours alerted firefighters to the pungent smoke, Medouni told them the charred remains were a sheep, the court heard. The defendants later admitted disposing of Ms Lionnet's body but always denied her murder. Sophie's parents Catherine Devallonne and Patrick Lionnet both attended the Old Bailey hearing Speaking when the couple were convicted last month, Ms Lionnet's mother said her daughter was killed by ""self-obsessed monsters"". Catherine Devallonne added: ""They starved, tortured and broke her until she could no longer fight. They took away her dignity and finally her life."" In her apology letter, Kouider went on to say she and Miss Lionnet had ""shared many good times together as well as pains until things went terribly wrong"". ""I am suffering every day thinking of you and what happened to you that dreadful night. I only wish I could turn the clock back,"" she wrote. In mitigation, the 35-year-old's defence lawyer attempted to persuade the judge her actions were ""entirely driven"" by mental disorders. Icah Peart QC said the fashion designer's delusional and personality disorders left her with ""irrational and completely overwhelming fear"" Ms Lionnet had been recruited by Mr Walton. However, Judge Hilliard told Kouider: ""I do not think you thought for one moment you were acting lawfully. ""I'm sure you knew the way you interrogated her was unacceptable in the extreme, that it was unlawful to assault her and she was in a dreadful state by the time of her death and torturing her in the bath was totally and utterly wrong.""

School offers week off for 'enrichment',"Simon Cox: ""We're trying to work with our families"" A secondary school is offering parents the chance to take their children out of school for one week in July next year for an ""enrichment week"". Woodlands School in Basildon says this will allow parents of pupils in Years 7, 8 and 9 to give them  ""opportunities that are more affordable"". Pupils will have to complete a booklet outlining what they have learned. The move comes as data shows rising numbers of pupils in England are being taken out of school to go on holiday. More pupils take term-time holidays Term-time holiday: What are the rules? In his letter to parents, head teacher Simon Cox says 15 to 19 July 2019 will be set aside for an ""enrichment week"". ""It is hoped that this will allow you to provide opportunities that are more affordable as they are out of the school holidays,"" the letter says. ""A full list of enrichment activities will be provided in school during this week and full attendance is expected unless the enrichment week documents have been completed."" The letter ends: ""Holidays at any other time of the year will not be granted and this enrichment week is not transferable to any other week in the school year."" Families who take up the offer will need to fill in aleave of absence form,externaland pupils will have to complete an educational booklet while out of school that week. Mr Cox told the BBC News website that the booklet would cover modern languages, history, geography, maths and English. ""If, for example, a family went to Greece, we'd need to see that they have mastered some basic communication, for geography we'd need to see key information around GDP and population, for history, the type of place and how the past has impacted, English would be about literature and maths will centre around currency."" Pupils whose parents do not take up this offer will be expected to attend school as normal. He added: ""We get an awful lot of holiday requests - well over 150 a year. ""Our authorised holiday is already 1% and we've got 2.9% unauthorised absence. ""We're the second highest finer in Essex for unauthorised absence."" Mr Cox says the school, which is the fifth most deprived in Essex and has 44% of pupils eligible for the pupil premium, wants to give its pupils opportunities to be successful. ""We need to give our pupils an opportunity to do enrichment activities and encourage families to do something worthwhile. ""We're trying to work with our families, it's about relationships and we have to pursue that."" More pupils take term-time holidays Term-time holiday: What are the rules?

Transgender woman wins pension court battle,"A transgender woman who was unable to access her pension was discriminated against by UK law,the European Court of Justice has found,external. The woman - known as MB - was refused the female state pension at 60 because she chose not to annul her marriage. MB said she preferred to stay married to her wife ""in the sight of God"". But a court has ruled a person who has changed gender does not have to annul the marriage they entered into before that change, to receive a pension. Under the UK's 2004 Gender Recognition Act, trans people acquired the right to formally change their gender by obtaining a full ""gender recognition certificate"". But the law states a certificate cannot be issued to a married person who does not have their marriage annulled on the basis of their gender change. Transgender man wants to be named father How should schools support transgender pupils? In the UK, women born before 6 April 1950 can apply for a state pension at age 60, while men born before 6 December 1953 must wait until 65. MB, who was born male in 1948, married in 1974 and had two children. In 1991, MB began to live as a woman and underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1995, but did not apply for a gender recognition certificate. When she reached her 60th birthday in May 2008, MB applied for a state pension, but was refused on the basis that legally she was still a man, and should therefore wait for the male pension at 65. MB challenged the decision and her case went to the UK Supreme Court, where the judges were ""divided"" on the issue. Supreme Court judgesreferred it to the EU Court of Justice for guidance. The ECJ found that the UK's marriage annulment condition (designed to avoid marriage between persons of the same sex) is ""unrelated"" to the retirement pension scheme. And so it concluded that UK legislation ""constitutes direct discrimination based on sex"" and is therefore in breach of European law. MB's lawyers - Jacqueline Mulryne of Arnold & Porter and Chris Stothers of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer - said they were ""delighted"" at the decision. ""After almost a decade, MB will finally be paid her pension and recognised as a woman by the government,"" they said in a statement. ""This is a small decision but it has great importance in the move towards increased equality and respect."" The case will now return to the Supreme Court to apply the ruling, but MB's lawyers said they are ""hopeful"" the Department for Work and Pensions will apply the ruling ""without delay"".

Fire chief in tears over Grenfell footage,"Michael Dowden left the room after the video was played The firefighter who led the initial response to the Grenfell fire broke down in tears after being shown footage of the disaster at the public inquiry. The video shows people shouting to residents to ""get out of the tower"" as the blaze spreads. Recalling that night, Michael Dowden said he had ""never seen anything"" like it before and had ""no previous knowledge"" to help his decision-making. The hearing was suspended for half an hour after he became emotional. Mr Dowden, watch manager from North Kensington fire station, was the incident commander for about an hour at the fire, which killed 72 people last June. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Fire chief 'untrained' in tower evacuation Grenfell Tower: What happened Giving evidence for a second day, he said he initially believed the fire was contained in flat 16 on the tower's fourth floor. But he began to feel ""uncomfortable"" because ""the fire was behaving in a way I'd not seen it behave before"". He said it was like a magnesium fire, ""sparking and spitting"", adding: ""That's not something I've seen before."" Mr Dowden, who has been with fire brigade for 14 years, was asked what he thought the material falling from the outside of the building was. ""I didn't know at that point what I know now, in terms of flammable cladding... ""If we were aware of that risk and that hazard at that point as we are now as an organisation we would have put things in place, but I wasn't aware of this cladding material put on to the external envelope of the building."" Mr Millett asked whether, when realising the fire was spreading across the exterior, the fire chief considered an ""evacuation"". Mr Dowden said that would have been ""impossible"". ""I didn't have the resources at that time - we're looking at 20 floors above the fire floor with just six fire engines in attendance, one central staircase."" He added: ""At that moment in time, things are rapidly developing and it is a very, very dynamic situation. I wasn't aware what was happening internally in the building. ""I have never seen anything like that but it was almost like I was consumed by that because of the sensory overload."" The inquiry has heard the blaze was spread by the building's exterior cladding which Mr Dowden said he did not see when he arrived at the scene. On Monday he told the inquiryhe was not trained to decide when to abandon the policyof ""stay put"" and evacuate a burning tower instead.

Beer sales restricted amid CO2 shortage,"Food wholesaler Booker is rationing beer and cider because of a shortage of CO2 used in carbonated drinks. The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, is capping customers to 10 cases of beer, and five of cider or soft drinks. It is more evidence that a scarcity of CO2 is hurting the food and drink sectors, and comes after Heineken and Coca-Cola faced disruption. Scotland's biggest abattoir has halted operations because of the gas shortage. Quality Pork Limited (QPL), at Brechin, which puts 6,000 pigs a week through its production line, stopped operations on Tuesday afternoon because it ran out of CO2 used to stun the animals before slaughter. QPL plans to send about 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say other abattoirs also face a carbon dioxide shortage. Booker said in a statement: ""Due to the international shortage of CO2, we are experiencing some supply issues on soft drinks and beer. ""We are currently working hard with our suppliers to minimise the impact for our customers and cannot comment further at this stage."" CO2 producers in the UK and mainland Europe have scaled back operations for maintenance, causing a shortage of the gas, whose many uses include improving the shelf life of packaged food and creating dry ice to keep products cool during transport. Why the CO2 shortage really matters Pig welfare at risk as CO2 shortage bites 'Urgent action needed' over CO2 shortage Heineken said its John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel brands had been hit, while Coca-Cola Great Britain said production had been interrupted until fresh CO2 supplies arrived. ""We are currently responding to an industry-wide issue that is impacting the supply of CO2 in the UK. Our focus is on limiting the effect this may have on the availability of our products,"" Coca-Cola said. Small UK bottling firms have also been hit. In the West Midlands, Holden's, which has 80 customers, shut down last Friday until further notice. ""I'm left with people sitting around doing nothing,"" said operations director Mark Hammond. Supermarket Morrisons said some frozen products had been affected by the shortage, and it aimed to resume selling its full online range ""as soon as possible"". The food and drink industry hopes that supplies will begin returning to normal in early July, although trade bodies have complained about a lack of communication from CO2 suppliers. Andy McGowan, chief executive of Scottish Pig Producers, a co-operative that runs the Brechin abattoir in collaboration with QPL, said he did not know when they would get a fresh CO2 delivery from their supplier. ""That's the frustrating thing - they're not telling us anything. We're pretty dismayed. The top priority is animal welfare - we will not have ourselves in a situation where the welfare is suffering,"" he said. Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a ""potentially huge effect"" on British food production. But that call for the food industry to be given priority has raised fears among drinks firms and smaller businesses that they will be at the back of the queue when gas supplies start to return to normal.

UK calls for more chemical weapons powers,"Inspectors can currently establish only whether chemical weapons have been used, not who is responsible The UK has called for a vote on increasing the international chemical weapons watchdog's powers. At a special session of the OPCW at The Hague, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said breaches of its chemical weapons ban could not be ignored, referencing attacks in Syria and Salisbury, Wilts. The UK wants new powers for inspectors to assign blame for attacks, a proposal that is opposed by Moscow. Inspectors can currently establish only whether such weapons have been used. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said British diplomats had launched a huge effort to gain enough support to win the vote on Wednesday. But Russia opposed the plan, which might see its Syrian allies face further international condemnation, he added. Mr Johnson told the OPCW meeting: ""The tragic reality is that chemical weapons have been used and are being used all over again. And, as we've heard, attacks have taken place in Syria and in Iraq. ""Over three months after that appalling incident [in Salisbury], areas of Salisbury are still being decontaminated and three people are still being treated for effects of exposure but are out of hospital. ""We cannot ignore these breaches."" Under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, 192 countries have agreed never to use or produce chemical weapons. Mr Johnson said members ""cannot allow the global ban on chemical weaponsâ¦ to be eroded away"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""At present the OPCW's experts will say where and when an attack happened but not who was responsible,"" he said. ""If we are serious about upholding the ban on chemical weapons, that gap must be filled. Attributing responsibility for an attack is clearly part of the OPCW's technical remit."" Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April. France said it had ""proof"" that ""chemical weapons were used - at least chlorine - and that they were used by Bashar al-Assad's regime"". The Syrian government denied the allegation. And its key ally Russia said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the incident had been ""staged"" with the help of the UK. The attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal on British soil led to accusations of Russian state involvement Meanwhile, the UK says Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 67, and his 33-year-old daughter, who were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury in Wiltshire on 4 March, were exposed to a nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group. This analysis was backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog. How do you test for chemical weapons? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Reality Check: Russian TV's claims about Salisbury attack What are Novichok nerve agents? The attempted murder of the pair on British soil led to accusations of Russian state involvement. Russia has denied involvement in the attack. Yulia Skripal left hospital a month after the attack, and her father was discharged a month later. Alastair Hay, an expert on chemical weapons at Leeds University, said the UK was ""absolutely right"" to press for new powers. ""Whether it happens and whether there are sufficient votes that the UK can garner to support the move is still an open question really,"" he told the BBC. ""Of course you have the UK, the Unites States, France and many others who want the OPCW to have those powers. ""But there are others who are very concerned about it.

Taliban bomb-maker guilty of Westminster plot,"This video can not be played How police tracked and caught plumber-turned-bomb maker Khalid Ali A British plumber has been convicted of planning a terror attack in Westminster and making bombs for the Taliban. Khalid Ali, 28, was arrested on 27 April 2017 in Parliament Street, where he was caught carrying three knives. Prosecutors said Ali, from Edmonton in north London, had planned a ""murderous attack"" on politicians and police. In a police interview, Ali said he wanted to deliver a ""message"" to British authorities, but claimed the knives were for protection. An Old Bailey jury convicted him of preparing an act of terrorism in the UK and two counts of possessing an explosive substance with intent. He did not react as the verdicts were read out. Ali will be sentenced on 20 July. Plumber's terror plan foiled by fingerprints On 22 April last year - one month after the Westminster terror attack - Ali was caught on CCTV walking past the MI6 building at Vauxhall Cross, as well as Westminster Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and Whitehall. Five days later, his mother called police and said she had found four knives in his bedroom. Police swooped in to arrest him just metres from Downing Street later that day. Ali had spent several years in Afghanistan, and when asked by British police whether he had returned to the UK for jihad, he replied: ""Jihad is what we do. We are Mujahideen."" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon described Ali as an ""incredibly dangerous individual"". Prosecutor Brian Altman QC had told the jury that Ali planned a ""deadly terror attack at the very heart of this country's democracy by killing a police officer, a member of the military or even a parliamentarian"". Ali travelled to Afghanistan in 2011 and spent five years making bombs to maim and kill coalition troops. In late October 2016, he appeared at the British consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, claiming to have lost his passport and asking for a temporary travel document in order to get home. He returned to the UK in early November 2016, when he was stopped at Heathrow airport, interviewed by police and had his fingerprints and DNA samples taken. The DNA samples and fingerprints were then shared with the FBI, which controls a database containing fingerprints found on bomb parts in global conflict zones. FBI agents found 42 prints linking Ali to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan. Defending the decision not to arrest Ali until April 2017 - when he was armed and within metres of Parliament - Mr Haydon said police and security services were ""managing any potential risk he posed and he was arrested at the most appropriate time"". Ali's prints were found on bomb components from two caches recovered by Afghan national security forces During questioning after his arrest, Ali admitted fighting British soldiers in Afghanistan, but refused to say whether he had killed any. In a police interview shown during the trial, Ali also said he had detonated more than 300 bombs. The court heard how his fingerprints were found on component parts of explosive devices that were handed in to US forces in Afghanistan in 2012. Police said Ali had been in a ""Taliban training camp affiliated to al-Qaeda where, for several years, he helped terrorists make hundreds of bombs capable of mass murder"".

Plumber's terror plan foiled by fingerprints,"This video can not be played Khalid Ali was arrested in Whitehall on 27 April 2017 Khalid Ali was carrying three knives when he was tackled by armed officers near Downing Street in April 2017 - and was just moments from being able to attack police, politicians or military personnel. But clues picked up from bomb parts recovered in Afghanistan five years earlier meant he was under surveillance by the police and MI5. Ali, who is one of the seven children, was born to an Ethiopian mother and Somali father in Saudi Arabia, to which the family moved to escape civil war in Ethiopia and from where - in 1992 - they came to the UK. He grew up in Edmonton and trained as a gas engineer and plumber after leaving school, but in his late teens became increasingly absorbed by religion and politics. In 2010, Ali travelled on an aid convoy to Gaza, appearing in news reports after a shipping dispute resulted in some of the travellers being forcibly taken to Greece. Kieran Turner, who helped organise the convoy, told the BBC: ""At that point I thought 'nice young man - this is going to be one of the people that's fun to travel with'."" Ali ""had a sense of humour"" and ""always smiled"", Mr Turner recalled. Ali travelled on an aid convoy to Gaza But Ali was a more complex figure than he appeared. In June 2011 he told family members he was moving to Birmingham for work. They would not hear from him for more than five years. He was reported missing and, during subsequent inquiries, a laptop from his bedroom was found to contain speeches by the al-Qaeda ideologueAnwar al-Awlakiencouraging people to engage in military jihad. In truth, Ali had gone to Afghanistan to join the Taliban. There, according to Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism policing, he went to a ""Taliban training camp affiliated to al-Qaeda where, for several years he helped terrorists make hundreds of bombs capable of mass murder"". In late October 2016, Ali suddenly appeared at the British consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, claiming to have lost his passport and seeking a temporary travel document in order to get home. Two days later, without luggage or possessions, he landed at Heathrow and was immediately questioned under terrorism laws. Ali claimed to have spent the preceding years travelling in northern Pakistan rediscovering himself and learning about different sects of Islam. Without lawful reason for further detention he was released but - crucially - only after his fingerprints were taken. These were shared with the FBI, which manages a vast database containing fingerprints found on bomb parts in various global conflict zones. Ali's prints were matched to some found on improvised explosive device (IED) components from two large caches recovered by Afghan national security forces - the main targets and victims of such weapons - in South Kandahar Province more than four years earlier. Ali's prints were found on IED components from two caches recovered by Afghan national security forces Eventually, 42 prints from the Afghan IED components were positively matched to Ali. Detectives applied to the US for the evidence to be declassified so he could be prosecuted in the UK but permission was not instant. In the meantime, Ali, unaware of these developments, appeared to resume normal life in London. He moved back to the family home in Edmonton, found work in a west London pizza takeaway and started retraining as a gas fitter. However, he was also quietly planning an attack and began researching targets. In March 2017 he was spotted at a march in central London, behaving suspiciously towards police officers outside Downing Street. Ali captured on CCTV talking to police officers outside Downing Street in March 2017 Then in April he conducted reconnaissance of sites including the MI6 building and New Scotland Yard. From then on events moved quickly. On 25 April, near his workplace in Ealing, he bought a set of knives and a sharpener. The following day, officers observed him buying a mobile phone. That night, he was watched emerging from the family home and putting a plastic bag into a wheelie bin outside another house. When retrieved, it contained packaging for kitchen knives and a sharpener. While her son had been outside, Ali's mother - concerned by his behaviour - went to his room and found four knives, which she took to a different part of the house. ""I was shocked and upset"" and ""scared at what he'd do with them"", she said in a statement read at Ali's trial. On his return an argument broke out when Ali realised the knives were missing. His mother called the police. Local officers attended and Ali left the property after midnight when his mother made it clear she wanted him to go. He then set about rearming himself. At daybreak he travelled across London, to Ealing, where he lingered for several hours before purchasing three kitchen knives and heading for Westminster - the location where, just weeks before, another attacker,Khalid Masood, had murdered five people, including a police officer. He walked around Parliament Square, dumping items in different locations, including a mobile phone in the River Thames that was later found to contain images of police officers in stab vests. Two of the three knives found on Ali when he was arrested When he walked towards Whitehall in the direction of Downing Street, armed police moved in. Knives were found in both jacket pockets and one tucked down the front of his trousers. Asked whether the public were in danger, Ali said he was not interested in them. Asked if anyone else was at risk, he told the officers: ""You lot are carrying weapons, so you must know you are in danger."" Ali had three blades tucked into his clothes when he was arrested by armed police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Haydon said: ""Police and security services were managing any potential risk that he posed and he was arrested at the most appropriate time."" It was only in the hours after Ali's arrest that permission was granted to use the evidence from the explosives in a British prosecution. During lengthy police interviews in the following days, Ali said he was armed only for his own protection and had not been planning an attack. He claimed to have been in Westminster to give a ""message"" to those in authority about his beliefs, which he had returned to the UK to deliver. Detectives were told the message was the same as one previously delivered by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Ali said he was a soldier of the Taliban and that al-Qaeda was its military wing. He admitted constructing explosives in Afghanistan - and when asked whether he had also detonated them, Ali said: ""I have pressed the button."" This video can not be played Khalid Ali said he ""pressed the button"" on more than 300 bombs in Afghanistan A detective asked: ""How many times have you pressed the button to cause an explosion?"" ""Probably more than 300 times,"" he replied. ""I've been training and fighting against Western troops, be it American or British,"" he told officers. He later added: ""I'm sitting here in front of you as a mujahid, as classified under your country, the law, as a terrorist."" Ali was asked: ""Did you kill any British troops while you were in Afghanistan?"" ""I will remain silent for now,"" he replied. In court, Ali changed his account, telling the juryhe had been held captive in Pakistan, near the Afghan border, and forced to bundle up components of explosive devices to prove he was not a British spy. He denied planning an attack in London to coincide with the start of the Taliban ""spring offensive"" the following day. Under cross-examination, he denied that the mobile phone purchased the night before his arrest - which has never been recovered - was used to contact the Taliban to get instructions to launch his attack. But he was found guilty of preparing terrorist acts and two counts of possession of an explosive substance with intent.

Strachan 'wouldn't be upset' by pay gap,"Springwatch presenter Michaela Strachan says she ""wouldn't be upset"" if co-host Chris Packham earned more than her. She told the Daily Mirror ""you cannot pay"" for Packham's knowledge and expertise on the live BBC nature show. ""What Chris brings to Springwatch in terms of knowledge is way more than what I can bring,"" the presenter added. While they have a similar amount of air time on the show, Strachan said: ""I'm not interested in what he earns from it - it's none of my business."" The BBC press office said they wouldn't be commenting on Strachan's remarks. Strachan, who has been working with Packham for decades, said of the show: ""I love doing it, I'm happy with what I get paid. ""If Chris was paid more, and I don't know if he is, I wouldn't be upset because you cannot pay for his knowledge, it's an extraordinary knowledge. ""Chris is extraordinary and the campaigning that he does is extraordinary and I think he's everybody's hero on the team at Springwatch. ""So I'm not interested in what he earns from it."" The pair presented The Really Wild Show together from 1993 to 1995 and have been hosting Springwatch since 2011. They also front its spin-off Autumnwatch, which returns to screens later this year. Strachan added: ""It's a fact that the programme would not be as good if there were two Chris Packhams or two Michaela Strachans and that's why Springwatch works so well as we both have different strengths.""

Teens 'may still be alive' in Thai cave,"Navy divers have been sent in to help look for the missing teenagers Thailand's deputy PM has said he is optimistic a group of young footballers trapped inside a cave are still alive, as the search enters a third day. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their coach entered the cave in Chiang Rai province on Saturday. Navy divers resumed their efforts on Tuesday after rising waters had halted the search. They had reportedly seen fresh footprints inside the cave complex, raising hopes for the group's safety. ""We are still optimistic they are all alive,"" Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said on Tuesday. ""Even though they may not have anything to eat, they should have water to drink."" The cave divers who went back for their friends Two days in an underwater cave running out of oxygen Divers in Mexico discover 'world's longest' cave The cave in northern Thailand extends for more than 6km (3.7 miles) underground The Tham Luang Nang Non cave is a tourist attraction which runs for many kilometres underground. The boys and their 25-year-old coach are thought to be in a chamber of the extensive cave network. Desperate relatives have been camping out at the cave, which lies near the border with Myanmar, holding a prayer ceremony for their safe return. ""My child, I'm here to get you now,"" one crying parent said, according to AFP. This video can not be played There is real concern for the footballers and their coach Jonathan Head, BBC News, Tham Luang Navy divers have been trying to reach the deepest caverns, and turning the area around the caves into a sea of mud. Weary, rain-soaked rescuers can be seen coming to and from the cave entrance, where medical teams are waiting, in the hope that the missing boys may be found. Family members pray around makeshift shrines. They have brought in pumps to try to reduce the water level, but so far have only been able to use them outside the caves, where their efforts are being thwarted by the rain. They are now reeling power cables into the caves to help the divers with better light, and to use the pumps there. They have also tried using drones. So far the only sign of the missing boys is the bicycles they left, which are still locked to the fence at the cave entrance, and some handprints spotted by divers who reached one of the largest underground chambers on Monday.

The team and their coach are believed to have entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave on Saturday afternoon. Rescue workers began searching for them on Saturday night after they were reported missing. The search was briefly halted but navy divers were able to re-enter the cave early Tuesday. Large squads of soldiers have been brought in to see if they can get access from the hills above the caves. There are also dozens of volunteers with more experience of cave diving and exploration. According to the Bangkok Post, visitors must cross a small stream to enter the cave, making it inaccessible if the stream floods. Search efforts have been hindered by lack of visibility inside the cave The cave can flood up to 5m (16ft) during Thailand's rainy season, which runs from June to October. Rescue teams were preparing to train the team to use scuba gear, in case they had to dive out through areas of the cave which were completely submerged, according to local officials.

Bucks Fizz star has mouth cancer,"Bucks Fizz star Jay Aston has revealed she has mouth cancer and fears it could stop her talking and singing. The singer is due to have part of her tongue removed but is concerned she may need more extensive surgery if more cancer is found. ""I think if they take more of my tongue away the chances of me singing, even talking, will be very slim,""she told the Daily Mirror.,external The 57-year-old found out she had cancer just under two weeks ago. Her agent confirmed the news to the BBC. The original line-up of Bucks Fizz ""After they told me, I got on the train and bawled my eyes out. Everyone was looking at me. I called my husband, and then Cheryl [Baker, her bandmate],"" she told The Daily Mirror. ""The thought of rejoining the band is now keeping me going. Being on stage with them is my happy place. Whatever you go through, it doesn't matter when you are on stage."" Jay has been doing gigs across the UK with original bandmates Cheryl and Mike Nolan. She said she had mimed on stage at a show last week after a meeting with her surgeon. ""I went home, got changed and went to the gig,"" she said. ""That's showbusiness. The thing that's stood me in good stead is that in the 1980s you mimed for TV. Cheryl has been singing with me where I do solo stuff to give it some welly."" Cheryl is helping Jay out with some of the vocals during live shows On the possibility of no longer being able to perform, Jay adds: ""Cheryl and Mike aren't getting a replacement, they say they will carry on as two. I would want them to carry on without me."" Jay will have skin removed from her thigh to reconstruct her tongue and she's hopeful she won't need more surgery. She joked that she had had an interesting conversation with her consultant regarding her famous skirt-tearing routine: ""We talked about where to put the scar because I rip my skirt off, and they said they would try and make it higher so it doesn't show so badly."" Bucks Fizz became one of the UK's biggest pop acts after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1981. Their song, Making Your Mind Up, went to number one in nine countries, and was followed by hit singles including My Camera Never Lies and Land of Make Believe.

Is the NHS a champion or an also-ran?,"How good is the NHS?  It's a question much debated over the years, even more so with the 70th birthday celebrations under way. If there was an Olympics for healthcare, where would the NHS be in the medal table? There is, of course, no simple answer - but one verdict might be: ""We get what we pay for."" An end-of-term report would probably say: ""Good in parts but could do better."" Many are the stories of patients who have brilliant care through the NHS and are forever grateful for a life-saving treatment. There is frequent praise for the compassionate care provided by staff. There is no shortage, though, of tales of long waits in crowded accident and emergency units and for routine operations. Travelling around the country reveals a service under great pressure with staff working flat out. Patients' frustration often turns towards ""the system"" and what they perceive to be lack of money invested by the government. What will the NHS look like at 100? The history of the NHS in charts Nick Robinson: 'Let's be honest about the NHS' There is a suspicion the NHS wastes money and is an inefficient bureaucracy. This will be heightened by the recent revelation the service spends Â£100m a year on postage for letters informing people about appointments. Some parts of the service are not good at co-ordinating appointments, resulting in multiple journeys for patients. Some are better than others at monitoring the condition of patients at home. A safety-first culture might be encouraging doctors to refer patients for scans and checks that are not necessary. So, cutting through the claims and assertions, how can the NHS be rigorously benchmarked against other health systems? A  comparison with other countries is not straightforward, as data is often gathered in different ways. But the report for the BBC by health experts at leading think tanks is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative of its kind. The blunt message is that the NHS is relatively poor on outcomes for patients diagnosed with some common cancers and after heart attacks. But, perhaps surprisingly given the intense pressure on the front line over the recent winter, the NHS is in the middle of the pack on waiting times for A&E and routine surgery. On health outcomes, the scorecard is not overly impressive. Performance is middling to poor. But when you look at the resources the NHS has at its disposal, things begin to appear in a different light. Physiotherapists are in relatively short supply The NHS has fewer than average doctors, nurses, dentists and physiotherapists per 1,000 patients. As a share of national income, health spending is below average. And when it comes to spending per head of population (adjusted for currencies and inflation), the UK is further behind much of the pack. The NHS is relatively efficient.  Administration costs are not as high as in some other systems, on a par with Ireland and Portugal and well below France and the USA. So, given the staff and kit available to treat patients, the NHS is doing tolerably well with the money it has. Higher investment might, arguably, improve outcomes. The government has recently committed anextra Â£20bn a year for the NHS in England by 2023, which will trigger Â£4bn more for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there is a growing sense that that will be enough only to cope with rising demand linked to a growing and ageing population. A financial boost needed to cut waiting lists and allow a big shift in the quality of care has yet to materialise. Access to healthcare is an important test of a developed economy. According to the report, the NHS is especially good at looking after people in financial hardship. It has remained true to its founding principle of being free at the point of delivery. In conclusion, you could say British people pay for a three-star service and get one. Getting a five-star service will need more money. But to have healthcare available to everyone regardless of means is a big asset for the UK and one to be celebrated on the 70th anniversary. It's not a gold medal winner - but it certainly should be on the podium.

Nick Robinson: 'Let's be honest about NHS',"Three years ago, Nick Robinson was diagnosed with cancer. The operation that successfully removed the tumour in his lung damaged his vocal cords. On Tuesday, he will present a debate about the future of the NHS at it approaches its 70th anniversary. We can all delight in the fact NHS care is generally safer than in other systems - although theevents at Gosport hospitalare a reminder of the need not to be complacent - that it generally treats people with care and courtesy, is relatively cheap to run and gives the same level of care to rich and poor alike. What, though, about those ""healthcare outcomes"" that put us ""near the bottom"" of the league table? What, for example, about the illness I had - cancer? Cancer survival rates here are significantly lower than in other countries. This is true not just of lung cancer but of other big cancer killers - in the bowel, in the colon, the pancreas and the prostate. Indeed, in nine out of 10 cancers, the survival rates here are well below the European average. In bowel cancer, we are 17th in the league table. Put simply, put starkly, what that means is that tens of thousands of people with cancer survive for fewer years than they would if they lived in say Germany, France or the Netherlands. BBC's Nick Robinson to have tumour removed What will the NHS look like at 100? The history of the NHS in charts There have been great efforts to improve NHS cancer care. And some improvements are visible. The detection and treatment of breast cancer has become significantly better in recent years - but there is a long way to go. What's true of cancer is also true of the other big causes of death - heart attacks and strokes. When it comes to tackling the most serious illnesses, the NHS is very far from being the best in the world. ""Aha,"" you might say, ""surely the problem is obvious - money. We simply don't spend enough."" It is certainly true that the NHS has been through the longest, tightest financial squeeze in its history. We spend less as a share of our national income on healthcare than they do in Germany or France. We employ fewer people to care for us than they do in many other countries. That is, no doubt, why the prime minister felt unable to resist the calls for a big boost to spending over the next five years. Yet it is also true that we spend more than, say, the Irish or the Spanish and that our poor ""healthcare outcomes"" existed and were known about long before the age of austerity. Yet in the decades I've been covering debates about the NHS, I have reported on endless rows about waiting times and waiting lists; on ""reforms"" and reorganisation; on allegedly secret plans to privatise the NHS but almost never on why it fails to keep people alive as well as other systems do. There are, of course, no easy answers to that question. Resources and organisation are surely a factor. Lifestyle, diet and public attitudes to health must all count too. GPs are under intense pressure When it comes to cancer, it is even possible that one of the jewels in the NHS crown - the GP system - may slow down the process of getting people to see the specialists they need to see to get the tests and the treatment they need. I was very lucky. My cancer could have been diagnosed much later. International surveys suggest people in the UK are more likely to say their doctor knows about them and their health - but they also indicate the time we get to spend with our doctor is much shorter than elsewhere. I worry that as more and more GPs retire early and as the pressure on the system increases, that standard of care is bound to fall. On average, people now see their GP six times a year, which is twice as often 10 years ago. It is just one of the new pressures on the health service we will be examining in NHS at 70 - Live. We will look at the impact of an ageing population.  In the past five years, the number of people aged over 85 has risen by almost a third. Their care costs on average five times more than that of someone under 30. We'll explore the increase in obesity.  A staggering 63% of us are now officially classified as obese or overweight - including half of all NHS staff. Then there is the increased demand for mental health care - one in four adults now experiences a mental heath problem in their lifetime. I have much to be thankful for. The tumour in my lung was removed successfully. The damage to my vocal cords - which was a side-effect of the operation - almost robbed me of my voice. But another op and many many hours of therapy restored it so I could fulfil my career ambitions and become a presenter on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Incidentally, my experience raises one more question we all too rarely discuss - should there be limits to what the NHS provides? When it came to getting my voice back, I had no choice but to pay for that therapy since there was no way the health service could - or, probably, should - have paid for the daily therapy sessions needed to get me back to work in weeks and not months. There will always be limits on what the system can afford. I have known for a very long time how superb the NHS can be but also that it has limitations. As an 18-year-old, I was the sole survivor in a fatal car crash in France. I spent a week heavily sedated in a respiratory intensive care unit in Lille, unable to breathe for myself. When I pulled through and was sent home, I was treated and cared for by superb NHS doctors, nurses, physio- and occupational therapists, who got me back on my feet. I was also informed that I would have died if I'd had the same accident in Britain, as the facilities in France were simply better than the ones we had. So, I'll be joining with all those wishing the NHS a happy 70th birthday next week. I'm aware there'll be parties and even religious services to celebrate the birth of one of Britain's best-loved institutions. I know that no politician with any hope of high office will dare to declare anything other than love for it and will insist that it's the best of British. However, the birthday gift the health service deserves as it turns three score years and 10 is not just warm words or even the promise of more cash. It is an open, honest, clear-headed diagnosis of its strengths and, yes, its weaknesses too. That and a national conversation about how those who care for us can help more people live longer healthier lives.

What will the NHS look like at 100?,"The NHS is turning 70. It's a time for celebration. But like any big birthday, it naturally prompts thoughts of what is to come. What will the NHS look like in the future? Let's see if we can forecast what the health service will be like on its 100th birthday. It seems inconceivable that there won't be. Tory politician Nigel Lawson once famously said "".... the NHS is the closest thing the English people have to a religion"". It means all political parties talk about the NHS being a priority. Earlier this month Prime Minister Theresa May was unveiling a new funding settlement - or birthday present, as it was dubbed - for the health service. It shows what a special case the health service is, given it's the only area of spending that has been agreed outside the normal process. Even the prospect of introducing more charges, for example for seeing a GP, missing a hospital appointment or using A&E, have been quickly dismissed by ministers of all colours in recent years. It suggests, says Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, that ""short of a huge political or economic upheaval"" the NHS will still be here in 30 years' time. But if you look even further ahead, the public is not so sure. Polling carried out by Ipsos MORI for the Health Foundation found 23% thought the NHS would not exist in 70 years' time. The 1960s featured a huge programme of hospital-building, creating the network of district general hospitals that are still in use today. These were upgraded by the Blair government, which struck deals with the private sector under PFI to renovate sites and build new ones. But there is now an undoubted shift away from hospital care. Everyone is agreed that the time has come to move care out of hospitals and into the community. It is cheaper and often better for the patient - older people are particularly at risk of losing their independence the longer they spend in hospital. Over the past 20 years the number of hospital beds has shrunk by a third You won't find too many people saying this trend should continue - with a growing and ageing population we may well have reached the minimum needed. But certainly there is an appetite to concentrate the most specialist care in larger centres, allowing more basic care, from diabetes consultations to minor surgery, to be carried out in smaller, community centres and GP hubs. The result could be the closure of some of those district general hospitals. They already are. Or at least robotic-assisted surgery, where doctors control robotic equipment from a console. The equipment can be more precise and is able to go where human hands could find it difficult to reach. But having a robot carry out an operation independently of human control is another thing altogether. What is more, the public do not seem so sure they would want that anyway. The Ipsos MORI poll found only 22% though the benefits of an autonomous robot doing surgery would outweigh the risks. However, artificial intelligence is starting to be used elsewhere. One of the most interesting opportunities is using algorithms to interpret scans. Dermatology and pathology also provide promising avenues, which is why Sir John Bell, the life sciences tsar, identified it as a potential ""big win"" for the NHS. In fact, technology overall is perhaps the area where we could see the biggest changes. The flip side is that it is hard to predict what will happen. Fifteen years ago the human genome was sequenced and that was meant to unlock a revolution in healthcare. Things are progressing, but it's not been as rapid as many predicted at the time. Genomic medicine - tailoring care based on an individual's unique genetic code - is beginning to change the way people are cared for. Genes can predict if a woman with breast cancer might respond to certain drugs, or whether radiotherapy is likely to shrink a tumour, for example. England's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has urged the NHS to move more quickly and embrace the ""genomic dream"". Others have said much the same about digital technologies. Video consultations are beginning to be used to connect care homes and hospitals, while telecare is being installed in people's homes to allow health and care staff to remotely monitor and interact with vulnerable patients. But again progress has proved slow. While many of our daily activities are now done online - from shopping to socialising - the NHS still relies very heavily on older technologies. The service is said to be the biggest purchaser of pagers, faxes and stamps in the world. If nothing else, that should certainly change by the time the NHS is celebrating its centenary year.

The history of the NHS in charts,"The NHS came kicking and screaming into life on 5 July 1948. It was the first time anywhere in the world that completely free healthcare was made available on the basis of citizenship rather than the payment of fees or insurance. It brought hospitals, doctors, nurses and dentists together under one service. But in the 70 years since its creation much has changed. The numbers working for the NHS have boomed. There are now 1.7m people employed by the health service across the UK, making it the fifth largest employer in the world. The biggest group in the workforce are nurses. The numbers employed have trebled. But that pales into insignificance next to doctors. There are now 10 times as many working for the health service as there were when it was created. This partly reflects how quickly medicine has advanced and how demand has increased, meaning many more medical experts are needed to care for patients. But roles have changed too. The job nurses do today has become much more specialised - it is now a degree-level profession. The basic personal care they used to provide is now much more likely to be done by healthcare assistants, with nurses involved in providing complex care that was once the preserve of doctors. Of course, as the number of staff has grown, so has the budget. The amount spent on health is now 12 times bigger than it was when the NHS started - and that's after you take inflation into account. And the pot is set to grow even further. Last week the government announced the budget for the NHS in England would beincreasing by 3.4% annually over the next five years. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of their money into the health service. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. It has meant falls in other areas of spending - among the biggest losers have been defence and housing. The early years were tough. The budget had to be cut in the early 1950s as the government struggled to keep up with demand. It forced ministers to introduce charges for prescriptions, dental work and spectacles. Today prescriptions cost Â£8.80 - but only in England (and there are many exemptions, covering children, older people and those with certain conditions). Elsewhere in the UK they have been made free again. This is just one of the consequences of devolution, which has seen individual administrations given control over health policy. Not everything has gone up. The most obvious example is the number of beds. There are now four times fewer beds than there were originally. This is because much more can be done in the community. And patients also spend much less time in hospital than they once did. Women who give birth today now tend to leave on the same day or the day after. After the creation of the NHS, as birth became medicalised, women would spend a week in hospital. It is a similar story for operations. The first hip replacement was carried out in late 1948. The patient spent weeks in hospital. Now the operation can be done as a day case. At the heart of the story of the NHS, is its impact on the nation's health. People now live 13 years longer than they did 70 years ago. Better access to healthcare has played a key role. But it is also worth noting that in the 70 years before the creation of the NHS, life expectancy actually increased by double what it has since. Access to clean water and construction of sewers were two of the biggest factors in that. Infant mortality - defined as deaths before the baby's first birthday - has improved dramatically. There are five key influences - congenital anomalies, prematurity, sudden infant death syndrome, maternal complications and birth injuries. The creation of the NHS, meaning births moved from home into a medical environment, and the advancement of medicine have been hugely influential. Another factor is immunisation. The NHS was set up not simply to treat illness, but also to promote good health. The introduction of the polio vaccine in the 1950s is a perfect example of this. Before this programme, cases of polio could climb as high as 8,000 in epidemic years, but once people started getting immunised the numbers dropped quickly. There is now a comprehensive vaccine programme in childhood with immunisations covering everything from meningitis and mumps to whooping cough. Improved healthcare and immunisation have meant the conditions people are dying of have changed. Infectious diseases, heart attacks and strokes are no longer claiming the number of lives they once did. Instead, people are more likely to be living with long-term conditions for which there are no cures. The most notable of these is dementia. Supporting people who can face many years of poor and deteriorating health is perhaps the biggest challenge for the next 70 years.

NHS 'poorÃ¢ÂÂ on treating deadly illnesses,"The NHS lags behind other countries when it comes to treating common, life-threatening illnesses, an independent analysis produced for the BBC says. Thereport,external- to mark the NHS's 70th birthday - said the UK was a ""below-average"" performer on preventing deaths from heart attacks, strokes and cancer. But it does get less funding than services in the other 18 nations studied, the experts pointed out. The analysis also said there were some ""definite strengths"". These included providing ""unusually good financial protection"" from the consequences of ill-health and being relatively efficient. The experts behind the analysis - one of five produced to mark the anniversary, on 5 July - described the NHS as a ""perfectly ordinary"" service produced for a ""middling level of cost"". It contrasted this with the boast by Nye Bevan, the minister who oversaw the creation of the NHS in 1948, that the service was the ""envy of the world"", at a time when few countries had a universal health system.

The think tanks looked at performance on the 12 most common causes of death. It found the NHS performed worse than average on eight of them: Breast cancer Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Pancreatic cancer Lung disease Respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) Stroke Heart attacks The NHS also had consistently higher rates of death for babies at birth or just after and in the first month of life. But there were some encouraging signs - it was performing better on kidney disease in terms of transplants and diabetes by preventing amputations, for example. There was also lower rates of suicides. The picture on dementia was unclear, the report. The experts said societal factors, such as high income inequality or poor health of the population, may also be influencing the poor performance. The analysis said it seemed ""plausible"" that poor performance was to some extent a consequence of relatively low levels of funding that meant there was fewer resources. Just over Â£3,100 per person per year is spent on health care in the UK, compared with an average of Â£3,500. This meant there were fewer doctors and nurses per head than in many countries. It also said the health service had ""very low levels"" of hospital beds and the lowest levels of CT and MRI scanners. The experts blamed this on a lack of investment, saying austerity had ""bitten hard"". Since 2010, the budget rises in the NHS have hovered between 1% and 2% a year - compared with the close to 4% it has traditionally enjoyed. The most positive element of the international comparison by far was that which related to affordability. Because of the nature of the NHS, the authors said, it provided good financial protection against the consequences of ill-health. For example, it had the lowest proportion of people who skipped medicines due to cost - 2.3% compared with a 7.2% average - and pretty low numbers who missed consultations for financial reasons. It was also among the best for proportion of income spent on health care. On accessibility, the report said waiting times in the NHS were roughly in line with others, while patient experience compared well. Vaccination rates against illnesses such as measles and flu were high. Jennifer Dixon, of the Health Foundation, said the UK should be ""proud"" cost was not something people feared. But she added: ""If we want to hold our head up high next to our European neighbours, we can and must do better."" The Department for Health and Social Care said the analysis contrasted witha Commonwealth Fund report that rated the NHS the ""best and safest""system in the world. A spokeswoman said survival rates were improving for a number of conditions and the extra funding recently announced - the budget will grow by Â£20bn a year in England by 2023 - would help make even more progress and ""secure its future"".

"Defence budget risks UK influence, say MPs","The UK will have to significantly increase defence spending if it is to maintain influence with Washington and Nato allies, MPs have warned. A Commons Defence Committee report says,externalthe defence budget should rise from 2% of GDP (Â£40bn) to 3% (Â£60bn). Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has reportedly demanded an extra Â£20bn for his department - but another minister warned against ""unsustainable"" rises. The government said it would ""continue to exceed"" Nato's 2% spending target. Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' The committee said the extra money for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) could be spent on increasing the readiness of the armed forces and to bolster Britain's anti-submarine warfare to counter possible threats from Russia. The report recommends increasing the defence budget to 3% of GDP, but says a rise to 2.5% would ""comfortably fill the 'black hole' in the existing MoD budget"". It argued that without such investment the UK armed forces' usefulness to the US would be diminished. ""The government must not let this happen,"" the report says. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says the committee's report will ""add fuel to what seems to be an increasingly acrimonious row between the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the Treasury and the prime minister"". He says there have been warnings of a Conservative backbench rebellion if more funding is not forthcoming. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson reportedly wants more money for the military but Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has warned against a tax and spend policy Over the weekend the Mail on Sundayreported,externalthat Mr Williamson threatened to end Theresa May's leadership if she did not provide more money. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss warned cabinet colleagues that it is ""not macho"" to demand more funding. Speaking at an event in London, she said the Â£20bn a year budget boost for the NHS announced by Theresa May last week was a ""one-off"" and would not be replicated elsewhere. ""My point to my colleagues is that any additional spending will necessarily - most likely - lead to additional taxation and we should be honest when we have that discussion,"" she said. ""We need to keep tax as low as possible."" This video can not be played ""If we don't have a distinctive Conservative approach .. I fear we'll lose and we'll deserve to"" says former business Minister Amid calls for extra resources for the military, Lord Houghton - chief of defence staff between 2013 and 2016 - said ""it would be a great shame"" if the armed forces budget was used as part of a ""political game"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today the current defence plans were ""unaffordable"" and the UK needed to ""make a decision"" about ""what sort of country we aspire to be"". Lord Houghton said: ""The first duty of government is the protection of the nation. ""We have slightly deluded the public of late that we have a defence programme that frankly we know is unaffordable. ""We are to an extent living a lie."" The MPs' report also notes comments by US Defence Secretary James Mattis that the UK benefits from its defence relationship with the US by Â£3bn a year. This video can not be played Lord Houghton says current defence programme is unaffordable ""This implies that both the UK armed forces and HM Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the US,"" the report says. ""However, that will continue to be true only while the UK military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the US military and to relieve US burdens."" At next month's Nato summit in Brussels, US President Donald Trump is expectedto repeat his demands for European allies to spend more on defence. Defence committee member Madeleine Moon, Labour MP for Bridgend, said the UK's armed forces have been ""hollowed out"" with the navy ""very weak"" and air capability ""diminished"".

US astronaut Buzz Aldrin sues his childrenThe second man to walk on the moon claims his children stole from him and are slandering his legacy.US & Canada,"He has become a strong advocate for human exploration of Mars US astronaut Buzz Aldrin is suing two of his children and his former business manager alleging they stole money from him and are slandering his legacy. The lawsuit, which also claims they are stopping him from getting married, was filed after his children petitioned to take control of his finances. They asked a judge to name them as his legal guardians because he is suffering from memory loss and confusion. Mr Aldrin, 88, was the second man to walk on the surface of the Moon. He did so as part of the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 and was accompanied by Neil Armstrong, who took the first steps on the surface and was followed minutes later by Mr Aldrin. Buzz Aldrin was part of the first space trip to send astronauts to the Moon in 1969 In a Wall Street Journal interview last week, the former US Air Force colonel said: ""Nobody is going to come close to thinking I should be under a guardianship."" In his lawsuit, he claims that his son, daughter and former manager Christina Korp also undermined his ""personal romantic relationships"" by forbidding him from getting married. At issue is the management of his private company, Buzz Aldrin Enterprises, and his non-profit organisation, the ShareSpace Foundation. What it's like to walk on the Moon Marvel's Stan Lee 'subject to elder abuse' Buzz Aldrin evacuated from South Pole In a legal filing earlier this month, his children Andrew Aldrin, 60, and Janice Aldrin, 60, contended that their father had recently begun associating with new friends who were trying to alienate him from his family.

It adds that they did so ""for their own self-dealing and enrichment"". The legal action also claims the pair had been slandering him for years by claiming he suffers from dementia and has Alzheimer's disease. He accuses his son of exploiting the elderly by ""knowingly and through deception or intimidation"" depriving him of his property, and his daughter of fraud and of not acting in his financial interest.

UK calls for more chemical weapons powersThe UK wants new powers for inspectors to assign blame for nerve agent attacks in Syria.UK Politics,"Inspectors can currently establish only whether chemical weapons have been used, not who is responsible The UK has called for a vote on increasing the international chemical weapons watchdog's powers. At a special session of the OPCW at The Hague, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said breaches of its chemical weapons ban could not be ignored, referencing attacks in Syria and Salisbury, Wilts. The UK wants new powers for inspectors to assign blame for attacks, a proposal that is opposed by Moscow. Inspectors can currently establish only whether such weapons have been used. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said British diplomats had launched a huge effort to gain enough support to win the vote on Wednesday. But Russia opposed the plan, which might see its Syrian allies face further international condemnation, he added. Mr Johnson told the OPCW meeting: ""The tragic reality is that chemical weapons have been used and are being used all over again. And, as we've heard, attacks have taken place in Syria and in Iraq. ""Over three months after that appalling incident [in Salisbury], areas of Salisbury are still being decontaminated and three people are still being treated for effects of exposure but are out of hospital. ""We cannot ignore these breaches."" Under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, 192 countries have agreed never to use or produce chemical weapons. Mr Johnson said members ""cannot allow the global ban on chemical weaponsâ¦ to be eroded away"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""At present the OPCW's experts will say where and when an attack happened but not who was responsible,"" he said. ""If we are serious about upholding the ban on chemical weapons, that gap must be filled. Attributing responsibility for an attack is clearly part of the OPCW's technical remit."" Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April. France said it had ""proof"" that ""chemical weapons were used - at least chlorine - and that they were used by Bashar al-Assad's regime"". The Syrian government denied the allegation. And its key ally Russia said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the incident had been ""staged"" with the help of the UK. The attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal on British soil led to accusations of Russian state involvement Meanwhile, the UK says Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 67, and his 33-year-old daughter, who were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury in Wiltshire on 4 March, were exposed to a nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group. This analysis was backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog. How do you test for chemical weapons? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Reality Check: Russian TV's claims about Salisbury attack What are Novichok nerve agents? The attempted murder of the pair on British soil led to accusations of Russian state involvement. Russia has denied involvement in the attack. Yulia Skripal left hospital a month after the attack, and her father was discharged a month later. Alastair Hay, an expert on chemical weapons at Leeds University, said the UK was ""absolutely right"" to press for new powers. ""Whether it happens and whether there are sufficient votes that the UK can garner to support the move is still an open question really,"" he told the BBC. ""Of course you have the UK, the Unites States, France and many others who want the OPCW to have those powers. ""But there are others who are very concerned about it. And that includes Russia and some of its allies. So, it's divided and it's a question of how many allies the UK can muster."" What are Novichok nerve agents?

Duke lays wreath at Holocaust memorial,"This video can not be played The duke lays a wreath in a simple ceremony The Duke of Cambridge has described the sight of shoes left behind by Jews killed in a Nazi extermination camp as ""terrifying"". On a visit to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Jerusalem, he said he was ""trying to comprehend the scale"" of the atrocity. Later in a speech, he said: ""Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed."" To finish the day he played football at a youth event and watched volleyball. In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour During his visit, part of the first official trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories by a UK royal, the prince laid a wreath where ashes of victims of the Holocaust were buried. He also met two survivors of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered during World War Two. In a speech at a reception hosted by the British ambassador, Prince William said the visit to Yad Vashem was ""profoundly moving"" and said ties between Britain and Israel had ""never been stronger"". He said: ""In the past century, the people of the Middle East have suffered great sadness and loss. Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed. ""I know I share a desire with all of you - and with your neighbours - for a just and lasting peace."" A girls' choir sang at the wreath-laying ceremony Later, the duke was greeted by Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, at his residence. There he met relatives of the late Rachel Cohen, who was hidden from the Gestapo by Princess Alice - mother of the Duke of Edinburgh - in her palace in Greece. ""You must be very proud of your great-grandmother, who saved defenceless Jews,"" Mr Netanyahu told the prince. Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, meet the prince Following the meeting, the Foreign Press Association condemned as ""disgraceful"" an alleged incident of a journalist being barred. The Associated Press's chief television producer, Nebi Qena, who is originally from Albania, said security guards repeatedly asked about his ""extraction"" and only let him in once other reporters were leaving. Afterwards, the security department of the Israeli Prime Minister's Office blamed the incident on ""human error"". ""We regret any distress or discomfort,"" it said. Allow Twitter content?

The duke also met the country's president, Reuven Rivlin, who called on him to take ""a message of peace"" to Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, whom he will meet later in his trip. ""It is about time that we have to find together the way to build confidence,"" said Mr Rivlin. ""Build confidence as a first step to bring to understanding that we have to bring to an end the tragedy between us that goes along for more than 120 years."" The duke responded, saying: ""I, like you, am hoping that peace in the area can be achieved."" By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond There were two Prince Williams on display in Israel today. The first, sombre-suited, awed by the enormity of the Holocaust, laid a wreath over the ashes of Jews murdered in the Holocaust. The second, in trainers, sunglasses and rolled-up shirtsleeves, high-fived and grinned his way through football practice with young Israeli and Palestinian kids. The duke shows off his ball skills Both princes wanted to learn about and understand this complicated country. Both clearly impressed their hosts. And each complemented the work of the other. You can overdo the sensitivities of this trip. The prince does not do press conferences, nor question and answer sessions with the public. Much is down to the planning of the visit. But Prince William has showed himself as serious, enthusiastic, versatile and fun. It's hard to imagine anything but good reviews so far. The duke's afternoon was spent visiting the city of Jaffa, where he met young Arab and Jewish Israelis playing football together. They are involved in two charities - the Equaliser and the Peres Centre for Peace - which focus on bringing together youngsters of different religious and ethnic communities through football. Asked to take part in a penalty shoot-out, Prince William joked: ""I'm a defender - it's going to go up there in that tree somewhere."" His first strike was saved but the other two hit the back of the net, prompting celebrations by the duke, who is president of the FA and a keen Aston Villa fan. Later he went to a beach in Tel Aviv where he watched young athletes play volleyball and chatted with beachgoers. Crowds greet the duke as he arrives to watch the volleyball match Kensington Palace has stressed that the five-day trip is non-political, as with all royal visits. But the BBC's Yolande Knell, who is in Jerusalem, said it would be extremely difficult for the prince to keep it that way, despite the careful choreography of the trip. She said Israeli and Palestinian officials had pointed out to her it was a highly politicised place, so people would be scrutinising his every step and every comment.

Olympic star Pendleton reveals depression,"Pendleton retired from track cycling following a successful 2012 Olympics in London Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton feels ""psychologically and physiologically damaged"" after she had to pull out of a Mount Everest climb. Last month, doctors advised the former cyclist to cut the charity trip short due to oxygen deficiency. Pendleton toldRadio Times,external: ""It's really put me through the wringer... I've taken a real battering. I've never felt so overwhelmed with illness. ""I'm having good days and bad days. You just have to grin and bear it."" Fogle has fronted many wildlife programmes Doctors put her on medication when she got back to the UK, explaining that oxygen deprivation can trigger depression. ""But I felt even further away from myself then,"" she told the magazine. ""They've assured me that it's quite a normal thing and in time it will pass."" Pendleton was accompanied on her Everest adventure by her friend, the TV presenter Ben Fogle. Their expedition, which had started in April, was filmed for a three-part documentary for CNN. Gold rush - Pendleton won gold and silver at London 2012 At the expedition's second camp, Pendleton stumbled into the tent she shared with Fogle and struggled to undo her jacket. Her lack of co-ordination and what she described as ""a horrific headache, like knitting needles sticking in the back of my skull"" were signs of hypoxia - a lack of oxygen. Having proved herself as a professional jockey following her retirement from cycling, the double Olympic champion says she liked the idea of trying equestrianism or clay pigeon shooting next.

Trump chides Harley-Davidson in tariff row,"Harley-Davidson has described the EU tariffs as a ""substantial"" burden Donald Trump has said Harley-Davidsons should ""never"" be built abroad, as he attacked the firm's plans to move some production overseas to avoid European tariffs. Mr Trump said the iconic bike brand's new Thailand plant marked a ""surrender"" and ""the beginning of the end"". Last week, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including bourbon, orange juice and motorcycles. Harley-Davidson says the increased costs are a ""substantial"" burden. The EU tariffs are a response to new US duties on steel and aluminium imports. Mr Trump also accused Harley-Davidson of making the decision to move some production to Thailand before the current trade dispute erupted, and of using the tariffs as an ""excuse"". But the firm - which also has plants in Australia, Brazil and India - said it planned the new plant after Mr Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which would have lowered tariffs in Asia. Video: How do tariffs affect us? Trade wars and Trump tariffs explained Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Taking aim at the iconic motorcycle brand on Twitter, the president said the company's employees and customers were ""already very angry at them"" because ""they surrendered, they quit!"" Mr Trump also said if they continued with their plan to move production to Thailand, ""the Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!"" Allow Twitter content?

In a series of posts, the president suggested Harley Davidson would not be able to sell bikes back into the US from Thailand ""without paying a big tax"". However Harley-Davidson says it operates four factories in the US. Mr Trump's row with the bike brand began on Monday after Harley-Davidson said manufacturing for the European market would be transferred from the US to other countries. He expressed surprise that the company had become ""the first to wave the white flag"",external, adding: ""I fought hard for them."" He also said the US was ""opening up closed markets"" with its new tariff system, and said the country would soon finish its study into tariffs on car imports from the European Union. Mr Trump previously threatened to impose a 20% tariffs on EU cars after the bloc imposed its retaliatory tariffs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also told reporters at a briefing on Monday that the EU was ""attempting to punish US workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies"". ""President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade, in hopes that the EU will join us,"" Ms Sanders said. Harley-Davidson says it will raise investment in its international plants, though it did not say which ones, adding that it expected the increase in production to take nine to 18 months. It said the tariffs would add, on average, $2,200 (Â£1,660) to each bike exported to Europe from the US as the import tax increases from 6% to 31%. The company, which sold nearly 40,000 motorcycles in Europe last year, said it planned to absorb those costs rather than pass them on to customers and risk damaging sales. Some US unions however are not supportive of the motorbike maker's decision to move production abroad. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents some Harley employees and has supported some of the president's tariff announcements, said the decision was ""in keeping with Harley's past decisions to open plants outside of North America."" ""Will Harley use any excuse to ship jobs overseas?"" said Robert Martinez Jr, the union's international president. ""Does Harley even understand what 'Made in America' means?"" United Steelworkers, which also represents Harley workers and has backed tariffs, said it does not know yet how the company's decision will affect employment. ""Domestic sales are what drive production and employment at Harley's US facilities,"" said Michael Bolton, a district director for United Steelworkers, who added that the company should focus on US production if it wants ""to continue to market itself as an iconic American brand"". This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. Harley-Davidson's move is one of the most visible consequences of the trade disputes triggered by President Trump's decision to levy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Mr Trump says the duties are necessary to protect the US steel and aluminium industries, which he says are vital to national security. They have drawn retaliation from the EU, Canada, Mexico, India and others while driving up the cost of metals for US manufacturers. US companies ranging from boat-builders to nail manufacturers have warned about the consequences of escalating trade tensions. Analysis by Chris Buckler, BBC News, Menomonee Falls In Wisconsin people are caught in the middle of a battle between two of the biggest American brands - Harley Davidson and Trump. Not that everyone wants to choose. Leaving work at the state's best-known business one woman said very simply: ""I love my company and I love my President."" Wisconsin turned Republican red in the last presidential election having been wooed by Donald Trump and his message of putting America First. If jobs end up being a casualty in a trade war their loyalty will be tested. But for the moment most of those who voted for Trump seem to be keeping their faith in him. Many believe the furious words that led to these tit-for-tat tariffs are just part of negotiation tactics. The problem for Harley Davidson is that at the moment nobody is backing down and to export to the European Union they are already having to pay the price of this trade skirmish.

Several 'seriously hurt' in bus crash,"Recovery vehicles removed the bus and lorry from the scene on Tuesday afternoon Two men died when a double-decker bus and a lorry were involved in a crash on the A47 in Cambridgeshire. Twelve other people were injured in the crash at about 07:30 BST on Thorney Road, Guyhirn. The driver of a First Eastern Counties bus, in his 50s, died, along with a passenger in his 70s. The collision, on a stretch of road with a 60mph speed limit, involved a Bretts Transport lorry near the entrance to its depot. Police said the bus ""collided into the lorry"". The lorry driver was not hurt. A Bretts spokesman said: ""At this stage we are giving the emergency services our full support and co-operation."" First Eastern Counties managing director Steve Wickers said: ""Two people have lost their lives in this incident, one being a driver based in our King's Lynn depot. ""I am shocked and saddened by what has happened. Our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and we will be providing as much support to them as we can through this difficult time.""

'Russia threat' prompts cash call,"The UK's armed forces need increased funding in order to meet threats from states including Russia, MPs have said. The Commons Defence Committee report,externalsaid the level of defence spending should rise from 2% to 3% of total GDP. Chairman Julian Lewis said this would also help the UK fill existing financial ""black holes"". The Ministry of Defence said the UK has the biggest defence budget in Europe and continues to exceed Nato's 2% spending target. Earlier this year, ex-commander of the UK's Maritime Forces Rear Admiral Alex Burton said Britain was in danger of losing its status as a ""credible military power"" and called for a rise in defence spending. UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts What's happening to defence spending? UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' In the committee's report, called Beyond 2 Per Cent, MPs said that failure to finance the military on a sustainable basis made it ""very difficult"" to have a long-term defence strategy. Increased spending was the ""only solution"" at a time when the UK faced a renewed threat from Russia and increasing challenges from terrorism, extremism and cyber-warfare, the MPs said. The report said defence spending was ""far too low"" and the government ""needs to apply the resources that are necessary to keep this country safe"". It must move the level of defence expenditure back towards 3% of GDP, as it was in the mid-1990s, it said. The committee warned of ""serious deficiencies in the quantities of armour, armoured vehicles and artillery available to the British Army"". The lack of vehicle-mounted anti-tank weapons and self-propelled artillery and the need for modernisation of rocket artillery left the Army ""at serious risk of being outgunned by its Russian counterpart"", it said. Other defence needs identified included: Greater anti-submarine warfare capacity The maintenance of the Army at a minimum of 82,000 personnel A layered air defence system A Royal Navy carrier group capable of protecting the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers In January, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson announced a new review, the Defence Modernisation Programme, focusing solely on military defence. Mr Williamson has indicated he will demand more money if the review deems it necessary. The review's findings are expected to be revealed in the coming weeks. In December,analysis by the House of Commons Library,externalfound that between 2010 and 2015 the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) budget had fallen by Â£8bn in real terms. Since then, spending has stabilised and in the last financial year (April 2016 - March 2017), Â£35.3bn was spent on defence. In 2016, the UK had the fifth biggest defence budget - the highest of all EU countries - according to an international militarystudy,external. Committee chairman Mr Lewis said:  ""The government now needs to look beyond the 2% minimum on defence spending, and begin moving towards a figure of 3%, to place our defence policy on a sustainable basis to meet new threats and fill existing financial 'black holes'. ""Defence is constantly described as the first duty of government. ""The MDP is the government's opportunity to show that it means what it says."" A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The defence secretary launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our armed forces in the face of intensifying threats and, while we welcome the Defence Committee's preliminary report, we will not speculate on the outcome of the programme before we share our headline conclusions.""

UK 'must prepare for Russia fight',"This video can not be played General Sir Nick Carter: Russia could initiate hostilities sooner than expected Britain's ability to respond to military threats from Russia will be ""eroded"" without further investment, the head of the Army has said. Russian hostility could come sooner than expected and Britain must prepare to ""fight the war we might have to fight"", General Sir Nick Carter added. The speech - approved by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - comes amidspeculation of potential defence cuts. The warning comes after Russia has practised simulated attacks in Europe. In the speech, at the Royal United Services Institute, Gen Carter highlighted Russia's new cyber warfare capabilities. He also spoke about Russian long-range missile strike capability, which he said was demonstrated in Syria when 26 missiles were deployed from a 1,500km (930 mile) range. Gen Carter said Russia was building an increasingly aggressive expeditionary force and the potential military threats to the UK ""are now on Europe's doorstep"". He said the Kremlin already boasted an ""eye-watering quantity of capability"" - a level the UK would struggle to match. Gen Carter stressed that Britain ""must take notice of what is going on around us"" or that the ability by the UK to take action will be ""massively constrained"". ""Rather like a chronic contagious disease, it will creep up on us, and our ability to act will be markedly constrained - and we'll be the losers of this competition,"" he said. He said he did ""not in any way"" want to suggest that Russia would go to war in the traditional sense, but that Moscow ""could initiate hostilities sooner than we expect"". ""I don't think it will start with little green men, it will start with something we don't expect. We should not take what we have seen so far as a template for the future."". Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? Five questions on defence spending Zapad: What can we learn from Russia's latest military exercise? It comes as the Russian armyconducted large scale military exercises last yearon home soil, in Belarus and in the Russian territory of Kaliningrad - which is sandwiched between Nato members Poland and Lithuania. It was one of Russia's biggest military exercises since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the UK's Â£36bn annual defence budget meant the government was addressing the range of threats from ""a position of strength"". However, Labour shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said she was sure Gen Carter would have tried to make his case behind closed doors but had gone public as a ""last resort"". She added that if voicing concerns over funding made the prime minister and the chancellor ""wake up"", it would have been worth ""making the fuss"". Admiral Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said such warnings from a serving chief were unprecedented. ""For them to talk about the need for more resources, I haven't known that in my 52 years in the navy - I mean this is extraordinary,"" he said. By Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent Russia's new Armata T-14 tank The reality is that Britain would never confront a threat like Russia on its own. That's why it is part of Nato. But even as a key member of the alliance, the truth is that some of the UK's weapons are increasingly outdated. WhileRussia's been developing new Armata tanks,the Army's Challenger 2 hasn't been modernised for 20 years. Many have been mothballed as the UK focused on the counter-insurgency campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan. Britain's ground-based air defence systems are also becoming increasingly obsolete and no match for Russia. Still, the likelihood of any direct military confrontation with Russia seems extremely remote. True, the US National Defence Strategy recently highlighted the risks of a more assertive Russia and China. But for now, the concern is more about those countries using cyber and misinformation to disrupt life in the West. General Carter's intervention is more driven by fears of further deep cuts to the UK's armed forces. The Ministry of Defence has a black hole in its budget. It is rare for a military chief to make such an obvious and public appeal for more cash. But he's doing it under the orders of the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. He has sent his generals over the top to put pressure on the chancellor. Robert Hannigan, who stood down as director of the intelligence monitoring service GCHQ last year, said Russia was the single country that had ""kept me awake"" in recent years. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""They have always been very capable, but in the last two, three, four years they've become quite aggressive."" Gen Carter's speech comes as national security adviser Mark Sedwill conducts a review of the UK's security capabilities. All three armed forces have been asked to put forward options for cuts as the Ministry of Defence looks at how it will control spending. There are concerns within the forces that the review will prioritise counter-cyber attacks and terrorism, rather than major defence. This video can not be played Watch: Russia's war game in 2017 under way Col Rupert Wieloch, a former senior British commander of forces in Libya, said the structure of funding needed to be addressed so that money for the armed forces was not ""confused"" with money for cyber security. However, Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the Army has been cut from more than 100,000 to 82,000 since 2010. Last week Conservative MP Julian Lewis, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, posed an urgent question in the Commons after speculation that there were plans to cut the UK military by 14,000 service personnel, nine warships and 100 helicopters. Mr Williamson said ""hard work"" is taking place to give the armed forces the ""right resources"". Some MPs have called to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP.It is currently at 2%- in line with guidelines for Nato members.

Defence spending examined,"The government has announced a reduction in the number of soldiers it plans to have in the Army by 2025, as part of itsIntegrated Review,external, examining ""the long-term strategic aims"" of UK national security, as well as defence, development and foreign policy. Although the number of soldiers will be falling, the UK's annual defence budget will be Â£7bn a year higher than previously committed to, by 2024-25. It had been widely reported that the government would be announcing a cut of 10,000 to the size of the Army, but that is not quite what is happening. What is being cut is the target for the number of fully-trained people in the Army, which is called the ""workforce requirement"". It is going down,externalfrom 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. Full-time trained strength is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually only 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army? Fact-checking claims about the Army, aid and nuclear weapons ""We've seen reductions in forces all over Europe as requirements for expeditionary responses have changed,"" Fenella McGerty, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told BBC News. She added that it would enable the government to put a higher proportion of defence spending towards things like technology and research and development. But BBC Newsnight's defence editor, Mark Urban, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the reduction could have an impact on the type of operation the British military conducts in future. ""If you were going to try and do an ongoing commitment as Britain did in Helmand [in Afghanistan] for all those years of about 10,000 rolling over from one brigade group to the next...it would be extremely difficult with a force that size"". From 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by Â£6.6bn in real terms (after factoring in rising prices over this period). That was a cut of 14.6% compared with the 2009-10 Budget, according to an analysis of government figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Since the 2016-17 financial year, however, annual defence spending has increased by Â£3bn in real terms. The extra funding promised as part of the Integrated Review means that by the 2024-25 financial year, the defence budget will be Â£51.7bn in cash terms, which is Â£7bn more than previously planned. Trevor Taylor, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: ""This was an unexpectedly generous settlement that sent a signal that the government intended to maintain defence at a higher rate of GDP than 2% for several years at least."" GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product and is the value of everything produced by the economy in a year. An IISS study,externalattempts to rank the world's biggest defence budgets. It puts the UK fourth behind China, India and the United States. The USA spends more on defence than all of the other countries in the top 10 combined, with a budget of $738bn (Â£557bn) a year. But when defence expenditure is analysed as a proportionof gross domestic product (GDP),the UK falls to seventh in the world. While the UK makes it into the top 10 in terms of spending, it comes way down the list in terms of military personnel. Data from the World Bank,externalfor 2018 puts the UK in 42nd place, well behind the likes of India, China, North Korea, Russia and the USA. In 2019 the UK spent2.1% of GDP,externalon defence. Since 2014, Nato has set a target for its members to spend 2% of GDP on defence. However, there has been criticism surrounding the methodology used to calculate these numbers, such as whether war pensions count as defence spending.

Why petroleum jelly may not heal cuts,"The label says petroleum jelly can help protect minor cuts, scrapes and burns. But new research suggests immediately slathering an open wound with this ointment might be a bad idea. Scientists have studied how the skin creates its own ""natural plaster"" to help heal these injuries. Oil-based substances, such as petroleum jelly, appear to disrupt this important process, and might increase the risk of wound infection, they say in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. TheAmerican Academy of Dermatology,externalrecommends petroleum jelly for keeping a wound moist and to help prevent it from drying out and forming a scab, because they take longer to heal. This will also help prevent a scar from getting too large, deep or itchy. As long as the wound is cleaned daily, it is not necessary to use anti-bacterial ointments, says the AAD. See more stories and videos like this Some NHS hospitals recommend it to patients with surgical wounds that have already started to heal, and it formspart of the first aid kit,externalin some contact sports, including rugby union where it is used by the England team. However, Prof Robert Ariens and colleagues at the University of Leeds say their observations with human and animal tissue suggest this may not be the best immediate approach to wound management. They found that a microscopic protein film forms rapidly over a wound as part of the natural clotting process. Medical imaging reveals the film - made up of a substance called fibrin - has tiny pores that let air reach the wound but are too small to allow bacteria and some viruses to pass through. Prof Ariens said: ""We did laboratory and animal studies which showed this film could be a barrier against microbial infection for at least 12 hours, and this gives the immune system time to get white blood cells to the wound to counteract any infection."" Adding petroleum jelly perforated the protective film. Prof Ariens said: ""If you get a scrape or a cut it is best to let it clot for half an hour to let the film form. Do clean it of course if it needs it, but the clot will make its own perfect plaster. After that, it might not be so bad to add petroleum jelly, but before then, from our findings, it appears to damage this film."" Independent wound care advisor Jacqui Fletcher, who is also the clinical editor of the journal Wound UK, said: ""You do see it used in sports. Boxing is a good example. If the fighter gets a cut they can use it to stop the blood running down the their face so that they can continue the fight. ""But that's about a quick fix rather than a suitable dressing."" She said, in terms of infection risk, a concern was using petroleum jelly that had been kept in the cupboard for a long time. ""People tend to have pots that have been open for a long time and dip a finger in, which might not be clean."" The manufacturer of a leading brand of petroleum jelly was contacted by the BBC for a comment. Dr Nick Levell, president of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ""Skin healing is important in both the healthy and those with skin disorders. ""For example, leg ulceration is an increasing problem for elderly people. This research may lead to further real-life clinical studies to see how oil-based substances affect infection rates.""

MPs back Heathrow airport expansion,"MPs have backed controversial plans to build a third runway at London's Heathrow airport. The government won a key vote in the Commons by 415 votes to 119 - a majority of 296. Tory MPs were under orders to support the government - but Boris Johnson, a leading opponent of expansion, missed the vote because he was in Afghanistan. Labour's official position was to oppose expansion, but its MPs were given a free vote. The SNP abstained. For:415 Against:119 Did not vote:116  The vote was welcomed by business group the CBI as ""a truly historic decision that will open the doors to a new era in the UK's global trading relationships"". Kuenssberg: Real reason for Johnson's Afghan trip? 'Where's Boris?' shout Heathrow debate MPs But Greenpeace UK said it was ready to join a cross-party group of London councils and the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, in a legal challenge against the third runway. And Friends of the Earth said in a statement: ""MPs who backed this climate-wrecking new runway will be harshly judged by history. ""The evidence on the accelerating climate crisis, which is already hitting the world's most vulnerable people, is overwhelming - and expanding Heathrow will only intensify the misery."" This video can not be played John McDonnell makes an impassioned plea to halt Heathrow expansion Environmental activists earlier staged a ""lie-in"" over Heathrow in Parliament's central lobby, just metres away from MPs preparing to vote on the proposals. Police locked-down the area after 12 protesters, who described themselves as from a ""pop-up"" Vote No Heathrow campaign, sprawled across the floor chanting. The government has pledged the airport will be built at no cost to the taxpayer, will create 100,000 jobs and will benefit the entire country, through guaranteed internal flights to the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson, who has returned from a trip to Afghanistan, was criticised for missing the vote Ministers also insist the project will have built-in environmental protections, with the ability to fine Heathrow or ground aircraft if promises on night flights and other contentious issues are broken. Eight Conservative MPs voted against the government, including former cabinet ministers Justine Greening and Theresa Villiers, Greg Hands - who resigned last week as international trade minister - and Adam Afriyie, Sir David Amess, Bob Blackman, Zak Goldsmith and Matthew Offord. More Labour MPs supported the government than backed their leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had opposed the expansion. The development was supported by 119 Labour MPs, while 96 voted against the move. MPs from across the political spectrum, some with constituencies on the Heathrow flight path, spoke out against the plan. At the start of a four-hour debate, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Heathrow was ""full"" and a new runway was needed to secure ""a clear path to our future as a global nation in the post-Brexit world."" This video can not be played Greg Hands: 'I made an unequivocal pledge' on Heathrow But in an impassioned speech, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that villages that had existed for 1,000 years would be ""wiped off the face of the earth"" to enable a company to maximise its profits. ""There are human costs to this decision that this House needs to recognise and contemplate before they vote tonight to worry and blight my community once again on a programme that will never - pardon the pun - take off,"" he told MPs. Opposition MPs shouted ""Where's Boris?"" as a Conservative MP who resigned from government over Heathrow expansion urged colleagues to join him in opposing a third runway. Former International trade minister Greg Hands, who represents Chelsea and Fulham, raised concerns about air quality and night flights but said it was a ""debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges"". Mr Johnson said following Mr Hands' example and quitting the government to vote against Heathrow would ""achieve absolutely nothing,"" before departing on a trip to Afghanistan.

Car investment slumps on 'Brexit worries',"Investment in Britain's car industry has fallen by half, according to figures from the motoring sector. The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) said that Brexit uncertainty was ""thwarting"" decisions by major car companies to put more money into UK factories. In the first six months of 2017, investment in new models and factory improvements stood at Â£647.4m. This year, the figure had fallen to Â£347.3m for the same period. The SMMT said this was lowest figure since the financial crisis. The trade body said that the government's ""red lines"" on Brexit and ""conflicting messages"" were working ""directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector"". Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, told the BBC that the industry needed ""clarity"" and demanded that Britain stay within the customs union and that a ""no deal"" scenario - where the UK leaves the customs union and the single market with no preferential trading deal - would be ""the worse option imaginable"". UK car industry ""will get good Brexit deal"", says minister Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Supply chains which rely on millions of car and truck parts moving freely between the UK and the EU would face disruption. This video can not be played SMMT boss Michael Hawes says companies are 'sitting on their hands' The government said the UK's car industry was a success story and that it was working for a deal that was mutually beneficial to both sides and as ""friction free"" as possible. Since the referendum a number of car makers, such as Nissan, have announced additional investment in Britain. I asked Mr Hawes what the effect would be if there was no ""deal"" with the EU agreed before the end of the year. ""It won't be an overnight closure but it could be a death by a thousand cuts,"" he told me. ""Gradually the competitiveness of the UK is eroded, making it that much harder to attract the investment, and it's the investment that makes it [the UK car sector] so competitive. ""We still need to see significant additional progress [on Brexit]. Nissan has committed to building two new models at its Sunderland plant He said: ""We still don't know what our future trading relationship is going to be, not just with Europe, but with some of the other countries with which the EU has free trade agreements which are important to this industry as well. ""There's undoubtedly frustration in boardrooms at the slow pace of negotiations. Mr Hawes said: ""The way the industry works - with investments over four or five years - you will see over the next couple of years, particular plants will reach that decision point. What we have seen over the last six months is that investment has been declining. ""Investment in the automotive industry is always a bit lumpy, but if you match what is happening in terms of total investment with what we hear, we are seeing companies sitting on their hands for as long as possible. ""But it reaches the point you have to make that decision, that's when you need the clarity,"" he added. The SMMT's annual Sustainability Report says that the automotive sector had a strong 2017 as investments made a number of years ago came to fruition. Employment levels rose by over 5% to 186,000 and the sector's total revenues hit a record Â£82bn. ""There is no credible 'plan B' for frictionless customs arrangements, nor is it realistic to expect that new trade deals can be agreed with the rest of the world that will replicate the immense value of trade with the EU."" Mr Hawes said. ""The government must rethink its position on the customs union. He said: ""There is no Brexit dividend for our industry, particularly in what is an increasingly hostile and protectionist global trading environment. ""Our message to government is that until it can demonstrate exactly how a new model for customs and trade with the EU can replicate the benefits we currently enjoy, don't change it."" He said both of the government's options for cross-border arrangements post-Brexit - the so-called""maximum facilitation"" or ""customs partnership"" models- were complex, expensive and not deliverable over a short period of time. The government said that, out of the EU, Britain could look to strike new trade deals with markets such as America and China.

Pig welfare at risk as CO2 shortage bitesScotland's biggest pig processor will run out of the gas which is used to stun farm animals.Business,"Scotland's biggest pig processor is set to run out of carbon dioxide on Tuesday, leaving it in danger of welfare issues such as overcrowding. The gas, which is used to stun farm animals and put the fizz in carbonated drinks, is in short supply in Europe. Quality Pork Limited, which puts about 6,000 pigs a week through its abattoir in Brechin, may have to send some animals to England. However, its sister plant in England is also facing CO2 shortages. Food and drinks firms are scaling back operations because of a shortage of CO2. CO2: The build up of a gas problem Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? CO2 shortage: Food industry calls for government action At least five gas producers in northern Europe have been offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld,external. And seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. Quality Pork Limited, which operates in collaboration with UK-wide meat processor Tulip and the Scottish Pork Producers (SPP) co-operative, uses CO2 as part of a pre-slaughter stunning process. It will run out of the gas on Tuesday. SPP chief executive Andy McGowan told the BBC that the abattoir would start to see animal welfare issues develop within a few days because of overcrowding. ""We can send some pigs to England, to our sister factories at Tulip. But that is not a long-term solution. They, too, are seeing CO2 shortages,"" he said. Mr McGowan said he had little idea when CO2 shipments would resume. ""One of the challenges is that we are not getting any sort of commitment from the gas companies. It makes planning difficult"". Tulip said it had sought approval from regulators so that Scottish pigs processed in its English abattoirs could still carry a Quality Meat Scotland kitemark. ""We remain extremely concerned about the lack of CO2,"" said a spokesman for Tulip. ""We are in regular communication with our supply partnersâ¦ although there is currently very limited information."" Drink-makers have also been hit by the shortage. On Monday, Coca-Cola said it had ""temporarily paused"" some production while the Holden's beer bottling company in the West Midlands said its facility in Dudley stopped work on Friday. Mark Hammond, operations director at the Holden's bottling plant, said ""We are going to do maintenance and a deep clean. But as of [Monday] morning, we have 25 people sitting around doing nothing."" He said ""CO2 is an absolutely vital component. It's the equivalent of diesel in the haulage industry."" The plant does not just bottle Holden's beer but has about 80 customers. Mr Hammond has no idea when his supplies might resume. Although the gas industry says things will start returning to normal in early July, he fears firms like his will be at the back of the queue for fresh supplies. ""We are a small firm, and there's obviously great demand across the sector,"" he said. ""We are not getting good communication from CO2 suppliers."" The meat industry hopes that it will be given delivery priority as more CO2 supplies come onto the market. ""Our processors deal with live animals,"" said the UK's Meat Processors' Association. ""The CO2 shortage has the potential to become an animal welfare issue. We have been asking to be treated as a priority."" The British Poultry Association (BPA) said: ""We are involved with live animals. They are a priority."" A BPA spokesman said many of his members had only enough CO2 ""to keep ticking over"". He added: ""We are maintaining production by stretching our gas. But people are living day-to-day."" However, small firms fear they will be a low priority when suppliers ramp up distribution for their big customers. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the CO2 shortage could disrupt hundreds of small suppliers. ""This unexpected disruption will cause a shockwave throughout many supply chains with smaller firms lower down being the first hit and the last to recover."" However, bigger firms are also feeling the squeeze. On Monday, Coca-Cola said its soft drinks production line was disrupted by carbon dioxide shortages, although supplies to customers have not been affected. The company said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers, partners and customers on a number of solutions as the situation develops."" Last week, drinks giant Heineken said its John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel had already been hit. The company said on Monday that it had no fresh information on when things might return to normal. ""We are still working through the issue with customers and trying to minimise disruption,"" said a spokeswoman. 'Urgent action needed' over CO2 shortage Are we in for a beer shortage this summer?

US astronaut Buzz Aldrin sues his childrenThe Apollo 11 astronaut claims his children are slandering his legacy by claiming he has dementia.US & Canada,"He has become a strong advocate for human exploration of Mars US astronaut Buzz Aldrin is suing two of his children and his former business manager alleging they stole money from him and are slandering his legacy. The lawsuit, which also claims they are stopping him from getting married, was filed after his children petitioned to take control of his finances. They asked a judge to name them as his legal guardians because he is suffering from memory loss and confusion. Mr Aldrin, 88, was the second man to walk on the surface of the Moon. He did so as part of the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 and was accompanied by Neil Armstrong, who took the first steps on the surface and was followed minutes later by Mr Aldrin. Buzz Aldrin was part of the first space trip to send astronauts to the Moon in 1969 In a Wall Street Journal interview last week, the former US Air Force colonel said: ""Nobody is going to come close to thinking I should be under a guardianship."" In his lawsuit, he claims that his son, daughter and former manager Christina Korp also undermined his ""personal romantic relationships"" by forbidding him from getting married. At issue is the management of his private company, Buzz Aldrin Enterprises, and his non-profit organisation, the ShareSpace Foundation. What it's like to walk on the Moon Marvel's Stan Lee 'subject to elder abuse' Buzz Aldrin evacuated from South Pole In a legal filing earlier this month, his children Andrew Aldrin, 60, and Janice Aldrin, 60, contended that their father had recently begun associating with new friends who were trying to alienate him from his family.

They also said he has been spending money at ""an alarming rate"". Mr Aldrin's lawsuit claims that his son and Ms Korp had improperly taken control of his finances - including millions of dollars worth of ""space memorabilia"" and ""space artifacts"". It adds that they did so ""for their own self-dealing and enrichment"". The legal action also claims the pair had been slandering him for years by claiming he suffers from dementia and has Alzheimer's disease. He accuses his son of exploiting the elderly by ""knowingly and through deception or intimidation"" depriving him of his property, and his daughter of fraud and of not acting in his financial interest. His eldest son is not involved in the lawsuit. A court-appointed mental health expert is planning to evaluate Mr Aldrin later this week. In a statement, his children say they are saddened by the ""unjustifiable"" lawsuit. ""If nothing else, our family is resilient and our ability to work together to solve problems and accomplish great things is strong,"" the Aldrin children said. President Richard Nixon met with the Apollo 11 crew during their quarantine after returning to earth ""We love and respect our father very much and remain hopeful that we can rise above this situation and recover the strong relationship that built this foundation in the first place."" Mr Aldrin has remained in the limelight in recent years, delivering cameo appearances in hit American television shows such as the Big Bang Theory, The Simpsons and 30 Rock. In 2002, he escaped assault charges after punching a man who demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landing was not staged. He has also become a strong advocate for human habitation of Mars, andlast year launched a virtual reality moviedetailing his plan to get humans there. Last week, he appeared at a National Space Council event at the White House, where US President Donald Trump announced the formation of a Space Force to serve as a sixth branch of the US military.

"NHS 'no longer the envy of the world'The UK system is criticised for being ""below average"" on preventing deaths from heart attacks, strokes and cancer.Health","The NHS lags behind other countries when it comes to treating common, life-threatening illnesses, an independent analysis produced for the BBC says. Thereport,external- to mark the NHS's 70th birthday - said the UK was a ""below-average"" performer on preventing deaths from heart attacks, strokes and cancer. But it does get less funding than services in the other 18 nations studied, the experts pointed out. The analysis also said there were some ""definite strengths"". These included providing ""unusually good financial protection"" from the consequences of ill-health and being relatively efficient. The experts behind the analysis - one of five produced to mark the anniversary, on 5 July - described the NHS as a ""perfectly ordinary"" service produced for a ""middling level of cost"". It contrasted this with the boast by Nye Bevan, the minister who oversaw the creation of the NHS in 1948, that the service was the ""envy of the world"", at a time when few countries had a universal health system. Is the NHS a champion or an also-ran? The history of the NHS in charts Nick Robinson: Let's be honest about the NHS Forget 70 - what will the NHS look like at 100? ""We run a health system with very scarce resources in terms of staff and equipment and achieve poor outcomes in some vital areas like cancer survival,"" said Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think tank. His team worked with experts at the King's Fund, Health Foundation and Institute for Fiscal Studies to look at key issues facing the NHS at this key milestone. Alongside this, they have produced reports looking a finances, social care, technology and the health of the nation, for the BBC. The topics will be discussed on theBBC Two show NHS at 70 - Liveon Tuesday at 20:00.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The think tanks looked at performance on the 12 most common causes of death. It found the NHS performed worse than average on eight of them: Breast cancer Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Pancreatic cancer Lung disease Respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) Stroke Heart attacks The NHS also had consistently higher rates of death for babies at birth or just after and in the first month of life. But there were some encouraging signs - it was performing better on kidney disease in terms of transplants and diabetes by preventing amputations, for example. There was also lower rates of suicides. The picture on dementia was unclear, the report. The experts said societal factors, such as high income inequality or poor health of the population, may also be influencing the poor performance. The analysis said it seemed ""plausible"" that poor performance was to some extent a consequence of relatively low levels of funding that meant there was fewer resources. Just over Â£3,100 per person per year is spent on health care in the UK, compared with an average of Â£3,500. This meant there were fewer doctors and nurses per head than in many countries. It also said the health service had ""very low levels"" of hospital beds and the lowest levels of CT and MRI scanners. The experts blamed this on a lack of investment, saying austerity had ""bitten hard"". Since 2010, the budget rises in the NHS have hovered between 1% and 2% a year - compared with the close to 4% it has traditionally enjoyed. The most positive element of the international comparison by far was that which related to affordability. Because of the nature of the NHS, the authors said, it provided good financial protection against the consequences of ill-health. For example, it had the lowest proportion of people who skipped medicines due to cost - 2.3% compared with a 7.2% average - and pretty low numbers who missed consultations for financial reasons. It was also among the best for proportion of income spent on health care. On accessibility, the report said waiting times in the NHS were roughly in line with others, while patient experience compared well. Vaccination rates against illnesses such as measles and flu were high. Jennifer Dixon, of the Health Foundation, said the UK should be ""proud"" cost was not something people feared. But she added: ""If we want to hold our head up high next to our European neighbours, we can and must do better."" The Department for Health and Social Care said the analysis contrasted witha Commonwealth Fund report that rated the NHS the ""best and safest""system in the world. A spokeswoman said survival rates were improving for a number of conditions and the extra funding recently announced - the budget will grow by Â£20bn a year in England by 2023 - would help make even more progress and ""secure its future"".

Women's top reproductive worries revealed,"Almost half of women aged 25-34 do not have an enjoyable sex life, a survey byPublic Health England,externalsuggests. About 7,000 women over the age of 16 responded to the first poll of its kind launched by the health body to guide future policy on reproductive health. Sexual satisfaction appeared to increase with age - less than a third of women aged 55-64 reported a lack of enjoyable sex in the past 12 months. Avoiding an unwanted pregnancy was the women's biggest concern overall. Managing painful, heavy periods was the third most common reproductive worry, while having an enjoyable sex life was second. Going for reproductive health screening, including smear tests, was fourth, ""Other"" reproductive health symptoms was fifth. And difficulty getting pregnant was sixth. Catching a sexually transmitted disease was seventh on the list. What happens during a smear test? Different issues took on relatively greater or lesser importance at different stages of a woman's life. The women who responded were aged 16 and older and living in England. Around 65% of the women reported having sex in the last month. A further 12% had had sex in the previous three months. Among other findings: Most women who were sexually active were using at least one method of contraception About a third of women currently using contraception reported using a coil (intra-uterine device) or implant Another third said they were using the pill Condoms were also a popular but not necessarily regular choice 12% of 16- to 24 year-olds said they did not use any regular contraception, compared with 33% of 35- to 44-year-olds and 45% of 45- to 54-year-olds About a third of the women had experienced severe reproductive health symptoms in the past 12 months, ranging from heavy menstrual bleeding to menopause, and incontinence to infertility. In-depth interviews revealed that these symptoms often affected women's ability to carry out daily activities, yet many concealed their symptoms from work colleagues. Embarrassment commonly acted as a barrier to accessing knowledge or support. Angela says reproductive health is still a taboo topic Angela Kilcoyne, who took part in a PHE focus group, said: ""Since I was 13, I have felt embarrassed about having heavy menstrual bleeding - a health issue which has caused me debilitating pain and nausea. I worked for years in banking, which was a very male dominated environment, and I never told my managers that I was off due to horrendous period pain. ""I would have to invent reasons month after month and soldier on. Or I would dose myself up and try and get through the day best I could, then collapse when I got home. Reproductive health should be spoken about in the workplace in the same way as sickness or flu."" Dr Sue Mann, public health consultant in reproductive health, from Public Health England, said: ""Enjoying a fulfilling sex life is important for women's mental and emotional wellbeing. Our data show that sexual enjoyment is a key part of good reproductive health and that while many women are reporting sexual dysfunction, many are not seeking help. ""Our research shows that there is still stigma associated with talking about reproductive health issues which is a barrier to women seeking help. This is particularly true in the workplace where many women do not feel comfortable speaking to their managers about the real reasons for needing to take time off work. We want to empower women to educate themselves about good reproductive health and to feel confident speaking about it.""

Last month, doctors advised the former cyclist to cut the charity trip short due to oxygen deficiency. Pendleton toldRadio Times,external: ""It's really put me through the wringer... I've taken a real battering. I've never felt so overwhelmed with illness. ""I'm having good days and bad days. You just have to grin and bear it."" Fogle has fronted many wildlife programmes Doctors put her on medication when she got back to the UK, explaining that oxygen deprivation can trigger depression. ""But I felt even further away from myself then,"" she told the magazine. ""They've assured me that it's quite a normal thing and in time it will pass."" Pendleton was accompanied on her Everest adventure by her friend, the TV presenter Ben Fogle. Their expedition, which had started in April, was filmed for a three-part documentary for CNN. Gold rush - Pendleton won gold and silver at London 2012 At the expedition's second camp, Pendleton stumbled into the tent she shared with Fogle and struggled to undo her jacket. Her lack of co-ordination and what she described as ""a horrific headache, like knitting needles sticking in the back of my skull"" were signs of hypoxia - a lack of oxygen.

Herteam,externalwill carry out scientific experiments on the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"", now said to be three times the size of France. Ms Penn said her own medical tests had convinced her of the potential toxic impacts of plastic, especially for women. Data will be shared with universities. In March this year, scientistspublished their latest estimate of the size,externalof what's officially termed the North Pacific Gyre - this moving mess of plastic is better known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and is formed by winds and ocean currents that swirl the material around, in the same way that water spirals down a drain. The study concluded that the amount of discarded plastic in the garbage patch was up to 16 times greater than previous estimates. As well as counting the amount in the seas, scientists are now moving on to examine how poisonous plastics can be to animals and humans.

Crew members carrying out a manta trawl, one of the key methods of gathering data For Emily Penn, it is the potentially toxic impact of the breakdown of plastics in the ocean by seawater and sunlight that is of great concern. These tiny fragments contain chemicals which are similar to the sex hormone oestradiol and this can impact fertility in animals and humans. ""The more I learned about the chemicals that we were finding in the oceans, I started to understand that many are endocrine disruptors, they mimic hormones and they are starting to get inside our bodies,"" she told BBC News from Hawaii where the mission will start. ""When I tested my own body for some of these chemicals we are finding in the ocean and in plastic, I then found them inside me as well,"" she said. ""During pregnancy, it's critical that you don't have these hormone disruptors inside you; we can pass them on to our children through childbirth and breastfeeding. ""It was that journey for me, that got me on the women's track because I realised it was a very women-focused issue because of the toxic nature of what we were facing."" Emily Penn has been involved in environmental issues for several years, organising the largest community-led clean up of the small Pacific island of Tonga. She has sailed around the world on a ship fuelled by biodiesel, and she co-founded eXXpedition - which runs a series of all-female voyages. Earlier this month, she received thePoints of Light,externalaward from Prime Minister Theresa May, which recognises outstanding volunteers making a change in their community. With her team on board the 22m (72ft) -long research vessel the Sea Dragon, Emily will sail two legs, covering 3,000 nautical miles. She will travel from Hawaii in the US to Vancouver in Canada and then on from Vancouver to the American city of Seattle. A team of 10 women from a range of different countries will take part in each section of the journey. The team will be trawling for plastic, trailing nets behind the ship. They will also gather air and water samples, and record observations of wildlife along the journey. ""We'll be looking at the chemicals on the surface of the plastics, and particularly in areas where turtles are living,"" said Emily Penn. There are cramped conditions for all aboard the Sea Dragon ""We'll be looking at sediments for the plastics that have sunk to the bottom and we'll be looking at the air and the microfibres that are present in the air that we are breathing  - we are taking the science to the next level."" As well as potentially releasing toxins, plastics are incredibly absorbent and act as sponges for other harmful chemicals floating in the ocean. Sea-going animals mistake microplastics for food and eat them, absorbing these contaminants. Because they don't ultimately break down, these chemicals become concentrated in the bodies of creatures, and are magnified as they move up the food chain. So a predator such as tuna will contain much higher concentrations than something like a shrimp or small fish. As well as science, the crew of Sea Dragon will be aiming to raise public awareness of the plastics issue and to push for solutions. While TV series like Blue Planet 2 have sounded the alarm on plastics, more needs to be done. ""The general perception is that we have an issue, but sometimes we don't understand the problem,"" said Emily Penn. ""When you put a fine mesh net into the water and pull up 1,000 almost invisible microplastic pieces, and then you realise we have 5 trillion fragments on the surface of our oceans and we can't go out there and clean it up, because it's the same size as the algae and the zooplankton."" As part of the efforts to deal with pollution, the BBC has just launched an initiative calledPlastics Watch, tracking the impact of plastic on the environment.
