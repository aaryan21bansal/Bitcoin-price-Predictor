Dozens of elephants killed in Botswana,"Baby elephants, orphaned by poachers, are now being cared for at a new sanctuary in Botswana Carcases of nearly 90 elephants have been found near a famous wildlife sanctuary in Botswana, conservationists say. Elephants Without Borders, which is conducting an aerial survey, said the scale of poaching deaths is the largest seen in Africa. The spike coincides with Botswana's anti-poaching unit being disarmed. Botswana has the world's largest elephant population, but poachers have been breaching its border. Some readers may find the image below distressing The scientist carrying out the extensive wildlife survey said many of the 87 dead elephants were killed for their tusks just weeks ago - and that five white rhinos have been poached in three months. ""I'm shocked, I'm completely astounded. The scale of elephant poaching is by far the largest I've seen or read about anywhere in Africa to date,"" said Dr Mike Chase from Elephants Without Borders. More on this and others stories from the continent 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa The country that brought its elephants back from the brink ""When I compare this to figures and data from the Great Elephant Census, which I conducted in 2015, we are recording double the number of fresh poached elephants than anywhere else in Africa."" That census estimated a third of Africa's elephants had been killed in the last decade and 60% of Tanzania's elephants had been lost in five years. Most of the dead elephants seen in Botswana had their tusks removed Botswana has had a reputation for an unforgiving approach to poachers and had largely escaped the elephant losses seen elsewhere. Despite a lack of fences on the international border, data from tracking collars showed elephants retreating from Angola, Namibia and Zambia and deciding to stay within the boundaries of Botswana where it was thought to be safe. Incidents of poaching in the country were rare because of armed and well-managed anti-poaching units. With 130,000 elephants, Botswana has been described as their last sanctuary in Africa as poaching for ivory continues to wipe out herds across the rest of the continent. The first sign that was changing came two years ago when the BBC flew with Mr Chase close to the Namibian border and he discovered a string of elephant carcasses with their tusks removed for the first time. Watch: Findings from the last Elephant census But these latest killings have been found deep in Botswana - close to the protected Okavango Delta wildlife sanctuary, which attracts tourists from around the world. ""People did warn us of an impending poaching problem and we thought we were prepared for it,"" said Mr Chase, who pointed to the disarmament of the country's anti-poaching unit as a cause. ""The poachers are now turning their guns to Botswana. We have the world's largest elephant population and it's open season for poachers. ""Clearly we need to be doing more to stop the scale of what we are recording on our survey."" Elephants Without Borders conducts regular aerial surveys The government disarmed its anti-poaching units in May - a month after President Mokgweetsi Masisi was sworn into office. The units have focussed much of their effort on the border regions, which have historically been more vulnerable. A senior official in the president's office, Carter Morupisi, told journalists in Botswana at the time that the ""government has decided to withdraw military weapons and equipment from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks"", but he did not explain why. Botswana's 2018 Wildlife Aerial Survey is only half-way through and conservationists fear the final figure of poached elephants will be a lot higher. The survey area is split into sections, or transepts, and the plane flies back and forth like a lawnmower cutting the grass - turning at each end to ensure nothing is missed. ""Fresh carcasses"" are those lost within the last three months, but many of those recorded had been killed within the last few weeks. Conservationists fear the scale of this new poaching problem is being ignored as it is bad for the country's reputation. ""This requires urgent and immediate action by the Botswana government,"" said Mr Chase. ""Botswana has always been at the forefront of conservation and it will require political will. ""Our new president must uphold Botswana's legacy and tackle this problem quickly. Tourism is vitally important for our economy, jobs, as well as our international reputation, which is at stake here as being a safe stronghold for elephants.""

Blue plaque to change after 'lesbian' row,"The plaque is situated at the site where Anne Lister married Ann Walker in 1834 The wording on a blue plaque in York honouring a woman described as the ""first modern lesbian"" is to be looked at again after complaints it had ""erased"" her sexuality. The tribute to 19th Century diarist Anne Lister described her as ""gender-nonconforming"". An online petition claimed the description had ""nothing to do with sexuality"". The group behind the memorial said it would change the wording. Yorkshire breaking news: Jet passengers 'dropped like flies'; Rail route electrification 'a priority' The plaque was unveiled on 24 July at Holy Trinity Church, where Lister received the church's blessing to privately contract a marriage to Ann Walker on 30 March 1834. An online petition set up by Julie Furlong calling on York Civic Trust to change the wording has attracted more than 2,500 signatures. The petition said: ""Anne Lister was, most definitely, gender non-conforming all her life. She was also however, a lesbian. ""Don't let them erase this iconic woman from our history."" Ms Furlong said she was happy the wording was to change. ""I am very happy that they have realised that lesbian erasure is not acceptable, but I will wait to hear on the final wording before expressing opinion as to that."" The plaque was put up at Holy Trinity Church in York The trust said following a meeting with the Churches Conservation Trust, York LGBT Forum and York LGBT History Month a joint decision was made to ""change the wording on the plaque"". The trust added: ""The plaque is intended to be a positive celebration of the union of Anne Lister and Ann Walker, and this remains the case. ""The last thing we wanted to do was to cause offence or upset to any community."" The trust has also apologised for having the rainbow upside down on the plaque. Suranne Jones as Anne Lister and Sophie Rundle as Ann Walker in costume for Gentleman Jack Lister's diaries tell the story of her life and lesbian relationships at Shibden Hall, where she lived between 1791 and 1840. The journals, of more than four million words,were recognised as a ""pivotal"" document in British historyby the United Nations in 2011.

Alfie Evans parents' 'fears' over new baby,"Kate James and Tom Evans had to wait four days to find out if their new baby had the same rare disease that killed his brother The parents of a 23-month-old baby who was at the centre of a high court legal battle over turning off his life support have had a second child. Kate James and Tom Evans, whose son Alfie died at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool in April, revealed their four-week-old son on television. The couple told ITV's This Morning they had to wait four days to see if baby Thomas had the same condition as Alfie. Their fight to prolong Alfie's life was backed by the Pope. Ms James said she learned she was expecting the baby while the couple were waging a legal campaign to stop treatment being withdrawn from Alfie, who had a rare degenerative condition. ""When I first heard I was expecting I was scared,"" she said. She added: ""We were scared about how we would react to this baby. I was scared I would resent the baby because he is not Alfie but it hasn't been like that he is amazing - he is like Alfie's double."" The couple found out two months after the death of Alfie Evans that any child they conceive could have the same condition The couple, from Merseyside, revealed they were told in June that Alfie had the extremely rare brain condition GABA-transaminase deficiency and that there was a one in four chance any future children they conceived might have this disease. They said it was caused by a faulty gene from each parent. Who was Alfie Evans? Legal battle toddler Alfie Evans dies Alfie's father begs Pope 'save our son' Ms James said they were told only 10 children in the world had been diagnosed with the disease and half of those had died. Mr Evans said the couple spent four days waiting for test results were ""the most nerve-wracking"". The tests have proved negative. Ms James added the baby's birth was ""bitter sweet"". Earlier this year the Supreme Court ruled after a prolonged legal battle that doctors al Alder Hey could withdraw life support from Alfie. At one stage Mr Evans met the Pope with a Vatican-owned hospital offering to care for Alfie in Rome when the campaign to save him became global. Who was Alfie Evans?

Main parties meet for Stormont talks,"The talks at Stormont were organised by the Alliance Party leader Naomi Long Northern Ireland's main parties have met for the first time sincethe breakdown of talks in February. The discussions at Stormont on Monday featured the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party as well as independent assembly member Claire Sugden, People Before Profit's Gerry Carroll and Steven Agnew of the Green Party. The TUV's Jim Allister did not attend. The meeting was organised by Alliance leader Naomi Long. Who's calling the shots on NI policy? She said she was pleased so many had responded to her invitation. Mrs Long described the meeting as a ""small step"" and as ""an opportunity to create some space"". The Alliance leader criticised what she said was the ""megaphone diplomacy"" of recent months, adding she hoped the parties were interested in creating a ""credible process"" aimed at restoring devolution. The East Belfast MLA said Monday's discussions were ""candid and constructive"". Sinn Fein MLA Alex Maskey, who attended the meeting, said: ""Sinn FÃ©in is a party of dialogue and we will participate in any process which is credible and can achieve a successful outcome"". ""Institutions of government need to enjoy public confidence and it is intolerable and unacceptable that we are still without an assembly and executive due to the DUP's decision to renege on the draft agreement in February and collapse the political negotiations,"" he added. Nigel Dodds accused Sinn FÃ©in of boycotting the assembly DUP MLA Simon Hamilton also attended the meeting. Separately, his party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""With Parliament returning this week, the government will be required to live up to its commitments to ensure the good governance of Northern Ireland. ""It was not the DUP which collapsed the executive and it is not the DUP which is blocking the restoration of the executive. ""The people of Northern Ireland deserve better and we will ensure that Westminster acts in their best interest. ""The DUP delivers, Sinn FÃ©in boycotts,"" the North Belfast MP added. The TUV said it did not attend the talks because they were ""not designed to address the core of the problem but to resurrect failed institutions"". ""The fundamental issue with the Stormont structures is that they cannot operate without Sinn FÃ©in/IRA,"" a spokesperson said. Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - split in a bitter row. Martin McGuinness, the then deputy first minister, resignedin protest of the handling of the botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme. The Stormont institutions collapsed in January 2017 Since then, the two parties have remained far apart over crucial issues such as Sinn FÃ©in's desire for legislation to give official status to the Irish language in Northern Ireland, rights for same-sex couples to marry and Troubles legacy issues. Several rounds of talks to restore government at Stormont have, so far, failed while the UK government has resisted calls to institute direct rule from Westminster.

Call for 11+ coaching ban to be reviewed,"This video can not be played Undercover filming at 10 Kent private primary schools revealed some fee-paying schools were tutoring A ban on in-school coaching for the 11+ exam should be reviewed, the leader of Kent County Council has said. In-school coaching is not allowed by the council, to level the playing field for grammar school access across independent and state primaries. But an undercover BBC reporter visited 10 fee-paying primary schools in Kent and found nine were tutoring pupils. Council leader Paul Carter said: ""Why shouldn't local schools, as well as private schools, be able to coach?"" A BBC South East reporter posing as a parent found the private schools were running extra classes and summer schools focusing on the exam. Also referred to locally as the Kent Test or Medway Test, it consists of English, maths and reasoning. This year's exam is being held on Thursday, 6 September. Mr Carter was speaking on the day the BBC revealed it found some fee-paying schools were tutoring The best performers will be offered places at grammar schools, which generally outperform their non-selective counterparts. However, critics say children from wealthier backgrounds have an unfair advantage because they are often coached in school, or have private tutors. Mr Carter told the BBC a review was needed. He said: ""All schools should be helping and supporting those that have got the ability to get into grammar school, to help, support and prepare them for the 11+."" Asked if it was time to get rid of the ban on coaching within schools, he said: ""That's my view. Why shouldn't local schools, alongside the private schools, be able to coach their children to pass the 11+?"" There are more than 40 independent primary or ""prep"" schools in Kent Labour's shadow schools minister Mike Kane MP said: ""The selective education system in England is not working effectively. It doesn't select by ability, it selects by income, the socio-economic status of a family."" This video can not be played Anti-grammar school campaigner says the Kent Test is unfair and favours children from wealthy families In a series of recordings with private schools teachers, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, one said: ""It's ridiculous they say you can't be tutored for it... we prepare children for the Kent Test - 100%."" Others were open about giving children examples of past papers, and mock tests ""structured in a very similar way"" to the Kent Test. Only one head denied any extra tutorials, saying ""no school should be coaching children"". Councillor Roger Gough said tutoring was ""not appropriate"" Kent County Council administers the test. It does not specifically define coaching, but said using previous papers for children to practise the question styles would break the rules. Councillor Roger Gough, cabinet member for children, young people and education, said: ""It should be apparent this is not an appropriate approach to a process which seeks to identify the most suitable type of educational placement for children leaving primary school by assessing their ability."" Reality Check: Do grammar schools help poor children? 'New' grammar school opens to pupils Grammar schools: What are they? The county council said it would ""always look at any firm evidence that suggests a school may have engaged in coaching"" and schools found in breach of the rules could be banned from holding future exams. Three were warned about coaching by the council in 2016, but no further action was taken and the council has never banned a school from holding the exam. Angela Culley said children were prepped for the Kent Test outside schools via private tutors Angela Culley, from the Independent Schools Association, said she disagreed with stigmatising private school coaching, when families also had the option to hire private tutors. She said: ""Out there we have tutoring centres preparing children for the 11+ exam. What's the difference?""

Payout for man who lost penis to superbug,"Andrew Lane, pictured with his wife Sue, said he feels like ""less of a man"" since his life-changing operation A cancer patient who lost most of his penis to a flesh-eating superbug has won a six-figure payout. Andrew Lane, 63, contracted the potentially fatal necrotising fasciitis infection following surgery to remove his prostate gland in March 2013. His bowel was punctured during the routine operation at Southend hospital but staff only noticed six days later. Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust admitted there were ""failures"" in diagnosing the problem. Mr Lane, from Thurrock, said: ""They've admitted their mistake, but I've not had an apology and knowing that just a scan a few days earlier would have prevented all of this is very difficult to accept."" Following the life-changing operation, Mr Lane can no longer have sex, is incontinent and has been treated for depression. Mr Lane has also been left looking ""nine months pregnant"" after infected tissue on his stomach had to be removed The damage caused by the infection was so severe that he was left with just an inch-and-a-half of his penis. He was also forced to have the contaminated tissue covering his stomach removed, which has left him looking ""nine months pregnant"". Mr Lane, who married his long-term partner Sue shortly after being discharged from hospital, decided to speak out to warn people how dangerous the necrotising fasciitis bug is. He said: ""I've been compensated, but I'll never get my health back. ""I used to be sporty and proud of my body, but now I can't bear to look in the mirror."" Mr Lane contracted a flesh-eating superbug at Southend Hospital Mr Lane, who works as a carer, added: ""My wife and I have been together for 18 years and enjoyed a healthy sex life but since this happened, that has been impossible. ""The desire is still there, but the little that's left just doesn't function any more. ""I know Sue still loves me, but I feel less of a man."" Denise Townsend, director of nursing at Southend University Hospital, said: ""I can confirm that the trust is in communication with Mr Lane regarding his case, a settlement sum has been agreed and that the trust has admitted failures in relation to delays in Mr Lane's diagnosis.""

And former home secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC's Politics Live: ""Once again, it's a case of leap before you look - there's absolutely no proposal here."" Ms Rudd said the Chequers plan represented ""the best shot we have of Brexit that's going to work for the UK"". EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan The Chequers plan explained Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mr Johnson resigned from the government in July in protest at the deal agreed by the cabinet at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels. Other Tory MPs have also criticised the package, and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he is ""strongly opposed"" to the proposals. Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border. Critics argue this would leave the UK tied to EU rules after it leaves on 29 March 2019, and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it. In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match. He wrote: ""The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head."" Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take ""every important trick"", adding: ""The UK has agreed to hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat."" Please upgrade your browser He said by using the strategy -defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend,external- the UK had ""gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank"". If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would ""throw away most of the advantages of Brexit"". Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to ""stop a proper Brexit"", but added: ""They have been rumbled."" The ""scandal"" around the border problem was ""not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried"", he added. Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border. In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan. ""She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals."" But Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of a group of MPs to meet Mr Barnier on Monday, suggested the EU negotiator agreed with him that the Chequers plan was ""absolute rubbish"" and he preferred the option of a looser arrangement based on Canada's trade agreement with the EU. ""Interestingly, Eurosceptics and Mr Barnier are in greater agreement than Eurosceptics and the government and between Mr Barnier and the government,"" Mr Rees-Mogg said. ""It's very encouraging.""

She added: ""To hear some members of the Conservative Party play fast and loose with the [Northern Ireland] peace settlement is disgusting."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as a ""charlatan"" who must share in responsibility for the ""disaster"" of Brexit. Downing Street also rejected a proposal from former Conservative minister Nick Boles for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area to allow time for a new trade deal to be negotiated. Mr Boles said the PM's plan, as it stands, has ""close to zero"" chance of winning support from Parliament while former education secretary Justine Greening told Radio 4's World at One that it was ""more unpopular with the British public than the poll tax"" and Theresa May should consign it to history.

2018 joint hottest summer for UK,"2018 was the joint hottest summer on record for the UK as a whole, and the hottest ever for England, the Met Office has announced. It said highs for summer 2018 were tied with those of 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the highest since records began in 1910. England's average temperatures narrowly beat those seen in 1976, they added. The heatwave saw soaring temperatures across much of the UK throughout June and July. Dry, sweltering conditions for weeks on end gave way to a more average August, said the Met Office. How does the heatwave compare to 1976? Your heatwave questions answered Next few years could be 'exceptionally warm' People enjoying the sunshine at beach huts on Barry Island, south Wales To the nearest 0.1C, all four years - 2018 as well as 1976, 2003 and 2006 - had an average temperature of 15.8C (60.4F). That is 1.5C above the long-term average, the Met Office said. The margins between the years are so small it's impossible to separate them, they added. This video can not be played 2018: The summer of sizzling sunshine In England, the mean temperature was 17.2C (63F). The 1976 record had been 17C. No records were set for other parts of the UK - although it was close in Wales, with an average of 16C, just 0.1C under the current record set in 1995. The hottest day of 2018 so far was Thursday, 26 July, when temperatures reached 35.3C in Faversham, Kent. But it still did not top the UK's highest-ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham, in August 2003. Heatwave blamed for record A&E attendances Prehistoric sites revealed by heatwave There were winners and losers in the heatwave. Many enjoyed taking the opportunity to sunbathe or spend more time in the garden. But higher temperatures posed a health risk to some people, and there wererecord A&E numbersover the summer. There have also been warningsfood prices could risein the coming months because of the extreme weather. Thousands have flocked to beaches, including this one at Bournemouth... ...but August also saw a return of more average temperatures and rather a lot of rain in places Having record average temperatures is consistent with the general picture of the climate warming in the UK and globally, the Met Office said. A spokeswoman told BBC News: ""It's generally accepted that the risk of heatwaves is increasing due to global warming. ""The temperature has risen, since industrial times, by one degree overall, so we're starting from a degree higher. So the peaks in these heatwaves are going to be a little bit higher as well."" Analysis by Matt McGrath, BBC News environment correspondent The immediate cause of this year's extended warm weather was the meandering jet stream taking a more northerly track over the UK, creating an area of high pressure over Britain which did not shift for weeks. But many scientists are also asking about the role of climate change in ""loading the dice"" and making a heatwave more likely, when an event like the wandering jet stream occurs. An early analysis by researchers from the World Weather Attribution group found that human activities including the burning of fossil fuelsmade this year's European heatwave twice as likely to occur. Met Office researchers say that while there are many natural factors at play in our weather, it is also likely that warming will make our future summers hotter. Friends of the Earth's head of policy Mike Childs said: ""This is yet another bleak warning that we're racing towards catastrophic climate change. ""But rather than taking their foot off the pedal, ministers continue to fuel the crisis with more roads and runways and by championing the development of dirty gas and oil. ""It's time for the government to take the heat off the planet by ending our fossil fuel fixation, investing in energy efficiency and developing the UK's huge renewable power potential."" The scorching summer could now give way to an autumn of above-average temperatures, the Met Office said. They said the three-month outlook, which covers August, September and October, shows ""an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK"". Meteorologists say above-average temperatures are more likely because sea surface temperatures are at ""near-record"" levels. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

EU 'strongly opposes' PM's Brexit plan,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly"" opposed to key parts of Theresa May's proposals for a future trade deal. This morning the prime minister saidshe would not compromise on the UK government's Chequers plan. But Mr Barnier said plans for a ""common rulebook"" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests. ""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces."" While he has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan, sources close to Mr Barnier told the BBC he has not been this explicit before. In response, the UK government insisted its plans were ""precise and pragmatic"" and would work for the UK and the EU. The negotiations between the UK and the EU have an informal October deadline, but Mr Barnier said this could be extended to mid-November. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options In an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Barnier said Mrs May's plans ""would be the end of the single market and the European project"". ""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. ""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits."" Please upgrade your browser He said another problem was that many goods now come with services attached - meaning they were hard to separate in a trade deal. ""We have a coherent market for goods, services, capital and people - our own ecosystem that has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces. There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. ""There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40 percent of the total value."" Mr Barnier's comments were published on the same day Mrs May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she was""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached,external. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunthas warned a no-deal Brexit would be a ""big mistake for Europe"", although Britain ""would survive and prosper"". Various business groups have warned about thepossible impacton the UK of no-deal Brexit. The World Trade Organization - under whose rules the EU and UK would trade if no deal was agreed -said it ""would not be end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"". This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU. ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. ""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU."" The so-called Chequers plan was agreed at the prime minister's country residence in July. It led to the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Barnier has previously criticised the proposals,ruling out allowing the UK to collect customs duties on behalf of the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work.

UK heatwave: Winners and losers,"This summer is set to be one of the hottest - and driest - on record. With no substantial rain since May and temperatures tipping past 30C (86F), a hosepipe ban looms as the heatwave continues to stretch ahead of us in an untypically British manner. There are, as with most things in life, pros and cons to the hot weather. Watering can salespeople enjoy a boom in trade, their counterparts in the electric blanket department see a slump. Butterflies bask in the long hot days, unaware of the jeopardy faced by the next generation of caterpillars. Here are some of the winners and losers of the season. Overcrowdedrail servicesare rarely improved by hot weather, with both practical and personal hurdles to overcome.Heat can buckle tracks and cause delays, while your fellow-traveller's underarm aroma could be escalated by the oven-like atmosphere of the quiet carriage. On the other hand, business is booming atheritage railways. Chuffing along with the wind (and soot) in your hair while hoping to spot Jenny Agutter waving her red petticoat is something that can be enjoyed in soaring temperatures. For example, the Severn Valley Railway is expecting bumper numbers this weekend, and has added new dates for its Wizard Express, while Telford Steam Railway is preparing for 500 people to turn up on Sunday. Shouting ""Oh, my daddy! My daddy!"" is optional. Keeping animals cool in the heatwave What are the effects of a heatwave? The hottest quiz of the year? Try getting agarden parasolfor a reasonable price and you'll be up against it - the cheapest ranges at Ikea, Homebase and B&Q are all low on stock. Sales ofbarbecuesandpaddling poolsalso soared with the temperatures - so once again there is limited availability. People in Birmingham who want to get their hot little mitts on an Argos paddling pool will have to travel to Warwick to get one, while those in Bradford would have to go to Clitheroe to get theirs. Humans aren't the only creatures who shouldslip-slop-slap,external. Cats, especially white ones, should have sun cream put on their ears, and horses' noses are also at risk. Prevent premature pork crackling byapplying sunscreen to pet pigs. Dogs, always eager to go for walks, lollop about and get overexcited, should be exercised in the early morning or late evening when it's a bit cooler for them. The RSPCA suggests,externalletting them splash about in a paddling pool. The Warwick and Clitheroe branches of Argos should therefore stand by to repel hordes of hot hounds. People already booked in for asummer breakin the UK have done well - they have the high temperatures of ""abroad"" without the need to transfer their shampoos and sun creams into 100ml bottles wedged into a freezer bag. According to the Association of British Travel Agents, two thirds of us have planned a British break for this year. Patricia Yates, the director of Visit Britain, said the hot weather acts as a ""timely reminder"" to people who are ""making a late call on where to go on holiday"". Manycampsitesare fully booked but determined searchers will be able to find late-availability pitches. Those who eschewed Margate for Malaga will not only have to limit their luggage but might find their homebody neighbours have a better tan than them when they return. Losers. Butterfliesmay be flitting about having fun in the sun butcaterpillarsare having a terrible time. The plants they need are wilting, and a lack of food might mean they are unable to pupate and survive over the winter. A comparison can be made with the long hot summer of 1976 -research by the University of York,externalsuggests that summer was the worst extreme event to affect butterflies and moths since detailed records began. The heat, coupled with a sustained drought, caused numbers to plummet across at least 50 different species which never fully recovered. There's happy paddling for ducks in Aylesbury Other losers from the hot weather includebadgersandhedgehogs, which find it harder to dig up worms as the ground hardens and worms burrow deeper for an easier passage and to find moisture. And spare a thought forducks-police from Aylesbury did,external.  They filled two paddling pools for the happy quackers. #Savetheducks. Christmas treesare unlikely to be on many minds at the moment, but farmers say there could be a price hike this yuletide season. The heatwave is causing the festive firs to wither and go brown - and some are even dying in the hot weather. It's the smaller - and therefore cheaper - trees that are the most affected, as older and bigger ones have deeper roots with which to reach water. People with a pea-ssimistic outlook also warn that Christmas dinner may be affected. Peacrops are suffering as the plants overexert themselves searching for water and the hot weather kills them before they reach maturity. Marrowfat and split green varieties are the most widely affected, according to the British Edible Pulses Association. It's swings and roundabouts though - as the weather is proving good forlentilcrops. Traditionally grown in India and North Africa, the heatwavehas created good growing conditions,externalin the UK this year. Hot weather makesantsmore active - bad news for those of us fed up of being nipped by the likes of thealready rampant horsefly. But it's good news for creatures like thegreen woodpecker, which enjoys an ant or ten on its summer menu. It's also good weather forlavenderfarmers, as it is a Mediterranean plant and requires a similar climate to thrive. The Provence region of France is where most lavender is commercially grown, but this summer theCotswolds and Kent,externalmay be giving it a run for its money. And lavender sachets at the ready - known for its soporific qualities, it may help you drop off to sleep on these sultry (sweaty) summer nights. What are the effects of a heatwave?

PM: No compromise with EU,"The prime minister says she is confident of a deal Theresa May has insisted she will not be forced into watering down her Brexit plan during negotiations with the EU. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe prime minister says she will ""not be pushed"" into compromises on her Chequers agreement that are not in the ""national interest"". But Mrs May also warns she will not ""give in"" to those calling for a second referendum on the withdrawal agreement. She says it would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy and... trust"". The Chequers agreement would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain friction-less trade at the border. But critics say it will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The EU has suggested that November is the latest a deal could be finalised. The government had previously ruled out another referendum. Brexit: All you need to know The UK's four Brexit options Key dates and potential hurdles The prime minister writes that the coming months are ""critical in shaping the future of our country"", but that she is ""clear"" about her mission in fulfilling ""the democratic decision of the British people"". She adds that following the Chequers agreement in July - which led to the resignation of two cabinet ministers - ""real progress"" has been made in Brexit negotiations. While there is more negotiating to be done, Mrs May writes: ""We want to leave with a good deal and we are confident we can reach one."" The government has been preparing for a no-deal scenario, even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors, she says. But the PM adds: ""We would get through it and go on to thrive."" She goes on to insist in her article that her government will not back another vote. ""In the summer of 2016, millions came out to have their say,"" she writes. ""In many cases for the first time in decades, they trusted that their vote would count; that after years of feeling ignored by politics, their voices would be heard. ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of that trust."" David Davis says the Chequers plan is ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who quit over the Chequers agreement, said he was also against a second referendum. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said he would vote against the Chequers plan in any Commons vote, adding that it would be ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU. He said the problems around the Northern Ireland border with the Irish Republic had been ""heavily overemphasised"" in the past. ""It's a border already - it works perfectly well with careful co-operation between sides,"" he said, and with ""political will"" from the UK and the Republic, it could continue to do so. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Welcome to the new term in politics - it is getting loud already. No sooner has the prime minister said she is committed to her Brexit blueprint than one of her previously loyal MPs has suggested signing up to it would be a ""humiliation"". And no sooner has she insisted that another Brexit referendum would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy"" than one of her own party donors says that is ""balderdash"". It seems, to put it mildly, that we are in for quite a political term. Both the big political parties at Westminster have their fair share of turmoil and the stakes could not be higher. But if the last few months, or the last few years, have taught us anything, it is that we can be very confident there will be a few bumps in the road - whether a Brexit deal is done or not. Writing in the same paper,external, Conservative MP Nick Boles - a former minister who backed Remain - said the Chequers policy had ""failed"" and he could no longer support it. He wrote that the EU was treating the plan as ""an opening bid"", and the UK was facing ""the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels"". Instead, Mr Boles, who is a member of the Brexit Delivery Group, believes the two-year transition period - which the government describes as an implementation period - should be scrapped and replaced with the UK becoming part of the European Economic Area for three years - giving more time for a trade deal to be negotiated. ""The plan I am setting out represents our only hope of a better Brexit,"" he added. Have voters changed their minds? Among the blue flags: Views from the pro-EU march What kind of Brexit do voters want? The People's Vote launched earlier this year to campaign for a vote on any final Brexit deal, and has a number of high-profile backers, including Sir Patrick Stewart and BBC football anchor Gary Lineker. It has also secured funding from donors including Julian Dunkerton, co-founder of fashion label Superdry - who has given the largest donation of Â£1m to the group. One of its supporters, the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said the impetus had shifted toward a public vote over the summer and it would be a ""betrayal of democracy"" for Theresa May ""to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say"". The Conservative donor and former Rolls-Royce chairman Sir Simon Robertson has also joined calls for a second referendum, saying he is ""deeply depressed"" at the tone of the Brexit debate. ""I think it is complete balderdash to say the people have spoken, therefore you can't go back. The people can speak again - why can't we have another vote on it?"" he asked, in an interview with thethe Observer,external. Earlier this week,it was revealed in a leaked memothat the People's Vote wants Labour MPs and activists to submit a motion at the party's conference this month, committing Labour to backing a new referendum on the final deal. The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Sunglasses model's own"" Despite the scorching weather, Lorraine Badcock's mum decided to dress her baby daughter in an outfit of dress, tights and mob cap. Lorraine Badcock: ""My mum still can't decide why she dressed me in this outfit"" Whilst many had fun in the sun wearing knitted bikinis and frilly sunhats, the more serious side to the heatwave was water usage restrictions and standpipes on the streets. In 1976 some households were without running water, which meant getting supplies from standpipes In pictures: The dried parks and parched lawns of Britain How long will it last? Your heatwave questions Jon in Bristol remembers how his school gave out stickers to put on our toilets at home, which read: ""Don't flush the loo more than you have to."" In a nod to the drought, Lara's dad used his creative skills to come up with tap and water tank fancy dress outfits for his children. Lara's dad made these fancy dress costumes during the drought Meanwhile, some children yearned for a dip in a pool, in Christopher Higgins' case, a nice, safe paddling pool, away from creatures of the sea as depicted on his Jaws T-shirt.

At-a-glance: Chequers explained,"The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The cabinet has reached an agreement on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. Here are the key points fromthe three page deal published by the government.,external The UK will ""maintain a common rulebook for all goods"" with the EU, including agricultural products, after Brexit. A treaty will be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland. Parliament will oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules, ""recognising that this would have consequences"". ""Co-operative arrangements"" will be established between EU and UK competition regulators. ""Different arrangements"" will be organised for services ""where it is in our interests to have regulatory flexibility"". A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"". Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"". The borders between the UK and EU will be treated as a ""combined customs territory"". The UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge  EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. A post-Brexit UK would be able to ""control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world"" without causing border disruption. This avoids a hard Irish border, and removes the need for ""backstop"" arrangements to be put in place before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the government says. The agreement says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". A ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. These proposals represent ""a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations"", the government says. According to the government the plan: Gives the UK an independent trade policy, with the ability to set its own non-EU tariffs and to reach separate trade deals Ends the role of the ECJ in UK affairs Ends annual payments to the EU budget with ""appropriate contributions for joint action in specific areas"" The early reaction from Brexiteers has been that they need to see the full 100-plus page plan  to see whether or not they agree with the government's claims. Full details will be released in a white paper next week. This is not a final Brexit deal. This is an agreement on the UK's preferred way forward as negotiations with the European Union about the future relationship reach a crucial stage.

Chris Evans to leave Radio 2 for Virgin,"This video can not be played Chris Evans is to leave BBC Radio 2 after thirteen years at the station Chris Evans has announced he will be leaving the Radio 2 breakfast show after eight years at the helm, and 13 years at the station. ""I'm going to leave. I'm leaving Radio 2,"" he told listeners, but promised he'd stay on air until Christmas. Explaining the decision, he said: ""Some of us are mountain climbers [but] if you get to the top of your favourite mountain and you stay there, you become an observer. ""I want to keep climbing."" Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting Who will take over from Chris Evans? 'It's a blow to lose Chris Evans' After the announcement, he played The Beatles' Twist and Shout, adding: ""You have to keep shaking it up."" He later confirmed he was leaving Radio 2 to host Virgin Radio's breakfast show. The star previously presented The Big Breakfast, before hosting early morning shows on Radio 1, Virgin and Radio 2 Evans took over from Sir Terry Wogan in 2010, and the breakfast show regularly attracts 9m listeners - more than any other UK radio programme. He is currently the second highest-paid star at the BBC, earning Â£1.6 million per year. The star and his wife Natasha are currently expecting twins; and he said his decision to change jobs had been ""big news in our house over the past few weeks and months"". Radio 2: Chris Evans highlights Who will take over from Chris Evans? Chris Evans- 'I'm paid too much' He admitted he'd been deliberating the decision for a year. ""A few weeks ago I made my mind up for sure,"" he said, adding he wanted to ""start up on a brand new adventure"". Speaking to Father Brian D'Arcy, who was delivering Monday's Pause for Thought, Evans said: ""As Sir Terry [Wogan] said: there's never a right time to go, but there could be a wrong time to go."" This video can not be played Chris Evans announces his departure live on air. Evans first joined Radio 2 in September 2005 as the host of the Saturday afternoon show, moving to drive time in April 2006 and the breakfast show in January 2010. During that time, he has also presented The One Show and the poorly-received relaunch of Top Gear following in 2016. But it is his radio show, with its warm and energetic mix of interviews, music and trivia, where the broadcaster truly excelled, creating a familial atmosphere with segments like Kids Get a Fanfare and Listener Breaking News. The children's writing competition 500 Words will remain part of the breakfast show after his departure, Evans said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The broadcaster revealed his decision shortly after 8:00 BST, after hinting at a ""big announcement"" throughout his Monday morning show. The 52-year-old said he had ""loved every second"" of presenting the breakfast programme, but ""I don't want this to be it"". He added that his final scheduled show was on Friday 21 December - but he'd like to bow out with a Christmas Eve special. Virgin Radio has confirmed Evans will be waking up the nation on its radio station in the new year - although no official start date has been given. This video can not be played Lynn Bowles was a familiar voice on Radio 2 for 18 years Evans formerly hosted the breakfast show on the first incarnation of Virgin Radio - which went on to become Absolute Radio - between 1997 and 2001. Virgin Radio UK, which was launched two years ago and is owned by Rupert Murdoch's Wireless Group, is a digital-only station with around 400,000 weekly listeners, compared with Radio 2's figure of 15 million. Speaking about his new appointment, Evans said: ""In many ways Virgin Radio is my spiritual home. I see nothing but exciting and groundbreaking opportunities ahead. In a medium that is changing so quickly on a daily basis, the potential for growth is unprecedented. ""Our plan is to give it all we've got, see where we can get to and have the most possible fun along the way. It makes me smile every time I think about it."" Richard Branson tweeted his happiness at the announcement of Evans' new post welcoming the star ""back where he belongs on Virgin Radio"". Allow Twitter content?

Treasury talks over extra time for Carney,"The Treasury and the Bank of England are in discussions about Mark Carney staying on as governor beyond his present departure date of June 2019. I understand the Treasury is concerned that trying to find a new governor now, amid Brexit talks, would be difficult. It wants to be able to give any new candidate a clear view of what the relationship with the EU will be like. Theresa May's spokesman said Mr Carney had said he intended to step down next year and that was still the plan. The Treasury wants as long an appointment process as possible and there is a belief in Whitehall that Mr Carney is open to staying on for as long as another 12 months, until 2020. The Financial Times reported,externalon Monday that those ""close to the governor"" believed he was positive about an extension. My sources say the possible extension is more to do with the next governor and who the Treasury think they can attract to the post given the present state of the Brexit negotiations, rather than whether Mark Carney staying will reassure the markets. However, regulators and financial market participants on both sides of the Channel also believe that Mr Carney is a reassuring figure during a period of Brexit uncertainty. It has been made clear to me that no deal has been agreed and the extension might be much less than a year, if it happens. The Canadian is due to appear before MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday and will be asked about his intentions. In October 2016 Mr Carney said he wouldstep down in June 2019- one year more than the five he had committed to, but still two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors serve. Speculation about the governor's future was first sparked by an item on the Evening Standard's diary pages last week saying the government had approached him about staying on.

Corbyn-backers sweep Labour elections,"Peter Willsman's election to Labour's ruling body has provoked controversy A Labour Party official who suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks has been re-elected to the party's ruling body. Peter Willsman was criticised when a recording of his remarks emerged in July, and the pro-Corbyn Momentum group withdrew its backing for him. But he is one of nine people elected to Labour's National Executive Committee. The remaining eight members of Momentum's slate were also elected. Labour pressure over Corbyn ally's remarks Momentum backs Labour candidate shake-up A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims In his recorded remarks, made during a Labour NEC meeting, Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He later apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported and that he would be referring himself for equalities training. Momentum founder Jon Lansman has also been re-elected to the executive committee. Comedian and longstanding Labour activist Eddie Izzard missed out, finishing in 10th place. This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Mr Willsman said and why it matters The centrist Progress group put forward nine candidates but they finished well behind the Momentum slate, who were referred to by supporters on Twitter as the #JC9. Labour MP Wes Streeting, a critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Mr Willsman's past comments should disqualify him from having any say over internal party rules regarding anti-Semitism. He told Channel 4 News that Mr Willsman should ""do the decent thing"" and refuse to take up the seat and, if he did not, the party should take action. While he acknowledged the left of the party had control over Labour's machinery, he said its ""paranoia"" was preventing the party from dealing with issues which were doing ""extraordinary harm"" to its reputation. But his fellow Labour MP, Chris Williamson, hailed the outcome as a victory over ""the haters and the smearers"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And Momentum said it showed the power of ""ordinary members"" to shape the direction of a ""reinvigorated, democratic"" party. Labour's NEC is expected to vote on Tuesday on whether to adopt, in full, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's anti-Semitism guidelines. Labour's code of conduct, which does not include all of the IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, has caused a drawn-out row within the party. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Mr Willsman had been ""let off the hook"" by Labour officials and Mr Corbyn should have personally intervened to rebuke him. ""The election of Peter Willsman to Labour's NEC following his reprehensible comments about Jews is deeply concerning,"" said its vice-president, Amanda Bowman. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he backed accepting the IHRA definition in full, including all examples. But he said the right of Labour members to criticise the actions of the Israeli government and to advocate the rights of Palestinians must be protected, as long they used acceptable language. ""I am hoping we can resolve it both in terms of the Labour Party but more importantly that we can then unite and work with community organisations - particularly from the Jewish community - to tackle anti-Semitism within our wider society,"" he said.

Roxanne Pallett: 'I apologise to Ryan',"This video can not be played Roxanne Pallet: 'I massively apologise to Ryan' Roxanne Pallett has apologised to Ryan Thomas, saying she ""overreacted"" when he ""punched"" her on Celebrity Big Brother. Her appearance on Channel 5's debut Jeremy Vine show was her first interview since leaving Celebrity Big Brother this weekend. The incident has since received over 11,000 Ofcom complaints. ""I massively apologise to Ryan, his friends and fans and every single person who watched that,"" Pallett said. ""[It was] an overreaction to what wasn't a malicious act. ""I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation."" Roxanne leaves CBB house after 'punch' 11,000 complaints over CBB 'punching' episode Contestant Ryan Thomas received a warning after Thursday's episode, which appeared to show him punching Roxanne during a play fight.

This video can not be played Lucy Mecklenburgh defends boyfriend Ryan Thomas over ""complete lie"" ""We both know and Roxanne knows there was no malice, hurt or anger in anything I did during this time. I am sorry and I understand,"" he said. Channel 5 say they ""monitor contestants and intervene when necessary"". The reaction to the incident was largely in support of Thomas, with Roxanne Pallett's family choosing to delete her social media accounts whilst she was in the house after they received thousands of messages from the public. Ryan Thomas was accused of punching Roxanne Pallett addressed the social media comments and said: ""I don't blame anyone, I understand everyone, I had to realise I'm dramatic and all the things people are calling me, I am. ""I need to better myself and this is a serious subject and is something I need to focus on. ""I need to rebuild my career and my personal life, this has overshadowed everything and I'm taking this massively seriously."" She added that she didn't want people to think she was undermining them, saying: ""I have been a victim of domestic abuse. I've worked with Women's Aid because of my own experience and perhaps they were right, my reaction was a tell-tale sign I had been in a situation like that. ""I would be horrified if people thought I had discredited and undermined abuse. ""After it happened, my mind ran away with me and everything in that house becomes so heightened - a look, a comment an action, your insecurities and sensitivity - in the moment it felt worse than it was."" Lucy Mecklenburgh appeared on BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Her interview comes after Thomas' girlfriend, former Towie star Lucy Mecklenburgh appeared on BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. She described the events on Celebrity Big Brother as ""hard to watch"". ""We know Ryan wouldn't hurt a fly, we all know the truth but for him to go through thinking everyone on the outside thinks he's a woman beater. ""His mum and brothers are in bits but we don't want people saying things like this when he has a daughter."" She also asked that Pallett ""publicly apologise to Ryan"", which she did a short time later on Jeremy Vine. Mecklenburgh also addressed Thomas' warning and asked that Celebrity Big Brother remove any strikes against the actor. ""I want Channel 5 to revoke the warning, in the past they've been for serious things and he didn't do that, people are angry and there are so many Ofcom complaints - everyone can see with their eyes that nothing happened.""

Drug dealer with child in car jailed,"Maurice Smith has been jailed for 40 months after admitting possessing cocaine with intent to supply A man who had his young daughter in the car with him when he was found to be carrying cocaine with a possible street value of Â£92,000 has been jailed. Jailing Maurice Smith, 56, for 40 months, a Carlisle Crown Court judge said ""the more cynical"" could think he was using the nine-year-old as ""cover"". Police found 250g (0.5lbs) of cocaine in a child's cardboard toy box in Smith's BMW on the M6 on 1 August. Smith, of Dearham, admitted possessing the Class A drug with intent to supply. Police stopped the car on the M6 southbound near Carlisle at about 14:00 BST after spotting it being driven suspiciously, the court heard. Officers found Â£1,130 in cash in the car as well as the drug which a police drugs expert had concluded could potentially be worth between Â£74,000 and Â£92,500 on the street if ""bulked out"" into greater quantities. Smith, of Craika Road, was told having his daughter in the car at the same time as the drugs was an ""aggravating feature"". Recorder Kevin Grice said: ""The more cynical may think that you were using the child, therefore, as cover for the transportation of drugs.""

New robot surgery system coming to NHS,"The Versius robot is designed and built in Cambridge A British company has unveiled a new robotic surgery system, which is expected to operate on patients for the first time next year. The Versius robot, designed and built in Cambridge, is a rival to the American da Vinci system, which is used in more than 70 hospitals in the UK. Versius is smaller, and the company behind it, CMR Surgical, believes it will be more flexible and versatile than existing robots, allowing it to perform a wider range of operations. Versius has independent modular arms which are ""quick and easy to set up"", said Luke Hares, co-founder of CMR Surgical. ""This means hospitals will be able to keep it busy, making it economical to run."" Each of the robot arms has flexible joints like a human arm, which are controlled by a surgeon sitting at a console using two joysticks and a 3D screen. Robot systems use laparoscopic, also known as keyhole, surgery, which is carried out with special instruments via small incisions. A surgeon (left) steers the da Vinci robot from a console This leads to reduced pain and faster recovery for patients, compared with conventional surgery. Robotic surgery also gives surgeons a better magnified view and increased dexterity. ""It takes around 80 hours to teach suturing with manual laparoscopic tools and some surgeons find it impossible to master,"" said  Addenbrooke's Hospital surgeon Mark Slack, a co-founder of CMR Surgical. ""By contrast, it takes half an hour to teach using Versius - this will enable many more surgeons to deliver the benefits of keyhole surgery."" The robotic surgery field is dominated by da Vinci, made by Californian company Intuitive Surgical. Da Vinci robots have been operating in the UK since 2001 and there are now more than 4,500 worldwide. They are used mostly for prostate, bladder and gynaecological surgery, although their range of operations is expanding. Key patents for the da Vinci system recently expired, which has encouraged other companies to enter the field of surgical robotics. Google has partnered with Johnson & Johnson on medical equipment manufacturer Verb Surgical. The company aims to have its robots connected to the internet so they can learn from each other. It is aiming to launch in 2020. Medtronic, the world's largest medical device company, also has a surgical robot, due for release next year. Nadine Hachach-Haram, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at St Thomas' Hospital, London, said robotics will play an increasingly important role in the operating theatre. ""The newer generation robots are more versatile, compact and cost-effective, which means we can deliver robotic surgery locally and not in large hospitals with dedicated robotic suites,"" she said. Dr Hachach-Haram, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons' Commission on the Future of Surgery, said, in the future, robots may do some elements of surgery independently. ""Surgeons will remain in control but as we develop the human-robot interface there may be simple parts of an operation, such as suturing or closing a wound that may be automated."" The Versius robot is expected to receive a European health and safety approval mark within the next few months. The price of the robot system has not been revealed, but CMR Surgical says it aims to make it more cost-effective for NHS hospitals than its American rival.

Funding cuts blamed for Rio museum fire,"This video can not be played Footage shows the huge scale of the blaze Officials in Brazil have blamed lack of funding for a huge fire that has ravaged the country's National Museum. One of the largest anthropology and natural history collections in the Americas was almost totally destroyed in Sunday's fire in Rio de Janeiro. This included the 12,000-year-old remains of a woman known as ""Luzia"" - the oldest discovered in Latin America. There had also been a string of complaints about the dilapidated state of the 200-year-old museum. ""We never had adequate support,"" its deputy director said after the fire. Experts had warned for years of a serious fire risk to the building. The museum director said ""Luzia is a priceless loss for everyone interested in civilization"" Presidential candidate Marina Silva criticised lack of investment. ""Given the financial straits of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and all the other public universities the last three years, this was a tragedy that could be seen coming,"" Ms Silva, a left-wing politician standing in next month's election, tweeted. The fire started on Sunday evening, after the building - a 19th Century former royal palace - closed for the day. The cause is not known, but Culture Minister Sergio Sa Leitao was quoted in Brazilian media as saying it may have been ignited by a small paper hot air balloon landing on the roof. No injuries have been reported but most of the 20 million items the museum contained went up in flames. In pictures: Rio museum destroyed in huge blaze Treasure-trove museum - from a meteorite to a 12,000-year-old skeleton Brazil's President Michel Temer said in a tweet that it was a ""sad day for all Brazilians"",externalas ""200 years of work, research and knowledge were lost"". Mr Sa Leitao said it was a ""tragedy that could have been avoided"" but a reconstruction effort would begin. Prof Paulo Buckup, an expert in fish science at the museum, arrived at 19:30 (22:30 GMT) local time to find parts of the building where animal specimens were kept still intact. ""It's unfortunate but the firefighters were not in a position to do anything, to fight anything,"" he told BBC Brasil's Julia Carneiro. ""They had no water, no ladders, no equipment. ""So we took the initiative to get in to try and save what we could. We had to break down doors. The soldiers helped us carry things."" Employees are distraught at the loss of so many artefacts Prof Buckup rushed into the burning building to save its extensive collection of molluscs rescuing ""a few thousand"" specimens, a ""tiny"" part of the collection. ""I don't know how many tens of thousands of insects and crustaceans were lost,"" he says. ""I feel very sorry for my colleagues, some of whom have worked here for 30 or 40 years. Now all evidence of their work is lost, their lives have lost meaning, too."" A deputy director at the museum, Luiz Fernando Dias Duarte, expressed ""immense anger"", and accused Brazilian authorities of a ""lack of attention"". ""We fought years ago, in different governments, to obtain resources to adequately preserve everything that was destroyed today."" Demonstrators gathered at the gates of the museum on Monday morning, protesting against the budget cuts that they blame for the fire. Police were seen firing tear gas. Protesters gathered at the museum gates One issue appears to be the lack of a sprinkler system. Mr Dias Duarte told Globo TV that a $5.3m (Â£4.1m) modernisation plan agreed in June would have included the installation of modern fire prevention equipment, but only after October's elections. A major dinosaur exhibition, which was forced to shut following a termite attack five months ago, had recently reopened only thanks to a crowdfunding campaign. Museum librarian Edson Vargas da Silva told local media that the building had wooden floors and contained ""a lot of things that burn very fast"", such as paper documents. The museum, Brazil's oldest, is managed by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the federal government has been struggling with huge budget imbalances in recent years. The deficit was about 8% of GDP in 2017, only slightly down from a record 10% two years earlier. But Rio de Janeiro state is also facing a budget crisis. Firefighters were able to retrieve a number of items from the burning building Roberto Robadey, a spokesman for the Rio fire department, is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that the hydrants closest to the museum were not working and that firefighters had to get water from a nearby lake. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent The pale yellow building is still standing - but the windows are burned out, the roof has gone and its insides are black. Throughout the day, firefighters, investigators and even museum staff have been going into the building and every so often they have brought out bits of artefacts or anything they think they can salvage from the rubble. Hundreds of people gathered outside, watching the developments - many of them in tears. Some researchers and academics I spoke to said they were still hopeful that some material on the ground floor could be saved - that is if it hadn't been crushed by the force of the upper floors collapsing on top of it. With their knowledge of where the archives were kept, they've been tipping off firefighters on where to go to rescue material in the hope that at least some of Brazil's most important history can be saved. Its 20 million artefacts included fossils and dinosaur bones. The jewel in the crown for many visitors was ""Luzia"". ""Luzia is a priceless loss for everyone interested in civilization,"" museum director Paulo Knauss told the AFP news agency. Using her skull, experts had produced a digital image of her face, which was used as the base for a sculpture that was also gutted by the fire. Another popular exhibit was the BendegÃ³ meteorite, weighing more than five tonnes and discovered in BahÃ­a state in the 18th Century. Images taken in the aftermath suggest it is still intact. The National Museum's BendegÃ³ meteorite, after the fire The building was also home to items covering the centuries from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s to the declaration of a republic in 1889. The ethnology collection had unique pieces from the pre-Columbian era and artefacts from indigenous cultures. Portugal's royal family transferred the court to the building in 1808, when the country faced the threat of invasion from Napoleon. The museum was established in 1818, with the aim of promoting scientific research by making its collection available to specialists.

Bodyguard beats Vanity Fair in ratings,"Richard Madden is assigned to protect Keeley Hawes in Bodyguard BBC One's thriller Bodyguard fought off ITV's new period drama Vanity Fair in Sunday's TV ratings, attracting more than twice as many people as its rival. The shows went head-to-head at 21:00 BST. The third episode of Bodyguard was seen by an average of 6.6 million viewers, according to overnight figures. The launch of Vanity Fair averaged 2.9 million. It followed The X Factor, whose ratings fell from 5.7 million on Saturday to five million on Sunday. Olivia Cooke plays Becky Sharpe, with Tom Bateman as Captain Rawdon Crawley in Vanity Fair Vanity Fair, based on William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th Century novel, has been billed as the programme to fill the gap left by Downton Abbey on ITV. It stars Olivia Cooke, who acted in Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One before playing Thackeray's ambitious protagonist Becky Sharp. Olivia Cooke: 'Without Spielberg I'd be the Vanity Fair maid' Bodyguard: What the critics say ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo recently said Vanity Fair came about partly because it's his mother's favourite book, and that he originally wanted a more famous actress to play the lead. ""I wanted Emma Watson or someone everyone would have known,"" he told the Edinburgh Television Festival last month. ""But Olivia will be known. She is absolutely brilliant in this and mesmerising and it's so flamboyantly directed. I think it's just fun and flashy and a huge budget for us, and I'm really excited."" The X Factor launch saw new judge Robbie Williams duet with Andy Hofton Speaking about what ratings he would expect any drama on the channel to register, he said: ""If they're only going to get 2.5 million viewers, that's not right for us. Our drama needs to be broad by definition, it needs to be impactful."" Vanity Fair is up against Bodyguard, which stars Richard Madden as an officer assigned to protect the home secretary, played by Keeley Hawes. Richard Madden 'not paid much' in Game of Thrones Its ratings have stayed flat - its first two episodes last Sunday and Monday attracted 6.7 and 6.4 million respectively in the overnight ratings. Meanwhile, the 15th series of X Factor began with an audience of 5.7 million on Saturday - down on the six million who tuned in to watch the launch show last year. That means Saturday's ratings were the lowest for a launch night since the programme started in 2004, when 4.9 million watched the opening episode.

Police to test sight of stopped drivers,"At present, there's a single mandatory check of a driver's eyesight when they take their test Drivers who fail to read a number plate from 20m (65ft) away when stopped by police will have their licences revoked immediately in a new crackdown. Three forces in England are planning to test every motorist they stop in a bid to clamp down on drivers with defective eyesight. Police say data from the tests will be used to improve understanding of the extent of poor driver vision. The forces taking part are Thames Valley, Hampshire and West Midlands. Officers can request an urgent revocation of a licence through the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if they believe the safety of other road users will be put at risk if a driver remains on the road. Under current rules, the only mandatory examination of a driver's vision takes place during the practical test, when learners must read a number plate from 20 metres. Teen death mum backs rule change Wrong way driver, 87, failed eye test What are the rules about eyesight and driving? (DVLA),external After a person has obtained a licence, it is up to them to inform the DVLA if they develop vision problems. The DVLA said if a licence has been revoked because a driver has failed the eyesight test, evidence must be provided on reapplication showing that the driver's vision meets the required standard. If the evidence provided is acceptable, the agency will require an additional eye test. Sgt Rob Heard, representing the police forces taking part in the campaign, said: ""Not being able to see a hazard or react to a situation quickly enough can have catastrophic consequences."" If your licence is revoked -which can occur for a number of medical reasons,external- you will have to apply for a new one, paying the fee as you would for a first licence. The DVLA will give you a disqualification period, during which a driver cannot apply for a new licence. You can then reapply eight weeks before the end of this period, and you may need to send evidence that you are fit to drive. The letter from the DVLA will tell you if this is the case. Not having a valid driving licence will often mean that your insurance is invalid. He warned that officers will be carrying out eyesight checks ""at every opportunity"". The power to revoke licences was introduced in 2013 under Cassie's Law, named after 16-year-old Cassie McCord, who died when an 87-year-old man lost control of his vehicle in Colchester, Essex. It later emerged he had failed a police eyesight test days earlier, but a legal loophole meant he was allowed to continue driving. Teen death mum backs rule change Mother lobbies for change in law.

One-legged golfer sues for discriminationPaul Houghton had his leg amputated but a golf course wanted a doctor's letter for him to use a buggy.UK,"This video can not be played Paul Houghton says the council discriminated against him A golfer with a prosthetic leg is suing a local council for refusing to let him play on its course using a buggy. Paul Houghton's right leg was amputated in 2000 after he was affected by a lethal tissue-eating bacteria. Mr Houghton learned to walk again - and golf became an important part of life but he still also uses crutches and a wheelchair. He claims Brentwood Council in Essex discriminated against him but the council is defending the legal action. Paul is lucky to be alive. In November 2000, while working as a roofer, he knelt in contaminated water and contracted the deadly flesh eating bug necrotizing fasciitis.  It consumes muscle and body tissue at a rate of 0.75in (2cm) an hour. ""The surgeon told me he had to operate immediately,"" Paul told the BBC. ""He said that he had no choice but to continue cutting until he was certain he had removed all the infected tissue. ""I had just two hours to prepare myself for an operation that at best I would survive with a leg missing, but at worst I would not survive at all."" His right leg was amputated above the knee, and he received the last rites in hospital. In all he had five operations, some for skin grafts because his amputation was very rushed and the perfect stump could not be formed. Paul could not continue to work as a roofer and his business was wound up. He requalified and now works for Chelmsford Council as its access officer in building control. He learned to walk with a prosthetic limb and switches between it, wheelchairs and crutches. However, overuse of the crutches causes shoulder injuries, while the prosthetic leg can cause pressure sores that are difficult to cure. Paul has represented England at disability golf 13 times, with a handicap of 14, and has played on courses across Europe. Because of his disability he needs a buggy in order to play an 18-hole course. In August 2016, Paul had booked to play a round with a friend at Hartswood Golf Course in Essex. It is owned and operated by Brentwood Council. On his way to the first tee he claims he was told he would not be allowed on to the course without a letter from his doctor justifying the medical need for a buggy. If he obtained such a letter he was told he would be given a certificate allowing him to use his buggy. ""I was gobsmacked,"" he told the BBC. ""I've played over 100 courses around England, I've played all around the world and I've not been treated in this way before."" Paul says he explained that he had his own insurance, a European Disabled Golf Association card, and a medical exemption, but the club insisted that he needed a letter from a doctor to justify the use of a buggy. ""It sends the message that disabled people aren't welcome, that we are not part of society, not included, but are segregated and can't join in a sport that's accessible to everybody, because we need to use other equipment to play the game,"" Paul says. In his legal claim, Paul argues that by refusing to allow him to use a buggy without a doctor's letter, the council discriminated against him because of his inability to walk around the golf course. In effect, he claims the council was applying a policy that indirectly discriminates against all disabled people who need a buggy to play golf. Brentwood Council denies any discrimination and is defending the legal action. The council said it was ""committed to ensuring safe access for everyone to all its facilities"" and would issue a full statement when legal action had concluded. Paul Houghton's solicitor, Chris Fry from the firm Fry Law, said: ""This case is more than just about making a service more accessible; it's a reminder of the importance of the benefits which sport brings to social inclusion, together with physical and mental health. ""This is especially important for people with a range of disabilities, and not least mobility impairments. ""A simple adjustment in this case will benefit Paul, and thousands of others in a multitude of ways."" Paul has represented England numerous times In its ""Buggy Use Policy"", England Golf, the governing body of amateur golf, says it ""wishes to encourage the participation in golf of all players regardless of disabilities"". This, it says, is in accordance with its obligations under the Equality Act. Cae Menai-Davis, co-founder of the Golf Trust, a charity that works with disabled groups to make golf more inclusive, commented: ""Golf is a sport for everyone. ""Making it difficult for a disabled golfer to use a buggy isn't just bad policy, it is bad business. ""There is a huge untapped group of people with learning and physical disabilities that want to play the game and will benefit hugely from it.""

Blue plaque to change after 'lesbian' rowAn online petition calls for a plaque in York honouring Anne Lister to reflect her sexuality.York & North Yorkshire,"The plaque is situated at the site where Anne Lister married Ann Walker in 1834 The wording on a blue plaque in York honouring a woman described as the ""first modern lesbian"" is to be looked at again after complaints it had ""erased"" her sexuality. The tribute to 19th Century diarist Anne Lister described her as ""gender-nonconforming"". An online petition claimed the description had ""nothing to do with sexuality"". The group behind the memorial said it would change the wording. Yorkshire breaking news: Jet passengers 'dropped like flies'; Rail route electrification 'a priority' The plaque was unveiled on 24 July at Holy Trinity Church, where Lister received the church's blessing to privately contract a marriage to Ann Walker on 30 March 1834. An online petition set up by Julie Furlong calling on York Civic Trust to change the wording has attracted more than 2,500 signatures.

"Breaking|Breaking news2018 'joint-hottest summer' for UK2018 was joint-hottest summer on record for UK as a whole and the hottest for England, Met Office saysUK","2018 was the joint hottest summer on record for the UK as a whole, and the hottest ever for England, the Met Office has announced. It said highs for summer 2018 were tied with those of 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the highest since records began in 1910. England's average temperatures narrowly beat those seen in 1976, they added. The heatwave saw soaring temperatures across much of the UK throughout June and July. Dry, sweltering conditions for weeks on end gave way to a more average August, said the Met Office. How does the heatwave compare to 1976? Your heatwave questions answered Next few years could be 'exceptionally warm' People enjoying the sunshine at beach huts on Barry Island, south Wales To the nearest 0.1C, all four years - 2018 as well as 1976, 2003 and 2006 - had an average temperature of 15.8C (60.4F). That is 1.5C above the long-term average, the Met Office said. The margins between the years are so small it's impossible to separate them, they added. This video can not be played 2018: The summer of sizzling sunshine In England, the mean temperature was 17.2C (63F). The 1976 record had been 17C. No records were set for other parts of the UK - although it was close in Wales, with an average of 16C, just 0.1C under the current record set in 1995. The hottest day of 2018 so far was Thursday, 26 July, when temperatures reached 35.3C in Faversham, Kent. But it still did not top the UK's highest-ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham, in August 2003. Heatwave blamed for record A&E attendances Prehistoric sites revealed by heatwave There were winners and losers in the heatwave. Many enjoyed taking the opportunity to sunbathe or spend more time in the garden. But higher temperatures posed a health risk to some people, and there wererecord A&E numbersover the summer. There have also been warningsfood prices could risein the coming months because of the extreme weather. Thousands have flocked to beaches, including this one at Bournemouth... ...but August also saw a return of more average temperatures and rather a lot of rain in places Having record average temperatures is consistent with the general picture of the climate warming in the UK and globally, the Met Office said. A spokeswoman told BBC News: ""It's generally accepted that the risk of heatwaves is increasing due to global warming. ""The temperature has risen, since industrial times, by one degree overall, so we're starting from a degree higher. So the peaks in these heatwaves are going to be a little bit higher as well."" Analysis by Matt McGrath, BBC News environment correspondent The immediate cause of this year's extended warm weather was the meandering jet stream taking a more northerly track over the UK, creating an area of high pressure over Britain which did not shift for weeks. But many scientists are also asking about the role of climate change in ""loading the dice"" and making a heatwave more likely, when an event like the wandering jet stream occurs. An early analysis by researchers from the World Weather Attribution group found that human activities including the burning of fossil fuelsmade this year's European heatwave twice as likely to occur. Met Office researchers say that while there are many natural factors at play in our weather, it is also likely that warming will make our future summers hotter. Friends of the Earth's head of policy Mike Childs said: ""This is yet another bleak warning that we're racing towards catastrophic climate change. ""But rather than taking their foot off the pedal, ministers continue to fuel the crisis with more roads and runways and by championing the development of dirty gas and oil. ""It's time for the government to take the heat off the planet by ending our fossil fuel fixation, investing in energy efficiency and developing the UK's huge renewable power potential."" The scorching summer could now give way to an autumn of above-average temperatures, the Met Office said. They said the three-month outlook, which covers August, September and October, shows ""an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK"". Meteorologists say above-average temperatures are more likely because sea surface temperatures are at ""near-record"" levels. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

Water companies set out plans to cut billsFirms have set out how they intend to cut water bills as part of the regulator's five year review.,"Water companies have set out plans to cut bills for millions of consumers in England and Wales. Severn Trent and United Utilities said they would cut the average bill by 5% and 10.5% respectively. Thames Water said bills would be unchanged. South West Water said it would offer customers,externala stake in the business. The plans are being submitted by water companies in England and Wales to the regulator Ofwat for the five years between 2020-2025. Ofwat will publish an assessment of each company's plan in January 2019. Water UK, the lobby group for the industry in the UK, summarised the plans submitted to Ofwat by the nine main providers and a number of smaller providers in England. It found  average domestic water bills were planned to fall by more than 4% in real terms across England as a whole. The regulatorsaid in Decemberthat the results of its price review would result in a cut in bills between Â£15 and Â£25 a year from 2020 to 2025. Water bills set to fall by up to Â£25 from 2020 Labour's plan for state control of water, power and rail Since privatisation in 1989, water bills have risen above inflation by about 40% and the regulator has faced criticism for overestimating the costs incurred by water companies, which have been taken into account by Ofwat during its price reviews. The latest price review was announced at a time when the Labour partyhad been discussing taking companies into public ownership. John Russell, Ofwat senior director for strategy and planning, said: ""We've reached a milestone in our price review process. From now and until January 2019 we'll pore over each and every business plan and we'll be looking for evidence that they are robust, ambitious and, crucially, that they have been shaped by customers."" Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, said that while bills would be flat over the five-year period being reviewed it intended to invest some Â£2.1bn to ""boost resilience and reduce leakage"" after it wasfined Â£120 million in June over leakage failures. In the North West of England, customers of United Utilities are being promised a 10.5% reduction on average bills in real terms and 250,000 fewer households in water poverty by 2025. Severn Trent said the 5% fall in real terms it was promising its 8.1 million customers was the largest in two decades. Its 200,000 customers at its Welsh operation Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig, though, will incur bill rises of 2.2%, although it said these would still be the lowest in Wales. Welsh Water, which has three million customers across most of Wales, Herefordshire and parts of Deeside and Cheshire, said average bills should fall by 5% by 2025 and that costs would be reduced by 10% to help fund the cut. At South West Water, average customer bills are being forecast to fall by 11% and for 9% at its Bournemouth Water arm by 2025. South West Water also sets out a ""first of a kind"" plan to offer customers a stake in the business from 2020 and the prospect of meetings where customers can cast votes. Customers could be given an option, alongside bill reductions, rebates and reinvestment, to have shares in parent company Pennon or a stake in South West Water itself. Anglian Water said its bills would rise - but by less than 1%. The region receives only two thirds of the national average rainfall. Ofwat has required companies to set out how much they intend to invest, what they will charge customers, how they will support vulnerable customers and how they will ensure their infrastructure is resilient for the long-term. Water UK said water companies in England intended to cut leakage by more than 16% over the five years. This is the biggest leakage programme for 20 years and would save the equivalent of 184 Olympic-size swimming pools of water every day by 2025, Water UK said.

Johnson: Chequers means Brexit disaster,"Boris Johnson has spoken out against Theresa May's plans for Brexit in a newspaper column Boris Johnson has savaged Theresa May's Brexit plans, saying they would leave the UK with ""diddly squat"" after the negotiations and hand the EU ""victory"". The ex-foreign secretaryused his Daily Telegraph column,externalto say the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain. Downing Street hit back, saying his article contained ""no new ideas"" and that ""serious leadership with a serious plan"" was needed. It comes after the EU's negotiator criticised the UK's proposals. The so-called Chequers deal was agreed by cabinet at the prime minister's country residence as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels. EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan The Chequers plan explained Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border. It also officially ends the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, but the ECJ would continue to be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to stick to. Critics say the deal will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. The negotiations between the UK and EU have an informal deadline tied to a summit in October - although figures on both sides have said it could slip back to November. If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it - and BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described what happens if they reject it as a ""great unknown"". ""Nobody can answer that question because it simply has not happened before,"" she added. In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match. He wrote: ""The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head."" Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take ""every important trick"", adding: ""The UK has agreed to hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat."" Please upgrade your browser He said by using the strategy -defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend,external- the UK had ""gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank"". If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would ""throw away most of the advantages of Brexit"". Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to ""stop a proper Brexit"", but added: ""They have been rumbled."" The ""scandal"" around the border problem was ""not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried"", he added. Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border. In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""Boris Johnson resigned over Chequers. There's no new ideas in this article to respond to. ""What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan. ""She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals."" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""Typical Johnson. False promises. Then refusal to take responsibility for his own actions. It's always someone else's fault."" This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July Meanwhile, in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised the Chequers deal, saying to agree to it would see ""the end of the single market and the European project"". He said plans for a ""common rulebook"" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests, adding: ""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades. You cannot play with it by picking pieces."" ""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. ""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third[-party] countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits."" Michel Barnier has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, one of Mrs May's allies, former First Secretary of State Damian Green, said it would be ""difficult but not impossible"" for the Chequers plan to win the support of MPs in the House of Commons. He said it was ""absolutely certain"" there was no Parliamentary majority for a so-called ""hard Brexit"" and challenged supporters of that option to come up with a proposal that could win the support of the House of Commons. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan, told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mrs May should not be replaced, because ""we don't need any more turbulence right now"". ""What matters in all of this is not the personality politics, it's the outcome at the end,"" he added. Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said of Chequers: ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. ""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU."" On Sunday, Mrs May wrote that she was ""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached on Brexit. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors.

One-legged golfer sues for discrimination,"This video can not be played Paul Houghton says the council discriminated against him A golfer with a prosthetic leg is suing a local council for refusing to let him play on its course using a buggy. Paul Houghton's right leg was amputated in 2000 after he was affected by a lethal tissue-eating bacteria. Mr Houghton learned to walk again - and golf became an important part of life but he still also uses crutches and a wheelchair. He claims Brentwood Council in Essex discriminated against him but the council is defending the legal action. Paul is lucky to be alive. In November 2000, while working as a roofer, he knelt in contaminated water and contracted the deadly flesh eating bug necrotizing fasciitis.  It consumes muscle and body tissue at a rate of 0.75in (2cm) an hour. ""The surgeon told me he had to operate immediately,"" Paul told the BBC. ""He said that he had no choice but to continue cutting until he was certain he had removed all the infected tissue. ""I had just two hours to prepare myself for an operation that at best I would survive with a leg missing, but at worst I would not survive at all."" His right leg was amputated above the knee, and he received the last rites in hospital. In all he had five operations, some for skin grafts because his amputation was very rushed and the perfect stump could not be formed. Paul could not continue to work as a roofer and his business was wound up. He requalified and now works for Chelmsford Council as its access officer in building control. He learned to walk with a prosthetic limb and switches between it, wheelchairs and crutches. However, overuse of the crutches causes shoulder injuries, while the prosthetic leg can cause pressure sores that are difficult to cure. Paul has represented England at disability golf 13 times, with a handicap of 14, and has played on courses across Europe. Because of his disability he needs a buggy in order to play an 18-hole course. In August 2016, Paul had booked to play a round with a friend at Hartswood Golf Course in Essex. It is owned and operated by Brentwood Council. On his way to the first tee he claims he was told he would not be allowed on to the course without a letter from his doctor justifying the medical need for a buggy. If he obtained such a letter he was told he would be given a certificate allowing him to use his buggy. ""I was gobsmacked,"" he told the BBC. ""I've played over 100 courses around England, I've played all around the world and I've not been treated in this way before."" Paul says he explained that he had his own insurance, a European Disabled Golf Association card, and a medical exemption, but the club insisted that he needed a letter from a doctor to justify the use of a buggy. ""It sends the message that disabled people aren't welcome, that we are not part of society, not included, but are segregated and can't join in a sport that's accessible to everybody, because we need to use other equipment to play the game,"" Paul says. In his legal claim, Paul argues that by refusing to allow him to use a buggy without a doctor's letter, the council discriminated against him because of his inability to walk around the golf course. In effect, he claims the council was applying a policy that indirectly discriminates against all disabled people who need a buggy to play golf. Brentwood Council denies any discrimination and is defending the legal action. The council said it was ""committed to ensuring safe access for everyone to all its facilities"" and would issue a full statement when legal action had concluded. Paul Houghton's solicitor, Chris Fry from the firm Fry Law, said: ""This case is more than just about making a service more accessible; it's a reminder of the importance of the benefits which sport brings to social inclusion, together with physical and mental health. ""This is especially important for people with a range of disabilities, and not least mobility impairments. ""A simple adjustment in this case will benefit Paul, and thousands of others in a multitude of ways."" Paul has represented England numerous times In its ""Buggy Use Policy"", England Golf, the governing body of amateur golf, says it ""wishes to encourage the participation in golf of all players regardless of disabilities"". This, it says, is in accordance with its obligations under the Equality Act. Cae Menai-Davis, co-founder of the Golf Trust, a charity that works with disabled groups to make golf more inclusive, commented: ""Golf is a sport for everyone. ""Making it difficult for a disabled golfer to use a buggy isn't just bad policy, it is bad business. ""There is a huge untapped group of people with learning and physical disabilities that want to play the game and will benefit hugely from it.""

Bodyguard beats Vanity Fair in ratingsBBC One's thriller attracted more than twice as many viewers as ITV's new period drama.,"Richard Madden is assigned to protect Keeley Hawes in Bodyguard BBC One's thriller Bodyguard fought off ITV's new period drama Vanity Fair in Sunday's TV ratings, attracting more than twice as many people as its rival. The shows went head-to-head at 21:00 BST. The third episode of Bodyguard was seen by an average of 6.6 million viewers, according to overnight figures. The launch of Vanity Fair averaged 2.9 million. It followed The X Factor, whose ratings fell from 5.7 million on Saturday to five million on Sunday. Olivia Cooke plays Becky Sharpe, with Tom Bateman as Captain Rawdon Crawley in Vanity Fair Vanity Fair, based on William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th Century novel, has been billed as the programme to fill the gap left by Downton Abbey on ITV. It stars Olivia Cooke, who acted in Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One before playing Thackeray's ambitious protagonist Becky Sharp. Olivia Cooke: 'Without Spielberg I'd be the Vanity Fair maid' Bodyguard: What the critics say ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo recently said Vanity Fair came about partly because it's his mother's favourite book, and that he originally wanted a more famous actress to play the lead. ""I wanted Emma Watson or someone everyone would have known,"" he told the Edinburgh Television Festival last month. ""But Olivia will be known. She is absolutely brilliant in this and mesmerising and it's so flamboyantly directed. I think it's just fun and flashy and a huge budget for us, and I'm really excited."" The X Factor launch saw new judge Robbie Williams duet with Andy Hofton Speaking about what ratings he would expect any drama on the channel to register, he said: ""If they're only going to get 2.5 million viewers, that's not right for us. Our drama needs to be broad by definition, it needs to be impactful."" Vanity Fair is up against Bodyguard, which stars Richard Madden as an officer assigned to protect the home secretary, played by Keeley Hawes. Richard Madden 'not paid much' in Game of Thrones Its ratings have stayed flat - its first two episodes last Sunday and Monday attracted 6.7 and 6.4 million respectively in the overnight ratings. Meanwhile, the 15th series of X Factor began with an audience of 5.7 million on Saturday - down on the six million who tuned in to watch the launch show last year. That means Saturday's ratings were the lowest for a launch night since the programme started in 2004, when 4.9 million watched the opening episode.

Sinead McNamara, 20, from Australia was found in a critical condition on the vessel on Thursday, and died while being airlifted to hospital. Greek authorities have launched an investigation into her final hours on the boat, which was docked on the island of Kefalonia. The super-yacht is owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Bailleres. Mr Bailleres and his family had left the Mayan Queen IV boat days before the incident, Greek news outlets reported. Ms McNamara, originally from Port Macquarie in New South Wales, regularly posted pictures of her travels to her Instagram account, where she had more than 12,000 followers.

Her friends have expressed their grief on social media, describing the young woman as a ""free-spirited"" and ""adventurous"" soul. ""You lived life with no fear and it's a blessing to have known you,"" one friend wrote. Another said: ""Everyone should take a page from Sinead's book - where she was meant to have a holiday in Bali that turned into a year and a half trip sailing across the world."" Australian YouTuber Alex Hayes, who was a friend of Ms McNamara's, shared a tribute, via an Instagram story, to his 650,000 followers. ""Life is so precious,"" he wrote. ""Gone way too soon.

"'80,000 pose online child abuse threat'","This video can not be played Take online sexual abuse seriously or face legislation, Sajid Javid warns tech giants Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned he will ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they do not help to tackle child sexual abuse online. Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation. He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem. Facebook, Google and Microsoft say they are committed to tackling the issue. Mr Javid said it was his ""personal mission"" to tackle online child abuse, adding: ""I've been impressed by the progress the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Apple have made on counter-terrorism. ""Now I want to see the same level of commitment from these companies and others for child sexual exploitation."" Last week, his cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt criticised Google for failing to ""cooperate"" with the UK over the issue. Mr Javid refused to go into detail about what new legislation surrounding abuse might look like. However, he stated his desire for tech companies to work more closely with law enforcement agencies, stop child grooming on their sites and block abuse material as soon as they detect it being uploaded. Referrals of child abuse images to the National Crime Agency (NCA) have surged by 700% in the last five years, according to new figures - and the NCA estimates that about 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat to children online. The IWF says the UK is one of the ""most hostile places in the world to host this disturbing material"" Furthermore, the images being uncovered are getting more graphic, the Home Office said, with abuse of babies and children under 10 becoming more frequently documented. The Home Office warned that live-streaming of abuse was also on the rise, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphone technology and the growing ease of money transfers across borders. The team fighting to remove online abuse images New laws pledged as social media firms snub talks In his speech, Mr Javid said: ""One officer I met during a visit to the NCA's Child Exploitation Online Protection Command, who had previously worked in counter-terrorism for over 20 years, told me how in all his years of working he's never been so shocked by the scale of the threat or the determination of the offenders as he is in his current job."" He went on: ""The threat has evolved a lot more quickly than the industry's response and industry has just not kept up. ""So let me say this - I'm not just asking for change, I am demanding it and the people are demanding it too - and if the web giants do not take more measures to remove this type of content from their platforms, I will not be afraid to take action."" By Joe Whitwell, BBC Technology reporter Millions of hours of video are uploaded to social networks every day, so finding illegal material can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Most of the tech giants have been investing in artificial intelligence to proactively search for videos and posts that contravene their policies or the laws of the countries they operate in. In March 2017, Facebook rolled out pattern-recognition algorithms to help detect Facebook Live posts from people who might be thinking of harming themselves. But algorithms alone cannot police content - and even a small percentage of incorrectly flagged videos could amount to thousands of clips every day. Human reviewers remain an important part of the equation - but hiring them costs money. In January, Germany introduced a new law demanding that social networks quickly remove illegal material or face fines of up to 50m euros. That proved to be just the motivation many social networks needed to step up to the challenge. Facebook reportedly recruited several hundred new staff in Germany to deal with reports of illegal content. Figures indicate that police in England and Wales recorded about 23 child sexual offences involving the internet every day in 2017/18 - up from about 15 a day in the previous 12 months. The scale of the offending has led to demands for internet giants to take more action to stop access to sexual abuse images and videos. Technology companies doing more to remove indecent images from circulation would be a ""monumental landmark"" in child protection, the NCA said. There have also been calls for tougher sentences for people who download indecent images of children. The agency added that in one week of action in July, 131 arrests were made, including teachers, a children's entertainer and a former police officer. Only 13 of those arrested were registered sex offenders, 19 others held positions of trust. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which assesses and removes online child abuse material, said it fully supported Mr Javid in his warning. Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive, said offenders were becoming more ""sophisticated in their crime"". Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said it was right that the Home Secretary is laying down the challenge to big tech companies. He said: ""These firms have been told time and again to play their part in stopping online child abuse, but have done very little."" The NSPCC is calling on the government to create an independent regulator with power to investigate and fine platforms which do not do enough to catch groomers. Facebook said it takes the exploitation of children very seriously. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's why Facebook works closely with child protection experts, the police and other technology companies to block and remove exploitative photos and videos, as well as to prevent grooming online. ""We agree with the home secretary that by continuing to work together in this way, we can make more progress, faster."" Google said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to child sexual abuse material and has invested for two decades in technology, teams and partnerships to tackle the issue. The firm announced that it was making available ""cutting-edge"" artificial intelligence that can dramatically improve how non-governmental organisations and other technology companies review content ""at scale"" and protect more children. Microsoft condemned child sexual exploitation as a ""horrific crime"", stating that the company works closely with others in industry, government and civil society to help combat its spread online. A spokeswoman said: ""Predators are constantly evolving their tactics and that is why we work collaboratively with other companies... to create tools that protect children online and help bring perpetrators to justice."" If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You can report it online to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (Ceop). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support. If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed. Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day.

Fire ravages 200-year-old Brazil museum,"This video can not be played Footage shows the huge scale of the blaze A fire has gutted the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, the oldest scientific institution in the country. Most of the 20 million items it contained, including the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas, are believed to have been destroyed. The cause of the blaze is not known. No injuries have been reported. The museum, located in a building that once served as the residence for the Portuguese royal family, celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. In pictures: Brazil national museum in flames The fire started on Sunday evening, after the facility had closed for the day. Aerial images broadcast on Brazilian television showed it spreading throughout the building. Firefighters were able to retrieve a number of items from the burning building Brazil's President Michel Temer said in a tweet that it was a ""sad day for all Brazilians"",externalas ""200 years of work, research and knowledge were lost"". Roberto Robadey, a spokesman for the Rio fire department, is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that the hydrants closest to the museum were not working and that firefighters had to get water from a nearby lake. By Monday morning the fire was under control and some of the museum's pieces had been rescued, he added. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent This isn't just Brazilian history that's gone up in flames. Many see this as a metaphor for the city - and the country as a whole. Rio de Janeiro is in crisis. Growing violence, a deep economic decline and political corruption have combined to make the city a shadow of what it once was. It was only in 2016 that it was hosting the Olympic Games - an event into which Brazil poured billions of dollars. But the hangover from the sporting event has hit Rio hard. Add to that the fact that federal spending has been slashed, and with violence on the rise, tourism numbers have also declined. This was a museum that many saw as long ignored and underfunded - now, with devastating consequences for Brazil's heritage. It was one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas. Its millions of artefacts included fossils, Brazil's largest meteorite, dinosaur bones and a 12,000-year-old skeleton of a woman known as ""Luzia"", the oldest ever discovered in the Americas. The museum houses thousands of items related to the history of Brazil and other countries The building was also home to items covering the centuries from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s to the declaration of a republic in 1889. The ethnology collection had unique pieces from the pre-Columbian era and artifacts from indigenous cultures. Pieces from Greco-Roman times and Egypt were also on display at the museum. Portugal's royal family transferred the court to the building in 1808, when the country faced with the threat of invasion from Napoleon. The museum was established in 1818, with the aim of promoting scientific research by making its collection available to specialists. Marcelo Moreira - a journalist with TV Globo in Rio - told the BBC: ""It's very sad... This museum has a great history. It represents a lot for Brazilian history and Brazilian culture. It's really a big loss for Brazil."" In an interview with Globo, the museum's director said it was a ""cultural tragedy"". One museum employee told the network that project managers had had ""tremendous difficulty"" trying to secure funding for ""sufficient"" resources for the palace. Staff at the museum said much of the building's interior was ""completely destroyed"" Another, librarian Edson Vargas da Silva, is quoted by local media describing the building, which he said had wooden floors and contained ""a lot of things that burn very fast"", such as paper documents. Employees had reportedly previously expressed concern about funding cuts and the dilapidated state of the premises. In pictures: Brazil museum in flames National museum consumed by fire.

Myanmar jails reporters over secret papers,"This video can not be played ""We didn't commit any crime"" A court in Myanmar has sentenced two Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for violating a state secrets act while investigating violence against the Rohingya minority. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, nationals of Myanmar, were arrested while carrying official documents which had just been given to them by police officers. They have maintained their innocence, saying they were set up by police. The case has been widely seen as a test of press freedom in Myanmar. ""I have no fear,"" Wa Lone said after the verdict. ""I have not done anything wrong. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom."" Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Suu Win, broke down in tears on hearing the verdict The two men, who both have families with young children, have been in prison since their arrest in December 2017. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are Myanmar citizens who were working for the international news agency. They had been collecting evidence about the murders of 10 Rohingya men by the army in the village of Inn Din in northern Rakhine in September 2017. They were arrested before the report's publication, after being handed some documents by two policemen who they met at the restaurant for the first time. A police witness testified during the trial that the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists. These are the men whose deaths the Reuters journalists were investigating The final report - a collaboration with other colleagues - was considered extraordinary,external, because it gathered testimonies from a range of participants, including Buddhist villagers who confessed to killing Rohingya Muslims and torching their homes. Accounts from paramilitary police also directly implicated the military. The military had previously released its own investigation into allegations of abuse in Rakhine, and exonerated itself of all wrongdoing. Authorities later launched their own probe into the Inn Din killings, confirming the massacre took place and promising to take action against those who had taken part. At least 700,000 Rohingya have fled violence in the country in the past year. The crisis erupted when a brutal crackdown was launched in response to a Rohingya militant group attacking several police posts. The United Nations has called the army's response - including murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement - ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"". This video can not be played Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women A UN report - released last week - called formilitary leaders to face genocide chargesfor their actions. Myanmar rejected the report. It sees the Rohingya - who have their own culture and language - as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Judge Ye Lwin told the court in Yangon the pair had ""intended to harm the interests of the state"". ""And so they have been found guilty under the state secrets act,"" he said. The verdict had been delayed once because of the judge's ill health. Nick Beake, BBC Myanmar correspondent, Yangon Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo bowed their heads as the verdict was delivered, while their families broke down in tears in court. The reporters have always insisted they were framed. Wa Lone - who missed the birth of his first child while being detained - protested his innocence once again as he was led away. Many will see this verdict as a crushing blow to freedom of the press in Myanmar and another setback for democracy, three years after Aung San Suu Kyi's party triumphed in free elections. Last week,UN inspectors called for Myanmar's top generals to stand trialfor genocide for the crimes committed against the Rohingya - the very subject these reporters were investigating. ""Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and press freedom anywhere,"" Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler said. Read their report 'Massacre in Myanmar',external The story behind the journalists' arrest Blow by blow: How a 'genocide' was investigated The verdict has been widely criticised by observers and human rights groups. Ahead of the verdict, people marched to show solidarity ""We are extremely disappointed by this verdict,"" Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, said according to Reuters. US ambassador Scot Marciel echoed the same criticism, saying the court's decision was ""deeply troubling for everybody who has struggled so hard here for media freedom"". The UN's resident and humanitarian co-ordinator in Myanmar, Knut Ostby, said the UN had ""consistently called for the release"" of the journalists and that ""a free press is essential for peace, justice and human rights for all. We are disappointed by today's court decision"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Momentum backs Labour candidate shake-upThe left-wing campaign group says a more open process would usher in a ""new generation"" of MPs.UK Politics","Jeremy Corbyn has said elected officials should be more accountable to party members Momentum has said it will back calls for the process of selecting Labour election candidates to be ""opened up"", at the party's conference this month. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting campaign group said it wanted to see a ""new generation"" of Labour MPs. It wants activists to be able to challenge sitting MPs rather than see them renominated by party branches. Some MPs who have been critical of Mr Corbyn's leadership fear the idea is aimed at purging them from the party. Two MPs on the right of the party - Frank Field and John Woodcock - have quit the whip in recent times complaining of a culture of bullying and intimidation in the party. Those on the left say they are out of step with the direction of the party and point to the fact Mr Field lost a vote of confidence among members of his local constituency party in Birkenhead in July. Momentum set to consult on Brexit stance Can Labour detoxify the anti-Semitism row? Local Labour branches are set to put forward a host of proposals to the conference in Liverpool later this month aimed at shaking up the party's internal procedures, although it is not yet clear how many will actually be debated, let alone win the support of the leadership. According to the Observer,external, one of the ideas being put forward is to scrap the rule which makes it an expellable offence to ""support a political organisation other than an official Labour group"". The sanction has been in place since the 1980s when Labour was fighting entryism by the hard-left Militant group. The paper said five local branches so far had expressed support for it being removed. Most of the focus, however, will be on demands for mandatory reselection, where local members will be given the opportunity to to choose from a shortlist of candidates, including the sitting MP. At the moment, the vast majority of incumbent MPs are reselected if they get the backing of a simple majority of constituency party members. Momentum said there was a ""groundswell"" of support from among its members for this system to change and for there to be a ""level-playing field"" between different candidates. ""Labour has to nurture the talent of its half a million members and we cannot let an outdated rulebook hold back a new generation of MPs,"" it said in a statement. ""Labour's selection procedure should be democratic, give a fair chance to all candidates and encourage positive campaigning. This means ending the divisive practise of forcing activists to campaign against sitting MPs and replacing it with a process that is open from the start. ""Opening up the selection process will create a more level playing field between candidates."" The vast majority of MPs oppose mandatory reselection, believing the demands are politically motivated. The conference is expected to discuss the findings of a ""democracy review"" commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, including into the rules for future leadership contests. But the question of mandatory reselection was not part of taskforce's remit.

Treasury in talks on keeping Mark Carney,"The Treasury and the Bank of England are in discussions about Mark Carney staying on as governor beyond his present departure date of June 2019. I understand the Treasury is concerned that trying to find a new governor now, amid Brexit talks, would be difficult. It wants to be able to give any new candidate a clear view of what the relationship with the EU will be like. Theresa May's spokesman said Mr Carney had said he intended to step down next year and that was still the plan. The Treasury wants as long an appointment process as possible and there is a belief in Whitehall that Mr Carney is open to staying on for as long as another 12 months, until 2020. The Financial Times reported,externalon Monday that those ""close to the governor"" believed he was positive about an extension. My sources say the possible extension is more to do with the next governor and who the Treasury think they can attract to the post given the present state of the Brexit negotiations, rather than whether Mark Carney staying will reassure the markets. However, regulators and financial market participants on both sides of the Channel also believe that Mr Carney is a reassuring figure during a period of Brexit uncertainty. It has been made clear to me that no deal has been agreed and the extension might be much less than a year, if it happens. The Canadian is due to appear before MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday and will be asked about his intentions. In October 2016 Mr Carney said he wouldstep down in June 2019- one year more than the five he had committed to, but still two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors serve. Speculation about the governor's future was first sparked by an item on the Evening Standard's diary pages last week saying the government had approached him about staying on.

Treasury in talks on keeping Mark CarneyThe Treasury and the Bank of England have begun discussions about Mark Carney staying on as Governor.BusinessComments,"The Treasury and the Bank of England are in discussions about Mark Carney staying on as governor beyond his present departure date of June 2019. I understand the Treasury is concerned that trying to find a new governor now, amid Brexit talks, would be difficult. It wants to be able to give any new candidate a clear view of what the relationship with the EU will be like. Theresa May's spokesman said Mr Carney had said he intended to step down next year and that was still the plan. The Treasury wants as long an appointment process as possible and there is a belief in Whitehall that Mr Carney is open to staying on for as long as another 12 months, until 2020. The Financial Times reported,externalon Monday that those ""close to the governor"" believed he was positive about an extension. My sources say the possible extension is more to do with the next governor and who the Treasury think they can attract to the post given the present state of the Brexit negotiations, rather than whether Mark Carney staying will reassure the markets. However, regulators and financial market participants on both sides of the Channel also believe that Mr Carney is a reassuring figure during a period of Brexit uncertainty. It has been made clear to me that no deal has been agreed and the extension might be much less than a year, if it happens. The Canadian is due to appear before MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday and will be asked about his intentions. In October 2016 Mr Carney said he wouldstep down in June 2019- one year more than the five he had committed to, but still two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors serve. Speculation about the governor's future was first sparked by an item on the Evening Standard's diary pages last week saying the government had approached him about staying on.

"'80,000 pose online child abuse threat'Sajid Javid will issue a warning over the ""full horror of the scale"" of the problem in the UK.","This video can not be played Take online sexual abuse seriously or face legislation, Sajid Javid warns tech giants Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned he will ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they do not help to tackle child sexual abuse online. Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation. He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem. Facebook, Google and Microsoft say they are committed to tackling the issue. Mr Javid said it was his ""personal mission"" to tackle online child abuse, adding: ""I've been impressed by the progress the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Apple have made on counter-terrorism. ""Now I want to see the same level of commitment from these companies and others for child sexual exploitation."" Last week, his cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt criticised Google for failing to ""cooperate"" with the UK over the issue. Mr Javid refused to go into detail about what new legislation surrounding abuse might look like. However, he stated his desire for tech companies to work more closely with law enforcement agencies, stop child grooming on their sites and block abuse material as soon as they detect it being uploaded. Referrals of child abuse images to the National Crime Agency (NCA) have surged by 700% in the last five years, according to new figures - and the NCA estimates that about 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat to children online. The IWF says the UK is one of the ""most hostile places in the world to host this disturbing material"" Furthermore, the images being uncovered are getting more graphic, the Home Office said, with abuse of babies and children under 10 becoming more frequently documented. The Home Office warned that live-streaming of abuse was also on the rise, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphone technology and the growing ease of money transfers across borders. The team fighting to remove online abuse images New laws pledged as social media firms snub talks In his speech, Mr Javid said: ""One officer I met during a visit to the NCA's Child Exploitation Online Protection Command, who had previously worked in counter-terrorism for over 20 years, told me how in all his years of working he's never been so shocked by the scale of the threat or the determination of the offenders as he is in his current job."" He went on: ""The threat has evolved a lot more quickly than the industry's response and industry has just not kept up. ""So let me say this - I'm not just asking for change, I am demanding it and the people are demanding it too - and if the web giants do not take more measures to remove this type of content from their platforms, I will not be afraid to take action."" By Joe Whitwell, BBC Technology reporter Millions of hours of video are uploaded to social networks every day, so finding illegal material can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Most of the tech giants have been investing in artificial intelligence to proactively search for videos and posts that contravene their policies or the laws of the countries they operate in. In March 2017, Facebook rolled out pattern-recognition algorithms to help detect Facebook Live posts from people who might be thinking of harming themselves. But algorithms alone cannot police content - and even a small percentage of incorrectly flagged videos could amount to thousands of clips every day. Human reviewers remain an important part of the equation - but hiring them costs money. In January, Germany introduced a new law demanding that social networks quickly remove illegal material or face fines of up to 50m euros. That proved to be just the motivation many social networks needed to step up to the challenge. Facebook reportedly recruited several hundred new staff in Germany to deal with reports of illegal content. Figures indicate that police in England and Wales recorded about 23 child sexual offences involving the internet every day in 2017/18 - up from about 15 a day in the previous 12 months. The scale of the offending has led to demands for internet giants to take more action to stop access to sexual abuse images and videos. Technology companies doing more to remove indecent images from circulation would be a ""monumental landmark"" in child protection, the NCA said. There have also been calls for tougher sentences for people who download indecent images of children. The agency added that in one week of action in July, 131 arrests were made, including teachers, a children's entertainer and a former police officer. Only 13 of those arrested were registered sex offenders, 19 others held positions of trust. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which assesses and removes online child abuse material, said it fully supported Mr Javid in his warning. Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive, said offenders were becoming more ""sophisticated in their crime"". Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said it was right that the Home Secretary is laying down the challenge to big tech companies. He said: ""These firms have been told time and again to play their part in stopping online child abuse, but have done very little."" The NSPCC is calling on the government to create an independent regulator with power to investigate and fine platforms which do not do enough to catch groomers. Facebook said it takes the exploitation of children very seriously. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's why Facebook works closely with child protection experts, the police and other technology companies to block and remove exploitative photos and videos, as well as to prevent grooming online. ""We agree with the home secretary that by continuing to work together in this way, we can make more progress, faster."" Google said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to child sexual abuse material and has invested for two decades in technology, teams and partnerships to tackle the issue. The firm announced that it was making available ""cutting-edge"" artificial intelligence that can dramatically improve how non-governmental organisations and other technology companies review content ""at scale"" and protect more children. Microsoft condemned child sexual exploitation as a ""horrific crime"", stating that the company works closely with others in industry, government and civil society to help combat its spread online. A spokeswoman said: ""Predators are constantly evolving their tactics and that is why we work collaboratively with other companies... to create tools that protect children online and help bring perpetrators to justice."" If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You can report it online to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (Ceop). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support. If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed. Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day.

U2 fans were left disappointed when the Berlin show was cut short on Saturday. The Irish band had played several songs before Bono apologised to the crowd, saying: ""I think we can't go on."" Those at the Mercedes-Benz Arena were initially told there would be a short pause, but were later informed that the show was over. Bono then promised that another gig would be arranged.

Water companies set out plans to cut bills,"Water companies have set out plans to cut bills for millions of consumers in England and Wales. Severn Trent and United Utilities said they would cut the average bill by 5% and 10.5% respectively. Thames Water said bills would be unchanged. South West Water said it would offer customers,externala stake in the business. The plans are being submitted by water companies in England and Wales to the regulator Ofwat for the five years between 2020-2025. Ofwat will publish an assessment of each company's plan in January 2019. Water UK, the lobby group for the industry in the UK, summarised the plans submitted to Ofwat by the nine main providers and a number of smaller providers in England. It found  average domestic water bills were planned to fall by more than 4% in real terms across England as a whole. The regulatorsaid in Decemberthat the results of its price review would result in a cut in bills between Â£15 and Â£25 a year from 2020 to 2025. Water bills set to fall by up to Â£25 from 2020 Labour's plan for state control of water, power and rail Since privatisation in 1989, water bills have risen above inflation by about 40% and the regulator has faced criticism for overestimating the costs incurred by water companies, which have been taken into account by Ofwat during its price reviews. The latest price review was announced at a time when the Labour partyhad been discussing taking companies into public ownership. John Russell, Ofwat senior director for strategy and planning, said: ""We've reached a milestone in our price review process. From now and until January 2019 we'll pore over each and every business plan and we'll be looking for evidence that they are robust, ambitious and, crucially, that they have been shaped by customers."" Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, said that while bills would be flat over the five-year period being reviewed it intended to invest some Â£2.1bn to ""boost resilience and reduce leakage"" after it wasfined Â£120 million in June over leakage failures. In the North West of England, customers of United Utilities are being promised a 10.5% reduction on average bills in real terms and 250,000 fewer households in water poverty by 2025. Severn Trent said the 5% fall in real terms it was promising its 8.1 million customers was the largest in two decades. Its 200,000 customers at its Welsh operation Hafren Dyfrdwy Cyfyngedig, though, will incur bill rises of 2.2%, although it said these would still be the lowest in Wales. Welsh Water, which has three million customers across most of Wales, Herefordshire and parts of Deeside and Cheshire, said average bills should fall by 5% by 2025 and that costs would be reduced by 10% to help fund the cut. At South West Water, average customer bills are being forecast to fall by 11% and for 9% at its Bournemouth Water arm by 2025. South West Water also sets out a ""first of a kind"" plan to offer customers a stake in the business from 2020 and the prospect of meetings where customers can cast votes. Customers could be given an option, alongside bill reductions, rebates and reinvestment, to have shares in parent company Pennon or a stake in South West Water itself. Anglian Water said its bills would rise - but by less than 1%. The region receives only two thirds of the national average rainfall. Ofwat has required companies to set out how much they intend to invest, what they will charge customers, how they will support vulnerable customers and how they will ensure their infrastructure is resilient for the long-term. Water UK said water companies in England intended to cut leakage by more than 16% over the five years. This is the biggest leakage programme for 20 years and would save the equivalent of 184 Olympic-size swimming pools of water every day by 2025, Water UK said.

Momentum backs Labour candidate shake-up,"Jeremy Corbyn has said elected officials should be more accountable to party members Momentum has said it will back calls for the process of selecting Labour election candidates to be ""opened up"", at the party's conference this month. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting campaign group said it wanted to see a ""new generation"" of Labour MPs. It wants activists to be able to challenge sitting MPs rather than see them renominated by party branches. Some MPs who have been critical of Mr Corbyn's leadership fear the idea is aimed at purging them from the party. Two MPs on the right of the party - Frank Field and John Woodcock - have quit the whip in recent times complaining of a culture of bullying and intimidation in the party. Those on the left say they are out of step with the direction of the party and point to the fact Mr Field lost a vote of confidence among members of his local constituency party in Birkenhead in July. Momentum set to consult on Brexit stance Can Labour detoxify the anti-Semitism row? Local Labour branches are set to put forward a host of proposals to the conference in Liverpool later this month aimed at shaking up the party's internal procedures, although it is not yet clear how many will actually be debated, let alone win the support of the leadership. According to the Observer,external, one of the ideas being put forward is to scrap the rule which makes it an expellable offence to ""support a political organisation other than an official Labour group"". The sanction has been in place since the 1980s when Labour was fighting entryism by the hard-left Militant group. The paper said five local branches so far had expressed support for it being removed. Most of the focus, however, will be on demands for mandatory reselection, where local members will be given the opportunity to to choose from a shortlist of candidates, including the sitting MP. At the moment, the vast majority of incumbent MPs are reselected if they get the backing of a simple majority of constituency party members. Momentum said there was a ""groundswell"" of support from among its members for this system to change and for there to be a ""level-playing field"" between different candidates. ""Labour has to nurture the talent of its half a million members and we cannot let an outdated rulebook hold back a new generation of MPs,"" it said in a statement. ""Labour's selection procedure should be democratic, give a fair chance to all candidates and encourage positive campaigning. This means ending the divisive practise of forcing activists to campaign against sitting MPs and replacing it with a process that is open from the start. ""Opening up the selection process will create a more level playing field between candidates."" The vast majority of MPs oppose mandatory reselection, believing the demands are politically motivated. The conference is expected to discuss the findings of a ""democracy review"" commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, including into the rules for future leadership contests. But the question of mandatory reselection was not part of taskforce's remit.

Chris Evans to leave Radio 2 breakfastThe broadcaster announces he'll be leaving the country's biggest breakfast show after eight years.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Chris Evans is to leave BBC Radio 2 after thirteen years at the station Chris Evans has announced he will be leaving the Radio 2 breakfast show after eight years at the helm, and 13 years at the station. ""I'm going to leave. I'm leaving Radio 2,"" he told listeners, but promised he'd stay on air until Christmas. Explaining the decision, he said: ""Some of us are mountain climbers [but] if you get to the top of your favourite mountain and you stay there, you become an observer. ""I want to keep climbing."" Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting Who will take over from Chris Evans? 'It's a blow to lose Chris Evans' After the announcement, he played The Beatles' Twist and Shout, adding: ""You have to keep shaking it up."" He later confirmed he was leaving Radio 2 to host Virgin Radio's breakfast show. The star previously presented The Big Breakfast, before hosting early morning shows on Radio 1, Virgin and Radio 2 Evans took over from Sir Terry Wogan in 2010, and the breakfast show regularly attracts 9m listeners - more than any other UK radio programme. He is currently the second highest-paid star at the BBC, earning Â£1.6 million per year. The star and his wife Natasha are currently expecting twins; and he said his decision to change jobs had been ""big news in our house over the past few weeks and months"". Radio 2: Chris Evans highlights Who will take over from Chris Evans? Chris Evans- 'I'm paid too much' He admitted he'd been deliberating the decision for a year. ""A few weeks ago I made my mind up for sure,"" he said, adding he wanted to ""start up on a brand new adventure"". Speaking to Father Brian D'Arcy, who was delivering Monday's Pause for Thought, Evans said: ""As Sir Terry [Wogan] said: there's never a right time to go, but there could be a wrong time to go."" This video can not be played Chris Evans announces his departure live on air. Evans first joined Radio 2 in September 2005 as the host of the Saturday afternoon show, moving to drive time in April 2006 and the breakfast show in January 2010. During that time, he has also presented The One Show and the poorly-received relaunch of Top Gear following in 2016. But it is his radio show, with its warm and energetic mix of interviews, music and trivia, where the broadcaster truly excelled, creating a familial atmosphere with segments like Kids Get a Fanfare and Listener Breaking News. The children's writing competition 500 Words will remain part of the breakfast show after his departure, Evans said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The broadcaster revealed his decision shortly after 8:00 BST, after hinting at a ""big announcement"" throughout his Monday morning show. The 52-year-old said he had ""loved every second"" of presenting the breakfast programme, but ""I don't want this to be it"". He added that his final scheduled show was on Friday 21 December - but he'd like to bow out with a Christmas Eve special. Virgin Radio has confirmed Evans will be waking up the nation on its radio station in the new year - although no official start date has been given. This video can not be played Lynn Bowles was a familiar voice on Radio 2 for 18 years Evans formerly hosted the breakfast show on the first incarnation of Virgin Radio - which went on to become Absolute Radio - between 1997 and 2001. Virgin Radio UK, which was launched two years ago and is owned by Rupert Murdoch's Wireless Group, is a digital-only station with around 400,000 weekly listeners, compared with Radio 2's figure of 15 million. Speaking about his new appointment, Evans said: ""In many ways Virgin Radio is my spiritual home. I see nothing but exciting and groundbreaking opportunities ahead. In a medium that is changing so quickly on a daily basis, the potential for growth is unprecedented. ""Our plan is to give it all we've got, see where we can get to and have the most possible fun along the way. It makes me smile every time I think about it.""

"'80,000 pose online child abuse threat'Sajid Javid will issue a warning over the ""full horror of the scale"" of the problem in the UK.UK","This video can not be played Take online sexual abuse seriously or face legislation, Sajid Javid warns tech giants Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned he will ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they do not help to tackle child sexual abuse online. Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation. He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem. Facebook, Google and Microsoft say they are committed to tackling the issue. Mr Javid said it was his ""personal mission"" to tackle online child abuse, adding: ""I've been impressed by the progress the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Apple have made on counter-terrorism. ""Now I want to see the same level of commitment from these companies and others for child sexual exploitation."" Last week, his cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt criticised Google for failing to ""cooperate"" with the UK over the issue. Mr Javid refused to go into detail about what new legislation surrounding abuse might look like. However, he stated his desire for tech companies to work more closely with law enforcement agencies, stop child grooming on their sites and block abuse material as soon as they detect it being uploaded. Referrals of child abuse images to the National Crime Agency (NCA) have surged by 700% in the last five years, according to new figures - and the NCA estimates that about 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat to children online. The IWF says the UK is one of the ""most hostile places in the world to host this disturbing material"" Furthermore, the images being uncovered are getting more graphic, the Home Office said, with abuse of babies and children under 10 becoming more frequently documented. The Home Office warned that live-streaming of abuse was also on the rise, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphone technology and the growing ease of money transfers across borders. The team fighting to remove online abuse images New laws pledged as social media firms snub talks In his speech, Mr Javid said: ""One officer I met during a visit to the NCA's Child Exploitation Online Protection Command, who had previously worked in counter-terrorism for over 20 years, told me how in all his years of working he's never been so shocked by the scale of the threat or the determination of the offenders as he is in his current job."" He went on: ""The threat has evolved a lot more quickly than the industry's response and industry has just not kept up. ""So let me say this - I'm not just asking for change, I am demanding it and the people are demanding it too - and if the web giants do not take more measures to remove this type of content from their platforms, I will not be afraid to take action."" By Joe Whitwell, BBC Technology reporter Millions of hours of video are uploaded to social networks every day, so finding illegal material can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Most of the tech giants have been investing in artificial intelligence to proactively search for videos and posts that contravene their policies or the laws of the countries they operate in. In March 2017, Facebook rolled out pattern-recognition algorithms to help detect Facebook Live posts from people who might be thinking of harming themselves. But algorithms alone cannot police content - and even a small percentage of incorrectly flagged videos could amount to thousands of clips every day. Human reviewers remain an important part of the equation - but hiring them costs money. In January, Germany introduced a new law demanding that social networks quickly remove illegal material or face fines of up to 50m euros. That proved to be just the motivation many social networks needed to step up to the challenge. Facebook reportedly recruited several hundred new staff in Germany to deal with reports of illegal content. Figures indicate that police in England and Wales recorded about 23 child sexual offences involving the internet every day in 2017/18 - up from about 15 a day in the previous 12 months. The scale of the offending has led to demands for internet giants to take more action to stop access to sexual abuse images and videos. Technology companies doing more to remove indecent images from circulation would be a ""monumental landmark"" in child protection, the NCA said. There have also been calls for tougher sentences for people who download indecent images of children. The agency added that in one week of action in July, 131 arrests were made, including teachers, a children's entertainer and a former police officer. Only 13 of those arrested were registered sex offenders, 19 others held positions of trust. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which assesses and removes online child abuse material, said it fully supported Mr Javid in his warning. Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive, said offenders were becoming more ""sophisticated in their crime"". Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said it was right that the Home Secretary is laying down the challenge to big tech companies. He said: ""These firms have been told time and again to play their part in stopping online child abuse, but have done very little."" The NSPCC is calling on the government to create an independent regulator with power to investigate and fine platforms which do not do enough to catch groomers. Facebook said it takes the exploitation of children very seriously. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's why Facebook works closely with child protection experts, the police and other technology companies to block and remove exploitative photos and videos, as well as to prevent grooming online. ""We agree with the home secretary that by continuing to work together in this way, we can make more progress, faster."" Google said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to child sexual abuse material and has invested for two decades in technology, teams and partnerships to tackle the issue. The firm announced that it was making available ""cutting-edge"" artificial intelligence that can dramatically improve how non-governmental organisations and other technology companies review content ""at scale"" and protect more children. Microsoft condemned child sexual exploitation as a ""horrific crime"", stating that the company works closely with others in industry, government and civil society to help combat its spread online. A spokeswoman said: ""Predators are constantly evolving their tactics and that is why we work collaboratively with other companies... to create tools that protect children online and help bring perpetrators to justice."" If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You can report it online to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (Ceop). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support. If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed. Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day.

Nine-year wait for heart 'shows donor need',"Gareth Evans has been waiting for a heart transplant since 2009 Father-of-two Gareth Evans has needed a heart transplant for nine years. The 45-year-old, from Stockport, has been waiting longer than anyone else in the UK on the current list of heart transplant patients. His health is declining and, as Organ Donation Week begins, the NHS wants people to join the UK's donor register. NHS Blood and Transplant figures show about 3,000 lifesaving transplants were missed in the last year, as families would not donate relatives' organs. They also show 80% of people support organ donation, yet only 33% of people have told their family they want to donate. Opt-out organ donation 'in place by 2020' Opt-out donation 'won't increase donors' Why you may wait longer if you're black Gareth originally had a heart transplant in 1990, aged only 17, after he contracted cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle. The heart has lasted 28 years, which is long for a donor organ, but now it is failing. He has spent the last three months in Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, where he is having IV medication to correct the damage done to his organs as his heart deteriorates. Gareth Evans and wife Danielle are urging people to join the NHS organ donor register ""I never thought it would take this long to find a donor,"" he said. ""I feel like I'm merely existing, not living. It was a lot easier to get through it as a 17-year old lad. Now I have the most awesome wife and kids that I worry about and I get very emotional when I think about them. ""Having to tell the family you might not make it is the most difficult thing to do,"" added Gareth, who is married to Danielle and has two sons aged 10 and 13. Anthony Clarkson, interim director of Organ Donation and Transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said the issue was often that family members had not communicated their decision on organ donation. ""Families tell us that they don't know their relative wanted to be an organ donor, and therefore they err on the side of caution and say no. ""Then often their family member becomes too ill to have the conversation and it is too late."" There are currently 6,133 people on the transplant waiting list and in the UK in 2017, 411 people died before the right donor was found. NHS Blood and Transplant is urging people to sign up to its Organ Donor Register, and to tell their families their wishes. Organ Donation Week,externalwill be be marked by councils, businesses and hospitals lighting their buildings pink. The campaign comes as the government has announced that it aims to introduce a new ""opt-out"" law in England, which will assume that over-18s are in favour of donating their organs when they die, unless they specifically register to ""opt out."" If voted through in the autumn it will come into effect in England from spring 2020. The government said this could save up to 700 lives a year. A similar opt-out system has been in place in Wales since 2015. Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme and Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest. Mr Clarkson added: ""We know that organ legislation will change, but the harsh fact is people are dying right now waiting for an organ, so it is important to share your wishes now.""

Breaking|Breaking newsReuters journalists jailed in MyanmarThe journalists were arrested while holding official documents about violence against Rohingyas.Asia,"This video can not be played ""We didn't commit any crime"" A court in Myanmar has sentenced two Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for violating a state secrets act while investigating violence against the Rohingya minority. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, nationals of Myanmar, were arrested while carrying official documents which had just been given to them by police officers. They have maintained their innocence, saying they were set up by police. The case has been widely seen as a test of press freedom in Myanmar. ""I have no fear,"" Wa Lone said after the verdict. ""I have not done anything wrong. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom."" Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Suu Win, broke down in tears on hearing the verdict The two men, who both have families with young children, have been in prison since their arrest in December 2017. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are Myanmar citizens who were working for the international news agency. They had been collecting evidence about the murders of 10 Rohingya men by the army in the village of Inn Din in northern Rakhine in September 2017. They were arrested before the report's publication, after being handed some documents by two policemen who they met at the restaurant for the first time. A police witness testified during the trial that the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists. These are the men whose deaths the Reuters journalists were investigating The final report - a collaboration with other colleagues - was considered extraordinary,external, because it gathered testimonies from a range of participants, including Buddhist villagers who confessed to killing Rohingya Muslims and torching their homes. Accounts from paramilitary police also directly implicated the military. The military had previously released its own investigation into allegations of abuse in Rakhine, and exonerated itself of all wrongdoing. Authorities later launched their own probe into the Inn Din killings, confirming the massacre took place and promising to take action against those who had taken part. At least 700,000 Rohingya have fled violence in the country in the past year. The crisis erupted when a brutal crackdown was launched in response to a Rohingya militant group attacking several police posts. The United Nations has called the army's response - including murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement - ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"". This video can not be played Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women A UN report - released last week - called formilitary leaders to face genocide chargesfor their actions. Myanmar rejected the report. It sees the Rohingya - who have their own culture and language - as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Judge Ye Lwin told the court in Yangon the pair had ""intended to harm the interests of the state"". ""And so they have been found guilty under the state secrets act,"" he said. The verdict had been delayed once because of the judge's ill health. Nick Beake, BBC Myanmar correspondent, Yangon Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo bowed their heads as the verdict was delivered, while their families broke down in tears in court. The reporters have always insisted they were framed. Wa Lone - who missed the birth of his first child while being detained - protested his innocence once again as he was led away. Many will see this verdict as a crushing blow to freedom of the press in Myanmar and another setback for democracy, three years after Aung San Suu Kyi's party triumphed in free elections. Last week,UN inspectors called for Myanmar's top generals to stand trialfor genocide for the crimes committed against the Rohingya - the very subject these reporters were investigating. ""Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and press freedom anywhere,"" Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler said. Read their report 'Massacre in Myanmar',external The story behind the journalists' arrest Blow by blow: How a 'genocide' was investigated The verdict has been widely criticised by observers and human rights groups. Ahead of the verdict, people marched to show solidarity ""We are extremely disappointed by this verdict,"" Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, said according to Reuters. US ambassador Scot Marciel echoed the same criticism, saying the court's decision was ""deeply troubling for everybody who has struggled so hard here for media freedom"". The UN's resident and humanitarian co-ordinator in Myanmar, Knut Ostby, said the UN had ""consistently called for the release"" of the journalists and that ""a free press is essential for peace, justice and human rights for all. We are disappointed by today's court decision"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

McCain laid to rest at US Naval AcademyThe war hero who went on to become a maverick Republican senator is buried after a private ceremony.US & Canada,"John McCain's funeral procession heads to the cemetery at the US Naval Academy Senator John McCain has been buried at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, after a small private ceremony. A military flypast was performed with the squadron one plane short, to symbolise the dead senator. Mr McCain graduated from the elite Naval Academy in 1958, later serving in Vietnam as a fighter jet pilot. Family and friends were joined by his classmates and the current midshipmen for a service at the school's chapel. It caps a week of memorials for Mr McCain, who died on 25 August, aged 81, from the effects of brain cancer. John McCain will be buried next to an old friend, in the grounds of the US Naval Academy On Saturday, heavyweights from across the political spectrum gathered at the Washington National Cathedral to remember the Arizona senator, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians. Two former presidents - George W Bush and Barack Obama - paid tribute to Mr McCain's courage and sense of honour. This video can not be played Barack Obama on John McCain's ""last laugh"" A eulogy by the statesman's daughter Meghan, one of his seven children, included a thinly veiled swipe at President Donald Trump. ""The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great,"" she said. This video can not be played Meghan McCain: ""We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness"" Crowds lined the route as the senator's final motorcade travelled to the academy in Annapolis.

UK's four Brexit options,"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.
