Coronavirus survivors 'at risk of PTSD'Leading doctors call for regular check ups of those who have been treated in hospital.Health,"People who were seriously ill in hospital with coronavirus need to be urgently screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, leading doctors say. The Covid Trauma Response Working Group, led by University College London and involving experts from south-east England, said those who had been in intensive care were most at risk. The experts said regular check ups should last at least a year. More than 100,000 people have been treated in hospital for the virus. The experts say tens of thousands of these would have been seriously ill enough to be at risk of PTSD. The working group highlighted research which showed 30% of patients who had suffered severe illnesses in infectious disease outbreaks in the past had gone on to develop PTSD, while depression and anxiety problems were also common. Tracy is just one of many people who has been left with psychological scars from her coronavirus experience. She was admitted to Whittington Hospital in north London in March and spent more than three weeks there - one of which was in intensive care. ""It was like being in hell. I saw people dying, people with the life being sucked from them. The staff all have masks on and all you saw was eyes - it was so lonely and frightening."" Since being discharged in April the 59-year-old has been struggling to sleep because of the thought she will die and she has constantly suffered flashbacks. She is now receiving counselling. ""It has been really difficult. Physically I have been so tired. I'm beginning to recover, but the mental side of it is very hard to deal with. ""I have a good support network of family and friends and I'm a positive person - and I am struggling. I think there will be plenty of people who are in a similar situation, if not worse."" Where are coronavirus cases rising and falling? How long will it take me to recover? UCL psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield, who is on the Covid working group, said those patients who have ended up in hospital will have faced a ""very frightening and invasive"" experience and coupled with the long-term complications they would be at risk of stress-related mental health difficulties. He said the unique nature of the pandemic, which meant patients were isolated from their family while in hospital, could also make the problems worse. ""We need to make sure we support these patients. Services in place are very variable. Failure to do more could have long-term consequences."" A spokesman for NHS England said it was clear the pandemic had ""turned lives upside down"". He said all Covid survivors who stayed in hospital will have a follow up appointment with either their GP or hospital team where their mental health would be assessed. They were also able to refer themselves for psychological support, he added. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

UK's top civil servant announces exit,"The UK's top civil servant, Sir Mark Sedwill, has confirmed he plans to stand down from the role in September. In a letter to Boris Johnson, he said it was the right time to go as the government moved to the next phase of its coronavirus recovery plan. His exit follows reports of tensions between him and senior members of Boris Johnson's team. The senior civil servants' union, the FDA, said Sir Mark had been undermined in a ""cowardly"" way. FDA General Secretary Dave Penman accused unnamed Downing Street officials of briefing against Sir Mark. He added: ""Not only is it a self-defeating and corrosive tactic, it's also a cowardly one, safe in the knowledge that those who are briefed against are unable to publicly respond."" He said the government would be ""weaker as a result"" of Sir Mark's departure. Sir Mark's other role as national security adviser will be taken by Mr Johnson's chief Brexit adviser David Frost. Dominic Cummings, regarded as the Prime Minister's most influential political adviser, has long called for an overhaul of the civil service. And in a speech on Saturday, Michael Gove, attacked what he called ""group think"" within its ranks. As cabinet secretary, Sir Mark advised the PM on implementing policy and the conduct of government. A career diplomat, he served as Ambassador to Afghanistan during a 20-year career in the Foreign Office. He took over as cabinet secretary at short notice following Sir Jeremy Heywood's death in November 2018. Mark Sedwill was appointed by Theresa May in November 2018 He had previously worked alongside former PM Mrs May as the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. After he leaves government service in September, Sir Mark will be made a peer while he will also chair a new panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations. A number of top civil servants have either left their posts or are set to depart in the coming months after the Conservatives' resounding election victory in December. Profile: Sir Mark Sedwill Minister takes aim at civil service 'group think' PM asks Foreign Office chief to stand down Philip Rutnam is suing the Home Office for unfair dismissal after quitting in February while Simon McDonald is leaving the Foreign Office in September following its merger with the Department for International Development. Sir Mark said he had served both Mr Johnson and his predecessor in ""extraordinary times"". ""Two years ago, when my predecessor fell ill, your predecessor asked me to step in as Cabinet Secretary, and you asked me to continue to support you through Brexit and the election period,"" he wrote. ""It was obviously right to stay on for the acute phase of the Covid-19 crisis. As you are setting out this week, the government's focus is now shifting to domestic and global recovery and renewal."" There have been no secrets about the government's ambition to shake up how it does business. And there has never been any mystery about the desire of the prime minister's top adviser, Dominic Cummings, to change Whitehall. What might perhaps have been rather abstract and hypothetical is becoming real. Because it doesn't just matter who the politicians are that set the direction of the government. It's not just important who their unelected advisers are who suggest, cajole and promote their ideas. The officials who are charged with carrying out their agendas are crucial, too. The departure of Sir Mark Sedwill, therefore, matters. The cabinet secretary is the boss of thousands and thousands of civil servants, and holds the ultimate responsibility for making the government machine work. And he is the third senior official to have called it quits on Boris Johnson's government. Read more from Laura here. In response, Mr Johnson said Sir Mark made a ""massive contribution"" to public life over the past 30 years and had been a source of ""shrewd advice"". ""You have done it all in Whitehall: from Afghanistan to the modernisation of the civil service; from immigration policy to Brexit and defeating coronavirus,"" he said. ""After serving for decades with great distinction - and unflappable good humour - I believe you have earned the gratitude of the nation."" Labour's shadow cabinet minister Helen Hayes paid tribute to Sir Mark, saying he had performed with dedication in ""difficult times"". But she added: ""On the day it was revealed millions of jobs across the country could be under threat in the coming months, it is very concerning Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are preoccupied with reshuffling Whitehall."" No 10 said Mr Frost would succeed Sir Mark as national security adviser, also taking a seat in the Lords, but he would continue to oversee negotiations on a trade deal with the EU until their conclusion.

PM promising Â£1bn to rebuild crumbling schools,"Head teachers have warned that funding for school repairs is long overdue Funding of Â£1bn for 50 major school building projects in England is being promised by the prime minister. There will also be a further Â£560m for repairs to crumbling school buildings. ""It's important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed,"" said Boris Johnson. But head teachers said the National Audit Office had identified a backlog of Â£6.7bn repairs needed across England's 21,000 schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson also addressed whether there would be social distancing when all pupils return to school full time in the autumn. The school with 300 holes in the roof Â£6.7bn needed to tackle school repairs, says spending watchdog Extra Â£7.1bn school funding 'enough to reverse cuts' ""It's not about 1 metre, it's not about 2 metres,"" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that safety was based on ""reducing the number of transmission points"" within schools for Covid-19 infections. This would mean whole classes becoming ""bubbles"" separated from other pupils, he suggested, with a promise to address the more ""complex"" arrangements needed for secondary school, where pupils ""criss-cross"" between different sets and subjects. He also promised there would be ""comprehensive plans in terms of both testing and tracing."" That could mean local closures of schools or sending home individual year groups in response to Covid-19 infections, Mr Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The school rebuilding programme, launched by the prime minister on Monday, will tackle the problems of ageing, dilapidated school buildings and also the need to create extra spaces for rising numbers of secondary age pupils. The 50 school building projects, which will be identified later in the year, will have Â£1bn in funding - the first phase of what is planned as a 10-year programme. The first of the 50 school projects will begin construction in September 2021 - but without any specified time frame for when they might all start or be completed. There will be an extra Â£560m for upgrades and repairs to schools for the next academic year - and Â£200m for improving further education colleges, which was previously announced, will be brought forward. There have been warnings that many school buildings are reaching ""the end of their useful lives"" ""This major new investment will make sure our schools and colleges are fit for the future, with better facilities and brand new buildings,"" said Mr Johnson. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, welcomed a ""significant step in the right direction"" - but said ""far too many children are studying in buildings that are not fit for purpose"". He warned that repairs were ""desperately needed and long overdue"" - and highlighted the concerns raised three years ago by the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, - saying that the problems would have ""worsened"" since then. In a report from 2017, the NAO warned of deteriorating school buildings - and said it would cost Â£6.7bn to bring buildings to a ""satisfactory"" level and a further Â£7.1bn to bring them up to a ""good condition"". It reported that many school buildings were ""near the end of their useful lives"" - and that major defects were likely to increase. Following that 2017 NAO warning, the government announcedÂ£2.4bn for school repairs and extra places. Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers backed the extra funding after a ""decade of underinvestment"" and warned that school funding must ""never be allowed to fall into such a perilous state again"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Conservatives' ""record on building and investment has been a lost decade"". The party said all regions of England had seen a fall in the amount of education investment per person since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Layla Moran, Lib Dem education spokeswoman, said the promises were ""spin over substance"" and that schools needed ""urgent investment"" rather than ""vague numbers pulled out of thin air"". The Department for Education says the funding for improving buildings is part of a wider investment in schools - including Â£650m for catch-up funding after the coronavirus and Â£350m for a tutoring service. There has also been a commitment to increase school spending by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 - which the Institute for Fiscal Studies says will reverse previous cuts to school budgets.

Leicester 'could be locked down over Covid',"Leicester's rise in cases has drawn attention in the highest circles of government The city of Leicester may be facing a localised lockdown after a rise in coronavirus cases, Home Secretary Priti Patel has confirmed. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, she said it was ""correct"" that the government was considering the move, reported in the Sunday Times. Figures on June 16 showed about 25% of the city's 2,494 cases so far were reported in the previous two weeks. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said there was ""no immediate prospect"" of a lockdown. Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said more analysis of data was needed Speaking on BBC Breakfast before Ms Patel was interviewed, he said data from testing was still being analysed and ""hopefully early next week we will know whether we have a problem and if we have, where it is"". Asked about restrictions, he said: ""I don't think that is an immediate prospect."" Coronavirus: What could local lockdowns look like in England? Sir Peter said he had been in constant contact with the chief medical officer, and said it would have been ""far better"" if the level of testing in the city had been greater. He said: ""It's only really if we know whether there is an issue, and where it might be, we can decide what, if anything, we need to do."" Ms Patel said she had spoken to Health Secretary Matt Hancock about a possible local lockdown, and said ""extra support"" would be going into the area. ""With local flare-ups, it is right we have a local solution,"" she said. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""It is right we have a local solution"" Leicester South MP and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC's The World This Weekend he felt there was ""no suggestion"" a lockdown was about to happen. ""I received a briefing from the health secretary yesterday and yes, we have a spike in infections in Leicester and yes, we have to respond to that with extra testing capacity and extra support for the local authority,"" he said. ""But nobody is proposing a local lockdown in the way in which it appears to have been presented in some of the media today and me and Matt Hancock were at one with that."" Leicester City Council's public health director said on 16 June the new cases - 658 - were ""relatively small"" but of concern. Local health experts confirmed they were involved in planning the next steps in tackling the virus, with attention focussed on the North Evington area. The Department of Health said four mobile testing sites and thousands of home testing kits had already been sent to Leicester. Public Health England said it was ""concerned"" by the increase in cases in the city and urged residents to follow advice on hygiene, social distancing and testing. It also said any tightening of restrictions locally, while such measures were eased elsewhere, would be ""difficult"" for the city. Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe has called for a lockdown Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe has called for a lockdown due to a ""perfect storm"" of poverty, positive tests and higher ethnic diversity. She said: ""I don't know why they're not enforcing a lockdown - the evidence suggests there should be one."" Tony Roe, BBC East Midlands political correspondent Just over a week ago, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed what he called an ""outbreak"" of Covid-19 In Leicester. In the first fortnight of June, 658 people had tested positive. With 2,500 cases in the city since March it's certainly a worrying statistical spike. North Evington was identified as an area of the city with a surge in cases - it's a community of tightly-packed terraces, mixed in with old industrial buildings and places of worship for many faiths. It's a good representation of Leicester as a multicultural city. A mobile centre has been set up this week in Spinney Hill Park so people can now walk to get a test. But the council says it needs the data from positive tests quickly if it is to react. It says it didn't get the data from the first fortnight of June until Thursday, so only this weekend has been able to plot where the Covid-19 cases are. The data also doesn't give an ethnicity breakdown, which mayor Sir Peter Soulsby says would be vital in helping understand which parts of the community are being affected by the virus - he's asked the health secretary for this data. Leicester has seen a number of Covid-19 cases in recent days. Several schools have been affected. Herrick Primary in Rushey Mead; Moat Community College in Highfields; Whitehall Primary in Rowlatts Hill; and Humberstone Junior and Humberstone Infant academies have all closed for a number of days. Business has been hit too, with three people testing positive at Sainsbury's supermarket in Melton Road, food manufacturer Samworth Brothers confirming a ""handful"" of cases at its Beaumont Leys sites and an unconfirmed number at the Pladis factory in South Wigston. By BBC Reality Check A spike in coronavirus cases has led to fears Leicester could face a local lockdown. However, it is not sure exactly what that would look like. Currently, councils do not feel like they have the powers to effectively shut off a city in the way you might expect. Rather, places where an outbreak has occurred - such as meat-processing plants - could temporarily shut and workers asked to be tested and self-isolate. Increased testing in an area would also likely play a part. This morning, the Mayor of Leicester Pete Soulsby said they were looking at neighbourhood-level data to assess what ""extra support"" might be needed in those areas.

Three charged over illegal street party clashes,"An estimate of 400 people gathered in Brixton for an unlicensed music event, police said Four people have been charged following violence at an illegal street party in south London. Twenty-seven police officers were injured during clashes at an ""unlicensed music event"" involving an estimated 400 people in Brixton on Wednesday night. The crowd on Overton Road were asked to leave and later became hostile, the Met Police said. The four people have been charged with public order offences and assault. Donte Knight, 20, of Charles Barry Close, Clapham Town, Wise Gambou, 19, of Chalk Road, Plaistow, and a 16-year-old male from Brixton are due to appear at Croydon Magistrates' Court on Monday accused of violent disorder.

Stabbing suspect family 'shocked and saddened',"Suspect Badreddin Abdalla Adam was named by police after multiple stabbings in Glasgow on Friday The family of a man shot dead by police following multiple stabbings in Glasgow say they are shocked and saddened by what happened. Suspect Badreddin Abdalla Adam, who was 28 and from Sudan, wasnamed by police following the incident on Friday. A member of Glasgow's Sudanese community, Almadi, spoke to the BBC on condition his full name was not used. He said Mr Adam's mental state had deteriorated recently and his family were sorry about the people stabbed. Mr Adam was shot and killed by specialist officers after six people, including a police officer, were stabbed at the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow's West George Street. Glasgow stabbings: What we know Concerns over asylum hotel plan ahead of stabbings The 28-year-old was staying in the 91-room hotel, along with about 100 other asylum seekers, after being moved there during the coronavirus pandemic. Almadi said Mr Adam had spent a month isolated in his room due to symptoms of Covid 19. He told the BBC: ""Actually he was suffering from a lot of mental health problems. ""He was mentally ill and actually his mental health deteriorated very badly when he stayed in the Park Inn."" PC David Whyte is being treated in hospital for serious injuries Almadi said Mr Adam's family were shocked at Friday's events in Glasgow. He added: ""They are very shocked and very sad and they feel very sorry about these people who are stabbed and for their families as well."" PC David Whyte, who is 42, was stabbed and critically injured as he responded to the incident. In a statement from his hospital bed, he said the scene of the stabbing was ""something I will never forget"". Police said the other five casualties, including three asylum seekers and two members of hotel staff, also remained in hospital - one of them in a critical condition. The injured males are aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. PC Whyte's wife Carol took to social media to pay tribute to her husband, posting an image of a thin blue line, with the words: ""Because he's mine, I hold the line"". The Thin Blue Line is an emblem used to support those in the police service. Home Secretary Priti Patel also paid tribute to the police and emergency workers who attended the incident. However, it has raised questions about the treatment of asylum seekers, withcharities and MPs questioning the decision to place people in hotels during the pandemic. The Scottish Communities Secretary, Aileen Campbell, has said she is seeking talks with the Home Office this week on the issue.

Radiation leak 'not from Russian nuclear plants',"The Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant is operating normally, Russian officials said Russia has said a leak of nuclear material detected over Scandinavia did not come from one of its power plants. Nuclear safety watchdogs in Finland, Norway and Sweden said last week they had found higher-than-usual amounts of radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere. A Dutch public health body said that, after analysing the data, it believed the material came ""from the direction of western Russia"". It said the material could indicate ""damage to a fuel element"". But in a statement, Russia's nuclear energy body said its two power stations in the north-west - the Leningrad NPP and the Kola NPP - were working normally and that no leaks had been reported. ""There have been no complaints about the equipment's work,"" a spokesperson for the state controlled nuclear power operator Rosenergoatomtold Tass news agency,external. ""Aggregated emissions of all specified isotopes in the above-mentioned period did not exceed the reference numbers."" Norway finds big radiation leak from Russian sub Russia explores old nuclear waste dumps in Arctic Radiation levels around the two powers stations ""have remained unchanged in June"", the spokesperson added. Lassina Zerbo, executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) tweeted on Friday that its Stockholm monitoring station had detected three isotopes - Cs-134, Cs-137 and Ru-103 - at higher than usual levels but not harmful to human health.

Boeing set for critical 737 Max flight tests,"The US aviation regulator has started formal test flights for Boeing's troubled 737 Max. The test flights, which will run through a series of potential emergency scenarios, are expected to take place over several days. Boeing's best-selling aircraft was grounded last year after two crashes killed all 346 people on the flights. The tests are a milestone for Boeing, but even if they go well, months of further safety checks will be needed. Aviation regulators grounded the 737 Max about 15 months ago following two crashes - a Lion Air flight and an Ethiopian Airlines flight - within five months of each other. The ruling triggered a financial crisis at the 103-year-old company, sparked lawsuits from victims' families, and raised questions about how Boeing and the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), conducted their safety approval process. Victims' families slam report into 737 Max crashes 'Nothing will ever be the same' after Boeing crash Boeing job cuts start to hit nearly 13,000 workers Investigators blamed faults in the flight control system, which Boeing has been overhauling for months in order to meet new safety demands. Carried out by FAA pilots, the tests will evaluate key systems, including a revised version of the flight control software which was implicated in the two accidents. The original system is believed to have overridden the pilots' commands and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives. Ethiopian Airlines' flight ET302 crashed shortly after take off in March 2019 The FAA told BBC News that the first certification flight took off from Seattle on Monday. The flight is expected to take several hours. Test flights had been planned for last year, but investigations uncovered an array of new safety issues that have delayed a return to service. It could take weeks to analyse data from the test flights. But even if this process is successful, further flying, training of pilots, and clearance from European and Canadian regulators will be needed. The European Aviation Safety Agency has maintained thatclearance by the FAA will not automatically mean a clearance to fly in Europe. Norwegian Air, TUI, and Icelandair are among airlines using the 737 Max in Europe, while other carriers have the aircraft on order. Boeing declined to comment.

UK's top civil servant announces exitSir Mark Sedwill quits his roles as cabinet secretary and security adviser to the PM.UK Politics,"The UK's top civil servant, Sir Mark Sedwill, has confirmed he plans to stand down from the role in September. In a letter to Boris Johnson, he said it was the right time to go as the government moved to the next phase of its coronavirus recovery plan. His exit follows reports of tensions between him and senior members of Boris Johnson's team. The senior civil servants' union, the FDA, said Sir Mark had been undermined in a ""cowardly"" way. FDA General Secretary Dave Penman accused unnamed Downing Street officials of briefing against Sir Mark. He added: ""Not only is it a self-defeating and corrosive tactic, it's also a cowardly one, safe in the knowledge that those who are briefed against are unable to publicly respond."" He said the government would be ""weaker as a result"" of Sir Mark's departure. Sir Mark's other role as national security adviser will be taken by Mr Johnson's chief Brexit adviser David Frost. Dominic Cummings, regarded as the Prime Minister's most influential political adviser, has long called for an overhaul of the civil service. And in a speech on Saturday, Michael Gove, attacked what he called ""group think"" within its ranks. As cabinet secretary, Sir Mark advised the PM on implementing policy and the conduct of government. A career diplomat, he served as Ambassador to Afghanistan during a 20-year career in the Foreign Office. He took over as cabinet secretary at short notice following Sir Jeremy Heywood's death in November 2018. Mark Sedwill was appointed by Theresa May in November 2018 He had previously worked alongside former PM Mrs May as the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. After he leaves government service in September, Sir Mark will be made a peer while he will also chair a new panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations. A number of top civil servants have either left their posts or are set to depart in the coming months after the Conservatives' resounding election victory in December. Profile: Sir Mark Sedwill Minister takes aim at civil service 'group think' PM asks Foreign Office chief to stand down Philip Rutnam is suing the Home Office for unfair dismissal after quitting in February while Simon McDonald is leaving the Foreign Office in September following its merger with the Department for International Development. Sir Mark said he had served both Mr Johnson and his predecessor in ""extraordinary times"". ""Two years ago, when my predecessor fell ill, your predecessor asked me to step in as Cabinet Secretary, and you asked me to continue to support you through Brexit and the election period,"" he wrote. ""It was obviously right to stay on for the acute phase of the Covid-19 crisis. As you are setting out this week, the government's focus is now shifting to domestic and global recovery and renewal."" There have been no secrets about the government's ambition to shake up how it does business. And there has never been any mystery about the desire of the prime minister's top adviser, Dominic Cummings, to change Whitehall. What might perhaps have been rather abstract and hypothetical is becoming real. Because it doesn't just matter who the politicians are that set the direction of the government. It's not just important who their unelected advisers are who suggest, cajole and promote their ideas. The officials who are charged with carrying out their agendas are crucial, too. The departure of Sir Mark Sedwill, therefore, matters. The cabinet secretary is the boss of thousands and thousands of civil servants, and holds the ultimate responsibility for making the government machine work. And he is the third senior official to have called it quits on Boris Johnson's government. Read more from Laura here. In response, Mr Johnson said Sir Mark made a ""massive contribution"" to public life over the past 30 years and had been a source of ""shrewd advice"". ""You have done it all in Whitehall: from Afghanistan to the modernisation of the civil service; from immigration policy to Brexit and defeating coronavirus,"" he said. ""After serving for decades with great distinction - and unflappable good humour - I believe you have earned the gratitude of the nation."" Labour's shadow cabinet minister Helen Hayes paid tribute to Sir Mark, saying he had performed with dedication in ""difficult times"". But she added: ""On the day it was revealed millions of jobs across the country could be under threat in the coming months, it is very concerning Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are preoccupied with reshuffling Whitehall."" No 10 said Mr Frost would succeed Sir Mark as national security adviser, also taking a seat in the Lords, but he would continue to oversee negotiations on a trade deal with the EU until their conclusion.

Why hairdressers and not nail bars?,"Pubs but not clubs, hairdressers but not nail salons. The planned changes to England's coronavirus lockdown on 4 July have leftmany businesses questioningwhy they can't reopen yet but others can. The government hasn't spelt out exactly how it made its decisions, but what might be some of the reasons to keep some businesses shut and others open? Pubs, bars and restaurants are set to reopen, but nightclubs will remain shuttered. ""The whole way a nightclub works is getting people in close proximity,"" says virologist Dr Chris Smith. Compare that with pubs, where ""the whole ethos isn't about dancing with people and mating and dating"". A nightclub with the 1m social distancing rule would have ""zero atmosphere"". The difference could also be linked to noise. Loud music in clubs forces people to talk louder or shout. When people talk more loudly or sing, they produce higher numbers of respiratory droplets, experts from the government'sScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies say,external. These droplets are projected into the air, to be inhaled by other people - meaning the risk of spreading the virus is higher. Add to this the possibility that if people are dancing in a club and breathing quicker, they could potentially inhale more of those droplets. The singing point is born out perhaps in Sage's observation that at least two outbreaks are associated with choir rehearsals. In Japan, some customers have donned plastic facemasks in bars Thegovernment's own advice,externalurges all businesses to avoid playing music that might force people to talk louder or shout to communicate. Live music or comedy isn't allowed anywhere. What will a night out be like after lockdown? The new pub experience All these trades are considered""close contact services"",externaland very few are allowed to reopen. Hairdressers and barbers are an exception. The ""highest risk zone"" is the area in the front of someone's face, says the government, and so businesses that need staff to be within that area for most of the appointment (make-up, spa or beauty services, for example) should not reopen. Tattoo parlours say it's frustrating having to stay shut - especially since they have long been required to have measures in place to prevent cross-contamination. Hairdresser: 'Over 2,000 people on our waiting list' What to expect when hairdressers reopen But ""touching people is definitely a risk factor,"" says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, visiting professor in civil engineering at the University of Cambridge. ""Wherever people are touching, that's a known transmission risk factor."" Dr Fitzgerald - who also sits on the Sage Environmental Modelling Group - says the position people gather in is also a factor that can increase your risk. ""Even at 2m distance, it's better not to be face-to-face, but face-to-back, or back-to-back, or side-to-side."" There are large and small particles that come from people's airways, he explains. Smaller particles linger in the air - with a higher concentration around someone's face - but larger ones are ""like ballistics"" and are projected out in front. This could be one reason why hairdressers - who can for the most part stand behind or to the side of a client - are allowed to open first. Virologist Dr Smith adds: ""When you go in to get your nails done, your hands are on the table, you're leaning forwardâ¦ you're having to go very close to that person, face to face."" He also weighs up the value of hairdressers compared with the others. ""Your life does not depend on getting a tattoo [or your nails done]. But if you don't get your hair cut... you might even lose your job."" People can go to outdoor gyms to exercise, but indoor gyms and dance studios will stay shut for now - althoughministers have suggested,externalthey could reopen by the end of July. The rationale is ventilation: the more fresh air there is, the lower the concentration of virus particles. ""If you provide fresh air into the space, the dirty air is leaving the space,"" says Dr Fitzgerald. The virus is swept out to the outdoors where it will be in a ""ridiculously low concentration"". But what about the gym and exercise itself? A study in Norway,externallooked at whether people who went to the gym were at a higher risk of coronavirus than those who didn't. Although small, the study found no increased risk for gym-goers and the country has since reopened all indoor gyms, albeit with social distancing in place. In Los Angeles, a fitness instructor trains students surrounded by plastic sheets Dr Fitzgerald says he has not seen any data to suggest dancing or running on a treadmill increases transmission. But of the data he has seen, there's a link between virus particles and breathing rate. If you're breathing quicker, the risk of spreading or catching the virus may be higher. And can sweat spread the virus? ""We don't think so,"" says Dr Smith. The decision to keep casinos closed but reopen arcades and bingo halls has been called ""inconsistent""by the Betting and Gaming Council,,externalwhich represents casinos. Could ventilation be a factor, with many seaside amusement arcades having open fronts, or the fact that at casinos people handle cards and chips? Or could it be something to do with the average time spent in such places? ""You're in much closer proximity to people, face-to-face, lots of games, it's very, very difficult to socially distance and play cards,"" says Dr Smith. Blackjack in a Las Vegas casino earlier this month - but with masks, gloves and screens Dr Fitzgerald says the length of time spent in a place with an infected person increases risk. It is unlikely someone would inhale one little virus particle and become infected, he says. Instead, there's usually a threshold of virus particles you need to reach before you become ill. ""You know the risk will increase the more particles you inhale. If you can reduce the time you may be in the vicinity, that will reduce your risk."" Cinemas, theatres and concert halls are allowed to open - but, crucially for the latter two, without any live performances. Thegovernment says the ban,externalon live theatre, comedy or music is ""to mitigate the risks of aerosol transmission - from either the performer(s) or their audience"".One suggestion,externalhas been to put up a clear screen between the cast and audience. This video can not be played How cinemas will reopen after lockdown ""When you are at the theatre, the performers are dancing around, singing around and they are going to produce more aerosols,"" said Dr Smith. In its review of how safe businesses would be with a 1m rule in place,,externalthe government differentiated between theatres and cinemas, saying ""further work may be required to mitigate risk"" in theatres. But the reasons for opening some businesses and not others may not be completely down to the virus. ""Reopening each extra business increases the transmission risk for coronavirus,"" says Dr Gemma Tetlow, chief economist at the Institute for Government think tank. ""There is a trade-off between health risks and the economic benefits you get from being open again. ""The government might have made the decision that, actually, people's mental well-being and the UK economy is really helped by pubs and cinemas opening but actually theatres don't deliver such benefits. Or perhaps they deliver benefits to different groups of people. ""The government might be particularly worried about the mental health of people in crowded, built up, urban areasâ¦ and you might therefore open some types of social venues in preference to others.""

When can I go on holiday?,"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. There are still some restrictions in place inNorthern Ireland: 10 people from three households can meet and stay indoors in private dwellings and holiday accommodation Unlimited households can meet outdoors Social distancing of 1m (3ft) remains for many indoors activities, including restaurants, retail and shopping centres No social distancing laws outdoors, or on public transport, but 1m (3ft) recommended The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September. What can you now do across the UK? How are social distancing rules changing now? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. Indoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue tocollect customer contact details,external. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. Nightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland. TheCommon Travel Area (CTA),externalis a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Travel within the CTA is not considered international travel. Fully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip.

PM 'will not return to austerity of 10 years ago',"Boris Johnson outlined plans to help the economy ""bounce back"" in an interview with the Mail on Sunday The prime minister has pledged his government will ""not go back to the austerity of 10 years ago"" ahead of a speech on Tuesday. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Boris Johnson set out his plans for a post-lockdown economic recovery. They will include a new taskforce which will look at speeding up thebuilding of hospitals, schools and roads. But Labour has accused the government of ""pulling the rug from under"" many parts of the economy. The economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly fall on record. Job cuts warning as 600,000 roles go in lockdown Ex-chancellor warns against return to austerity UK debt now larger than size of whole economy Amid continued criticism of the way his government has handled the pandemic, the PMtold the paper,externalthat ministers will be ""doubling down on levelling up"" - spending on infrastructure in order to ""build our way back to health"". ""If Covid was a lightning flash, we're about to have the thunderclap of the economic consequences,"" he said. ""We're going to make sure that we have plans to help people whose old jobs are not there any more to get the opportunities they need."" Boris Johnson did press-ups as he spoke about his own - and the economy's - recovery from coronavirus In the Mail on Sunday article, the PM said the country would ""bounce back"" from the pandemic. He reinforced his message by doing press-ups to show he is ""fit as a butcher's dog"", following intensive care treatment for the virus in April. Meanwhile the UK's coronavirus death toll rose by 36 on Sunday to 43,550. Scotland recordedno new coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day, and there has been one more death in Northern Ireland. An Infrastructure Delivery Taskforce, led by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, aims to help to remove ""bottlenecks"" faced by major projects. No 10 hopes a building boom will boost jobs and improve connectivity for cities, towns and villages. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said ""really good"" infrastructure projects could give some immediate ""payback"" by increasing the number of people in work and the ""amount of demand"" in the economy in the short term. But he told the BBC that the ""risks"" could include spending money in the ""wrong way"" and doing things too quickly - which could result in ""low-quality infrastructure projects which don't pay for themselves"". He said over the next year, a lack of jobs will be the ""most important"" challenge, and called on the government to consider supporting people through training and job subsidy schemes. He warned there was a danger the UK could return to ""levels of unemployment we haven't actually seen for decades"". Analysis commissioned by the Labour Party suggests that unemployment levels could soar to levels not seen since the 1980s - tipping past the peak of 3.3 million seen in 1984 under Margaret Thatcher,the Observer reports,external. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned of such ""Thatcher levels of unemployment"" if sectors, such as hospitality, cannot fully reopen. In 1981, demonstrators marched from Liverpool to London in protest of unemployment rates under Margaret Thatcher's government He accused the government of ""pulling the rug from under"" many parts of the economy by tellingfirms they will have to start paying towards the furlough scheme from August, before it closes entirely in October. Mr Miliband told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there needed to be a bridge between the end of the furlough scheme and a job creation programme. He also criticised the government for not announcing a summer Budget this year when the UK is facing potentially theworst recession in 300 years. Addressing reports that the PM wants to help areas previously affected by austerity, Mr Miliband replied: ""There's a grand canyon between his rhetoric and the reality."" Boris Johnson has faced serious criticism for the way his government has handled the coronavirus outbreak - and questions are likely to continue as ministers look to ease the lockdown in England. But evidently keen to try and get his wider political agenda back on track, the prime minister is returning to the phrase that was so frequently used in last year's general election campaign - ""levelling up"". It means spending on infrastructure - schools, transport and the NHS. So, how will these big projects be paid for? With billions already spent to support the economy during this pandemic, borrowing, big time, seems on the cards. The number of workers on UK payrollsdived by more than 600,000 between March and May, official figures suggest, with economists warning the full effect on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end. Almost nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the pandemic have had their wages paid by the government under its furlough scheme. In a major easing of England's lockdown to help to reopen the economy, the PM announced on Tuesday that pubs, restaurants, hotels and many other businesses would be allowed to welcome back customers from 4 July. Pubs in England have so far only been allowed to reopen for takeaways But the announcement was criticised by some businesses - such as indoor gyms - that were not included on the list. And Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), warned there could bea ""very nasty rebound"" of coronavirusin the winter if the country does not use the next few months ""sensibly"". Pubs fear that new opening rules won't save them 'It was a shock' - the businesses not allowed to reopen First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford criticised the government's messaging around the easing of lockdown restrictions in England. He accused the PM of suggesting that coronavirus was ""all over"" and normal life can resume. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so R0, FURLOUGH:The language of the outbreak RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Mr Drakeford has been more cautious over easing lockdown, and neitherWalesorScotlandhave decided whether to follow England's move toease restrictions on overseas travel.The UK government is responsible for border controls, but the response to the pandemic is devolved. Meanwhile, Leicestermay be facing a localised lockdown after a rise in coronavirus cases. Figures show about 25% of the city's 2,494 cases were reported in the two weeks up to 16 June alone.

The businesses not allowed to reopen,"Tattoo artist Adam Grant says he was shocked to learn his studio can't reopen on 4 July While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July, many business owners were disappointed to learn they must keep their doors closed for now. ""It was a shock. I can understand the logical argument but personally it feels very irritating and disappointing,"" says Adam Grant,  a tattoo artist and studio manager at Tattoo UK in Uxbridge, west London. He says it was frustrating to hear that hairdressers can open on 4 July, while tattoo parlours must remain closed. It was especially irritating since tattoo parlours already have measures in place to prevent-cross contamination he says, such as the disposable gloves and aprons which artists must wear. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Tuesday that the government's public health experts will work with sectors which remain closed, to help them become ""Covid secure"" and open ""as soon as possible"". ""I don't really get it,"" says beautician Tara Williamson In the hope of a 4 July opening, Mr Grant had already made changes to the way the studio operated, including mandating face masks and asking future customers to come to appointments alone. Now he says he has no date for reopening and no guidance on what safety measures will need to be in place. ""We've been left in limbo really, until further notice,"" he says. As a self-employed tattoo artist Adam was able to claim financial support from the government during lockdown, but he says that only covered him for 2-3 months. ""We may have to see if we can get another self-employment scheme because if we're not allowed to open, we need to be compensated,"" he says. Nightclubs Casinos Bowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft-play Spas Nail bars and beauty salons Massage, tattoo and piercing parlours Gyms and dance studios Swimming pools and water parks Exhibition and conference centres This video can not be played ""Iâm frustrated we canât reopen when pubs and restaurants can"" Beautician Tara Williamson is also frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen but beauty salons staying closed. She runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping and had planned to open on 4 July. ""I don't really get it. I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow,"" she says. Tara had already made a number of changes at the salon, following safety guidelines that were issued to salons reopening overseas, in the absence of any clear guidelines in the UK. ""We've put screens in place, we've done a one-way system in the salon, we've prepared everything for the two metre distancing, we've staggered appointments, we've got sanitising stations,"" she says. ""It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening."" Gym manager Rob Ward has socially distanced workout areas in preparation for reopening Rob Ward, who runs YourGym, an independent fitness centre in Lytham, Lancashire, says he was also hoping to reopen on 4 July. The gym received a government grant of Â£25,000 during lockdown and Rob was able to enrol his staff on the state-paid furlough scheme. But he says closing for three months has inflicted a huge financial hit. ""You start a year with projected figures but they've all been knocked,"" he says. ""We've had some amazing support from local members, who were able to support us financially even when they couldn't come in. ""A lot of our personal trainers taught free online classes to keep the gym going. It's been a crazy time but there are such positives that come out of it."" Rob had been putting in place social distancing measures for when the gym can welcome back its members. ""Every other treadmill is out of order now, so you've got space. In our spin studio we've taken lots of bikes out,"" he says He's also used tape to ensure space between floor workout stations, bought a fogging machine for overnight disinfecting, and introduced a new online booking system. Even though the government has now reduced social distancing guidelines from 2m to '1m-plus', Rob says he'll keep the current measures in place ""to inspire consumer confidence"". ""We need a date. That's the main thing."" Mark Sesnan's organisation GLL is responsible for 200 swimming pools in the UK Mark Sesnan, managing director of GLL, says he'd also like a date to open his 200 swimming pools, with 11,000 staff across the UK. ""Basically we've been surviving on fresh air for the last 13 weeks. We feel extremely disappointed and let down,"" he says. ""As an industry we submitted documents to government on 7 May. Those documents have all been accepted and we'd been led to believe they provided a good enough framework for re-opening."" Mark says GLL was able to furlough most of its staff, but the organisation has also had to dig into its cash reserves. With pools geared toward a 4 July opening, GLL has also incurred costs from recent preparations such as water testing. He says the worst thing about Boris Johnson's announcement on Tuesday was the lack of a firm opening date for businesses that must remain closed. He's called on the government to ""come off the fence"". ""I was down at Charlton Lido yesterday in the blazing sunshine with a massive bright blue, empty swimming pool. It's sad for everybody,"" he says Lockdown to be relaxed in England as 2m rule eased What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? What are the social distancing rules?

Seven charts on the jobs market,"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

Here's a brief summary of what's been going on around the UK:   There has been a very definite boom in cycling across the UK since lockdown began at the end of March. It's prompted ministers to pledge millions of pounds for new ""pop-up"" bike lanes, and other road safety measures across the country. However, cycling campaigners say progress has been mixed, with improvements so far only seen in cities like London and Manchester, where plans to boost cycling were already in place. Pete Gibbons, who lives in Bristol, had been taking advantage of the quieter roads in lockdown to cycle more with his nine-year-old daughter. ""It was a completely different experience during lockdown because there wasn't any traffic, so it felt safe to be on some of the main city roads."" As the traffic returns, BBC journalist Becky Morton been asking if the UK's roads are better geared for cycling. And has enough been done to to keep people like Pete on his bike? Read more here. There's good news from Spain, which was once among the worst-affected countries in Europe. On Saturday, the capital Madrid recorded zero deaths for the first time since the pandemic reached the city, the president of the Madrid region, Isabel DÃ­az Ayuso, announced. ""Together we can ensure that this nightmare doesn't happen again,"" she said on Twitter on Sunday. It's a big change from a few months ago, when Ms DÃ­az Ayuso said that an estimated 3,000 people had died in the region's care homes in March alone - 2,000 higher than normal. More than 28,000 people have died in Spain since the pandemic began, and there have been almost a quarter of a million confirmed cases.

""Women work business hours, and when they get home itâs like a second job â theyâre responsible for cooking, cleaning and raising their children,"" she said. Vieceli is one of the workers on the front line of the pandemic who have been sharing their stories about the extra pressure they face as women. Another is Tsion Firew, who works in emergency medicine inNew York, alongside her role as a special adviser to the ministry of health in Ethiopia. She told the BBC that most health workers in the east African country and the US were women but senior leadership was mainly men - something which she suggests has life-threatening consequences. âWeâve noticed how certain PPE [protective kit] ] is made for men,"" she said. ""Even the
hair covers are made to fit men.â And the challenges facing women do not cease at the hospital door. InSouth Africa, university student Basi Letebele is looking for work after losing her job at a supermarket a few weeks ago. She was using the money
to pay for her studies and support her three-year-old daughter. âOne of the
applications I came across said that they would prefer men. That discouraged
me, because in this economy weâre all looking for work. ""What hope do we have as
women if there are jobs that prefer males?â The three women were speaking toBBC Outside Source, as part of theRethink series, looking at how the world should change after the pandemic. Paul GlynnEntertainment & arts reporter As the owner of one of the most famous haircuts in the UK for the past 40 years, Paul Weller is being surprisingly serene about his lockdown locks. ""I'm just letting it grow,"" he laughs. ""Well, I was kind of letting it grow anyway, but I've had no choice now. You have to just adapt, don't you?"" Rather than attempting to trim his own barnet at home, as others have done to varying degrees of success, the musician has been letting it all hang out while ""trying to make the best of it"" at his nearby studio in Surrey. ""There's so much time off and obviously no live work, so I'm just cracking on and trying to get on with the next thing really,"" he says.

Nearly half a million people have been barred from travelling in and out of Anxin county in Hebei province. The latest spike is linked to a food market in Beijing, the South China Morning Post reported. The city has ramped up testing in response to the outbreak, an official told a press conference on Sunday. ""We are also rolling out large scale screening to
key regions and key populations,"" Zhang Qiang said. ""We have already tested all the people that need
to be tested."" Beijing reported its first case from this outbreak on 11 June, and since then more than 300 people have tested positive for Covi-19. A further 36 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, latest government figures show. It brings the total number of recorded deaths - in all settings - to 43,550. Figures have also been released for the UK nations. The figures - which are collated differently to the UK-wide numbers - show:  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she feels an ""enormous"" relief at seeing the death toll not increase. The current tally remains at 2,482. The Greek economy is heavily reliant on tourism and officials are trying to kick-start the sector As we reported earlier, the Greek island of Kos is set to host dozens of German doctors for free from Monday. The tourism ministry said it was hosting the 170 medical professionals ""in recognition and gratitude for their contribution in combating the coronavirus"". Greece is officially scheduled to re-open its regional airports to passenger traffic on Wednesday Hundreds of tests are to be conducted daily at airports. Visitors will also have to fill out information forms, and disclose where they are staying, at least 48 hours before entering the country. Greece has reported fewer than 200 deaths from Covid-19.

France is holding local elections after they were delayed in March If you're just joining us, welcome. Here are the latest coronavirus headlines from around Europe: Reality Check Earlier, UK Home Secretary Priti Patel
told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that she was concerned about mass gatherings âin the
midst of a global [coronavirus] pandemicâ. She said there had been âfar too
many assaultsâ on police officers at protests and street parties. In the month to 7 June, assaults
on emergency service workers in England and Wales jumped by 24% compared with
the same period last year, according to the National Police Chiefsâ Council
(NPCC). The NPCC has attributed this, in
part, to an increase in protest activity across the country. At the end of last year, the Crown
Prosecution Service said there had been almost 20,000 assaults on emergency
workers in England and Wales. It said a large number of these
offences were for spitting but they also included kicking, punching,
head-butting and biting. This video can not be played Ben Carson on Trump's testing comments The US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, says he believes the increase in cases in America is because people have not been following social distancing guidelines. Florida and Texas are among states reinstating some restrictions. But the former neurosurgeon pointed out that although the numbers of cases had increased, the mortality rate had gone down. Reality Check Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe
has warned that its residents âare disproportionately at risk from Covid-19â, following reports that the city faces a local lockdown. Sheâs referring to poverty and the
diverse population of Leicester. In the 2011 Census, 37% of the
population was recorded as Asian and a further 12% were from other minority
groups. Most minority groups are at increased risk of dying from coronavirus,
including South Asians â the largest ethnic group in Leicester - who are 1.5 times
more likely to die than white people, according to the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Delhi 'wasted' lockdown to become Covid hotspot,"Delhi has ramped up testing in recent weeks With more than 77,000 cases of Covid-19, Indiaâs capital, Delhi, has become the countryâs biggest hotspot. The BBC's Aparna Alluri explains how this appears to be an opportunity missed. The city administration seems to have squandered the opportunity afforded by a stringent nationwide lockdown that lasted more than two months. Lax contact tracing, excessive bureaucracy, poor or no co-ordination with private health services and political wrangles have all led to a surge in numbers. Smaller Indian cities seem to be doing a far better job than the capital, the seat of Indiaâs federal government. The southern city of Bangalore has been lauded for its contact-tracing efforts which have contained the infection, and Chennai (formerly Madras) has had relatively few deaths despite a surge in cases.  But much like the financial capital Mumbai, which has also been hit hard by the virus, Delhi has been overrun with cases and its public hospitals, some of the best and biggest in the country, are struggling. This is despite the fact that Delhi is governed by Arvind Kejriwalâs Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which won a thumping majority earlier this year on the back of strong public services, including healthcare. So, what went wrong? Delhiâs caseload has risen sharply since the beginning of June - more than 50,000 of its Covid-19 cases were confirmed this month alone. One reason could be increased rate of testing with newly approved antigen kits - a rapid diagnostic test that gives results in as little as a half hour. âTesting is not a panacea,â K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public health Foundation of India and member of the national Covid-19 taskforce, told the BBC. âOf course you must test - but test judiciously, test based on symptoms or other clear criteria.â And that, he adds, is only possible with âearly case identification and exhaustive contact tracingâ - neither of which has happened. A study on contact tracing by the Indian Council of Medical Research,external(ICMR) found that between January and April, India, on average, tested 20 contacts for every confirmed case. But there were massive discrepancies. While some states such as Karnataka averaged 93 contacts, Delhi tested as few as nine. Patients stranded as Delhi struggles with Covid Why is India reopening amid a spike in virus cases? Are more women dying of Covid-19 in India? In fact, earlier this month,Delhiâs health minister said that officials were tracing only immediate contacts,externalgiven the high number of cases. But some people have taken to Twitter, alleging that even family members of Covid-positive patients were not being tested, and their neighbourhoods were not being contained. Allow Twitter content?

Delhi health workers have begun screening every household But, experts say, a lot of this should have been done earlier, during the lockdown. And if that had happened, the government would have been able to take swift, informed measures when restrictions started to ease from the third week of May. âThis whole disease is immensely stigmatised. Itâs become a law and order enforcement problem rather than a public health issue,â says Dr Ambarish Satwik, a vascular surgeon at Delhiâs Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Heavy restrictions on testing, poor communication on what happens after you test positive, and the fear of being quarantined in poorly maintained government facilities have all made people reluctant to get tested. âIf you get calls from the police, if you get calls from the district surveillance officer saying youâll get dragged away to some quarantine facility, who would get tested?â Dr Satwik asks. âYou would rather wait it out. The process is the punishment.â Despite the huge role private healthcare plays in India, much of the onus has been on understaffed and overstretched government laboratories and public hospitals. This has meant that many people who have symptoms prefer to stay home rather than queue up in long lines at public hospitals. And in recent weeks as stories emerge of Delhiâs hospitals running out of beds or refusing to admit Covid-19 patients, the chaos and anxiety have only increased. On Saturday, Mr Kejriwal blamed the speed at which coronavirus has spread for the burden on Delhi's health system. âFear and stigma drive the epidemic underground,â Prof Reddy says.  He says the government should have co-ordinated better with private players to be able to expand testing and hospitalisation early on, and to control prices. But Delhiâs government has spent weeks sparring with private hospitals over prices, testing criteria and hospital beds. All of this has meant fewer options for patients, leading to what Dr Satwik calls a  âsystematic disincentivisaitonâ for testing. Prof Reddy says the government was also so busy chasing clinical services - tests and hospital treatment - that it ignored basic public health functions. Mr Kejriwal was re-elected as chief minister for the third time this year âThey should have built a sympathetic environment - primary health teams backed by community health workers to find out who has fever and cough. These teams visiting homes should have enabled patients to be transferred to hospitals.â He says that would have created a clear process and offered reassurance, without which itâs hard to beat a pandemic. âPeople must have the confidence that they will get the care they need, that they will be treated with empathy,â he says. But the reality was far from that. Delhiâs unusual administrative position only adds to the confusion. Although itâs a state governed by Mr Kejriwal, the lieutenant governor, who represents the federal government, has competing powers. The result has been a series of conflicting orders, issued and then retracted, sometimes in as little as 24 hours - proof of what has always been a testy relationship between Mr Kejriwal and Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who leads the federal government. âWe canât keep swinging between one decision and another amid this daily drama of orders being countermanded and protests being lodged,â Prof Reddy says. He says Delhi, being the capital, should have received the best of attention rather than âfalling victim to the complexity of multiple decision-making authoritiesâ. But, some have argued, Delhiâs very role as a power centre has hobbled its response - its bureaucracy, for instance, has made it more opaque, with crucial data often being shared grudgingly.

Mumbai still has some 500 more active cases than Delhi. The capital is only slightly ahead in confirmed cases - about 5,000 - and could slip to second place again. But either way, Delhi cannot afford to slacken its efforts. âItâs never too late in an epidemic,â Prof Reddy says. âYou have to mount a very strong effort even now to contain the infection. You have to do that.â Are more women dying of Covid-19 in India? Why is India reopening amid a spike in virus cases?

Man charged with murder over Reading stabbings,"Khairi Saadallah is charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A man has been charged with the murder of three men who were stabbed to death in a public park in Reading. Khairi Saadallah is accused of killing James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joe Ritchie-Bennett, 39, on 20 June. The attack in Forbury Gardens was later declared a terrorist incident. Mr Saadallah, 25, has also been charged with three counts of attempted murder, Thames Valley Police said. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. The 25-year-old came to the UK from Libya in 2012. He originally claimed asylum and was given leave to remain in 2018. Counter Terrorism Policing South East continues to lead the investigation. Post-mortem tests revealed David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong each died of a single stab wound The three friends each died of a single stab wound, post-mortem examinations have shown. Mr Furlong was head of history and government and politics at The Holt School in Wokingham. His parents said their son was ""beautiful, intelligent, honest and fun"" and ""will live in our hearts forever"". Mr Ritchie-Bennett was a US citizen who moved to the UK 15 years ago. His father Robert Ritchie told US TV network CBS the family was ""heartbroken"" and said his son, who was originally from Philadelphia, was ""brilliant and loving"". And scientist Mr Wails was described as ""always happy"" and a person who ""always made people smile"". Three other people hurt in the attack have since left hospital. Members of the victims' families lit candles at a vigil in Reading, which the local councilstreamed online,external. It began at 19:00 BST, marking a week since the attack. Home Secretary Priti Patel was among officials at the vigil in Market Place. People who took part in the virtual memorial were encouraged to light a candle and place it on their doorsteps or in their windows. Families of the victims came together to light candles at a vigil in Reading on Saturday By Caroline Davies The vigil took place on a grey and windy day in Reading's centre just yards from where the attack happened in Forbury Gardens last Saturday. Representatives from the police, ambulance, local MPs and family sat on spaced out chairs, facing three lanterns: the three lives lost. After the families each lit the candles for their loved ones, they came together as a group, hugging and holding on to each other. The crowd was silent, remembering the three men, David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong - described as honest, loving and outstanding people, whose lives were cut short. Ahead of the vigil, Mr Furlong's family released a statement thanking the police for their ""remarkable bravery"" in response to the attack. They also thanked other members of the emergency services, and members of the public ""who did all they could to help and save the lives of those who had been injured that night"". The statement added: ""To James' colleagues and pupils at the Holt School: he spoke often of how much he loved where he worked and his passion for developing the students. He cared so much and was very proud of each and every one of you. ""James was passionate about creating a more loving and caring society. His time with us was cut far too short but the impact he made will live on, long long into the future. His family, his friends and those who have met him - he made us all a better person. ""We are so proud of him. James was, and always will be, so very much loved by us all."" Home Secretary Priti Patel was among officials at the event The family of Mr Ritchie-Bennett also released a statement, which read: ""We LOVED Joe so much and we are in such deep sorrow. We need all the prayers for Joe and the Ritchie and Bennett families."" Councillor David Stevens told the vigil that the attack had left Reading ""feeling a mix of horror, disbelief and immense sadness."" ""Just one week ago, friends and families were sat in Forbury Gardens, just a few yards from here, making the most of the warm weather on a summer's evening and enjoying one another's company,"" he said. ""It was around now, the happiness and tranquillity of the evening was shattered in the cruellest and most horrific way."" The Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire, James Puxley, said of the three friends: ""Who knows what they would have achieved in life had they lived to an old age. Doubtless they would have achieved many good things that the community is now deprived of benefiting from."" He also praised members of the public who ""tore off their shirts to make bandages"" to help the victims of the attack. This video can not be played Family members of James Furlong, David Wails and Joe Ritchie-Bennett lit candles at the vigil An online book of condolence has also been opened for people to pay tribute to the three friends, who were members of the LGBT community. Martin Cooper, chief executive of Reading Pride, said he also had been friends with all three men, and they were ""great supporters"" of the community. He previously described them as ""true gentlemen"" and said each had a ""unique personality"".

New Irish PM puts Covid-19 top of agenda,"MicheÃ¡l Martin will lead his Fianna FÃ¡il party into a historic coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens Ireland's new taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the fight against Covid-19 will be his government's first priority. The 59-year-old Cork native was elected at a special meeting of the Irish parliament in Dublin. He has been the leader of the Fianna FÃ¡il party since 2011. He will lead a three-party coalition consisting of Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Mr Martin said that to be elected to serve as taoiseach was ""one of the greatest honours which anyone can receive"". Speaking to the DÃ¡il (Irish lower house) as taoiseach for the first time, Mr Martin said the focus would be on the social, economic, and cultural recovery from the coronavirus. He said would would begin immediately on preparing an investment-led jobs and recovery initiative. These proposals would be brought before the DÃ¡il next month. It is the first time in history that former Civil War rivals Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have governed together. Mr Martin is expected tolead the country until December 2022before handing back over to Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael leader. MicheÃ¡l Martin pictured leaving Dublin's Convention Centre after being elected Mr Martin has been a member of the DÃ¡il (lower house of Irish parliament) for just over 30 years. He served as cabinet minister in several Fianna FÃ¡il governments from 1997 to 2011. As health minister in 2004, he became the first national government minister in any part of the world to introducea workplace smoking ban,external, which also banned the public from lighting up in pubs. 2020 Election Profile: Fianna FÃ¡il's MicheÃ¡l Martin Mr Martin was elected taoiseach by members of the DÃ¡il in a special sitting on Saturday. The vote took place at the Convention Centre in Dublin, rather than its traditional home at Leinster House, due to Covid-19 social distancing rules. TDs gathered at the convention centre in Dublin, due to social distancing requirements A majority of 93 members of the DÃ¡il voted in favour of him taking the role, while 63 members voted against him. Mr Martin made the trip to the president's official residence, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in to be presented with the seal of office Mr Martin appointed a new cabinet on Saturday evening, dividing the roles between all three parties. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is now the tÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) as well as minister for enterprise, trade and employment. Writing on Twitter on Saturday evening, he said he was ""honoured"" to be appointed to the position, and that his party was ""doing what is right for the country"". Green Party leader Eamon Ryan is minister for transport, energy and climate action. The rest of the posts were distributed as follows: Minister for Finance - Paschal Donohoe (Fine Gael) Minister for Health  - Stephen Donnelly (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence - Simon Coveney (Fine Gael) Minister for Justice - Helen McEntee  Fine Gael) Minister for Education - Norma Foley (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Agriculture - Barry Cowen (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Housing - Darragh O'Brien (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Public Expenditure - Michael McGrath (Fianna FÃ¡il) Minister for Rural Affairs and Social Protection - Heather Humphreys (Fine Gael) Minister for Higher Education - Simon Harris (Fine Gael) Minister for Communications and Culture - Catherine Martin (Green Party) Minister for Children and Disability and Equality - Roderic O'Gorman (Green Party) Mr Varadkar has been caretaker taoiseach since the general election in February. Higher Education Minister Simon Harris (centre left), remains in the cabinet, having previously served as health minister No party came close to winning a majorityin the poll which would enable them to govern alone, but coalition talks were then halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Fianna FÃ¡il won the most seats, but the two larger parties needed the support of the Greens to have a working majority in the Irish parliament (the DÃ¡il). The party leaders and their negotiating teams reached agreement on a coalition deal earlier this month. This video can not be played What challenges lie ahead for the new Irish government? There have also been nominations made to the Seanad, the upper house of the Irish legislature. Of the house's 60 seats, the Taoiseach has made 11 nominations, of which there are four each for Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, with two for the Green Party. The final nomination goes to Traveller rights activist Eileen Flynn. MicheÃ¡l Martin confirmed on Saturday he would be setting up a shared island unit within the Department of the Taoiseach. This was criticised on Twitter by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who highlighted that none of the Seanad picks represented Northern Ireland. Ian Marshall, a unionist from County Armagh, previously served in the Seanad from 2018 until 2020, and was supported in his original nomination by Sinn FÃ©in. MicheÃ¡l Martin was the only Fianna FÃ¡il leader in the party's history not to have served as taoiseach, but that changed today. MicheÃ¡l Martin is expected to be taoiseach (prime minister) for two and a half years He will hold the role for 30 months before handing over to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar. The two parties, both centrist, Fianna FÃ¡il slightly to the left and Fine Gael to the right, have dominated the politics of the state since its foundation. Although there has been little to separate them policy-wise for decades, their decision to share power in government for the first time is historic. But it's also a political necessity for their leaders to keep Sinn FÃ©in, the party that got the most votes in February's general election, away from government. Sinn FÃ©in has accused the two of using the Greens as a ""fig leaf"" to disguise their denial of the electorate's demand for change. The three parties have five years to disprove those who claim the new coalition is simply a slightly greener version of business as usual in such areas as housing and dealing with climate change in a radical manner. A meeting between Mr Martin and Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, is likely in the coming days. While there will be new faces, there will be some old problems to talk about such as Brexit and Covid-19. Not everyone supported the new taoiseach during Saturday's vote in the Convention Centre. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael of conspiring to exclude them from government. Mary Lou McDonald claimed Sinn FÃ©in had been excluded from power At February's election, Sinn FÃ©in took 24.5% of first-preference votes, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. ""Faced with the prospect of losing their grip on power, Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael have circled the wagons,"" she said, claiming the new coalition was a ""marriage of convenience"". Fine Gael leader and outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party would not make a nomination but instead would support the nomination of MicheÃ¡l Martin. Leo Varadkar and MicheÃ¡l Martin chat before the vote in the Convention Centre Green Party leader Eamon Ryan also supported the nomination of Mr Martin for taoiseach, saying the Fianna FÃ¡il leader was ""perfectly qualified to run the country"". Labour leader Alan Kelly said his party would not support the nomination of either Mr Martin or Ms McDonald. People Before Profit Richard Boyd Barrett did not support Mr Martin's nomination and said the coalition's programme for government was a ""re-hash and reheating of the same failed policies"".
