BBC women face 'veiled threats',"Men working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women, a report found Women at the BBC have told MPs they faced ""veiled threats"" while trying to raise the subject of equal pay. More than 150 women have put forwardwritten evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee,,externalahead of a hearing on Wednesday. Auditors PwC have separately reviewed the pay and diversity of presenters, correspondents and on-air talent. The BBC's media editor Amol Rajan says the corporation is proposing a pay cap of Â£320,000 for its news presenters. The change, following an outcry about the size of the salaries of the BBC's highest paid stars, will only affect a handful of people but forms part of a wider restructuring of pay of on-air staff. Tuesday's announcement about on-air pay and Wednesday's committee session take place against the backdrop of a long-running debate about gender pay at the BBC, which began last summer after thecorporation published its salaries for on-air staffearning more than Â£150,000. BBC director general Tony Hall and Carrie Gracie, whoquit as the BBC's China editorover ""pay discrimination"" this month, will be questioned by the committee of MPs. The BBC's media editor says the proposed Â£320,000 cap has not yet been fully agreed or signed off and will apply only to on-air staff working full time. It will affect presenters, editors and correspondents, who will be given time to respond to the proposals. However, it is not clear whether on air-staff will be able to earn more from other BBC work, for instance on entertainment programmes. Last week,six of the BBC's leading male presenters agreed to take pay cuts. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS select committee, said the Â£320,000 pay cap didn't fully address his concerns. ""It actually affects a relatively small number of people,"" he said. ""If you look at the grievances that Carrie Gracie brought forward, saying she wasn't paid the same amount as other international editors at the BBC, this new proposed pay cap wouldn't have addressed that at all."" Collins also discussed the pay disparity for talent outside of news - in areas of entertainment and sport. He said: ""Many people would look at that and say, 'why is it that Gary Lineker is paid many multiples of what Clare Balding is paid?'. ""Many people would say she does a job of equal value, working on many different outlets for the BBC and covering a wide range of sports. And that's why this review must go much broader than that."" The National Union of Journalists and the BBC Women group have criticised the BBC's record on equal pay ahead of the MPs' inquiry into the issue. BBC Women, a group that represents female BBC journalists and producers, said it had ""no confidence in the on-air review"" because it had not been consulted and felt it had ""been excluded from the process"". The salaries of Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman were among those revealed last summer ""We believe there is a wider culture of gender discrimination, which can be seen in patterns of promotion, especially after women take maternity leave."" They added: ""While individual BBC managers have been supportive there is still a bunker mentality in some quarters and women have experienced veiled threats made against them when they raised the subject of equal pay."" The group included several individual testimonies in its evidence to MPs, including one from former BBC Scotland health correspondent, Eleanor Bradford. How the BBC gender pay story unfolded Chris Evans tops list of best-paid stars Bradford said she discovered she ""was one of the lowest-paid correspondents at BBC Scotland, despite regularly appearing on UK-wide news and delivering exclusive stories"". She said she regularly asked for a pay rise and eventually was given a Â£5,000 increase but it was not backdated and she remained about Â£10,000 below some male colleagues doing exactly the same job. She subsequently left the BBC. Bradford told BBC Radio 4 Today that she felt it was an ""unconscious bias"", but there were ""efforts to change things"" during her last couple of years with the BBC. ""I do hope that there will be change, but I think nevertheless the spotlight should be shown on this because I think the change isn't happening fast enough,"" she said. Thirteen further cases have been put forward anonymously. They include: A TV news presenter who said she ""had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more...  I am told that we are now being paid at the same rate per day, but there is no transparency"" A BBC reporter who found her full time equivalent salary for making identical programmes was about half her male counterpart A sports broadcaster who has worked for the BBC for almost 30 years, both as staff and freelance, who found her Â£500 pay on a flagship radio programme was less than half of the male presenter A regional news presenter who after becoming aware that her male colleague's salary was a third more than the figure she had been offered was given a 5% increase An award-winning broadcaster on a flagship arts programme said she found her male colleague was being paid 50% more per show. ""When I asked for (the) pay gap to be corrected the line manager told me 'the BBC doesn't do equal pay', and that in raising the issue I was being 'aggressive'. I refused to back down and eventually was given the same rate as my male colleague and it was backdated"". A BBC spokesperson said: ""We look forward to an informed debate at the select committee based on all the facts. ""The BBC is committed to equal pay, and we don't accept the assertion we have not been complying with the Equality Act, nor do we offer inferior contracts based on someone's gender or race. Nicky Campbell, Huw Edwards, Jon Sopel, Jeremy Vine, Nick Robinson and John Humphrys are to take pay cuts ""We want to help women progress in their career and have set out ambitious targets to close the gender pay gap, filled by women. We've also set out action to achieve them. ""We have already set out how we plan to deliver real pay transparency for our staff, and today we'll publish proposals to significantly change how we manage on-air pay so we have a clear, transparent and fair system for the future."" The spokesperson added that the corporation would ""not getting in to debates at the moment on pay band levels"". Damian Collins MP, chair of the DCMS committee, said that the complaints from the BBC Women group and the NUJ included those about ""unlawful pay disparities on grounds of race, discrimination against women returning to work after periods of maternity leave, and discrimination against part-time workers and/or those who request flexible working"". A report published in October foundmen working for the BBC earn an average of 9.3% more than women. The figure covered all staff, on and off air, and was put down to the fact there are more men in senior jobs. It compares with a UK average of 18%, and BBC director general Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"".

Reality Check: Equal pay,"Carrie Gracie's resignation as the BBC's China Editor has highlighted the issue of equal pay and it got us wondering how widespread the problem is in the UK. Equal pay means staff doing the same job must be paid the same amount - it is a legal requirement. Remember that having equal pay does not necessarily mean that you do not have a gender pay gap. The BBC reported in October that its gender pay gap was 9.3%, but that may be because more men are in senior jobs than women. The chart above shows the number of cases about equal pay in employment tribunals that have reached conclusions. What it does not show is the outcome of those cases.The Ministry of Justice publishes figures,externalfor the outcomes, but they are not as much help as you might expect. Since 2011, so few cases were successful at a hearing they were recorded as 0%. But, on the flipside, the proportion of cases recorded as unsuccessful at a hearing was also 0%. So what is going on? A large proportion of cases are ""dismissed upon withdrawal"", in other words the employee and employer either came to a conclusion away from the tribunal or the employee withdrew, and in those circumstances the results are not made public. So we don't know how often genuine cases of unequal pay occur. No other area of complaint has this feature at tribunals - discrimination on the grounds of age or race or disability all have at least a small proportion of cases decided one way or the other by the tribunal. It turns out that demonstrating that jobs are equal is such a difficult and drawn-out process that very few cases are ever decided at tribunal level. ""The procedures that have to be followed in equal pay cases are so complicated that people settle,"" said Caroline Underhill from Thompsons Solicitors. ""For all other claims the legal procedures are far less convoluted and the law is easier to understand."" It also means that cases which do proceed to tribunal can drag on. ""Equal pay cases are notorious for taking a long time... making the cases expensive"", according to the TUC. As we see in the chart at the beginning of this article there is no clear pattern in the numbers of equal pay cases being heard in tribunals. And it is particularly difficult to read anything into it because of the impact of charging people who brought cases. There was a big fall in the number of all types of cases going to tribunals when fees were introduced in July 2013. The numbers went up again after July 2017,when the government was forcedby the courts to stop charging fees.

Call to charge hospital over boy's death,"Signs of sepsis brought on by pneumonia were initially missed by hospital staff Charges against a hospital where a six-year-old boy died are being considered, police have confirmed. Jack Adcock died of septic shock at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011, after a ""catalogue"" of mistakes. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter, but supporters have said ""systemic"" hospital failings were to blame. Leicestershire Police confirmed it had received a letter urging the force to bring corporate manslaughter charges. The court heard Jack, who had Down's Syndrome and a heart condition, was the subject of a ""catalogue"" of errors including missing signs of his infection and mistakenly thinking he was under a do-not-resuscitate order. After being found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence Bawa-Garba was suspended for 12 months. But last week theHigh Court upheld an appeal,externalby the General Medical Council (GMC) that this decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". The hospital trust itself should be investigated, doctors' groups have said Thisprovoked a backlash from medicswho felt Bawa-Garba had been made a scapegoat for making honest mistakes in a under-resourced hospital. More than 8,000 doctors have signed a letter condemning her treatment and online appeal raised more than Â£200,000 in a matter of days. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) said the case had caused ""shock waves"". Junior medical staff and trainees were ""fearful"" and felt unsupported, he said. ""They will be hesitant to work in these circumstances thus compromising patient care."" Hadiza Bawa-Garba's case has provoked concern within the medical profession Writing to Leicestershire Police, BAPIO said: ""We believe that significant concerns have been raised and evidence referred to which justify consideration of an investigation of University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust to determine if Jack Adcock's death could require a prosecution."" The force confirmed it had received the letter from the BAPIO and ""will be discussing its contents with the CPS"". A spokesman for the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said: ""We understand that the police have received a letter from the BAPIO and will be discussing it with the CPS.

MPs vote to leave Parliament during refit,"The majority of the iconic building dates back to the mid-19th Century MPs have voted to leave the Palace of Westminster while a proposed multi-billion pound refurbishment of the historic building takes place. The Commons approved a motion calling for a ""full and timely decant"", designed to allow essential repairs, by 236 votes to 220. The planned move, part of a proposed Â£5.6bn modernisation, will not take effect until 2025 at the earliest. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the era of ""patch and mend"" had to end. The Lords will debate and vote on their views on the future of the building next week. Where could MPs be re-homed? Although the government has said the decision is a matter for Parliament, Mrs Leadsom said the iconic building faced ""critical risks"", with 60 episodes in recent years which could have led to a serious fire. While any full-scale restoration programme would be likely to see MPs and peers leave for a ""significant"" amount of time, she said the Palace of Westminster ""will always remain the home of Parliament"" and this would be guaranteed in future legislation. While Parliament needed to get on with the matter, she said the business planning must be rigorous to ensure value for money for the taxpayer. This video can not be played Pound: Palace of Westminster is a statement During a three hour debate on the issue, several MPs argued that Parliament risked becoming a safety risk for all those who worked in it and urgent action was needed. As well as the threat of fire, the building is seen as vulnerable because of its antiquated sewage system and areas of the palace, which was largely rebuilt in the 19th Century after it burnt down, are riddled with asbestos. A review by accountants Deloitte in 2014 estimated that the cost of repairs with a full decant would cost between Â£3.5bn and Â£3.9bn, a partial decant between Â£3.9bn and Â£4.4bn and a rolling programme of works, with Commons and Lords chambers being ""vacated and then re-occupied"" and lead to longer recesses, up to Â£5.67bn. The motion passed endorses a 2016 report by the Joint Committee on the Palace of Westminster which warned a decision on how to refurbish Parliament could not be delayed any further and backed a ""full and timely decant"" to Richmond House, a nearby building in Whitehall currently used by the Department of Health. A senior parliamentary official recently warned that Parliament could become the next Grenfell Tower The current rolling programme of repair work is no longer viable, many MPs believe Former Cabinet minister Damian Green said Parliament was not safe in its current condition and it was not a ""wild exaggeration"" to say that it is a ""death trap"". Labour's Chris Bryant said for MPs to want to stay in the building while extensive building work was taking place was ""bonkers"" and they had a duty to preserve Parliament for the next 100 to 200 years. What it's like to work in a crumbling Parliament Parliament 'could be next Grenfell' Another delay to Parliament's restoration But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said he could no longer support the plan because the measurements had changed and the bulk of Richmond House would have to be demolished to make way for a replica chamber in its courtyard, considerably increasing the cost of the project. And Labour's Stephen Pound said it was vital that parliamentarians kept a ""footprint"" in the historic building, insisting ""we cannot lose this, we have fought too hard for this"". The SNP's Pete Wishart said the estimates for the various options were ""eye-watering"" and he would not be surprised if the entire project ended costing between Â£10bn and Â£12bn.

Capita shares collapse on profit warning,"Capita shares have plunged almost 50% after the outsourcing firm warned on profits and announced a major shake-up. New chief executive Jonathan Lewis said the company had become ""too complex"" and ""driven by a short-term focus"" and needed to change its approach. Capita, which issued a series of profit warnings last year, has again cut its profit forecast and revealed plans to raise Â£700m by issuing new shares. The move comes after outsourcing rival Carillion collapsed earlier this month. Capita operates the London congestion charge, runs the government's Jobseekers Allowance helpline and administers the teachers' pension scheme. It also collects the TV licence fee on behalf of the BBC. Shares ended the day 47% lower at 182.5p, prompting calls from Labour and trade unions for urgent government action to avoid ""another Carillion"". A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said as a ""strategic supplier"" Capita was always monitored by the government. The firm employs 70,000 people, about 50,000 of whom are in the UK. According to Tussell, a firm which analyses UK public sector contracts, Capita won 154 government contracts last year. Mr Lewis, who took over two months ago, said a review had found the company worked across too many markets and services, meaning it was difficult to ""maintain a competitive advantage"" in every business. Capita had relied too much on acquisitions to drive growth and had also seen weakness in new contracts, he added. The company does have some financial strengths. It can call on Â£1bn in cash and credit facilities, has a significantly higher profit margin than Carillion did and has been taking steps to reduce its debt burden. If Carillion had made an announcement like this a few years ago - raising money to pay off debt, admitting a slow-down in the market, owning up to both underinvestment and an over-reliance on buying other companies to find growth - then it might still be with us now. Instead, Capita's new boss, Jonathan Lewis, has decided to take evasive action early. Chief executives are normally afforded only one chance to hit the reset button in their time at the top, and the smart ones take it early, and hit the button hard. That is what Mr Lewis has done. By taking harsh financial medicine now he has probably ensured that the company does not suffer Carillion's fate. Mr Lewis plans a wide-ranging overhaul including cost cutting, selling unprofitable businesses and cutting the dividend to shareholders. Annual profits are now expected to be between Â£270m and Â£300m - well below analyst expectations of Â£400m. In a conference call Mr Lewis said there was ""much to be done"", but Wednesday's announcements were the ""first steps on the road to recovery"". Neil Wilson, senior analyst at ETX, said signs of problems had been building at the firm, including the loss of ""a lucrative and profitable contract with the Prudential"" in January. Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, urged the government to ""take serious steps"" to oversee the activities of Capita, pointing out that it was the third major outsourcing company after Carillion and Interserve to issue a profit warning in the past month. Capita is audited by KPMG, the same accountancy firm which audited Carillion. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said Capita was ""on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners' rights"". ""Another day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the Big Four popping up at every turn in the company's chequered history,"" he added. Capita offers customer management services, including the operation of call centres, for public and private sector organisations. Its customers include O2, M&S, John Lewis, local councils, the Army and the Department of Work and Pensions. The firm's biggest contract is its management of O2's call centres. The 10-year deal was signed in 2013 and is worth Â£1.2bn. It is also the UK's leading provider of software to emergency service control rooms and also runs the Ministry of Justice's electronic monitoring services for criminal offenders.

Blood test finds toxic Alzheimer's proteins,"Scientists in Japan and Australia have developed a blood test that can detect the build-up of toxic proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease. The work,published in the journal Nature,external, is an important step towards a blood test for dementia. The test was 90% accurate when trialled on healthy people, those with memory loss and Alzheimer's patients. Experts said the approach was at an early stage and needed further testing, but was still very promising. Alzheimer's disease starts years before patients have any symptoms of memory loss. The key to treating the dementia will be getting in early before the permanent loss of brain cells. This is why there is a huge amount of research into tests for Alzheimer's. One method is to look for a toxic protein - called amyloid beta - that builds up in the brain during the disease. It can be detected with brain scans, but these are expensive and impractical. The new approach, a collaboration among universities in Japan and Australia, looks for fragments of amyloid that end up in the blood stream. By assessing the ratios of types of amyloid fragment, the researchers could accurately predict levels of amyloid beta in the brain. Significantly, the study shows it is possible to look in the blood to see what is happening in the brain. Dr Abdul Hye, from King's College London, said: ""This study has major implications as it is the first time a group has shown a strong association of blood plasma amyloid with brain and cerebrospinal fluid."" The test is cheaper than brain scanning, ""potentially enabling broader clinical access and efficient population screening"", according to the study. At the moment there is no treatment to change the course of Alzheimer's, so any test would have limited use for patients. However, it could be useful in clinical trials. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""These data are very promising and may be incredibly useful in the future, in particular for choosing which people are suited for clinical trials and for measuring whether amyloid levels are changed by treatments in trials."" Dr Hye added: ""Considering Alzheimer's disease has a very long pre-clinical phase, a truer test will be how well this test performs in independent, healthy, cognitively normal individuals or even in individuals in the early stages of the disease.""

Mosque suspect's defence 'conjured up'Prosecutors question Darren Osborne's claim that a man called Dave drove a van into worshippers in June.2h2 hours agoUK,"A man accused of driving a van into a group of people outside a London mosque in June ""conjured up a defence out of thin air"", prosecutors have said. Darren Osborne had intended to kill as many Muslims as possible, said Jonathan Rees QC in his closing statement. Mr Osborne, 48, who denies murder and attempted murder, says a friend called Dave was driving the van when it hit people in Finsbury Park, killing one. But Mr Rees said Dave's participation was ""plainly fabricated"". ""You know why he is lying, because despite all of his talk, the defendant doesn't have the courage of his convictions. He has sought to blame someone whose involvement he's invented,"" he told Woolwich Crown Court. Mr Rees said Mr Osborne's two contradictory statements during his trial told the jurors ""everything you need to know about the defendant's approach to these proceedings"". He urged jurors not to allow Mr Osborne to ""pull the wool over your eyes"", adding the defendant's motivation had been ""a warped hatred of all Muslims with its roots in material he had watched on TV and online"". ""His chosen weapon was a large van, capable of inflicting fatal injuries if driven into a crowd of pedestrians."" Earlier, Mr Rees challenged the defendant to explain why Dave had not been seen on CCTV getting out of the van after the collision, in which nine people were also injured. Mr Osborne said: ""He's like Dynamo, an illusion. An illusionist. He can make himself vanish perhaps. I don't know."" And he insisted that Dave had not been made up. Mr Osborne denies the murder of Makram Ali, 51, and the attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"".

Police Tasered man with mental age of 7He was also charged with assaulting an officer but the case collapsed when CCTV of the incident emerged.4h4 hours agoBristol,"This video can not be played Max, now 28, has a mental age of seven and also has autism A disabled man was Tasered by police and charged with assaulting an officer in a case that collapsed when his mother discovered CCTV of the incident. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the footage showed ""rather different"" events to those claimed by Avon and Somerset Police. The police watchdog said failure to gather the CCTV ""fell below standard"" but there was no wrongdoing. Avon and Somerset Police has issued a partial apology over the case. But the police force said the incident had been subject to a ""detailed and robust investigation"" by the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) and there was no case to answer for misconduct. Police statements said Max stepped ""towards them and pushed"" a PC Officers were called to The Laurels, a supported housing unit for vulnerable adults in Bristol, in August 2015 after reports of a cracked window. Max, who has the mental age of a seven-year-old and whose name has been changed, had been drinking. The audio recording of the radio call between the control room and the officers revealed they were told Max had ""smashed a window at the location causing a bit of a disturbance, apparently he's intoxicated"". A transcript of a 999 call to police at the time, released on Wednesday, said ""we don't feel safe, some of the clients don't feel safe and are vulnerable here, so it's best probably take him off the premises as soon as possible"". The IOPC report references a radio call where the operator advises officers that there was a marker for violence on Max's record. However, statements from officers reveal they were unable to hear this information before he was Tasered as Max was talking to them ""in close proximity"". The 28-year-old was arrested and charged with assaulting an officer after police said he pushed them. Police statements said a bare-chested Max, who also has autism, stepped towards them and pushed a PC ""double-handed in the chest with open palms"" and the officer ""stumbled back two foot"" before the Taser was used. The officers said they were in danger and did not know if he was carrying a weapon. Staff later said the ""damage was caused accidentally"" and those at the housing said they did not want to press charges. 12 August 2015: Police are called to a disturbance at The Laurels in St Pauls. They arrest and use a Taser on Max, then aged 24 November 2015: Trial at Bristol Magistrates' Court collapses after defence lawyers provide CCTV of the alleged assault to prosecutors Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy writes to Avon and Somerset's Police and Crime Commissioner who orders an investigation into the case Superintendent Pete Warren reports back Max's mother takes case to IOPC, then called the IPCC 6 October 2017: IOPC finds no evidence of misconduct The case at Bristol Magistrates' Court collapsed in November 2015 when Max's mother, Margaret secured CCTV footage and handed it to the defence. The CPS prosecutor that day, Kevin Withey, said the footage ""shows an incident rather different to that described in the statements of the PCs"". The case was investigated after calls by MP Kerry McCarthy and Avon and Somerset's Police and Crime Commissioner but the force backed its officers, saying one had been kicked and they were unaware of Max's learning difficulties. A further investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, now the IOPC, found ""inaccuracies"" in the officers' accounts but did not find evidence of any misconduct. It recommended further disability awareness training for officers. Max's mother Margaret feared her son would go to prison Margaret is now urging the force to review its use of Tasers. ""If Max had been found guilty on the basis of their evidence, he would have been sent to prison,"" she said. The IOPC said that although the actions of the officer who failed to gather the CCTV evidence ""fell below the standard expected"", they did not amount to misconduct. Supt Richard Corrigan, from the force, said the decision to arrest Max ""was necessary"" and the IOPC report stated the arrest and use of Taser were reasonable. ""I am very happy to acknowledge the failures and to extend an apology to the family over two elements,"" he said. ""This is the failure in relation to the letter that was submitted to the police and crime commissioner which contained information that wasn't accurate. ""The second element was our absolute responsibility to secure the CCTV, which wasn't secured."" He added: ""The IOPC identified a performance issue relating to a separate officer in relation to securing and preserving of CCTV evidence in connection with this case and a management plan was put in place to address this issue. ""Unfortunately, inaccurate information about the assault on an officer was initially given to the police and crime commissioner. The IOPC concluded this mistake had no influence on the way we dealt with this case, but we'd like to apologise for the error."" The force now has a ""dedicated lead for autism"" and all new officers and civilian investigators undergo training covering ""autism spectrum conditions and other non-visible disabilities"". The force is under investigation for the use of a Taser against race relations group founderJudah Adunbiand over the repeated punching of a man who was detained under the Mental Health Act in Yeovil.

Woman breaks down at rugby rape trial,"Paddy Jackson (left) and Stuart Olding both deny the charges against them A woman who has accused two Ulster rugby players of raping her has broken down in court while giving evidence about the case. The 21-year-old, who was 19 at the time of the alleged attacks, appeared at Belfast Crown Court. Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding, who both deny the charges against them, listened in the dock as the woman gave evidence against them. The woman said that she was first attacked by Mr Jackson. Giving evidence from behind a curtain, she sobbed as she told the court: ""He knew I did not want this to happen and he kept going."" The woman said the rape happened in a bedroom at Paddy Jackson's house in June 2016 after a night out at a nightclub in Belfast. She said Stuart Olding later came into the bedroom and he attacked her too. The woman told the court: ""No-one should have to go through what I went through."" She added: ""Rape is a game of power and control. They rely on your silence. You only take back the power when you actually do something about it."" Blane McIlroy (left) and Rory Harrison both deny the charges against them At one point in the proceedings, Judge Patricia Smyth asked the woman if she wanted to take a break because she was so upset. But she said she wanted to continue. She said that on the night in question, she had kissed Paddy Jackson in an upstairs bedroom earlier in the evening at his house. She said: ""It was completely consensual but it was instigated by Patrick Jackson."" ""Patrick Jackson tried to undo my trousers. I told him firmly I wasn't interested and went back downstairs."" Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have both been capped for Ireland She was asked by lead prosecution QC Toby Hedworth if Mr Jackson tried ""to take matters further""? ""No"" she said. But she said he forced himself on her later in the evening. He followed her upstairs when she went up to retrieve her clutch bag, and he attacked her, the court heard. Describing the start of the alleged attack, she said: ""In that moment, you think you are going to kick and scream and fight. ""But it doesn't work that way. Look, you just freeze. I knew where this was going but it just happened so quickly."" The trial is taking place at Belfast's Crown Court When Stuart Olding came into the room, she said she pleaded for the attack to stop. ""I looked at Patrick Jackson straight in the eyes and said: 'Please, no, not him as well"". She said that a medical check later revealed that she had suffered ""internal damage"". She said at first she had been reluctant to go to the police. She said: ""You just think they're not going to believe you."" Ulster Rugby's Craig Gilroy (left), Iain Henderson and Rory Best pictured going into Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday But now she says she is glad she did so. ""It's the best decision I made,"" she said. Asked if she had known Paddy Jackson before agreeing to go back to his house with a group of six other people, she said she had met him once before briefly. But she added: ""I don't follow rugby. I've never been to an Ulster rugby match."" She said that on the night in question, she consumed a large glass-and-a-half of wine, and three double vodkas. The woman gave evidence for more than an hour, with the curtain shielding her from most of the court. The defendants, media and people in the public gallery were able to watch her giving evidence on a screen. Mr Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. He denies the charges. Mr Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. He too denies the charge. Two other men have also been charged in connection with the case. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure. He denies the charge. Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charges. The case continues.

Trump to release controversial memo,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The FBI has questioned moves to release a secret memo said to accuse it of abusing surveillance powers to target Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""We have grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy,"" the agency said. There are suggestions the Congressional memo may be published on Thursday. Democrats fear the document may be an attempt to discredit the inquiry into Trump campaign links to Russia. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff accused his Republican counterparts of altering the text of the document after it was voted on. He said it should be withdrawn and reviewed again prior to any possible public release. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading the investigation into alleged Russian meddling and possible obstruction of justice by members of the Trump administration. The White House has to approve the memo's release but its chief of staff, John Kelly, told Fox News Radio it would be ""released here pretty quick"" for the ""whole world"" to see. The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington All you need to know about Trump Russia story The four-page document was compiled by staffers for House Intelligence Committee (HIE) head Devin Nunes, a member of Mr Trump's Republican party. Staff of Republican Devin Nunes wrote the secret memo It apparently accuses the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) of abusing a surveillance programme known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) during the 2016 presidential election campaign. The allegation is that the FBI ran surveillance on a member of Mr Trump's campaign. According to lawmakers who saw the memo, it says the FBI obtained a warrant to spy on the campaign aide on the basis of unproven accusations against Mr Trump known as the ""Russian dossier"". That dossier was compiled by former UK intelligence agent Christopher Steele with money financed in part from Hillary Clinton's campaign. The HIE voted to release the memo on Monday and Mr Trump has until the weekend to decide whether to clear it for public release. Following his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Mr Trump was heard telling a Republican lawmaker he was ""100%"" for releasing the document. As of Wednesday however, he had still not read the memo, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Mr Kelly said Mr Trump wanted ""everything out so the American people can make up their own minds and if there's people to be held accountable, then so be it"". Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words In a rare statement, the agency said it had had ""limited opportunity"" to review the document,externalbefore the HIE voted to release it on Monday. ""We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the Fisa process,"" the FBI statement added. The US Department of Justice has said it would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" to release the memo. Trump officials say the memo proves his allegation that he has been treated unfairly by the FBI. Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump team during his White House transition, said it was ""no surprise"" the FBI had objected to the memo's release. Mr Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to lead the Russia inquiry ""Having stonewalled Congress' demands for information for nearly a year, it's no surprise to see the FBI and DoJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies,"" he said. After firing FBI director James Comey last year, Mr Trump reportedly asked his temporary replacement, Andrew McCabe, how he had voted in the 2016 presidential election. Mr McCabe resigned last month as Mr Trump accused him of pro-Democratic bias. He had been planning to retire in March. In December, Mr Trump reportedly challenged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mr Mueller, over his loyalties. He wanted to know whether Mr Rosenstein was ""on my team"", CNN reports.,external Democrats on the HIE accused Republicans of having secretly altered the memo before giving it to the White House.

Mr Schiff said that releasing the memo increased ""the risk of a constitutional crisis by setting the stage for subsequent actions by the White House to fire Mueller or, as now seems more likely, Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein"". Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who serves on the Senate Intelligence committee, said the Republicans were clearly trying to ""undermine the special counsel's investigation"". ""There's no excuse for playing politics with highly classified information,"" she added. A counter-memo drafted by Democrats was blocked by Republicans.

Mosque suspect's defence 'conjured up',"A man accused of driving a van into a group of people outside a London mosque in June ""conjured up a defence out of thin air"", prosecutors have said. Darren Osborne had intended to kill as many Muslims as possible, said Jonathan Rees QC in his closing statement. Mr Osborne, 48, who denies murder and attempted murder, says a friend called Dave was driving the van when it hit people in Finsbury Park, killing one. But Mr Rees said Dave's participation was ""plainly fabricated"". ""You know why he is lying, because despite all of his talk, the defendant doesn't have the courage of his convictions. He has sought to blame someone whose involvement he's invented,"" he told Woolwich Crown Court. Mr Rees said Mr Osborne's two contradictory statements during his trial told the jurors ""everything you need to know about the defendant's approach to these proceedings"". He urged jurors not to allow Mr Osborne to ""pull the wool over your eyes"", adding the defendant's motivation had been ""a warped hatred of all Muslims with its roots in material he had watched on TV and online"". ""His chosen weapon was a large van, capable of inflicting fatal injuries if driven into a crowd of pedestrians."" Earlier, Mr Rees challenged the defendant to explain why Dave had not been seen on CCTV getting out of the van after the collision, in which nine people were also injured. Mr Osborne said: ""He's like Dynamo, an illusion. An illusionist. He can make himself vanish perhaps. I don't know."" And he insisted that Dave had not been made up. Mr Osborne denies the murder of Makram Ali, 51, and the attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"".

'I won't get 13 months spent in jail back',"This video can not be played Petruta-Cristina Bosoanca speaks about having to give birth in prison A woman held in custody for more than 13 months before her trial collapsed has told the BBC she hopes someone will be punished for the failures which led to her giving birth in prison. The trial of Petruta-Cristina Bosoanca - held on trafficking and prostitution charges - was stopped after evidence cast doubt on the complainant's story. ""Nobody is going to give me this 13 months back,"" said Ms Bosoanca. Judge Gregory Perrins said there had been ""wholesale failures"". Ms Bosoanca, 25, was arrested in December 2016 and was released from HMP Bronzefield on Monday. She said it was ""very difficult"" giving birth five months ago to her baby boy, Christian. ""There was no-one with me,"" she said. ""In the moments when I was supposed to be happy, I was happy but unhappy at the same time."" The trial of Adrian Iordan, Anisoara Lautaru and Ms Bosoanca was stopped on its 17th day, after the complainant in the case had been cross-examined. Some 65,000 lines of text messages were disclosed to the defence on day two. Ms Bosoanca said she repeatedly insisted she was not guilty and that she ""needed to show"" it. ""I knew it, at the beginning I asked for my phone, I asked for the pictures, CCTV, I asked for everything but they (didn't) care,"" she said. Ms Bosoanca's question now is: ""Why they don't discover everything earlier? I was waiting for them to see the truth."" ""They were incompetent all of them,"" she added. ""They kept me far away from my family, from my son."" A senior prosecutor apologised to the court and said the CPS's handling of the case had ""fallen below standard"". Hundreds of court cases axed over failings The defendants were accused of conspiring to traffic a young woman to the UK from Romania for the purpose of prostitution. The complainant claimed she had been trafficked and forced into prostitution by the three defendants and had become pregnant after being raped in the UK. It later emerged the woman was already pregnant when she entered the country in 2016, when she was examined three days after the arrest of Ms Bosoanca. At London's Wood Green Crown Court, Judge Perrins said the defence had requested medical evidence about the pregnancy as long ago as August 2017 and had been repeatedly told that no such medical evidence existed. This repeated failure to properly disclose the police doctor's report was, said the judge, ""one of the more serious failings identified in this case and requires further explanation"". Facebook messages also showed that the complainant had been discussing the pregnancy and the identity of the father of her child with friends. The BBC understands that relevant social media material was known to the police from January 2017 but was not disclosed until December 2017. Defence lawyers working through the disclosed evidence said it would have taken four days' solid work to find evidence that undermined the prosecution case in the disclosed material. Ms Lautaru was arrested in March 2017. The 19-year-old was remanded in custody for most of the time since then. Following the collapse of the case on Friday, a CPS spokesman said: ""We are concerned by the outcome of the case and the comments of the judge today. ""It is clear there have been failings in this case, and it is being reviewed by senior CPS lawyers as a matter of urgency."" The CPS had previously said it would review the case and the judge said he would refer the case to the director of public prosecutions.

HK bans ivory trade in 'historic' vote,"The ivory trade will now be phased out in Hong Kong by 2021 Hong Kong's lawmakers have voted overwhelmingly to ban the trade in ivory, in a move campaigners described as ""a lifeline for elephants"". A similar ban was brought in across mainland China earlier this year. Ivory sales will be phased out gradually in Hong Kong, stopping completely in 2021. Prior to the vote, demonstrators gathered outside Hong Kong's legislature with signs reading: ""Do you really need ivory chopsticks?"" ""Shutting down this massive ivory market has thrown a lifeline to elephants,"" said Bert Wander of the global advocacy group Avaaz. Ivory from animal tusks - mostly those of elephants - has been traded in Hong Kong for more than 150 years. It is considered the world's largest ivory market. WildAid Hong Kong, a conservation group, says the former British colony had a 670-tonne stockpile in 1989, when the global trade was banned. Only ivory dating from before that period is meant to be sold there, but campaigners say the legal trade is often a cover for illegal activities. The war on elephants Can China's ivory trade ban save elephants? In July 2017, authorities in Hong Kong said they had seized the world's biggest ever haul of ivory tusks - some 7.2 tonnes. Elephant tusks seized by Hong Kong Customs and Excise More than 90% of those buying ivory in Hong Kong are from the Chinese mainland, which had hitherto been the world's largest importer of elephant tusks. The trade in Hong Kong will cease in three stages. First, there will be a ban on hunting trophies and ivory from after 1975, when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) took effect. Later, ivory obtained before 1975 will also be included. And finally, traders will be obliged to dispose of their stock by 2021. The country that brought its elephants back from the brink Laos is 'fastest growing' ivory market The penalties for ivory smuggling will also increase considerably. Under the new law, offenders could be fined HK$10m ($1.3m; Â£1m), double the present amount, or imprisoned for 10 years instead of the current two. This video can not be played The facts and figures behind China's ivory trade Many conservationists have hailed the ban as a victory. Alex Hofford of WildAid called it ""a great moment in the history of elephant conservation"". Hong Kong lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said the vote marked a great day for elephants, but that the changes must be enforced effectively. ""It's now up to our law enforcement agencies to ensure the ban is properly implemented,"" she said. Some activists feel the timeframe is unnecessarily long, however. They point out that African elephants are still being killed for their tusks in huge numbers.

USA Gymnastics doctor 'abused 265 girls',"The number of known sexual abuse victims of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar has grown to 265, a Michigan judge has said. At least 65 victims are set to confront Nassar, 54, in court this week in the last of three sentencing hearings, prosecutors say. He was sentenced last week to 40 to 175 years in prison after nearly 160 women testified that he had molested them. His victims included Olympic gold medal winners Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber. Nassar is already serving 60 years in prison for possession of child sex abuse images. This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar In the current hearing, the court is sitting to sentence him for molesting patients in the back room of Twistars gymnastics club in Dimondale, Michigan. The former Michigan State University (MSU) physician pleaded guilty in November to three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct against girls for whom he was supposed to be providing medical care. At least one of the sexual assaults included a victim younger than 13. Two of the victims were abused at 15 or 16 years old. On Wednesday Judge Janice Cunningham told the small court in Charlotte, Michigan: ""We have over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims in the state, in the country, and all over the world. Jessica Thomashow said: ""He first molested me when I was nine... before I had braces"" ""As a result, by allowing live streaming and tweeting, all individuals are able to participate in this process."" The first to speak was 17-year-old Jessica Thomashow, who told the court:""He first molested me when I was nine (...) before I had braces, and when I still played with my American Girl dolls. ""Larry Nassar preyed on us for his own pleasure, leaving in his wake traumatised and broken girls."" She described him as ""evil"" and ""a criminal of the worst kind"". This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony Ms Thomashow's older sister was also abused by the doctor while studying at MSU. In this final sentencing, a minimum of 25 to 40 years is expected to be added to Nassar's prison sentence. The 156 women who confronted a predator The hearing is scheduled to last three days as women line up to deliver victim-impact testimony. USA Gymnastics says every director of its board has now resigned in the wake of the scandal. The US Olympic Committee demanded the board step down by Wednesday or face losing its governing authority. ""We are in the process of moving forward with forming an interim board of directors during the month of February,"" said a statement by USA Gymnastics. About 140 victims are suing Nassar, USA Gymnastics and MSU, seeking monetary damages from institutions they accuse of ignoring the allegations. Michigan's attorney general has launched a criminal investigation into MSU. The college's president and top sports official resigned last week following Nassar's sentencing. Protests erupted among students and faculty after MSU's board unanimously appointed former governor John Engler to serve as interim president. Several students and faculty members said they were blindsided by the choice and were not asked for input. The Texas ranch where dozens of girls were abused by Nassar Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered an investigation into the Karolyi Ranch. Scores of Nassar's victims were abused ata Texas training campfor the US gymnastics team.

'Mum's poems taught us not to fear death',"Helen Dunmore has posthumously won Costa Book of the Year for Inside the Wave When poet Helen Dunmore was nearing the final stages of cancer, she told her daughter Tess Charnley one day: ""Darling, check your email. There's something for you."" ""And she'd emailed us all this final poem, Hold Out Your Arms, about her impending dying,"" Tess explained onBBC Radio 4's Today programmeon Wednesday. Hold Out Your Arms was written on 25 May 2017. Dunmore died less than two weeks later at the age of 64. The poem - reproduced in full below - talks of death's ""motherly caress"". It implores: ""Death, hold out your arms for me/Embrace me/Give me your motherly caress/Through all this suffering/You have not forgotten me."" The final lines read: ""As you push back my hair/- Which could do with a comb/But never mind -/You murmur/'We're nearly there'."" The poem was posthumously added to reprints of Dunmore's final collection Inside the Wave, which on Tuesday was named winner of the Costa Book of the Year prize. Dunmore wins Costa Book of the Year prize Tess told the Today programme that receiving the poem was ""an enormous comfort"". She said: ""You worry so much when someone you love is dying - that they're frightened, or you just worry that it's a horrible thing for them. But she showed us all that it was OK."" Tess Charnley says her mother made the most of every day The collection was written after Dunmore was diagnosed with cancer and looks at the liminal space between life and death - the book's blurb says it examines what it's like to be travelling inside a wave, before it crashes - exploring it all the while with an artist's eye. The opening poem Counting Backwards first came to her when she was lying on an operating table and talks of the anaesthetist and his cannula. Another, which she wrote about living for the moment while hooked up to oxygen, is about the tree outside the ward where she was staying. Her bravery was what marked her final days, weeks and months, her daughter said. ""I suppose because I'm quite young, maybe naive, I've always seen death as something very frightening,"" said Tess. ""My mum just showed me that it doesn't have to be. ""I think although her world got smaller, she couldn't go out so far afield, she continued to just see the beauty in everything - which I find very inspiring. ""She just made the most of every single day until she died."" This video can not be played Helen Dunmore's daughter remembers her legacy Dunmore never saw her writing as a job. ""To mum, it wasn't working - poetry was so intrinsic to her as a person that it was never work,"" said Tess. ""It was just a part of her and she would never not do it. It was very natural that she would write until she died. ""We were just enormously proud of the work she was producing and actually, last year before she died, she had Inside the Wave published and Birdcage Walk, her novel, and one of her children's books as well. ""So it was actually quite an enormous year for her as a writer. I've always just loved reading it as she goes along."" Dunmore's son Patrick Charnley, daughter Tess and widower Francis collected the Costa honour on her behalf Tess told Today how she held her mother's hands in her final days. ""She continued comforting everyone around her, even when perhaps she was the one who needed comforting the most,"" she said. ""She was intrinsically my mum until the very end. Which was lovely."" Her favourite of her mother's works was a poem Dunmore wrote for her daughter, All the Things You Are Not Yet. ""She wrote it about me as a baby and everything she hoped for me as I grew up,"" she explained. ""It's become particularly resonant now she's died, because it has bits about, for example, when I would have a baby - which I now know she'll never see me have. It's precious to me."" Hold Out Your Arms Death, hold out your arms for me Embrace me Give me your motherly caress, Through all this suffering You have not forgotten me. You are the bearded iris that bakes its rhizomes Beside the wall, Your scent flushes with loveliness, Sherbet, pure iris Lovely and intricate. I am the child who stands by the wall Not much taller than the iris. The sun covers me The day waits for me In my funny dress. Death, you heap into my arms A basket of unripe damsons Red crisscross straps that button behind me. I don't know about school, My knowledge is for papery bud covers Tall stems and brown Bees touching here and there, delicately Before a swerve to the sun. Death stoops over me Her long skirts slide, She knows I am shy. Even the puffed sleeves on my white blouse Embarrass me, She will pick me up and hold me So no one can see me, I will scrub my hair into hers. There, the iris increases Note by note As the wall gives back heat. Death, there's no need to ask: A mother will always lift a child As a rhizome Must lift up a flower So you settle me My arms twining, Thighs gripping your hips Where the swell of you is. As you push back my hair - Which could do with a comb But never mind - You murmur 'We're nearly there.' 25 May 2017 Inside the Wave was published by Bloodaxe Books in April 2017.

Trump heralds 'new American moment',"This video can not be played Standing ovation v stony-faced silence A bullish US President Donald Trump has proclaimed a ""new American moment"" as he delivered his maiden State of the Union speech to Congress. In a primetime address, the Republican leader said he was ""extending an open hand"" to Democrats to work together. Mr Trump also saidhe was ordering Guantanamo Bay to be kept open, reversing an Obama-era directive to close the controversial detention camp. The American economy is booming but Mr Trump's approval rating languishes. Trump's speech: As it happened Four reactions to Trump speech Melania defies tradition to arrive alone In an upbeat message a world away from his apocalyptic ""American carnage"" inaugural speech of just a year ago, Mr Trump said his administration was ""building a safe, strong and proud America"". ""There has never been a better time to start living the American dream,"" he told lawmakers in a one-hour-and-20-minute speech. Nearly 46 million television viewers were expected to tune in as he implored the nation to come together as ""one team, one people and one American family"". Mr Trump made a plea for the kind of bipartisan co-operation that has been in short supply during a turbulent first year in office. The president, who has enraged Democrats by withdrawing protections for immigrants who entered the US illegally as children, offered an olive branch. ""Tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, colour and creed."" US First Lady Melania Trump arrived separately from her husband But he insisted on a border wall with Mexico and other concessions from Democrats as part of any over-arching immigration deal. Some Democrats hissed. This video can not be played What did a Trump voter and a 'Dreamer' think of the State of the Union? Reality Check: Seven Trump claims fact-checked What is the State of the Union speech? Mr Trump again touted his pet plan to rebuild America's ageing roads and other infrastructure, though he did not offer many details. The president said that 2.4 million jobs had been created on his watch. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low as the US continues its recovery from the recession of a decade ago. But Mr Trump's average job approval is jammed at 40%, according to Real Clear Politics. Massachusetts congressman Joseph Kennedy III, a great-nephew of President John F Kennedy, delivered the Democratic rebuttal. He attempted to seize Mr Trump's political mantle by purporting to speak for ""Americans who feel forgotten and forsaken"". This video can not be played Democratic congressman Joseph Kennedy III said he was speaking for all Americans Bewailing a ""fractured country"" and depicting the Trump presidency as ""chaos"", Mr Kennedy, 37, said: ""Many have spent the past year anxious, angry, afraid."" ""Bullies may land a punch,"" he said. ""They might leave a mark. ""But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defence of their future."" A new Kennedy in the political spotlight In one telling moment from Mr Trump's speech, members of the Democratic Congressional Black Caucus sat in stony-faced silence amid a standing ovation as the president noted African-American unemployment has hit a record low. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said Mr Trump's appeal for unity, after a year of ""divisive actions, petty insults and disgraceful race-baiting... ring hollow"". About a dozen Democratic lawmakers said they would boycott this State of the Union. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News You can tell a lot about a State of the Union address by where a president chooses to begin. On Tuesday night, Donald Trump delivered a polished speech that started by touting his economic record. Lower unemployment. Restored consumer and business confidence. A higher stock market. Mr Trump's poll numbers have lagged below the mark one would expect a leader presiding over a prosperous economy. The president, in his speech, set about trying to change that. When it came to policy, Mr Trump offered some bipartisan suggestions with few details, such as addressing high prescription drug prices, infrastructure investment, job training and prison reform. Where the president lingered, however, were on topics that will prove as divisive as ever. The paeans to patriotism and traditional values will be viewed by Democrats as a rekindling of culture wars. He spoke of religious liberty and standing for the national anthem, and Democrats sat stone-faced. The president's pledge to offer an open hand on immigration negotiations was surrounded by extended passages about immigrant crime and a veiled swipe that ""Americans are dreamers, too"". This speech had a softer touch. The language was smooth. The edge, however, was still as sharp. Read more of Anthony's analysis of the speech Trump calls for unity but divides media Mr Trump condemned ""depraved"" North Korea. He warned that Pyongyang's ""reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. ""We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening."" Mr Trump paid tribute to a disabled defector from the regime, Ji Seong-ho, who fled the country on crutches and was in the audience. Harrowing tale of Trump's North Korean defector The president also noted that nearly all the territory in Syria and Iraq once controlled by the Islamic State group has been retaken. ""We will continue our fight until [the Islamic State group] is defeated,"" Mr Trump vowed. While his two White House predecessors have used their State of the Union speeches to forecast victory for American forces in Afghanistan, Mr Trump largely skirted what is now America's longest war. In an apparent acknowledgment ofthe deteriorating security situationthere, he said the US ""military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines"". He only mentioned Russia once alongside China as a rival. Mr Trump did not refer to the federal inquiry into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, a controversy that is dogging his presidency and which both he and Russia have denied.

Ministers agree to show MPs Brexit report,"Brexit minister Robin Walker made the announcement in Parliament Leaked studies on the economic impact of Brexit will be made available to MPs to read, ministers have said. No 10 said it would allow MPs and peers to see the report on a confidential basis after a Commons debate. Ministers decided not to oppose a Labour motion urging its publication, amid signs they would lose the vote. The leaked study suggests that in three different scenarios the UK economy would grow more slowly than it would if it stayed in the European Union The government had previously argued that the document's immediate publication could damage UK negotiations with the EU. Theresa May earlier told reporters en route to China, where she is on a trade mission, that making the analysis public before it was fully completed would be ""wrong"". The key Brexit dates in 2018 EU sets out Brexit transition demands But with the government facing potential defeat in the vote on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit minister Robin Walker told MPs a copy of the report would be given to Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Commons Brexit committee. He added: ""And a confidential reading room can be provided for other MPs and peers a copy of this analysis to view the material on a confidential basis. This will happen only when arrangements can be made."" The minister did not clearly specify a timeframe on when these arrangements can be made. Labour have called for the report to be released since details of its existence first emerged in a Buzzfeed article on Monday. Several Tories also said the material should be made public. Former Chancellor Ken Clarke, a leading supporter of a soft Brexit in which the UK maintains existing links with the EU, said there was a ""rather curious cult of secrecy"" around the government's approach to the issue. Sir Keir Starmer says ministers cannot sideline Parliament to hide their party's ""deep divisions"" ""A leak is a very serious matter and I deplore leaks when documents are revealed whose contents compromise the national interest, or are loaded with party political or other significance,"" he said. ""But an objective analysis of the economic consequences of various options which the government is at the moment looking at and considering, it's impossible to see how that compromises the national interest. ""A properly open government should make that sort of information freely available to all those, including MPs, with a legitimate interest in the subject."" Tory MP Anna Soubry suggested it was a ""farce"" for the document to be released confidentially for only a few hundred people to see when it was likely to end up all over the internet. She said ministers must get a grip on the EU negotiations, warning of ""a collective outbreak in the government of a form of madness"". Speaking before the government concession was announced, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament was entitled to know the likely impact of the government's approach and to hold it to account. ""What we need now from the government is clarity about when the documents will be handed over and a guarantee they will be so in an unedited and unredacted form,"" he said. I'm not a quitter, says Theresa May Theresa May responds to her detractors Calls to publish Brexit study rejected May announces education deals with China Kuenssberg: Foreign adventures cannot obscure May's Brexit backdrop May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers What happens now that a deal's been done?

Children's hospital deaths were avoidable,"Adam Strain, Raychel Ferguson, Claire Roberts and Conor Mitchell. Lucy Crawford's family chose not to release a photograph An inquiry into the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland's hospitals has found that four of them were avoidable. The findings followed a 14-year inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths. Who were the children? Timeline of hyponatraemia inquiry Hyponatraemia is a medical condition that occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream. Thedamning report was heavily critical of the ""self-regulating and unmonitored"" health service.,external The Belfast, Southern and Western health trusts said they ""unreservedly apologise"" to the five families. This video can not be played Mr Justice O'Hara calls on medical professionals to put the public interest first. Mr Justice O'Hara was scathing of how the families were treated in the aftermath of the deaths and also of the evidence given to the inquiry by medical professionals. He said that ""doctors and managers cannot be relied on to do the right thing at the right time"" and that they had to put the public interest before their own reputation. He also said that some witnesses to the inquiry ""had to have the truth dragged out of them"". This video can not be played Jennifer Roberts speaks about the death of her daughter, Claire The inquiry was set up in 2004 to investigate the deaths of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts, Raychel Ferguson, Lucy Crawford and Conor Mitchell. The chairman said that the deaths of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts and Raychel Ferguson were the result of ""negligent care"". The inquiry's report has made 96 recommendations In his report, Mr Justice O'Hara found that: while investigating the death of Adam Strain, the inquiry had been met with ""defensiveness and deceit"" and that ""information was withheld"" about what happened to Adam in the operating theatre there ""was a cover up"" in the death of Claire Roberts, whose death was not referred to the coroner immediately to ""avoid scrutiny"" poor care was ""deliberately concealed"" in the death of Lucy Crawford there was a ""reluctance among clinicians to openly acknowledge failings"" in the death of Raychel Ferguson in the death of Conor Mitchell, there was a ""potentially dangerous variation in care and treatment afforded to young people at Craigavon Hospital"" In total, the inquiry made 96 recommendations including the establishment of a duty of candour on medical professionals ""to tell patients and their families about major failures in care and to give a full and honest explanation"". This video can not be played The chair of the hyponatraemia inquiry believes evidence was withheld about Adam Strain's death Mr Justice O'Hara added that the ""reticence of some clinicians and healthcare professionals to concede error or identify underperformance or colleagues was frustrating and depressing"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, said that the inquiry was ""confirmation of what we knew happened"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, during the delivery of Mr Justice O'Hara's findings ""She went into hospital as a young, healthy girl and was neglected by the nurses, neglected by the doctors and, ultimately, died because of the negligence of those we consider health professionals."" Mrs Ferguson added that she had been devoted to finding the truth and ""what I experienced during this journey is inexcusable"". ""The trust and their lawyers abused their position by trying to cover up the truth. They robbed me of the most precious wee girl,"" she said. ""For hospital medical staff to make a mistake is forgivable, however, to orchestrate a cover-up and to deliberately mislead is totally unforgivable."" The family of Conor Mitchell said medical staff had ""failed Conor so badly"". ""The reticence with which the investigation has been handled by the trust and their advisers and the grudging way in which the limited acceptance of failings and minimal apology given were extracted, indicates a reluctance on their part to undertake the learning and the change in attitude needed to reduce the trauma caused in cases such as these,"" they said. by Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondent There was a real sense of regret, here, that for these five families, life should have been very, very different. The report spans three volumes of almost 700 pages and, while each case is treated separately, overall the chairman refers to a catalogue of failings, where in most cases shortcomings were evident from the outset. Sometimes with a great deal of emotion, Mr Justice O'Hara talked about the lack of professional candour, not just among clinicians but also by some managers. There was a tremendous sense of grief and anger in the room. The mothers of Raychel Ferguson and Claire Roberts sat in the front row and sobbed throughout the chairman's findings. A spokesperson for the Belfast, Western and Southern trusts said they would ""urgently review"" the recommendations to ""ensure that all possible steps have been taken to prevent this ever happening again"". ""We made mistakes, we were not as open and transparent as we could, and should have been, and opportunities to learn from each other to make our care safer were missed - for this we are truly sorry. This video can not be played Marie Ferguson said her daughter Raychel's death ""destroyed me"" ""Since these tragic deaths occurred significant lessons have been learned in how we safely manage fluids in children and many improvements have been put in place."" Cathy Jack, the medical director at the Belfast Health Trust, said all three trusts would comply with any individual rulings that might arise from the General Medical Council and added that, on a personal level, she was ashamed. The Health and Social Care Board said: ""Whilst we fully accept that it is cold comfort to the families, since the incidents leading to these tragic deaths, a number of significant changes have taken place within the wider health and social care system. ""A lot of work has gone into ensuring that when things do go wrong, incidents are reported, robust action is taken, families are engaged, and relevant learning is shared and disseminated."" The Department of Health said the ""thoughts of everyone"" were with the families of the children and it was ""deeply sorry for the distress, hurt and loss suffered by the families"". ""The inquiry report acknowledges the work that has been undertaken to address serious, past failings and provide safe and accountable care in future,"" it added. ""That vital work will continue, informed by the findings and recommendations of the inquiry report."" General Medical Council chief executive Charlie Massey said: ""The inquiry raised some serious concerns - we will analyse these to identify any new evidence it has brought to light in relation to the cases considered. ""The GMC supports the introduction of a statutory duty of candour. ""It's vital that doctors and all other professionals are open and honest with patients and employers."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it noted the report into the inquiry had been published and would ""take time to carefully assess its contents before deciding what action needs to be taken"". The hyponatraemia inquiry has been dogged by repeated delays and adjournments. The first witness was not called until April 2012 and it stopped taking evidence in November 2013. A total of 106 doctors and other medical professionals gave evidence and 179 witnesses were called. Fifty lawyers were involved, representing the inquiry, the families and the health trusts. Initial reports suggest the inquiry cost Â£13.5m, but that figure is expected to rise.

The phenomenon has been seen around the world, including by Abdur Rahman Yassin, who took this photo in Singapore. A blue moon occurs when a full moon happens twice in one calendar month, and a supermoon occurs when the Moon is closest to the Earth. Pictured here in Myanmar. It has been seen in the western hemisphere, such as here in New York, for the first time in more than 150 years. The moon pictured setting behind the downtown skyline of San Francisco, on the US west coast. This close-up of the moon was taken in Jakarta, Indonesia. This red glow is produced by the same effect that gives us red sunsets. Sunlight is skimming through the Earth's atmosphere on its way to the Moon and it gets refracted or bent. The blue light is then filtered out, leaving the red light visible, like here in Anaheim, California. The super blue blood moon was also pictured in Svalbard, Norway. The supermoon was pictured rising behind St Paul's Cathedral in London. This shot was taken by photographer Danny Lawson, in Hull in the United Kingdom.

Children's hospital deaths were avoidableA 14-year inquiry into the deaths of five children delivers damning criticism of medical professionals.,"Adam Strain, Raychel Ferguson, Claire Roberts and Conor Mitchell. Lucy Crawford's family chose not to release a photograph An inquiry into the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland's hospitals has found that four of them were avoidable. The findings followed a 14-year inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths. Who were the children? Timeline of hyponatraemia inquiry Hyponatraemia is a medical condition that occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream. Thedamning report was heavily critical of the ""self-regulating and unmonitored"" health service.,external The Belfast, Southern and Western health trusts said they ""unreservedly apologise"" to the five families. This video can not be played Mr Justice O'Hara calls on medical professionals to put the public interest first. Mr Justice O'Hara was scathing of how the families were treated in the aftermath of the deaths and also of the evidence given to the inquiry by medical professionals. He said that ""doctors and managers cannot be relied on to do the right thing at the right time"" and that they had to put the public interest before their own reputation. He also said that some witnesses to the inquiry ""had to have the truth dragged out of them"". This video can not be played Jennifer Roberts speaks about the death of her daughter, Claire The inquiry was set up in 2004 to investigate the deaths of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts, Raychel Ferguson, Lucy Crawford and Conor Mitchell. The chairman said that the deaths of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts and Raychel Ferguson were the result of ""negligent care"". The inquiry's report has made 96 recommendations In his report, Mr Justice O'Hara found that: while investigating the death of Adam Strain, the inquiry had been met with ""defensiveness and deceit"" and that ""information was withheld"" about what happened to Adam in the operating theatre there ""was a cover up"" in the death of Claire Roberts, whose death was not referred to the coroner immediately to ""avoid scrutiny"" poor care was ""deliberately concealed"" in the death of Lucy Crawford there was a ""reluctance among clinicians to openly acknowledge failings"" in the death of Raychel Ferguson in the death of Conor Mitchell, there was a ""potentially dangerous variation in care and treatment afforded to young people at Craigavon Hospital"" In total, the inquiry made 96 recommendations including the establishment of a duty of candour on medical professionals ""to tell patients and their families about major failures in care and to give a full and honest explanation"". This video can not be played The chair of the hyponatraemia inquiry believes evidence was withheld about Adam Strain's death Mr Justice O'Hara added that the ""reticence of some clinicians and healthcare professionals to concede error or identify underperformance or colleagues was frustrating and depressing"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, said that the inquiry was ""confirmation of what we knew happened"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, during the delivery of Mr Justice O'Hara's findings ""She went into hospital as a young, healthy girl and was neglected by the nurses, neglected by the doctors and, ultimately, died because of the negligence of those we consider health professionals."" Mrs Ferguson added that she had been devoted to finding the truth and ""what I experienced during this journey is inexcusable"". ""The trust and their lawyers abused their position by trying to cover up the truth. They robbed me of the most precious wee girl,"" she said. ""For hospital medical staff to make a mistake is forgivable, however, to orchestrate a cover-up and to deliberately mislead is totally unforgivable."" The family of Conor Mitchell said medical staff had ""failed Conor so badly"". ""The reticence with which the investigation has been handled by the trust and their advisers and the grudging way in which the limited acceptance of failings and minimal apology given were extracted, indicates a reluctance on their part to undertake the learning and the change in attitude needed to reduce the trauma caused in cases such as these,"" they said. by Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondent There was a real sense of regret, here, that for these five families, life should have been very, very different. The report spans three volumes of almost 700 pages and, while each case is treated separately, overall the chairman refers to a catalogue of failings, where in most cases shortcomings were evident from the outset. Sometimes with a great deal of emotion, Mr Justice O'Hara talked about the lack of professional candour, not just among clinicians but also by some managers. There was a tremendous sense of grief and anger in the room. The mothers of Raychel Ferguson and Claire Roberts sat in the front row and sobbed throughout the chairman's findings. A spokesperson for the Belfast, Western and Southern trusts said they would ""urgently review"" the recommendations to ""ensure that all possible steps have been taken to prevent this ever happening again"". ""We made mistakes, we were not as open and transparent as we could, and should have been, and opportunities to learn from each other to make our care safer were missed - for this we are truly sorry. This video can not be played Marie Ferguson said her daughter Raychel's death ""destroyed me"" ""Since these tragic deaths occurred significant lessons have been learned in how we safely manage fluids in children and many improvements have been put in place."" Cathy Jack, the medical director at the Belfast Health Trust, said all three trusts would comply with any individual rulings that might arise from the General Medical Council and added that, on a personal level, she was ashamed. The Health and Social Care Board said: ""Whilst we fully accept that it is cold comfort to the families, since the incidents leading to these tragic deaths, a number of significant changes have taken place within the wider health and social care system. ""A lot of work has gone into ensuring that when things do go wrong, incidents are reported, robust action is taken, families are engaged, and relevant learning is shared and disseminated."" The Department of Health said the ""thoughts of everyone"" were with the families of the children and it was ""deeply sorry for the distress, hurt and loss suffered by the families"". ""The inquiry report acknowledges the work that has been undertaken to address serious, past failings and provide safe and accountable care in future,"" it added. ""That vital work will continue, informed by the findings and recommendations of the inquiry report."" General Medical Council chief executive Charlie Massey said: ""The inquiry raised some serious concerns - we will analyse these to identify any new evidence it has brought to light in relation to the cases considered. ""The GMC supports the introduction of a statutory duty of candour. ""It's vital that doctors and all other professionals are open and honest with patients and employers."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it noted the report into the inquiry had been published and would ""take time to carefully assess its contents before deciding what action needs to be taken"". The hyponatraemia inquiry has been dogged by repeated delays and adjournments. The first witness was not called until April 2012 and it stopped taking evidence in November 2013. A total of 106 doctors and other medical professionals gave evidence and 179 witnesses were called. Fifty lawyers were involved, representing the inquiry, the families and the health trusts. Initial reports suggest the inquiry cost Â£13.5m, but that figure is expected to rise.

Coroner to challenge pub bombs rulingFamilies of the 21 victims of the Birmingham pub bombings want suspects to be named in new inquests.2h2 hours agoBirmingham & Black Country,"Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 A coroner is to appeal against a ruling to name suspects of the Birmingham pub bombings in new inquests. Twenty-one people died when two bombsexploded in the city centre in 1974. Last week, two High Court judges ruled that coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC was wrong to decide that the names of the suspects would not be part of new inquests for the victims. A spokesman for the inquests said the coroner will apply for permission to appeal against this judgement. Midlands Live: Ex-Crewe Alex coach denies sex offences; Mylee Billingham: Police wait to question father Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the attack, said: ""It is disappointing to say the least."" Sir Peter had decided in July that the names of the alleged perpetrators would not be part of the framework of new inquests. But at a hearing at Birmingham Justice Centre on Friday, he was ordered to reconsider this decision, following a judicial review. Mrs Justice Carr and Lord Justice Simon said they were ""minded to quash the coroner's decision which excluded the perpetrator issue and remit the case so as to enable him to reconsider the decision"". Birmingham Inquests,externalsaid it will call for the issue to be looked at again. Analysis: Phil Mackie, BBC News The families will be fuming because they feel that whenever they negotiate one hurdle another is put in their way. They won the campaign to have the inquests resumed; they got the law changed to allow them to claim back the costs of their Northern Irish solicitors and then won the judicial review. After the latest success I spoke to Brian Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed, and asked him why he wasn't celebrating - he told me that there'd be another twist before the inquests can resume. It's going to mean further delays to the hearing which was originally scheduled to start last September, and may not get underway until this autumn. Ms Hambleton said: ""All this just adds further delay and more anxiety, especially regarding legal aid. ""We are in a situation where we are forced to go out on the streets and beg to be able to fund the legal process to get truth, justice and accountability on one the biggest unsolved mass murder of the 20th century."" Justice4the21, the main campaign group representing many of the relatives, had said they would ""no longer participate"" in the hearings following the coroner's decision in July last year. Relatives had argued the inquests could not take place without naming suspects, while their lawyers said discussing potential perpetrators ""is central to the case"". In a statement from the coroner, it said: ""In the circumstances, the coroner considers that legal issues raised in the High Court judgment require reconsideration and clarification and he now intends to seek permission to appeal the judgment to the Court of Appeal. ""All of the interested persons in the inquests, including the families, have been informed of the coroner's decision to seek permission to appeal."" The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened A pre-inquest review, which had been listed for 22 February, will now be postponed. The latest decision will also mean further financial struggles for the families, who fundraised Â£40,000 to pay for the judicial review after they were refused legal by the Ministry of Justice which said the bid did not meet strict criteria. Christopher Stanley of KRW, which represents the families added: ""There was always a possibility that the coroner would seek to appeal the judgement against his decision on perpetrators. ""There are important points of law in this matter. That does not detract from the disappointment of our clients with his decision. ""Whether a cross-appeal is lodged will depend on a number of factors."" Original inquests were held days after the bombings but closed without any evidence being heard The victims' families have fought for years to have the inquests reopened. Hearings were held days after the bombings but closed without hearing any evidence. No one has been charged with the attacks since six men were freed from prison in 1991. Previously, self-confessed IRA bomb maker Michael Hayes said he was part of the group responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings. He told the BBC he defused a third explosive in Birminghamand accepts ""collective responsibility"" for all of the group's actions.

'Roman haul' turns out to be TV prop,"Paul Adams and Andy Sampson have only been metal detecting for a year Two men who thought they had unearthed a stash of Roman gold coins had their dreams dashed when they discovered the coins were a prop for a TV sitcom. Andy Sampson and Paul Adams had been metal detecting in a field on the Suffolk/Essex border when they found more than 50 ""gold"" coins with pottery. Mr Sampson said his friend started ""shouting and jumping around and dancing"" after he found the ""treasure"". However, it emerged the fake coins were a prop for the BBC show Detectorists. Mr Sampson said the pair, who have only been metal detecting for a year, had spotted the farmer ploughing the field last summer, and got his permission to go out one evening to check it out. The gold coins were part of a scene being filmed for the BBC TV series Detectorists ""Paul kept running at me shouting, 'Roman gold!' and I thought, 'he's winding me up',"" he said. ""He was floating across the top of the field rather than running through it. I wish I'd had a camera."" The pair went back to the furrow and found more than 50 gold coins with pottery, which they believed at the time could have been worth up to Â£250,000. Mr Sampson said he immediately began working out how he would spend the money, with plans including paying off the mortgage, buying a new car and going on the trip of a lifetime. Rail passenger wakes to find Â£100 gift Stranger pays for 'humbled' medic's fuel Thousands of birds join murmuration However, he took the find back home and showed it to his neighbour, who was less enthusiastic about it. Mr Sampson said his neighbour picked up the coins and immediately said ""they're not real - there's something wrong with them"". The pair made some inquiries and found out the farm was being used as a filming location during the summer for BBC Four comedy Detectorists, which stars Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones. It emerged the production crew had filmed a tractor pulling a plough through the ground, unearthing the coins as it went. However, Mr Sampson said, ""it had buried some as well"", and they were the ones they found. The men said they had finally ""got over"" their huge disappointment and it had not put them off the hobby.

'Lonely' librarian jailed over book thefts,"Elizabeth Macregor stole hundreds of titles A librarian stole books from her workplace - including one on the Aberfan disaster - and tried to sell them online for up to Â£400. Elizabeth Macregor, 57, burned several books in a bid to escape justice. Macregor, of Hirwaun, stole hundreds of books from Pontypridd Library in Rhondda Cynon Taff. She was jailed for eight months at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court after being found guilty of two counts of theft and perverting the course of justice. Her employers noticed books had started to go missing and Macregor was suspected of being the culprit. A police investigation found some of the missing titles on sale on her eBay account, including the book Aberfan - A Disaster and its Aftermath by Joan Miller which she tried to sell for Â£400. Rare books 'Tome Raider' thief jailed Â£40,000 rare Harry Potter novel stolen Bible thief returns book after 42 years Macregor had ""low social interaction"" for many years, the court heard When officers searched her home, several hundred books were recovered - some were fire damaged after Macregor had tried to burn them and others were found in her green recycling bin. She claimed to have bought them from various libraries which had sold them as excess stock. Judge Richard Twomlow said Macregor told the jury ""a catalogue of ridiculous lies"" during her trial. Kathryn Lane, defending, described Macregor as a ""lonely individual"" who had suffered from a number of mental and physical health problems. Since being sacked by the library service, Macregor had found a new job at Public Health Wales, she said. The court heard this book was used in research for TV programmes marking the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster Sentencing her, Judge Twomlow said she had stolen from her employer in a ""calculating and careful way"". He described the book on Aberfan as ""more valuable in historic and cultural terms than financial"". The judge said the book was ""mercifully"" relatively undamaged and had been restored. Macregor was given six months in prison for each of the thefts - to be served concurrently - and two months for perverting the course of justice, which will be served consecutively. Richard Killick, senior prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Any matter involving a breach of trust is very serious. ""In this case, however, it was twofold in that Macregor breached the trust of her employer and that of the community she served.""

Ministers agree to publish Brexit report,"Brexit minister Robin Walker made the announcement in Parliament Leaked studies on the economic impact of Brexit will be made available to MPs to read, ministers have said. No 10 said it would allow MPs and peers to see the report on a confidential basis after a Commons debate. Ministers decided not to oppose a Labour motion urging its publication, amid signs they would lose the vote. The leaked study suggests that in three different scenarios the UK economy would grow more slowly than it would if it stayed in the European Union The government had previously argued that the document's immediate publication could damage UK negotiations with the EU. Theresa May earlier told reporters en route to China, where she is on a trade mission, that making the analysis public before it was fully completed would be ""wrong"". The key Brexit dates in 2018 EU sets out Brexit transition demands But with the government facing potential defeat in the vote on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit minister Robin Walker told MPs a copy of the report would be given to Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Commons Brexit committee. He added: ""And a confidential reading room can be provided for other MPs and peers a copy of this analysis to view the material on a confidential basis. This will happen only when arrangements can be made."" The minister did not clearly specify a timeframe on when these arrangements can be made. Labour have called for the report to be released since details of its existence first emerged in a Buzzfeed article on Monday. Several Tories also said the material should be made public. Former Chancellor Ken Clarke, a leading supporter of a soft Brexit in which the UK maintains existing links with the EU, said there was a ""rather curious cult of secrecy"" around the government's approach to the issue. Sir Keir Starmer says ministers cannot sideline Parliament to hide their party's ""deep divisions"" ""A leak is a very serious matter and I deplore leaks when documents are revealed whose contents compromise the national interest, or are loaded with party political or other significance,"" he said. ""But an objective analysis of the economic consequences of various options which the government is at the moment looking at and considering, it's impossible to see how that compromises the national interest. ""A properly open government should make that sort of information freely available to all those, including MPs, with a legitimate interest in the subject."" Tory MP Anna Soubry suggested it was a ""farce"" for the document to be released confidentially for only a few hundred people to see when it was likely to end up all over the internet. She said ministers must get a grip on the EU negotiations, warning of ""a collective outbreak in the government of a form of madness"". Speaking before the government concession was announced, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament was entitled to know the likely impact of the government's approach and to hold it to account. ""What we need now from the government is clarity about when the documents will be handed over and a guarantee they will be so in an unedited and unredacted form,"" he said. I'm not a quitter, says Theresa May Theresa May responds to her detractors Calls to publish Brexit study rejected May announces education deals with China Kuenssberg: Foreign adventures cannot obscure May's Brexit backdrop May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers What happens now that a deal's been done?

Twenty-one people died when two bombsexploded in the city centre in 1974. Last week, two High Court judges ruled that coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC was wrong to decide that the names of the suspects would not be part of new inquests for the victims. A spokesman for the inquests said the coroner will apply for permission to appeal against this judgement. Midlands Live: Ex-Crewe Alex coach denies sex offences; Mylee Billingham: Police wait to question father Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the attack, said: ""It is disappointing to say the least."" Sir Peter had decided in July that the names of the alleged perpetrators would not be part of the framework of new inquests. But at a hearing at Birmingham Justice Centre on Friday, he was ordered to reconsider this decision, following a judicial review. Mrs Justice Carr and Lord Justice Simon said they were ""minded to quash the coroner's decision which excluded the perpetrator issue and remit the case so as to enable him to reconsider the decision"". Birmingham Inquests,externalsaid it will call for the issue to be looked at again. Analysis: Phil Mackie, BBC News The families will be fuming because they feel that whenever they negotiate one hurdle another is put in their way. They won the campaign to have the inquests resumed; they got the law changed to allow them to claim back the costs of their Northern Irish solicitors and then won the judicial review. After the latest success I spoke to Brian Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed, and asked him why he wasn't celebrating - he told me that there'd be another twist before the inquests can resume. It's going to mean further delays to the hearing which was originally scheduled to start last September, and may not get underway until this autumn. Ms Hambleton said: ""All this just adds further delay and more anxiety, especially regarding legal aid. ""We are in a situation where we are forced to go out on the streets and beg to be able to fund the legal process to get truth, justice and accountability on one the biggest unsolved mass murder of the 20th century."" Justice4the21, the main campaign group representing many of the relatives, had said they would ""no longer participate"" in the hearings following the coroner's decision in July last year. Relatives had argued the inquests could not take place without naming suspects, while their lawyers said discussing potential perpetrators ""is central to the case"". In a statement from the coroner, it said: ""In the circumstances, the coroner considers that legal issues raised in the High Court judgment require reconsideration and clarification and he now intends to seek permission to appeal the judgment to the Court of Appeal. ""All of the interested persons in the inquests, including the families, have been informed of the coroner's decision to seek permission to appeal."" The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened A pre-inquest review, which had been listed for 22 February, will now be postponed. The latest decision will also mean further financial struggles for the families, who fundraised Â£40,000 to pay for the judicial review after they were refused legal by the Ministry of Justice which said the bid did not meet strict criteria. Christopher Stanley of KRW, which represents the families added: ""There was always a possibility that the coroner would seek to appeal the judgement against his decision on perpetrators. ""There are important points of law in this matter. That does not detract from the disappointment of our clients with his decision. ""Whether a cross-appeal is lodged will depend on a number of factors."" Original inquests were held days after the bombings but closed without any evidence being heard The victims' families have fought for years to have the inquests reopened. Hearings were held days after the bombings but closed without hearing any evidence. No one has been charged with the attacks since six men were freed from prison in 1991. Previously, self-confessed IRA bomb maker Michael Hayes said he was part of the group responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings. He told the BBC he defused a third explosive in Birminghamand accepts ""collective responsibility"" for all of the group's actions.

Carrie Gracie speaks of BBC pay 'insult',"This video can not be played Carrie Gracie: ""If they don't report the truth how can we?"" Former BBC China editor Carrie Gracie has said she is ""very angry"" about the way the BBC has treated some female members of staff. The presenter, who resigned from her post earlier this month in protest at pay inequality, was giving evidence to a committee of MPs. Gracie said she felt the BBC's response to her grievance was ""an insult"". Director general Tony Hall said the BBC ""got some things wrong"", but added that he ""admired her courage"". He insisted the BBC's system for dealing with pay complaints was ""working"" and equality was ""at the core of what we stand for"" but faced claims from one MP that the broadcaster was in ""meltdown"" over the issue. They were giving evidence to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. How the BBC gender pay story has unfolded Gracie, 55, who has worked for the BBC for more than 30 years, said a grievance process over pay concluded that the reason she was paid less than male counterparts was that she had been deemed to be ""in development"". She said that justification was ""an insult to add to the original injury"", adding: ""It is unacceptable to talk to your senior women like that. ""I would never have gone to China on those terms. I asked for equal pay at the very beginning."" In emotional testimony, the presenter also said she had found the grievance process ""very painful"". She spoke about the ""strain of being in conflict"" and that, in the process, managers had attempted to ""to crush your self esteem about your work"". A reviewpublished on Tuesday said there was ""no evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making"" at the BBC. But the review, conducted by auditors PwC, was rejected by BBC Women, which represents almost 200 staff members. The issue has been in the headlines since last summer, when the BBC published a list of presenters who earn more than Â£150,000 per year, revealing a gap in the earnings of its best-known male and female presenters and actors. This video can not be played Carrie Gracie: ""I really feel angry about some of the things I have seen and heard"". Referring to other female staff members who had told her about similar grievance experiences, she said: ""I feel very angry about what they put some other people through. ""I really feel angry about some of the things I've seen and heard and some of the women and the suffering they've gone through."" Gracie was appointed China editor in 2013 but stepped down in early January, saying she was dismayed to discover the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than their two female counterparts. The presenter said the BBC had offered to pay her Â£100,000 in back pay after the inequality came to light - but said the offer ""sounds like a tacit admission of pay discrimination"". Reality Check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem? She told the MPs: ""The thing that's very unacceptable to meâ¦ it [the BBC] basically said in those three previous years - 2014, 2015 and 2016 - I was 'in development'."" Gracie criticised the way BBC executives had handled her situation, saying their stance was ""damaging the credibility of the BBC in a completely unacceptable way"". She said: ""We're not in the business of producing toothpaste or tyres at the BBC. Our business is truth. We can't operate without the truth. ""If we're not prepared to look at ourselves honestly, how can we be trusted to look at anything else in reporting honestly?"" Gracie is returning to a job in the BBC newsroom. She said: ""I could leave the BBC tomorrow and get a better paid job. I don't want to leave it in this state. It is in deep trouble and we need to sort it out and I need to be there alongside the other great BBC women, helping the BBC to sort it out."" This video can not be played Tony Hall: ""Yes there were management failings"" Director general Tony Hall and other BBC executives also spoke at the committee hearing. Lord Hall said: ""The result of the grievance which she described to you did say very clearly that we had got some things wrong. I would that we hadn't got things wrong but we did."" The director general said Gracie had done ""first rate work for the BBC"" and added: ""I don't want to undermine in any way the work she has done."" He added the ""domination of men"" in highly paid positions was wrong and the BBC is working to resolve that. Lord Hall told the committee that pay ""should not be a matter of gender - completely agree, outrageous if it was"". But he added that it was legitimate to have a ""pecking order"" between editors in the pay scale. Lord Hall said: ""I don't believe there is an old boys network, I believe in equality of opportunity. ""Wherever I can, properly, we have been trying to appoint women to key roles at the BBC - key roles in news, key roles as correspondents and reporters in news."" He added: ""The idea of some old boys club, I abhor. That is not the way I believe that BBC should be or is."" At one point, BBC chairman Sir David Clementi turned round in his seat and apologised to Gracie, who was sitting behind him, for the mistakes the corporation had made. He later told Conservative MP Julian Knight it was clear the BBC made a ""number of errors"" during the grievance process. ""I apologise for what she has been through,"" he said. ""I recognise for individuals concerned how stressful these occasions are, they are stressful for us but it must be much more so for her. I'm actually very sorry."" BBC head of news Fran Unsworth said that when Gracie was appointed as China editor, her salary was actually higher than that of the Middle East and North America editors. ""At the time that we set Carrie's pay in that role, there was no issue around gender at all,"" she said. However, after Gracie's appointment, Jon Sopel was hired to be the new North America editor. ""Jon Sopel came with a different pay history,"" she said. ""He had been a BBC One presenter, he had been a presenter on World News. He was a former political editor of the News Channel. He was a former Paris correspondent. And he had accumulated a much higher salary than Carrie was on at the time as a presenter of the News Channel. And we did not cut his pay in asking him to go to North America."" The North America editor was on air ""twice as much in peak time - and that is at a busy time in the China story"", she explained. She added: ""It's a different job, the China job. It's a more features-based agenda, it's not on the relentless treadmill that something like the North America editor's job is."" She also insisted she had never described Ms Gracie's role as ""part-time"" but said she had apologised to the journalist at the time if her language was ""loose"" and had given that impression. Lord Hall added it was ""a mistake not to review Carrie Gracie's pay when the new North America editor was put in place"". Razia Iqbal, Samira Ahmed, Kate Silverton and Kate Adie all supported Gracie A number of female BBC presenters, including Kate Adie, Mariella Frostrup, Kate Silverton, Louise Minchin and Naga Munchetty, were in Westminster to support Gracie. As Gracie spoke, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman was among those to tweet their support for the presenter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gracie also said she had received more than 500 supportive emails from members of the public since her resignation, and 300 from BBC staff. Carrie Gracie's testimony to the DCMS select committee contains several revelations. These include her rejection of back pay close to Â£100,000, and the fact that the BBC's letter to her about her grievance said she was ""in development."" Without seeing the letter in full, it's impossible to know the context, of course, but it seems a sloppy choice of words. Revealing that she twice had breast cancer, recently suffered a family bereavement, and that her daughter had leukaemia, Gracie detailed the very difficult personal circumstances that she has endured during the recent stages of her career. Her explanation that she spent 214 days in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan last year counters several reports in the media, and Gracie specifically expressed disappointment at negative briefing against her which she believes originates in the corporation. Several times, Gracie made clear that she believes she is very lucky to work at the BBC, and cast ""BBC Management"" as a ""fortress"" often acting against the interests of BBC men and women. The BBC Women campaign group is now up to 190 at least, she said. And she produced a number of memorable phrases that have already been widely picked up on social media. Perhaps her strongest line was the claim that the BBC doesn't trade in toothpaste, it trades in truth. The implied allegation that it has been less than honest has the power to hurt an organisation founded on principles of public service.

Capita shares plunge on profit warning,"Capita shares have plunged almost 50% after the outsourcing firm warned on profits and announced a major shake-up. New chief executive Jonathan Lewis said the company had become ""too complex"" and ""driven by a short-term focus"" and needed to change its approach. Capita, which issued a series of profit warnings last year, has again cut its profit forecast and revealed plans to raise Â£700m by issuing new shares. The move comes after outsourcing rival Carillion collapsed earlier this month. Capita operates the London congestion charge, runs the government's Jobseekers Allowance helpline and administers the teachers' pension scheme. It also collects the TV licence fee on behalf of the BBC. Shares ended the day 47% lower at 182.5p, prompting calls from Labour and trade unions for urgent government action to avoid ""another Carillion"". A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said as a ""strategic supplier"" Capita was always monitored by the government. The firm employs 70,000 people, about 50,000 of whom are in the UK. According to Tussell, a firm which analyses UK public sector contracts, Capita won 154 government contracts last year. Mr Lewis, who took over two months ago, said a review had found the company worked across too many markets and services, meaning it was difficult to ""maintain a competitive advantage"" in every business. Capita had relied too much on acquisitions to drive growth and had also seen weakness in new contracts, he added. The company does have some financial strengths. It can call on Â£1bn in cash and credit facilities, has a significantly higher profit margin than Carillion did and has been taking steps to reduce its debt burden. If Carillion had made an announcement like this a few years ago - raising money to pay off debt, admitting a slow-down in the market, owning up to both underinvestment and an over-reliance on buying other companies to find growth - then it might still be with us now. Instead, Capita's new boss, Jonathan Lewis, has decided to take evasive action early. Chief executives are normally afforded only one chance to hit the reset button in their time at the top, and the smart ones take it early, and hit the button hard. That is what Mr Lewis has done. By taking harsh financial medicine now he has probably ensured that the company does not suffer Carillion's fate. Mr Lewis plans a wide-ranging overhaul including cost cutting, selling unprofitable businesses and cutting the dividend to shareholders. Annual profits are now expected to be between Â£270m and Â£300m - well below analyst expectations of Â£400m. In a conference call Mr Lewis said there was ""much to be done"", but Wednesday's announcements were the ""first steps on the road to recovery"". Neil Wilson, senior analyst at ETX, said signs of problems had been building at the firm, including the loss of ""a lucrative and profitable contract with the Prudential"" in January. Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, urged the government to ""take serious steps"" to oversee the activities of Capita, pointing out that it was the third major outsourcing company after Carillion and Interserve to issue a profit warning in the past month. Capita is audited by KPMG, the same accountancy firm which audited Carillion. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said Capita was ""on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners' rights"". ""Another day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the Big Four popping up at every turn in the company's chequered history,"" he added. Capita offers customer management services, including the operation of call centres, for public and private sector organisations. Its customers include O2, M&S, John Lewis, local councils, the Army and the Department of Work and Pensions. The firm's biggest contract is its management of O2's call centres. The 10-year deal was signed in 2013 and is worth Â£1.2bn. It is also the UK's leading provider of software to emergency service control rooms and also runs the Ministry of Justice's electronic monitoring services for criminal offenders.

UK sells Bangkok embassy for Â£420mThe money from the sale will be used to renovate buildings across the UK's diplomatic service.1han hour agoUK,"The Foreign Office has sold its British embassy in Bangkok for Â£420m, the biggest property sale in its history. Money raised will be used to renovate other embassies around the world. British diplomats in Thailand's capital city will move to a modern tower block in 2019, that has been leased for the next 15 years. The embassy was built in 1922 when the British government bought the nine-acre site on the outskirts of Bangkok. The Wireless Road compound includes its own tropical garden in a busy part of the capital, but large parts of the embassy have fallen into disrepair. A statue of Queen Victoria will remain in the compound but a war memorial will be moved to a new site. A statue of Queen Victoria in the compound will remain in place Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""Britain is a leading player on the global stage and I'm determined to ensure that our diplomats have all the necessary tools to do their job effectively. ""This includes working in modern, safe, fit-for-purpose premises not just in Bangkok but around the world."" He added that the new state-of-the-art premises would ""only enhance our trade links"" with Thailand. The sale price is more than a third of the FCO's annual core budget of Â£1.2bn, and the money could also be used to buy new compounds, improve security, and increase earthquake protection. The projects will include new electrical wiring in the Paris embassy, refurbishments in Cairo and its New Dehli embassy will also be renovated. Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the FCO, said that the move offered ""the best value for the taxpayers"" in a ""tight fiscal environment"".

Airline bans 'emotional support peacock',"The unusual creature drew some confused glances from other passengers A female traveller was recently banned from taking a large ""emotional-support peacock"" on board a United Airlines flight, it has emerged. She had offered to buy the bird its own plane ticket, according to travel blog Live and Let Fly. Nonetheless the airline refused to let the bird board at Newark airport in New Jersey, saying it did not meet guidelines due to its weight and size. United says this was explained to the traveller before she arrived at Newark. Pictures of the striking bird and its owner, attempting to travel to Los Angeles, emerged via The Jet Set, a travel-based talk show. The images show the animal perched on an airport baggage trolley, as fellow passengers gaze at it in shock. After six hours at the airport, the exotic bird and its human companions decided to take to the road and instead drive across the US. 'My therapy animal is inspirational' The peacock, reportedly called Dexter, belongs to Brooklyn-based artist Ventiko, who documents its life on social media. ""I have never left the house without having at least one person react,"" Ventiko told a local culture website in 2017. The artist, whose real name is not known, told Bedford and Bowery that the feathery giant ""really changed my life in a positive way"". United Airlines said the bird did not meet size guidelines. It is not known if the woman pictured is its owner She originally bought Dexter and a peahen called Etta for an art installation. She later found them a new home from which Etta and her offspring disappeared. The loss affected Dexter's behaviour and Ventiko came to his rescue after hearing that the bird was housed in a garage. Following a failed stint at an upstate New York farm, Ventiko finally decided to welcome Dexter into her Bushwick loft. Now involved in her photography and performance art, the exotic bird appears to enjoy his New York life. However, he avoids public transportation, like the subway, because Ventiko doesn't ""want to traumatise him"". Airlines have allowed some passengers with emotional or psychiatric problems to take therapy animals on board with them. But the number of emotional support animals has been rising in recent years, sparking suggestions that people are abusing the system. In 2014, a woman was escorted off a US Airways flight when her pig, named Hobie, defecated and squealed before the plane took off. Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' The killer whale that can say 'hello' and 'bye bye' Stop boiling lobsters alive, says campaign Had Dexter made it on to the plane, the peacock would have joined a flock of jet-set birds. Traveller Jodie Smalley, from Seattle, made headlines after taking her turkey on a pre-Christmas flight home in 2015. Cynics were surprised to hear that the bird made the return trip back in one piece - and wearing a special bird nappy. A year ago, a photo of 80 birds of prey was captured on board an airliner in the Middle East, promptly going viral online. The falcons were being flown from an unknown destination to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, for what was believed to be a hunting trip.

UK sells Bangkok embassy for Â£420m,"The Foreign Office has sold its British embassy in Bangkok for Â£420m, the biggest property sale in its history. Money raised will be used to renovate other embassies around the world. British diplomats in Thailand's capital city will move to a modern tower block in 2019, that has been leased for the next 15 years. The embassy was built in 1922 when the British government bought the nine-acre site on the outskirts of Bangkok. The Wireless Road compound includes its own tropical garden in a busy part of the capital, but large parts of the embassy have fallen into disrepair. A statue of Queen Victoria will remain in the compound but a war memorial will be moved to a new site. A statue of Queen Victoria in the compound will remain in place Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""Britain is a leading player on the global stage and I'm determined to ensure that our diplomats have all the necessary tools to do their job effectively. ""This includes working in modern, safe, fit-for-purpose premises not just in Bangkok but around the world."" He added that the new state-of-the-art premises would ""only enhance our trade links"" with Thailand. The sale price is more than a third of the FCO's annual core budget of Â£1.2bn, and the money could also be used to buy new compounds, improve security, and increase earthquake protection. The projects will include new electrical wiring in the Paris embassy, refurbishments in Cairo and its New Dehli embassy will also be renovated. Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the FCO, said that the move offered ""the best value for the taxpayers"" in a ""tight fiscal environment"".

Carrie Gracie speaks of BBC pay 'insult'The BBC's former China editor is talking about equal pay in front of MPs at a select committee.,"This video can not be played Carrie Gracie: ""If they don't report the truth how can we?"" Former BBC China editor Carrie Gracie has said she is ""very angry"" about the way the BBC has treated some female members of staff. The presenter, who resigned from her post earlier this month in protest at pay inequality, was giving evidence to a committee of MPs. Gracie said she felt the BBC's response to her grievance was ""an insult"". Director general Tony Hall said the BBC ""got some things wrong"", but added that he ""admired her courage"". He insisted the BBC's system for dealing with pay complaints was ""working"" and equality was ""at the core of what we stand for"" but faced claims from one MP that the broadcaster was in ""meltdown"" over the issue. They were giving evidence to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. How the BBC gender pay story has unfolded Gracie, 55, who has worked for the BBC for more than 30 years, said a grievance process over pay concluded that the reason she was paid less than male counterparts was that she had been deemed to be ""in development"". She said that justification was ""an insult to add to the original injury"", adding: ""It is unacceptable to talk to your senior women like that. ""I would never have gone to China on those terms. I asked for equal pay at the very beginning."" In emotional testimony, the presenter also said she had found the grievance process ""very painful"". She spoke about the ""strain of being in conflict"" and that, in the process, managers had attempted to ""to crush your self esteem about your work"". A reviewpublished on Tuesday said there was ""no evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making"" at the BBC. But the review, conducted by auditors PwC, was rejected by BBC Women, which represents almost 200 staff members. The issue has been in the headlines since last summer, when the BBC published a list of presenters who earn more than Â£150,000 per year, revealing a gap in the earnings of its best-known male and female presenters and actors. This video can not be played Carrie Gracie: ""I really feel angry about some of the things I have seen and heard"". Referring to other female staff members who had told her about similar grievance experiences, she said: ""I feel very angry about what they put some other people through. ""I really feel angry about some of the things I've seen and heard and some of the women and the suffering they've gone through."" Gracie was appointed China editor in 2013 but stepped down in early January, saying she was dismayed to discover the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than their two female counterparts. The presenter said the BBC had offered to pay her Â£100,000 in back pay after the inequality came to light - but said the offer ""sounds like a tacit admission of pay discrimination"". Reality Check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem? She told the MPs: ""The thing that's very unacceptable to meâ¦ it [the BBC] basically said in those three previous years - 2014, 2015 and 2016 - I was 'in development'."" Gracie criticised the way BBC executives had handled her situation, saying their stance was ""damaging the credibility of the BBC in a completely unacceptable way"". She said: ""We're not in the business of producing toothpaste or tyres at the BBC. Our business is truth. We can't operate without the truth. ""If we're not prepared to look at ourselves honestly, how can we be trusted to look at anything else in reporting honestly?"" Gracie is returning to a job in the BBC newsroom. She said: ""I could leave the BBC tomorrow and get a better paid job. I don't want to leave it in this state. It is in deep trouble and we need to sort it out and I need to be there alongside the other great BBC women, helping the BBC to sort it out."" This video can not be played Tony Hall: ""Yes there were management failings"" Director general Tony Hall and other BBC executives also spoke at the committee hearing. Lord Hall said: ""The result of the grievance which she described to you did say very clearly that we had got some things wrong. I would that we hadn't got things wrong but we did."" The director general said Gracie had done ""first rate work for the BBC"" and added: ""I don't want to undermine in any way the work she has done."" He added the ""domination of men"" in highly paid positions was wrong and the BBC is working to resolve that. Lord Hall told the committee that pay ""should not be a matter of gender - completely agree, outrageous if it was"". But he added that it was legitimate to have a ""pecking order"" between editors in the pay scale. Lord Hall said: ""I don't believe there is an old boys network, I believe in equality of opportunity. ""Wherever I can, properly, we have been trying to appoint women to key roles at the BBC - key roles in news, key roles as correspondents and reporters in news."" He added: ""The idea of some old boys club, I abhor. That is not the way I believe that BBC should be or is."" At one point, BBC chairman Sir David Clementi turned round in his seat and apologised to Gracie, who was sitting behind him, for the mistakes the corporation had made. He later told Conservative MP Julian Knight it was clear the BBC made a ""number of errors"" during the grievance process. ""I apologise for what she has been through,"" he said. ""I recognise for individuals concerned how stressful these occasions are, they are stressful for us but it must be much more so for her. I'm actually very sorry."" BBC head of news Fran Unsworth said that when Gracie was appointed as China editor, her salary was actually higher than that of the Middle East and North America editors. ""At the time that we set Carrie's pay in that role, there was no issue around gender at all,"" she said. However, after Gracie's appointment, Jon Sopel was hired to be the new North America editor. ""Jon Sopel came with a different pay history,"" she said. ""He had been a BBC One presenter, he had been a presenter on World News. He was a former political editor of the News Channel. He was a former Paris correspondent. And he had accumulated a much higher salary than Carrie was on at the time as a presenter of the News Channel. And we did not cut his pay in asking him to go to North America."" The North America editor was on air ""twice as much in peak time - and that is at a busy time in the China story"", she explained. She added: ""It's a different job, the China job. It's a more features-based agenda, it's not on the relentless treadmill that something like the North America editor's job is."" She also insisted she had never described Ms Gracie's role as ""part-time"" but said she had apologised to the journalist at the time if her language was ""loose"" and had given that impression. Lord Hall added it was ""a mistake not to review Carrie Gracie's pay when the new North America editor was put in place"". Razia Iqbal, Samira Ahmed, Kate Silverton and Kate Adie all supported Gracie A number of female BBC presenters, including Kate Adie, Mariella Frostrup, Kate Silverton, Louise Minchin and Naga Munchetty, were in Westminster to support Gracie. As Gracie spoke, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman was among those to tweet their support for the presenter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gracie also said she had received more than 500 supportive emails from members of the public since her resignation, and 300 from BBC staff. Carrie Gracie's testimony to the DCMS select committee contains several revelations. These include her rejection of back pay close to Â£100,000, and the fact that the BBC's letter to her about her grievance said she was ""in development."" Without seeing the letter in full, it's impossible to know the context, of course, but it seems a sloppy choice of words. Revealing that she twice had breast cancer, recently suffered a family bereavement, and that her daughter had leukaemia, Gracie detailed the very difficult personal circumstances that she has endured during the recent stages of her career. Her explanation that she spent 214 days in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan last year counters several reports in the media, and Gracie specifically expressed disappointment at negative briefing against her which she believes originates in the corporation. Several times, Gracie made clear that she believes she is very lucky to work at the BBC, and cast ""BBC Management"" as a ""fortress"" often acting against the interests of BBC men and women. The BBC Women campaign group is now up to 190 at least, she said. And she produced a number of memorable phrases that have already been widely picked up on social media. Perhaps her strongest line was the claim that the BBC doesn't trade in toothpaste, it trades in truth. The implied allegation that it has been less than honest has the power to hurt an organisation founded on principles of public service.

Compared to earlier in the week, it was a low-key day, but Labour's Sir Keir Starmer continued to put pressure on the Brexit Secretary David Davis over the gloomy economic predictions for Brexit leaked to the media. David Davis told the Commons the outcome was ""a work in progress"" saying that modelling was ""incredibly difficult"". That was followed by an urgent question on the financial troubles of outsourcing firm Capita. There was a more collegiate mood later in the day when the Commons debated baby leave for MPs. Women MPs shared stories about the challenges of having a newborn baby and being an MP.

Hospital car parking charges debate House of CommonsParliament Health Minister Stephen Barclay responds on behalf of the government, observing of hospital car parking charges: ""All of us pay them. We all know they're unpopular with constituents and a concern for staff."" The issue is not the ""desirability"" of scrapping them, he continues, ""but doing so in a way that doesn't cause unintended consequences."" He specifies that 67% of hospitals in England don't charge for parking, prompting his party colleague Robert Halfon to object that it is ""widespread"". Mr Barclay tells him the statistic is ""a statement of fact"". In Mr Halfon's response afterwards, he confesses he's ""disappointed"" by the minister's response. Hospital car parking charges debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow health minister Julie Cooper winds up for Labour, saying that having to pay to use hospital car parks ""adds insult to injury"". ""It's not like a shopping trip or a night out - nobody goes to hospital because they want to,"" she says. Ms Cooper tells MPs that patients have few other options as ""public transport has been reduced due to cuts"" and in any case many are ""too unwell or too frail"" to use it. She highlights Labour's promise to ""remove this tax on the sick"" and scrap all hospital car park charges. The PM says EU nationals arriving after the UK's exit should not automatically expect full rights. Hospital car parking charges debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Lisa Cameron tells the Commons it's estimated that scrapping hospital car parking charges in Scotland has saved NHS staff Â£25m. The Scottish Government scrapped charges at 14 sites where fees had previously applied in 2008, but there are still some where patients have to pay. She argues the charges are effectively ""a tax on NHS treatment"" and is particularly concerned about disabled people, who she says are being ""doubly financially penalised"" as they are more likely to face poverty anyway.

Hospital car parking charges debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning argues that car park charges mean NHS staff are effectively ""taxed even more to go to work"". He refers to his background as a fireman, noting that ""firefighters and police do not pay to park - why another emergency worker?"" The current system is ""fundamentally wrong"" and it's not good enough to say it's devolved to NHS trusts as they're ""unaccountable"", according to Sir Mike. Hospital car parking charges debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Melanie Onn says when she visits the hospital, as she did recently for a blood test, the test might only take a few minutes but there was a 68-minute wait, which costs Â£3.50 in parking charges. ""I know that I can afford this but there are many in my constituency who cannot,"" she says, adding that it feels like ""profiteering off the back of those who have no choice but to be at the hospital"". She also raises the nuisance caused to surrounding residential areas which ""get filled with cars"" belonging to people trying to avoid parking at the hospital. Hospital car parking charges debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Robert Halfon is starting the debate on scrapping car parking charges in NHS hospitals in England and Wales. He says a lot of organisations support this move, including the AA, RAC and Care. Mr Halfon tells MPs he started his campaign for free hospital car parking in 2014 when he found that some hospitals are charging Â£500 per week for parking. He says that last year, most hospitals had increased their car parking charges and even charged blue badge holders. The charges hit the most vulnerable and those who are caring for elderly relatives, he adds. Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament Andrea Leadsom tells the House that, as appointed representatives, MPs are not regulated by the same employment rules. She argues that they would need to be made employees to make them subject to the same regulations, which would have far-reaching implications that would need to be thought about carefully. The motion proposes that MPs who are new parents should have the option of voting by proxy which, as the leader of the House notes, would be a new thing in the Commons. She encourages MPs to contribute to an expected review by the Procedure Committee. Finally, Harriet Harman also encourages MPs to contribute to the review - and MPs agree the motion without a vote. Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom replies to the debate, welcoming the ""excellent and very personal speeches"" from MPs. She says that dealing with the matter of baby leave is ""essential"". Maternity leave is essential as new parents must spend time with their babies, she says, and there is also the need to address ""how and whether"" MPs with babies should be allowed to vote in the House during that Ms Leadsom mentions her work with ""parent infant partnership"" charities, helping mothers form ""secure attachments"" with their new babies. She also recalls 46 hours of labour with one of her children, while she was employed at a bank. ""They required me back after 11 weeks so I also had a good dose of post-natal depression to deal with,"" Ms Leadsom adds. She praises MPs for being ""very committed to ensuring that those who come after us don't have to suffer the same problems"". Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz winds up for Labour, calling it ""unacceptable"" that some MPs have been criticised for having children. She says voters ""want Parliament to be representative of different parts of society"". She stresses the proposals under consideration are just to enable mothers to have proxy votes, not for wider application. This would enable MPs to ""balance giving birth and looking after a baby with their work as an MP,"" she says. Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Hannah Bardell says it's important MPs tackle this issue so that people from all walks of life think ""that [Parliament] is something that I can and want to be part of"". She says that although all MPs who've spoken today have been supportive of introducing baby leave, they still face opposition. She reads out a letter a constituent wrote to her party colleague Alison Thewliss challenging her suitability to be a mother and an MP. House of CommonsParliament Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Jess Phillips also calls on male MPs to take time off when their babies are born, rejecting the idea people should take pride in how much time they spend in Parliament. ""I'm coming for you,"" she warns. Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Luciana Berger says that MPs now have an on-site nursery, which is ""a much improved replacement"" for the bar which used to be there. She calls for more baby friendly spaces in Parliament, breastfeeding rooms, baby changing rooms and more. Her baby was four weeks old and she was recovering from a C-section at the time when the election was called, she adds. She states that the whips, although understanding, have required her to come to vote at times when her baby was less than six months old. ""I was a slummy mummy,"" she says, admitting it was difficult to take a shower and take a train to London, navigate the train and Tube, especially when MPs are packing overnight things for a late night vote. Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Emma Reynolds recounts how she was expecting her baby to be born in April 2017, estimating that the baby would be three years old at the time of the next election. She gave birth on Good Friday last year. Four days later, she was breastfeeding her baby Theo when her mother told her that Theresa May had called an election. She wondered how she and her husband were going to cope during an election, especially when she was ""already struggling"" with the baby being up during the night. She recalls how many people assumed she wouldn't stand for re-election given that she was a new mother, noting that no-one would make that assumption about a new father. She says she was extremely fortunate in that her husband's employer was very understanding and granted him early paternity leave for the election campaign. MP tweets.. Allow Twitter content?

Baby leave debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Maria Miller, Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee in Parliament, says: ""This has to be a joint enterprise if it's going to be successful."" Being an MP is a unique honour, she says, but it shouldn't mean that only those without care and responsibilities can apply. Maria Miller says that in a council in her Basingstoke constituency nine out of the 14 councillors are women - some of whom have young children.

"'Roman haul' turns out to be TV propThe 50 ""gold"" coins and pottery had earlier been buried by the crew of the BBC show Detectorists.1han hour agoSuffolk","Paul Adams and Andy Sampson have only been metal detecting for a year Two men who thought they had unearthed a stash of Roman gold coins had their dreams dashed when they discovered the coins were a prop for a TV sitcom. Andy Sampson and Paul Adams had been metal detecting in a field on the Suffolk/Essex border when they found more than 50 ""gold"" coins with pottery. Mr Sampson said his friend started ""shouting and jumping around and dancing"" after he found the ""treasure"". However, it emerged the fake coins were a prop for the BBC show Detectorists. Mr Sampson said the pair, who have only been metal detecting for a year, had spotted the farmer ploughing the field last summer, and got his permission to go out one evening to check it out. The gold coins were part of a scene being filmed for the BBC TV series Detectorists ""Paul kept running at me shouting, 'Roman gold!' and I thought, 'he's winding me up',"" he said. ""He was floating across the top of the field rather than running through it. I wish I'd had a camera."" The pair went back to the furrow and found more than 50 gold coins with pottery, which they believed at the time could have been worth up to Â£250,000. Mr Sampson said he immediately began working out how he would spend the money, with plans including paying off the mortgage, buying a new car and going on the trip of a lifetime. Rail passenger wakes to find Â£100 gift Stranger pays for 'humbled' medic's fuel Thousands of birds join murmuration However, he took the find back home and showed it to his neighbour, who was less enthusiastic about it. Mr Sampson said his neighbour picked up the coins and immediately said ""they're not real - there's something wrong with them"". The pair made some inquiries and found out the farm was being used as a filming location during the summer for BBC Four comedy Detectorists, which stars Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones. It emerged the production crew had filmed a tractor pulling a plough through the ground, unearthing the coins as it went. However, Mr Sampson said, ""it had buried some as well"", and they were the ones they found.

Drunk tourists warned over insurance cover,"A man who fell and hit his head after ""drinking all night"" was correctly refused travel insurance cover, an ombudsman has said. Yet, another man who slipped over in a nightclub's toilets after a drink while on holiday should have been covered. The cases have been featured by the financial ombudsman to highlight the small print and rules surrounding travel insurance disputes. It said tourists should not be expected to have been sober to win a claim. The burden of proof was on the insurer to prove that too much drinking was to blame. Many insurers have a clause in travel insurance policies that means cover is refused if the policyholder's accident was caused by excessive alcohol. If the insurer refuses to pay for the medical expenses, the customer can appeal to the financial ombudsman to make an independent ruling. The organisation looked at nearly 900 travel insurance complaints in the last three months of 2017, to highlight some of the issues involved. ""Insurers may choose not to pay out if they believe someone's been drinking excessively, although this doesn't necessarily mean holidays should be totally alcohol-free,"" said chief financial ombudsman Caroline Wayman. ""In each case, we'll need to carefully weigh up all the evidence to decide, on balance, whether the insurer has made the right call. ""Encouragingly, compared with recent years, we're generally upholding fewer travel insurance complaints. This suggests, while there is still clearly work to do, that many insurers are increasingly treating their customers in a fair and reasonable way."" Drinking is a major part of many holidays (posed by a model) In the nightclub case, the ombudsman told the insurer to pay up for a man's medical treatment costs. The man said he had been drinking, but that he was not drunk at the time. The ombudsman decided that, on balance, it did not think the evidence showed it was more likely than not that excessive alcohol consumption had caused his accident. However, in the other case highlighted, an insurer sent the ombudsman medical records showing the emergency doctor diagnosed the injured man with ""acute alcohol intoxication"". These records also said he had not been able to sign a form when he arrived at the hospital, and other records made during his ambulance trip suggested he had said he had been drinking all night. Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' 'Emotional support peacock' barred from United Airlines plane M&S plans to close up to 14 stores The ombudsman said figures show more than 21.9 million people from the UK went on summer holidays abroad in 2017. Overall there were 3,000 complaints about travel insurance made to the ombudsman last year. It ruled that the insurers had not treated their customers fairly in nearly four in 10 cases. A spokeswoman for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said: ""Travel insurance is a lifeline for people who run into trouble overseas, with insurers paying out more than a million pounds every day. ""More than half of this funds emergency medical treatment for people who have been badly injured or have fallen seriously ill. As with any insurance, customers do have a responsibility not to behave recklessly. ""Insurers know people will likely want to drink alcohol while they are on holiday and they don't expect you to stay sober all the time, but there is a danger of invalidating your cover if you drink so much that it makes you act dangerously or means you are out of control."" Overall, the financial ombudsman handled 81,647 new cases on a variety of subjects between October and December. The majority (54%) were complaints about the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. Energy drink + alcohol = trouble?

"Nintendo Switch overtakes the Wii UThe Nintendo Switch games console outsells its predecessor, just 10 months after its launch.3h3 hours agoTechnologyComments","The Nintendo Switch games console has outsold its predecessor, just 10 months after its launch. Nintendo sold 7.23 million Switch consoles in the previous quarter, bringing total sales to about 14.86 million devices. The Wii U, which went on sale in November 2012, sold 13.56 million units before it was discontinued in 2017 and was considered a commercial failure. Nintendo reported its most profitable quarter since 2009. The companyannounced an operating profit,externalof 116.50 billion yen (Â£755m, $1.07 billion), up from 32.26 billion yen a year ago. Nintendo's biggest star continues to entertain The Kyoto-based company raised its profit forecast for the year ending March from 120 billion yen to 160 billion yen. It said it expected Switch sales to reach 20 million this year and said a Pokemon game would be released for the Switch ""in 2018 or later"". Super Mario Odyssey was the best-selling game for the Nintendo Switch, with 9.07 million copies sold since it was released in October. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - a rerelease of a Wii U title - has sold 7.33 million copies, with launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild selling 6.70 million. Splatoon 2 - a sequel to one of Nintendo's newest original properties - sold 4.91 million copies. ""Switch sales during the holiday season were stronger than expected in Japan, the United States and Europe,"" Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said at an earnings briefing. Nintendo Switch is both home console and handheld The Nintendo Switch is a curious device that many gamers thought would fail. Equal parts home console and handheld device, it lacks the computational might of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and has no movie-streaming apps or web browser. But while Microsoft and Sony have been busy pushing ultra-high definition gaming, Nintendo has focused on what it does best: making really fun games. Critics have been bowled over by its home-grown titles such as Super Mario Odyssey and Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, and the games have won awards. Nintendo's latest accessory for the Switch is a collection of foldable cardboard sheets that turn the console into a piano, robot or fishing rod. Odd, perhaps - but it shows the company is not afraid to innovate. The Switch is not only a successor to the Wii U. If the price comes down, it could replace the hugely popular 3DS as Nintendo's primary handheld console. For now, Nintendo says both devices will be sold alongside one another. But Nintendo might need a few more hits to keep up momentum. Pokemon games are typically among the best-selling titles for Nintendo's consoles, but a Pokemon adventure for the Switch has yet to be released.

"Labour pushes for Brexit study publicationThe party wants a binding Commons vote, arguing MPs need the document to make informed decisions.4h4 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","Brexit minister Robin Walker made the announcement in Parliament Leaked studies on the economic impact of Brexit will be made available to MPs to read, ministers have said. No 10 said it would allow MPs and peers to see the report on a confidential basis after a Commons debate. Ministers decided not to oppose a Labour motion urging its publication, amid signs they would lose the vote. The leaked study suggests that in three different scenarios the UK economy would grow more slowly than it would if it stayed in the European Union The government had previously argued that the document's immediate publication could damage UK negotiations with the EU.

Breaking|Breaking news'Medics must put public interest first'The 14-year inquiry into the deaths of five children delivers its findings.5m6 minutes agoNorthern Ireland,"Adam Strain, Raychel Ferguson, Claire Roberts and Conor Mitchell. Lucy Crawford's family chose not to release a photograph An inquiry into the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland's hospitals has found that four of them were avoidable. The findings followed a 14-year inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths. Who were the children? Timeline of hyponatraemia inquiry Hyponatraemia is a medical condition that occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream. Thedamning report was heavily critical of the ""self-regulating and unmonitored"" health service.,external The Belfast, Southern and Western health trusts said they ""unreservedly apologise"" to the five families. This video can not be played Mr Justice O'Hara calls on medical professionals to put the public interest first. Mr Justice O'Hara was scathing of how the families were treated in the aftermath of the deaths and also of the evidence given to the inquiry by medical professionals. He said that ""doctors and managers cannot be relied on to do the right thing at the right time"" and that they had to put the public interest before their own reputation. He also said that some witnesses to the inquiry ""had to have the truth dragged out of them"". This video can not be played Jennifer Roberts speaks about the death of her daughter, Claire The inquiry was set up in 2004 to investigate the deaths of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts, Raychel Ferguson, Lucy Crawford and Conor Mitchell. The chairman said that the deaths of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts and Raychel Ferguson were the result of ""negligent care"". The inquiry's report has made 96 recommendations In his report, Mr Justice O'Hara found that: while investigating the death of Adam Strain, the inquiry had been met with ""defensiveness and deceit"" and that ""information was withheld"" about what happened to Adam in the operating theatre there ""was a cover up"" in the death of Claire Roberts, whose death was not referred to the coroner immediately to ""avoid scrutiny"" poor care was ""deliberately concealed"" in the death of Lucy Crawford there was a ""reluctance among clinicians to openly acknowledge failings"" in the death of Raychel Ferguson in the death of Conor Mitchell, there was a ""potentially dangerous variation in care and treatment afforded to young people at Craigavon Hospital"" In total, the inquiry made 96 recommendations including the establishment of a duty of candour on medical professionals ""to tell patients and their families about major failures in care and to give a full and honest explanation"". This video can not be played The chair of the hyponatraemia inquiry believes evidence was withheld about Adam Strain's death Mr Justice O'Hara added that the ""reticence of some clinicians and healthcare professionals to concede error or identify underperformance or colleagues was frustrating and depressing"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, said that the inquiry was ""confirmation of what we knew happened"". Marie Ferguson, the mother of Raychel, during the delivery of Mr Justice O'Hara's findings ""She went into hospital as a young, healthy girl and was neglected by the nurses, neglected by the doctors and, ultimately, died because of the negligence of those we consider health professionals."" Mrs Ferguson added that she had been devoted to finding the truth and ""what I experienced during this journey is inexcusable"". ""The trust and their lawyers abused their position by trying to cover up the truth. They robbed me of the most precious wee girl,"" she said. ""For hospital medical staff to make a mistake is forgivable, however, to orchestrate a cover-up and to deliberately mislead is totally unforgivable."" The family of Conor Mitchell said medical staff had ""failed Conor so badly"". ""The reticence with which the investigation has been handled by the trust and their advisers and the grudging way in which the limited acceptance of failings and minimal apology given were extracted, indicates a reluctance on their part to undertake the learning and the change in attitude needed to reduce the trauma caused in cases such as these,"" they said. by Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondent There was a real sense of regret, here, that for these five families, life should have been very, very different. The report spans three volumes of almost 700 pages and, while each case is treated separately, overall the chairman refers to a catalogue of failings, where in most cases shortcomings were evident from the outset. Sometimes with a great deal of emotion, Mr Justice O'Hara talked about the lack of professional candour, not just among clinicians but also by some managers. There was a tremendous sense of grief and anger in the room. The mothers of Raychel Ferguson and Claire Roberts sat in the front row and sobbed throughout the chairman's findings. A spokesperson for the Belfast, Western and Southern trusts said they would ""urgently review"" the recommendations to ""ensure that all possible steps have been taken to prevent this ever happening again"". ""We made mistakes, we were not as open and transparent as we could, and should have been, and opportunities to learn from each other to make our care safer were missed - for this we are truly sorry. This video can not be played Marie Ferguson said her daughter Raychel's death ""destroyed me"" ""Since these tragic deaths occurred significant lessons have been learned in how we safely manage fluids in children and many improvements have been put in place."" Cathy Jack, the medical director at the Belfast Health Trust, said all three trusts would comply with any individual rulings that might arise from the General Medical Council and added that, on a personal level, she was ashamed. The Health and Social Care Board said: ""Whilst we fully accept that it is cold comfort to the families, since the incidents leading to these tragic deaths, a number of significant changes have taken place within the wider health and social care system. ""A lot of work has gone into ensuring that when things do go wrong, incidents are reported, robust action is taken, families are engaged, and relevant learning is shared and disseminated."" The Department of Health said the ""thoughts of everyone"" were with the families of the children and it was ""deeply sorry for the distress, hurt and loss suffered by the families"". ""The inquiry report acknowledges the work that has been undertaken to address serious, past failings and provide safe and accountable care in future,"" it added. ""That vital work will continue, informed by the findings and recommendations of the inquiry report."" General Medical Council chief executive Charlie Massey said: ""The inquiry raised some serious concerns - we will analyse these to identify any new evidence it has brought to light in relation to the cases considered. ""The GMC supports the introduction of a statutory duty of candour. ""It's vital that doctors and all other professionals are open and honest with patients and employers."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it noted the report into the inquiry had been published and would ""take time to carefully assess its contents before deciding what action needs to be taken"". The hyponatraemia inquiry has been dogged by repeated delays and adjournments. The first witness was not called until April 2012 and it stopped taking evidence in November 2013. A total of 106 doctors and other medical professionals gave evidence and 179 witnesses were called. Fifty lawyers were involved, representing the inquiry, the families and the health trusts. Initial reports suggest the inquiry cost Â£13.5m, but that figure is expected to rise.

Capita shares plunge on profit warningOutsourcing giant Capita says it has become 'too complex' and overly focused on the short term.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments,"Capita shares have plunged almost 50% after the outsourcing firm warned on profits and announced a major shake-up. New chief executive Jonathan Lewis said the company had become ""too complex"" and ""driven by a short-term focus"" and needed to change its approach. Capita, which issued a series of profit warnings last year, has again cut its profit forecast and revealed plans to raise Â£700m by issuing new shares. The move comes after outsourcing rival Carillion collapsed earlier this month. Capita operates the London congestion charge, runs the government's Jobseekers Allowance helpline and administers the teachers' pension scheme. It also collects the TV licence fee on behalf of the BBC. Shares ended the day 47% lower at 182.5p, prompting calls from Labour and trade unions for urgent government action to avoid ""another Carillion"". A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said as a ""strategic supplier"" Capita was always monitored by the government. The firm employs 70,000 people, about 50,000 of whom are in the UK. According to Tussell, a firm which analyses UK public sector contracts, Capita won 154 government contracts last year. Mr Lewis, who took over two months ago, said a review had found the company worked across too many markets and services, meaning it was difficult to ""maintain a competitive advantage"" in every business. Capita had relied too much on acquisitions to drive growth and had also seen weakness in new contracts, he added. The company does have some financial strengths. It can call on Â£1bn in cash and credit facilities, has a significantly higher profit margin than Carillion did and has been taking steps to reduce its debt burden. If Carillion had made an announcement like this a few years ago - raising money to pay off debt, admitting a slow-down in the market, owning up to both underinvestment and an over-reliance on buying other companies to find growth - then it might still be with us now. Instead, Capita's new boss, Jonathan Lewis, has decided to take evasive action early. Chief executives are normally afforded only one chance to hit the reset button in their time at the top, and the smart ones take it early, and hit the button hard. That is what Mr Lewis has done. By taking harsh financial medicine now he has probably ensured that the company does not suffer Carillion's fate. Mr Lewis plans a wide-ranging overhaul including cost cutting, selling unprofitable businesses and cutting the dividend to shareholders. Annual profits are now expected to be between Â£270m and Â£300m - well below analyst expectations of Â£400m. In a conference call Mr Lewis said there was ""much to be done"", but Wednesday's announcements were the ""first steps on the road to recovery"". Neil Wilson, senior analyst at ETX, said signs of problems had been building at the firm, including the loss of ""a lucrative and profitable contract with the Prudential"" in January. Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, urged the government to ""take serious steps"" to oversee the activities of Capita, pointing out that it was the third major outsourcing company after Carillion and Interserve to issue a profit warning in the past month. Capita is audited by KPMG, the same accountancy firm which audited Carillion. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said Capita was ""on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners' rights"". ""Another day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the Big Four popping up at every turn in the company's chequered history,"" he added. Capita offers customer management services, including the operation of call centres, for public and private sector organisations. Its customers include O2, M&S, John Lewis, local councils, the Army and the Department of Work and Pensions. The firm's biggest contract is its management of O2's call centres. The 10-year deal was signed in 2013 and is worth Â£1.2bn. It is also the UK's leading provider of software to emergency service control rooms and also runs the Ministry of Justice's electronic monitoring services for criminal offenders.

Seaplane route 'inexplicable' before crash,"The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane A seaplane was not following an authorised route when it plunged into a river north of Sydney, killing six people, the flight operator says. Five members of a British family and a Canadian pilot died in the incident on 31 December. There were no survivors. A preliminary report, released on Wednesday, did not draw any conclusions about why the plane had crashed. But Sydney Seaplanes described events moments before the crash as ""totally inexplicable"". The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report said the DHC-2 Beaver had made a steep right turn before diving nose-first into the Hawkesbury River at Jerusalem Bay, about 50km (30 miles) from the city. ""The key question arising from the report is why the plane crashed approximately half way down Jerusalem Bay... the plane simply should not have been where it was,"" said Sydney Seaplanes chief executive Aaron Shaw. Among the victims was Richard Cousins, the chief executive of FTSE 100 catering company Compass Group. Mr Cousins, 58, died alongside his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. The plane deviated from the expected flight path and crashed in Jerusalem Bay The pilot had flown the authorised route ""hundreds of times before"", Mr Shaw said. ""A turn of this nature at low altitude by a pilot with Gareth's skills, experience and intimate knowledge of the location is totally inexplicable,"" he said. The ATSB said it was investigating why Mr Morgan had flown in that direction. ""We don't have a preferred theory at this stage as to why he went off course,"" transport safety director Nat Nagy said. Mr Nagy said investigators were exploring whether the sudden turn was ""an attempt to turn around or whether it was a planned turn"". Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins The pilot had more than 10,000 hours of flying experience - including about 9,000 hours on floatplanes. He had appeared to be in a ""high standard of health"", the report said. Mr Morgan and the family from Tooting, in south-west London, had been flying back to Sydney from a waterfront restaurant near the crash site. Mr Nagy said he could not guarantee that the cause of the crash would be identified in the final report, due in a year. ""It is possible that we're not able to know exactly what happened in that cockpit,"" he said. In its preliminary findings, investigators said there was no evidence of damage to the plane or any ""flight control issues"". A survey of the wreckage found: No evidence of a birdstrike or a collision with any objects No evidence of pre-impact structural damage The aircraft's flaps had been in a ""climb"" position at the time of the crash. There was no voice or flight data recorder on board - neither were required by regulations for an aircraft of such size, the ATSB said. The plane had last undergone maintenance in November. A new engine had also been installed then as part of a scheduled changeover, and subsequently tested, the report said. Investigators said they would retain the engine, propeller and several aircraft components for further examination.

'UK should add folic acid to flour',"This video can not be played Why is folic acid important? There are fresh calls for the government to fortify flour with folic acid in the UK to help protect babies from common birth defects. A new study concludes higher doses of the B vitamin, which can prevent spina bifida in unborn babies, will not harm the general public. Folic acid is added to flour in more than 80 countries worldwide, but the UK has previously held off. Women are advised to take folic acid before pregnancy, but many don't. Fortification would provide extra cover, say experts. The idea of mandatory fortification has already been backed by health ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not England. The latest research, published in Public Health Reviews, claims evidence for limiting intake of folic acid to no more than 1mg a day is out-of-date and flawed. The new re-analysis of the data finds no relationship between higher levels of folic acid and harm, although some say there is still not enough proof to say fortification is entirely safe. Research had previously suggested that high doses of folic acid could cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, cramps, sleep disorders, confusion, nausea and seizures. It can also cover up the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, which is a particular concern in older people. Prof David Smith, an expert in pharmacology at the University of Oxford, said: ""The matter has not been resolved."" However, Prof Tom Sanders, nutrition expert at King's College London, said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence in support of the case for folic acid fortification to prevent neural tube defects. A neural tube defect involves abnormal development of the brain, spine or spinal cord. Approximately one in 1,000 pregnancies in the UK is affected. Researchers say the cost of adding folic acid would be ""pennies"". Under the government's 1998 Bread and Flour regulations, white flour is already fortified with iron, calcium and some vitamins - at a cost of just 71p per tonne of flour. Lead author, Prof Sir Nicholas Wald, of the Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine, said: ""Fortification would be a major saving. ""Failing to fortify flour with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is like having a polio vaccine and not using it."" Study co-author Prof Sir Colin Blakemore, from the University of London, said: ""If you can dispel the argument for harm... you are left only with the fact that not fortifying flour denies a proven and clear benefit to a significant proportion of the population."" The US has seen a 23% fall in pregnancies with neural tube defects (spina bifida and anencephaly) since the policy was introduced in 1998. Folic acid occurs naturally in dark green leafy vegetables but research has suggested three-quarters of women across the UK don't consume sufficient levels. It is voluntarily added to some breakfast cereals and spreads, but it is very difficult for pregnant women to get enough from diet alone. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We want mums-to-be to have healthy pregnancies, and NHS guidance is that women planning a pregnancy should take a daily supplement of 400 micrograms of folic acid before conception and until the 12th week of pregnancy. We also recommend eating more folate-rich foods to reduce the risk of neural tube defects."" spinach, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli beans and legumes (e.g. peas, blackeye beans) yeast and beef extracts oranges and orange juice wheat bran and other whole grain foods poultry, pork, shellfish and liver fortified foods (e.g. some brands of breakfast cereals - check the label).

"The killer whale that can 'speak'The animal mimics words such as ""hello"" and is thought to be the first of its kind to copy human speech.","Wikie, a 16-year-old female A killer whale that can mimic words such as ""hello"" and ""bye bye"" is thought to be the first of its kind to copy human speech. The female learned to ""speak"" a handful of human words by copying a trainer at a marine park in France. The animal's repertoire includes the name ""Amy"" and ""one, two, three"". Whales and dolphins are among the few animals other than humans that can learn to produce a novel sound just by hearing it. ""In mammals it is very rare,"" said Dr Josep Call of the University of St Andrews, a co-researcher on the study. ""Humans obviously are good at it... Interestingly, the mammals that can do best are marine mammals."" The researchers set out to find out whether killer whales could learn new vocalisations by imitating others. They studied a female named Wikie at Marineland Aquarium in Antibes, France. She was taught to speak human words through her blowhole and can be heard in recordings mimicking words such as hello and Amy, and counting one, two, three, using squawks, shrill whistles or raspberries. This video can not be played Killer whale says ""hello"" Killer whales are known to live in groups with unique vocal ""dialects"".  They may copy other members of their kind in the wild, although this needs to be tested. ""The killer whale that we studied in captivity was capable of learning vocalisations of other killer whales and also human vocalisations by imitating them,"" said Dr Call. ""Therefore this result suggests this is also a plausible explanation for how killer whales in the wild learn the vocalisations of other killer whales and how they develop their dialects."" Killer whales in the wild live in pods with distinct dialects Vocal imitation is a hallmark of human spoken language, yet in other animals it is strikingly rare. Dolphins and beluga whales are among the few mammals that can copy sounds from other species or each other. Some birds can mimic human speech, notably parrots, but also some members of the crow family. Dr Jose Abramson, from Complutense University of Madrid in Spain, a co-researcher on the study, said basic ""conversations"" with Wikie may one day be possible. ""Yes, it's conceivable ... if you have labels, descriptions of what things are,"" he said. ""It has been done before with a famous grey parrot and dolphins using American sign language; sentences like 'bring me this object' or 'put this object above or below the other'."" However, he said we have to be careful about imposing human concepts on animals, as there is more to gain by trying to understand the natural way each species communicates in its own environment. Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' 'Emotional support peacock' barred from United Airlines plane Stop boiling lobsters alive, says campaign Wikie made sounds while partially immersed in water with her blowhole exposed to the air. Sounds made under the water may be quite different. And since this was just the one whale, the researchers are unsure whether there are more copy-cat killer whales in the wild. Killer whales in captivity: they have been known to mimic other animals such as sea lions Dr Alex Thornton, senior lecturer in cognitive evolution at the University of Exeter, said we still don't fully understand why some animals learn to mimic. Some animals copy sounds to show off to potential mates, while in others this might help to identify an individual as a member of a group. ""Some whales, for example, learn their calls from one another and so have local vocal dialects that mark them out as members of their social group,"" said Dr Thornton, who is not connected with the research. Killer whales, or orcas, are the largest of the dolphins and one of the world's most powerful predators. They eat marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales, and are known to grab seals right off the ice.

First fall in UK car production in 8 years,"Car manufacturing in the UK fell last year for the first time since 2009. According to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), 1.67 million cars left UK factories in 2017, a decline of 3% compared with the year before. The SMMT says lower demand from UK consumers was the main reason for the fall, although exports also dipped. New investment in the UK motor industry shrank as well, falling to Â£1.1bn last year, compared with Â£1.66bn in 2016. Despite the decline last year, manufacturing in the UK remains high by historical standards, having risen steadily in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The number of cars that rolled off the production lines in 2017 was still the second highest since the turn of the century. But the SMMT remains concerned about the effects of falling business and consumer confidence, as well as what it calls confusion over the government's policy on diesel. Output for the domestic market fell by 9.8%, reflecting a decline in new car sales, which gathered pace towards the end of the year. Overseas demand continued to dominate production, with almost eight in every 10 cars built being sent abroad, more than half of them to the rest of the European Union. Meanwhile demand for commercial vehicles in the UK fell by 25%, which the SMMT blamed on ""a fall in business confidence and fluctuating buying cycles"". However, exports to the EU fell by just over 5%. Despite big increases in demand from other markets, notably Japan, China, Canada and the United States, overall exports fell by 1.1%. Export volumes do tend to fluctuate from year to year, and the arrival of a new model can have a big impact on the figures. However, the SMMT is clearly worried that future exports could be under threat, if rapid progress is not made on the trading conditions which will apply after the country leaves the EU. It argues that there is an urgent need for agreement on a transition deal, allowing the UK to remain in both the single market and the customs union until a final agreement on a new trading relationship has been reached. In addition, it wants the UK to continue to benefit from existing EU free trade agreements and customs union agreements during the transition, to protect exports to countries such as South Korea, Canada and Turkey. ""We urgently need clarity on the transitional arrangements"", the SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes told reporters. Such arrangements, he said, ""must retain all the current benefits, else around 10% of our exports could be threatened overnight"". The SMMT has also released figures showing that investment in the UK automotive sector fell by a third last year, dropping to Â£1.1bn from Â£1.66bn in 2016 and Â£2.5bn the year before that. Although investment in the motor industry is often cyclical, and can vary sharply from year to year, the SMMT says there is evidence that it is now actually stalling, as companies wait for certainty over our future relationship with the EU. It says rapid progress is needed on trade discussions, to safeguard jobs and promote future growth. Despite the overall fall in production, meanwhile, one segment of the market is currently expanding. Engine production grew by 6.9% in 2017, with 1 million diesel units and 1.7 million petrol units being built. The SMMT attributes much of the recent growth to investment in factories producing the latest generation of high-tech diesel engines - such as Ford's plant in Dagenham, which alone builds 790,000 units each year. It is an important sector, employing some 8,000 people, with nearly half of them working on building diesels. But whether the growth can be maintained is open to question. In the UK, diesel sales fell by more than 17% last year. Across Europe, too, diesel's market share has been falling, as politicians have become more concerned about urban air quality - and consumers have become worried in turn about possible restrictions on using their cars. People within the industryinsist that modern diesels are clean. But they admit that persuading enough people to buy them is proving to be a challenge. At the moment, there is no sign of that situation changing.

"Nintendo Switch overtakes the Wii UThe Nintendo Switch games console outsells its predecessor, just 10 months after its launch.7m7 minutes agoTechnologyComments","The Nintendo Switch games console has outsold its predecessor, just 10 months after its launch. Nintendo sold 7.23 million Switch consoles in the previous quarter, bringing total sales to about 14.86 million devices. The Wii U, which went on sale in November 2012, sold 13.56 million units before it was discontinued in 2017 and was considered a commercial failure. Nintendo reported its most profitable quarter since 2009. The companyannounced an operating profit,externalof 116.50 billion yen (Â£755m, $1.07 billion), up from 32.26 billion yen a year ago. Nintendo's biggest star continues to entertain The Kyoto-based company raised its profit forecast for the year ending March from 120 billion yen to 160 billion yen. It said it expected Switch sales to reach 20 million this year and said a Pokemon game would be released for the Switch ""in 2018 or later"". Super Mario Odyssey was the best-selling game for the Nintendo Switch, with 9.07 million copies sold since it was released in October. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - a rerelease of a Wii U title - has sold 7.33 million copies, with launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild selling 6.70 million. Splatoon 2 - a sequel to one of Nintendo's newest original properties - sold 4.91 million copies. ""Switch sales during the holiday season were stronger than expected in Japan, the United States and Europe,"" Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said at an earnings briefing. Nintendo Switch is both home console and handheld The Nintendo Switch is a curious device that many gamers thought would fail. Equal parts home console and handheld device, it lacks the computational might of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and has no movie-streaming apps or web browser. But while Microsoft and Sony have been busy pushing ultra-high definition gaming, Nintendo has focused on what it does best: making really fun games. Critics have been bowled over by its home-grown titles such as Super Mario Odyssey and Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, and the games have won awards. Nintendo's latest accessory for the Switch is a collection of foldable cardboard sheets that turn the console into a piano, robot or fishing rod. Odd, perhaps - but it shows the company is not afraid to innovate. The Switch is not only a successor to the Wii U. If the price comes down, it could replace the hugely popular 3DS as Nintendo's primary handheld console. For now, Nintendo says both devices will be sold alongside one another. But Nintendo might need a few more hits to keep up momentum. Pokemon games are typically among the best-selling titles for Nintendo's consoles, but a Pokemon adventure for the Switch has yet to be released.

"Bitcoin - the Revenue comes callingIf you have profited from crypto-currencies you could be liable for tax, says Rory Cellan-Jones.10h10 hours agoTechnology","Bitcoin came close to crossing $20,000 in December but dipped below $10,000 in January It is that time of year many a self-employed person dreads, the deadline to submit your tax return and pay anything you owe. But this year there is a question a select few should be asking themselves - have I profited from my investment in crypto-currencies? If you have, you could be liable for tax. In 2014 Revenue & Customs publishedguidelines,externalmaking clear the different taxes that apply to any earnings from crypto-currencies. For most people who have bought a few bitcoins some years ago, it is Capital Gains Tax that will be relevant. This will apply to any profits, once you hit the Â£11,300 CGT threshold, not just if they are converted into a standard currency but if they are used to buy other crypto-currencies such as Ethereum or to invest in initial coin offerings (ICOs). But in recent weeks there is some evidence that a few people are making trading in crypto-currencies a full-time job, in which case they are likely to be liable for income tax on their earnings. Now, the acceleration in the value of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies happened over the course of 2017 so it is unlikely many people will have incurred tax liabilities in 2016-17, the year HMRC is currently examining. But over recent months there has been a flood of Bitcoin money heading into everything from ICOs to property - so next year there should in theory be a big boost for the government's Capital Gains Tax receipts. One accountant told me plenty of his clients had piled into Bitcoin but seemed unaware of the tax implications. What is clear is the whole crypto-currency industry is now under the spotlight of regulators around the world. They are concerned not just about tax evasion but money laundering and major fraud. In the United States this week theSecurities and Exchange Commission got a court orderto halt an ICO attempting to raise $1bn (Â£0.7bn) to fund what was claimed to be the world's first ""decentralised"" bank. The regulator alleges this was a scam that had already used what it described as fraudulent tactics to raise as much as $600m, including failing to disclose the criminal background of key executives.

The killer whale that can 'speak',"Wikie, a 16-year-old female A killer whale that can mimic words such as ""hello"" and ""bye bye"" is thought to be the first of its kind to copy human speech. The female learned to ""speak"" a handful of human words by copying a trainer at a marine park in France. The animal's repertoire includes the name ""Amy"" and ""one, two, three"". Whales and dolphins are among the few animals other than humans that can learn to produce a novel sound just by hearing it. ""In mammals it is very rare,"" said Dr Josep Call of the University of St Andrews, a co-researcher on the study. ""Humans obviously are good at it... Interestingly, the mammals that can do best are marine mammals."" The researchers set out to find out whether killer whales could learn new vocalisations by imitating others. They studied a female named Wikie at Marineland Aquarium in Antibes, France. She was taught to speak human words through her blowhole and can be heard in recordings mimicking words such as hello and Amy, and counting one, two, three, using squawks, shrill whistles or raspberries. This video can not be played Killer whale says ""hello"" Killer whales are known to live in groups with unique vocal ""dialects"".  They may copy other members of their kind in the wild, although this needs to be tested. ""The killer whale that we studied in captivity was capable of learning vocalisations of other killer whales and also human vocalisations by imitating them,"" said Dr Call. ""Therefore this result suggests this is also a plausible explanation for how killer whales in the wild learn the vocalisations of other killer whales and how they develop their dialects."" Killer whales in the wild live in pods with distinct dialects Vocal imitation is a hallmark of human spoken language, yet in other animals it is strikingly rare. Dolphins and beluga whales are among the few mammals that can copy sounds from other species or each other. Some birds can mimic human speech, notably parrots, but also some members of the crow family. Dr Jose Abramson, from Complutense University of Madrid in Spain, a co-researcher on the study, said basic ""conversations"" with Wikie may one day be possible. ""Yes, it's conceivable ... if you have labels, descriptions of what things are,"" he said. ""It has been done before with a famous grey parrot and dolphins using American sign language; sentences like 'bring me this object' or 'put this object above or below the other'."" However, he said we have to be careful about imposing human concepts on animals, as there is more to gain by trying to understand the natural way each species communicates in its own environment. Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' 'Emotional support peacock' barred from United Airlines plane Stop boiling lobsters alive, says campaign Wikie made sounds while partially immersed in water with her blowhole exposed to the air. Sounds made under the water may be quite different. And since this was just the one whale, the researchers are unsure whether there are more copy-cat killer whales in the wild. Killer whales in captivity: they have been known to mimic other animals such as sea lions Dr Alex Thornton, senior lecturer in cognitive evolution at the University of Exeter, said we still don't fully understand why some animals learn to mimic. Some animals copy sounds to show off to potential mates, while in others this might help to identify an individual as a member of a group. ""Some whales, for example, learn their calls from one another and so have local vocal dialects that mark them out as members of their social group,"" said Dr Thornton, who is not connected with the research. Killer whales, or orcas, are the largest of the dolphins and one of the world's most powerful predators. They eat marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales, and are known to grab seals right off the ice.

"Drunk tourists warned over insurance coverDrinking excessive alcohol can invalidate travel insurance cover, but the burden of proof is on the insurer.10h10 hours agoBusiness","A man who fell and hit his head after ""drinking all night"" was correctly refused travel insurance cover, an ombudsman has said. Yet, another man who slipped over in a nightclub's toilets after a drink while on holiday should have been covered. The cases have been featured by the financial ombudsman to highlight the small print and rules surrounding travel insurance disputes. It said tourists should not be expected to have been sober to win a claim. The burden of proof was on the insurer to prove that too much drinking was to blame. Many insurers have a clause in travel insurance policies that means cover is refused if the policyholder's accident was caused by excessive alcohol. If the insurer refuses to pay for the medical expenses, the customer can appeal to the financial ombudsman to make an independent ruling. The organisation looked at nearly 900 travel insurance complaints in the last three months of 2017, to highlight some of the issues involved. ""Insurers may choose not to pay out if they believe someone's been drinking excessively, although this doesn't necessarily mean holidays should be totally alcohol-free,"" said chief financial ombudsman Caroline Wayman. ""In each case, we'll need to carefully weigh up all the evidence to decide, on balance, whether the insurer has made the right call. ""Encouragingly, compared with recent years, we're generally upholding fewer travel insurance complaints. This suggests, while there is still clearly work to do, that many insurers are increasingly treating their customers in a fair and reasonable way."" Drinking is a major part of many holidays (posed by a model) In the nightclub case, the ombudsman told the insurer to pay up for a man's medical treatment costs. The man said he had been drinking, but that he was not drunk at the time. The ombudsman decided that, on balance, it did not think the evidence showed it was more likely than not that excessive alcohol consumption had caused his accident. However, in the other case highlighted, an insurer sent the ombudsman medical records showing the emergency doctor diagnosed the injured man with ""acute alcohol intoxication"". These records also said he had not been able to sign a form when he arrived at the hospital, and other records made during his ambulance trip suggested he had said he had been drinking all night. Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' 'Emotional support peacock' barred from United Airlines plane M&S plans to close up to 14 stores The ombudsman said figures show more than 21.9 million people from the UK went on summer holidays abroad in 2017. Overall there were 3,000 complaints about travel insurance made to the ombudsman last year. It ruled that the insurers had not treated their customers fairly in nearly four in 10 cases. A spokeswoman for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said: ""Travel insurance is a lifeline for people who run into trouble overseas, with insurers paying out more than a million pounds every day. ""More than half of this funds emergency medical treatment for people who have been badly injured or have fallen seriously ill. As with any insurance, customers do have a responsibility not to behave recklessly. ""Insurers know people will likely want to drink alcohol while they are on holiday and they don't expect you to stay sober all the time, but there is a danger of invalidating your cover if you drink so much that it makes you act dangerously or means you are out of control."" Overall, the financial ombudsman handled 81,647 new cases on a variety of subjects between October and December. The majority (54%) were complaints about the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. Energy drink + alcohol = trouble?

Bitcoin - the Revenue comes calling,"Bitcoin came close to crossing $20,000 in December but dipped below $10,000 in January It is that time of year many a self-employed person dreads, the deadline to submit your tax return and pay anything you owe. But this year there is a question a select few should be asking themselves - have I profited from my investment in crypto-currencies? If you have, you could be liable for tax. In 2014 Revenue & Customs publishedguidelines,externalmaking clear the different taxes that apply to any earnings from crypto-currencies. For most people who have bought a few bitcoins some years ago, it is Capital Gains Tax that will be relevant. This will apply to any profits, once you hit the Â£11,300 CGT threshold, not just if they are converted into a standard currency but if they are used to buy other crypto-currencies such as Ethereum or to invest in initial coin offerings (ICOs). But in recent weeks there is some evidence that a few people are making trading in crypto-currencies a full-time job, in which case they are likely to be liable for income tax on their earnings. Now, the acceleration in the value of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies happened over the course of 2017 so it is unlikely many people will have incurred tax liabilities in 2016-17, the year HMRC is currently examining. But over recent months there has been a flood of Bitcoin money heading into everything from ICOs to property - so next year there should in theory be a big boost for the government's Capital Gains Tax receipts. One accountant told me plenty of his clients had piled into Bitcoin but seemed unaware of the tax implications. What is clear is the whole crypto-currency industry is now under the spotlight of regulators around the world. They are concerned not just about tax evasion but money laundering and major fraud. In the United States this week theSecurities and Exchange Commission got a court orderto halt an ICO attempting to raise $1bn (Â£0.7bn) to fund what was claimed to be the world's first ""decentralised"" bank. The regulator alleges this was a scam that had already used what it described as fraudulent tactics to raise as much as $600m, including failing to disclose the criminal background of key executives. AriseBank has blamed the dispute on ""confusion"" over its activities and crypto-currencies. Accountants have a warning for those who invest their crypto-currency gains in schemes that turn out to be fraudulent - if you lose your money, you won't even be able to write it off against tax.

"Logan Paul 'more popular' than ZoellaStudy suggests children are seeking edgier content on YouTube, their favourite online site.6h6 hours agoTechnology","Logan Paul replacing Zoella as children's favourite could indicate a change in the content they want, say researchers Controversial vlogger Logan Paul has knocked Zoella off the top spot as UK children's favourite YouTuber, according to a study. Paul was embroiled in a row earlier this year when he posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim. His rise suggested children were seeking ""edgier"" content, said an analyst for research firm Childwise. It was likely children had been exposed to ""shocking content"", he added. The Childwise study looked at the media habits of 2,000 children in the UK aged five to 16. It found that YouTube was now the most popular online destination, with virtually all five to 16-year-olds visiting the site. ""Zoella losing her top YouTuber slot to Logan Paul shows that we could be moving into a new era with a change in the kind of vloggers that are popular with children,"" said Simon Leggett, research director. ""Children used to mainly follow wholesome, big-sister/brother types who offered chatty advice and company. However, children's favourite new vloggers are more edgy, with a style more akin to negative playground behaviour where the most popular vloggers are the ones that do the worst possible things they can get away with on YouTube."" Paul has been criticised for a video, filmed in Japan's infamous suicide forest, showing a dead body. It was removed from YouTube, following a barrage of criticism and the vlogger was taken off the site's Preferred programme, which lets brands sell ads on the top 5% content creators. The site also said it was putting ""on hold"" other projects with the US vlogger. ""Prior to this year, Logan had not been chosen by children at all,"" said Mr Leggett. ""His growing audience, which starts as young as age nine, were potentially exposed to shocking content over new year after Logan's ill-considered decision to upload a widely criticised video of his visit to Aokigahara, Japan's 'suicide forest.'"" Paul apologised for the video, saying he did not expect to be forgiven. YouTube is now the most popular online destination for children aged five to 16 The Childwise study looked at the overall media habits of children. It suggested that more than half of children now use Instagram, while messaging app WhatsApp has also increased significantly in popularity, with two in five saying they use it. Twitter and Facebook however, continue to face a decline in popularity among the younger audience. Only one in five said they used Twitter while Facebook was more likely to be used by girls -  only 2% of boys made mention of it. The research also found that children now watch more video on devices than on traditional TVs and are embracing voice-activated devices such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. It could be creating an ""Alexa generation"", postulated Mr Leggett. ""There is no requirement for children to use any common courtesy when using voice recognition technology, and with so many young children interacting with these devices, asking for help with homework, requesting songs, turning devices on and off, it is possible this abbreviated language could spill over into conversations in real life. ""Will children become accustomed to saying and doing whatever they want to a digital assistant, 'Do this, Do that,' talking as aggressively or rudely as they like without any consequences? Will they then start doing the same to shop assistants or teachers?"" he asked.

"Stop boiling lobsters alive, says campaign","More than 50 high-profile campaigners and celebrities have called for stronger protection to prevent lobsters and crabs being cooked alive. They have signed a letter urging Environment Secretary Michael Gove to categorise the crustaceans as sentient organisms in a new Animal Welfare Bill. The organisers point to mounting scientific evidence that shows the animals can feel pain. Signatories include presenter Chris Packham and comedian Bill Bailey. They also include representatives from the RSPCA and the British Veterinary Association. Establishing whether some animal groups feel pain can take years of scientific research. But there has been considerable scientific research on sentience in decapods - the crustacean group that includes lobsters and crabs - since Parliament passed the Animal Welfare Act in 2006. What's the kindest way to kill a lobster? Maisie Tomlinson, from the campaign group Crustacean Compassion, which organised the letter, told BBC News: ""It's really not acceptable to be boiling animals alive, to be cutting them up alive. ""All the evidence out there at the moment points to the notion that they're capable of experiencing pain."" The letter to Mr Gove says: ""In light of the extreme practices they are subjected to, we call on the government to include decapod crustaceans under the definition of 'animal' in the Animal Welfare Bill (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) and in the Animal Welfare Act 2006."" Presenters Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan are among those who have signed the letter While lobsters and crabs are certainly animals in the biological sense, the letter points out that ""in the UK, decapods fall outside of the legal definition of 'animal' in the Animal Welfare Act 2006, and so there is currently no legal requirement for food processors, supermarkets or restaurants to consider their welfare during storage, handling or killing."" It is necessary to either cook or freeze lobsters and crabs quickly after they are killed, because the meat spoils rapidly. But campaigners say there are now more humane killing methods - as well as ways of stunning the animals into unconsciousness - that have little impact on food preparation. ""There is no economic or culinary reason why decapods cannot be humanely dispatched, yet killing is sometimes preceded by breaking off the legs, head or tail, and is often accomplished by boiling alive,"" the letter states. Ms Tomlinson said decapods fulfilled 14 scientific measures for experiencing pain. While there was uncertainty over two remaining criteria, this was because the relevant scientific studies had not yet been carried out. In a BBC News article published earlier this year,Prof Robert Elwood, from Queen's University Belfast, said  numerous experiments showed ""rapid avoidance learning, and [crustaceans] giving up highly valuable resources to avoid certain noxious stimuli"" - consistent with the idea of pain. Campaigners say there's no reason why decapods cannot be humanely dispatched before cooking The 2006 Animal Welfare Act became law just before the European Food and Safety Authority  published a report classifying decapod crustaceans as so-called Category One animals, where ""the scientific evidence clearly indicatesâ¦ that animals in those groups are able to experience pain and distress"". The government has launched a public consultation on a new Animal Welfare Bill, and campaigners want to use the opportunity to amend what they see as a significant oversight. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told BBC News: ""We are committed to the very highest standards of animal welfare. ""As the prime minister has set out, we will make the United Kingdom a world leader in the care and protection of animals as we leave the EU. ""We are currently consulting on the draft Bill and will consider responses when bringing the Bill forwards."" More than 23,000 people have already signed a petition online to support the law change. Signatories to the letter include television presenter Michaela Strachan; Dr Julia Wrathall, chief scientific officer for the RSPCA; the executive director of Humane Society International Claire Bass, University of Sussex neuroscientist Prof Anil Seth; and Prof John Webster, animal husbandry expert at the University of Bristol.

A new Kennedy in spotlight,"This video can not be played Democratic congressman Joseph Kennedy III said he was speaking for all Americans Another member of the Kennedy political dynasty delivered the Democratic response to President Trump's State of the Union speech. But what do we know about him? He has one of the most famous surnames in US history. Now US Representative Joe Kennedy III has stepped into the national spotlight as he delivered the traditional rebuttal to the president's State of the Union. Although well known in Massachusetts political circles, this was the first time Mr Kennedy came to ""prime time"". In a speech that had several jabs at the president, he said: ""Bullies never win."" And in Spanish, he told childhood immigrants who fear deportation because Obama-era protections may soon expire: ""You are part of our story."" Some of the reaction to his rebuttal, however, centred on apparent moisture at the side of his mouth. Republican pollster Frank Luntz compared it to Republican Senator Marco Rubio's case of ""dry mouth"" during the 2013 rebuttal, when he had to reach for a glass of water. But in a subsequent tweet, Mr Luntz said of Mr Kennedy that it was ""only a matter of time before he takes the national stage"". Allow Twitter content?

State of the Union explained,"US President Joe Biden will deliver his third State of the Union address on Thursday 7 March. The annual event is the keynote speech by the president to Congress in which he sets out his agenda for the next year, highlights his accomplishments to the American people, and shapes a political message. It is a requirement of theUS constitution,externalthat the president ""shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient"". That requirement has been interpreted differently in the more than 200 years since President George Washington delivered the first in 1790 in New York, then the US capital. In recent decades the State of the Union has become one of the major media events of the US political calendar, a closely watched affair that is countered by a rebuttal address from the opposition. ""Washington is amazed"", was the Washington Post headline after Mr Wilson spoke George W Bush But through much of the 19th Century, presidents sent only a written statement. The third president, Thomas Jefferson, objected to appearing in person - saying it was too much like an imperial or king's speech, and for the next 100 years presidents sent a written message to Congress that was then read out for them. President Woodrow Wilson, who led the United States into World War I, was the first president since John Adams to address Congress directly, in 1913urging reform of high US tariff barriers.,external Woodrow Wilson, seen here on the back of a train, revived the practice of the spoken address But as the power of the presidency has increased in the last century, the importance of the State of the Union speech has grown. And that power has been reinforced by the role of television and radio, which have allowed the president to address the American people directly. In 1922, Warren Harding became the first president to broadcast his speech live on the radio, according to the US House of Representatives clerk's office. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who took office in 1933, was a master of the radio address. His ""Four Freedoms"" State of the Union speech,externalin 1941 outlined the rights that Americans would soon be fighting for as the US edged towards joining World War II. By 1947, under President Harry Truman, the State of the Union speech was televised - and by the 1960s it was moved to a 21:00 evening time slot to gain a greater television audience. It is traditionally carried live by all major US broadcast networks. Mr Trump addresses Congress after winning the election In later years President Lyndon Johnson used the State of the Union tolaunch his Great Society programme,externalto end poverty in America, while in 1994 Bill Clinton promoted hisstalled plan for healthcare reform,external. But two of the most memorable State of the Union messages came in the 19th Century. In 1823, President James Monroeoutlined the ""Monroe Doctrine"",external, which called for the European powers to cease interfering in the affairs of the Americas, and endorsed the movement for independence by South American nations from Spain. And in 1862, President Abraham Lincoln expressed his desire for the Civil War to lead to the emancipation of the slaves, which was later realised in his Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves in the Southern states in rebellion from the Union. In Abraham Lincoln's speech he outlined his vision to free the slaves The State of the Union speech has always been flexible - addressing both domestic and foreign policy needs. In 1996, a year after his party lost control of the US House of Representatives for the first time in 42 years, Democratic President Bill Clinton famously declared ""the era of big government is over"". Bill Clinton In 2002 and 2003 President George W Bush used his State of the Union speech to argue the moral case for war against Iraq,labelling the regime part of the ""axis of evil"" that threatened world peace.,external A key message ofMr Bush's last State of the Union in 2008,externalresonated deeply in retrospect. ""At kitchen tables across our country, there is concern about our economic future,"" he said, months before the credit crunch become a full financial meltdown. He added: ""In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth."" The following year, in his first address to Congress, Democratic President Barack Obama spoke to a nation in the midst of economic crisis. ""I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before,"" he said. In his final State of the Union, Mr Obama surprised Vice-President Joe Biden, who had recently lost a son to brain cancer, with a special assignment to lead a cancer-research task force. ""For the loved ones we've all lost, for the families that we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all,"" he said. ""What do you say, Joe?"" Republican Congressman Joe Wilson shouted ""You lie"" at Mr Obama during his remarks in 2009 The State of the Union is held in the House of Representatives' chamber in the US Capitol, and begins with a formal invitation. The House's sergeant at arms announces the president, who enters to a standing ovation. Supreme Court Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg admitted to falling asleep during a speech by Mr Obama After the president delivers the address, the opposition party typically responds with a televised address from a politician it wants to showcase. As is customary when the nation's top leaders are gathered at a single location, one member of the cabinet - the designated survivor - does not attend the State of the Union address. He or she remains at a secure location to ensure continuity of government should a catastrophic event occur. In recent years, newly-elected presidents have addressed joint sessions of Congress shortly after taking office and while these have not been officially recorded as State of the Union speeches, they have widely been perceived as such.

A smoother Trump with same hard edge,"Donald Trump took a measured tone. His speech was garnished in flowery, high-minded language. But beneath it all was the same hard edge. On immigration, deregulation, taxes and cultural flashpoints, the president offered policies - and claimed victories for accomplishments - that have won him the praise of his base and stirred the ire of his political opponents. Last year in his address to Congress, Trump laid out an ambitious agenda, but aside from tax reform, many of his big-ticket legislative directives were either derailed in Congress or languished without ever becoming concrete proposals. On Tuesday night it was time to reform the battalion and head, once more, unto the breach. Here are some key takeaways - as well as an early judgement on how they might fare in the battles to come. Eleven months ago, the newly inaugurated president gave a speech to Congress that was warmly received, even by some Trump critics on the left. Mr Trump at one point pledged to put""trivial fights behind us"". It hasn't exactly turned out that way. Now the president is again preaching national unity. The question is whether a divided American public - nearly half of whom ""strongly disapprove"" of the president - can still be converted. Claims of a ""new American moment"" and lines like ""for the last year we have sought to restore bonds of trust between our citizens and our government"" may fall on deaf ears among all but the president's loyal followers. In particular Democrats may have tuned out because that ""trust"" line came immediately after talk about honouring the flag and standing for the national anthem - not-so-veiled references to the president's sharp attacks on NFL player protests. This video can not be played Standing ovation v stony-faced silence The president has a list of accomplishments of which he can - and does - boast, but they were largely moves to please his base. His task, which will take more than one night, is to convince more of the public that his accomplishments are in their interest. There's a reason Mr Trump touted the US economy right at the top of his speech. He hopes Americans, many of whom view the nation as on the wrong track, will change their minds when they look at their bank accounts in the months to come. Outlook:Just a few days after his last congressional speech, Mr Trump tweeted about his suspicions that Barack Obama had his ""wires tapped"" during the campaign. The ""kinder, gentler"" Trump was gone in a flash. How long can this one last? Democrats want protections for undocumented migrants who entered the US as children. The president wants sweeping changes to rules governing legal immigration and billions of dollars for border security, including his border wall. Mr Trump promised in his address on Tuesday to extend an ""open hand"" to Democrats. Several weeks ago he said that any comprehensive agreement needed to be a ""bill of love"". In between those two lines, however, was a government shutdown and considerable acrimony.  The president has belittled his Democratic opponents and accused them of endorsing open borders and increased crime. And that ""open hand"" quote, which was released to the press before the speech, looked considerably different when it turned out to be surrounded by extended passages about immigrant crime, gangs and a not-so-veiled swipe that ""Americans are dreamers too"". Perhaps this is all just part of his negotiating style, to be shrugged off when a deal is near. But with Democrats worried that their base won't allow them to back down from a fight, a promise of co-operation probably won't be enough. Outlook:An open hand can be a gesture of kindness or the prelude to a slap. The chasm between the two sides is just as wide as it was yesterday.In fact, it may be wider. It has become a running joke in Washington circles to exclaim something like ""infrastructure week is off to a great start"" any time an administration-friendly news cycle is upended by a Trump-created conflagration. A White House focus on an infrastructure investment programme has been frequently promised and oft-delayed. Now it's back as a topic of conversation - this time, with an anti-regulation twist. The president received cross-party cheers for calling for big spending - $1.5tn - but Democrats sat on their hands when told it could come from subsidised private investment. He also held out the hope that building projects would be easier to accomplish by cutting red tape. This video can not be played Democratic congressman Joseph Kennedy III said he was speaking for all Americans ""We built the Empire State Building in just one year,"" Mr Trump said. ""Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?"" There were other areas of possible bipartisan compromise - on lowering prescription drug prices, job training, prison reform and family leave legislation - but they were only mentioned in passing. Infrastructure, it seemed, was where the president is most likely to make an extended effort. Outlook:Spending money on bridges and roads is popular. It creates local jobs and makes constituents happy. Democrats like it. Republicans like it. The president likesit. While deregulation may be a sticking point, this is a deal waiting to get done.

'UK should fortify flour with folic acid',"This video can not be played Why is folic acid important? There are fresh calls for the government to fortify flour with folic acid in the UK to help protect babies from common birth defects. A new study concludes higher doses of the B vitamin, which can prevent spina bifida in unborn babies, will not harm the general public. Folic acid is added to flour in more than 80 countries worldwide, but the UK has previously held off. Women are advised to take folic acid before pregnancy, but many don't. Fortification would provide extra cover, say experts. The idea of mandatory fortification has already been backed by health ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not England. The latest research, published in Public Health Reviews, claims evidence for limiting intake of folic acid to no more than 1mg a day is out-of-date and flawed. The new re-analysis of the data finds no relationship between higher levels of folic acid and harm, although some say there is still not enough proof to say fortification is entirely safe. Research had previously suggested that high doses of folic acid could cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, cramps, sleep disorders, confusion, nausea and seizures. It can also cover up the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, which is a particular concern in older people. Prof David Smith, an expert in pharmacology at the University of Oxford, said: ""The matter has not been resolved."" However, Prof Tom Sanders, nutrition expert at King's College London, said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence in support of the case for folic acid fortification to prevent neural tube defects. A neural tube defect involves abnormal development of the brain, spine or spinal cord. Approximately one in 1,000 pregnancies in the UK is affected. Researchers say the cost of adding folic acid would be ""pennies"". Under the government's 1998 Bread and Flour regulations, white flour is already fortified with iron, calcium and some vitamins - at a cost of just 71p per tonne of flour. Lead author, Prof Sir Nicholas Wald, of the Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine, said: ""Fortification would be a major saving. ""Failing to fortify flour with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is like having a polio vaccine and not using it."" Study co-author Prof Sir Colin Blakemore, from the University of London, said: ""If you can dispel the argument for harm... you are left only with the fact that not fortifying flour denies a proven and clear benefit to a significant proportion of the population."" The US has seen a 23% fall in pregnancies with neural tube defects (spina bifida and anencephaly) since the policy was introduced in 1998. Folic acid occurs naturally in dark green leafy vegetables but research has suggested three-quarters of women across the UK don't consume sufficient levels. It is voluntarily added to some breakfast cereals and spreads, but it is very difficult for pregnant women to get enough from diet alone. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We want mums-to-be to have healthy pregnancies, and NHS guidance is that women planning a pregnancy should take a daily supplement of 400 micrograms of folic acid before conception and until the 12th week of pregnancy. We also recommend eating more folate-rich foods to reduce the risk of neural tube defects."" spinach, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli beans and legumes (e.g. peas, blackeye beans) yeast and beef extracts oranges and orange juice wheat bran and other whole grain foods poultry, pork, shellfish and liver fortified foods (e.g. some brands of breakfast cereals - check the label).

Logan Paul 'more popular' than Zoella,"Logan Paul replacing Zoella as children's favourite could indicate a change in the content they want, say researchers Controversial vlogger Logan Paul has knocked Zoella off the top spot as UK children's favourite YouTuber, according to a study. Paul was embroiled in a row earlier this year when he posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim. His rise suggested children were seeking ""edgier"" content, said an analyst for research firm Childwise. It was likely children had been exposed to ""shocking content"", he added. The Childwise study looked at the media habits of 2,000 children in the UK aged five to 16. It found that YouTube was now the most popular online destination, with virtually all five to 16-year-olds visiting the site. ""Zoella losing her top YouTuber slot to Logan Paul shows that we could be moving into a new era with a change in the kind of vloggers that are popular with children,"" said Simon Leggett, research director. ""Children used to mainly follow wholesome, big-sister/brother types who offered chatty advice and company. However, children's favourite new vloggers are more edgy, with a style more akin to negative playground behaviour where the most popular vloggers are the ones that do the worst possible things they can get away with on YouTube."" Paul has been criticised for a video, filmed in Japan's infamous suicide forest, showing a dead body. It was removed from YouTube, following a barrage of criticism and the vlogger was taken off the site's Preferred programme, which lets brands sell ads on the top 5% content creators. The site also said it was putting ""on hold"" other projects with the US vlogger. ""Prior to this year, Logan had not been chosen by children at all,"" said Mr Leggett. ""His growing audience, which starts as young as age nine, were potentially exposed to shocking content over new year after Logan's ill-considered decision to upload a widely criticised video of his visit to Aokigahara, Japan's 'suicide forest.'"" Paul apologised for the video, saying he did not expect to be forgiven. YouTube is now the most popular online destination for children aged five to 16 The Childwise study looked at the overall media habits of children. It suggested that more than half of children now use Instagram, while messaging app WhatsApp has also increased significantly in popularity, with two in five saying they use it. Twitter and Facebook however, continue to face a decline in popularity among the younger audience. Only one in five said they used Twitter while Facebook was more likely to be used by girls -  only 2% of boys made mention of it. The research also found that children now watch more video on devices than on traditional TVs and are embracing voice-activated devices such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. It could be creating an ""Alexa generation"", postulated Mr Leggett. ""There is no requirement for children to use any common courtesy when using voice recognition technology, and with so many young children interacting with these devices, asking for help with homework, requesting songs, turning devices on and off, it is possible this abbreviated language could spill over into conversations in real life. ""Will children become accustomed to saying and doing whatever they want to a digital assistant, 'Do this, Do that,' talking as aggressively or rudely as they like without any consequences? Will they then start doing the same to shop assistants or teachers?"" he asked.

Hawaii officials resign over missile alert,"This video can not be played People were warned to take shelter Two top civilian officials from Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency have resigned over the sending of a false incoming missile alert. The 13 January message led to widespread panic and the authorities took 38 minutes to correct it. Administrator Vern Miyagi and executive officer Toby Clairmont stepped down on Tuesday after reports detailing the agency's failures were released. The individual who sent the alert has also been fired, officials confirmed. ""A combination of human error and inadequate safeguards contributed to this false alert,""the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said in a preliminary report into the incident released on Tuesday,external. The report said the mix-up happened after a midnight supervisor at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency decided to conduct a spontaneous drill during a shift transition. The incoming day supervisor was then said to be unaware the 08:05 drill would involve any incoming day officers, who were then not told about the exercise. Hawaii correction was delayed by forgotten log in How Hawaii reacted to false missile alert Shock, blame and apologies after missile warning The drill message, which was called in pretending to be from US Pacific Command, began and ended with the words: ""Exercise! Exercise! Exercise!"". But the warning also said ""This is not a drill"", in a script that the FCC say was different from established procedure. Hawaii Governor David Ige admitted he could not correct the warning as he had forgotten his Twitter log-in According to the federal report, the employee was one of three who received the call but did not hear the exercise warning. Believing it was real, they said they sent out the genuine alert out using the agency's software. The official whose identity remains unknown, was temporarily reassigned after the incident, but has now been fired from the agency by state officials. The FCC said the employee had so far refused to cooperate with investigators beyond submitting a written statement. A state report also released on Tuesday said the employee had a record of ""poor performance"" on the job. Reports say he had been a source of concern for colleagues for 10 years, having confused emergency drills with real life incidents on at least two occasions. The FCC report acknowledged that the Hawaiian agency had already taken steps to avoid a repeat of the incident, and now required secondary approval before an alert could be sent out. Previously they did not have checks in place to stop individuals sending out a warning to mobile devices and state radio and television without higher approval. The report alleges the agency was conducting an ""atypical"" amount of drills without prior notice, which federal investigators say ""heightened the potential for an error to occur"". They are also said to have failed to develop procedures for response to any accidental false alarm, resulting in them having to use social media to correct the mistake.

Mosque attack suspect hoped to kill Corbyn,"The man accused of driving a van into a crowd of people near a north London mosque had hoped to kill Jeremy Corbyn. Darren Osborne, 48, has denied he was behind the wheel during the attack on 19 June 2017, telling Woolwich Crown Court a ""guy called Dave"" was driving. He said they originally hired the van to kill the Labour leader on a march he was expected to attend. Mr Osborne also said that it ""would have been even better"" if London Mayor Sadiq Khan had been present. ""It would have been like winning the lottery,"" he added. Mr Osborne is accused of mowing down people in Finsbury Park, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others. He denies charges of murder and attempted murder. Taking to the witness box, Mr Osborne said he met Dave at a pub in Treforest, South Wales, in early April or March last year, while he also met a man called Terry Jones, and that the trio discussed their political views. Mr Osborne said they initially planned to murder a Labour politician in Rochdale, before planning to target Mr Corbyn, believing he would be at the annual Al Quds march in London. He told the court he was alone in the van as he drove towards the march - but that ""road blocks"" in central London had ""thwarted their plans"". Later, he said he travelled to the Finsbury Park area, because ""it was Jeremy Corbyn's constituency"", where he met the others. Mr Osborne said they swapped drivers and he was ""in the footwell"" while Dave was driving, adding he had ""no idea"" where Dave went after the collision. He said the opportunity to attack the Labour leader would mean ""one less terrorist off our streets"". Asked if he had contact with Terry and Dave after the attack, Mr Osborne told the court they were planning to form a far-right group, adding: ""We were going to call ourselves the 'Taffia'."" Earlier, the court heard evidence on whether Mr Osborne acted with accomplices - namely two men, known only as ""Dave"" and ""Terry Jones"". Concluding the prosecution case, Jonathan Rees QC said Mr Osborne told the Metropolitan Police on the day of the attack that he was acting alone. Police footage appearing to show Mr Osborne in the back of a police van He read a statement from Det Con Paul Dring, who interviewed Mr Osborne as he was under armed guard at University College Hospital, on the day of the attack. During the interview, Mr Osborne told DC Dring: ""I'm flying solo"", the court heard. Mr Osborne is said to have spoken to officers after he was detained and told them he ""lost control"" of his van. The court was shown footage from the body camera of PC David Jones, who is said to have handcuffed Mr Osborne while he was on the ground after the incident. A man - who the prosecution says is Mr Osborne - can be heard saying: ""I lost control of the van"", and ""lost control, man"". Mr Jones then says: ""Were you driving, yeah?"" and the man is heard to reply: ""Yeah"". Asked if he had been drinking, the man said he had consumed a ""couple of pints"". Mr Osborne denies the murder of Mr Ali and attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"". Mr Ali, from Haringey, had collapsed at the roadside shortly before being hit by the vehicle after leaving a prayer meeting.

May announces education deals with China,"Trade between China and the UK is worth Â£59bn Theresa May has announced new education links with China as she arrives for a three-day visit to boost trade and investment after Brexit. The initiative includes the extension of a Maths teacher exchange programme and a campaign to promote English language learning in China. The UK prime minister has claimed her visit ""will intensify the golden era in UK-China relations"". But she has stressed China must adhere to free and fair trade practices. In an article for the Financial Times ahead of her arrival, she acknowledged that London and Beijing did not see ""eye-to-eye"" on a number of issues - and she promised to raise concerns from UK industry about the over-production of steel and the protection of intellectual property against piracy. Other issues likely to be discussed include North Korea and climate change. It is not clear whether they will include human rights in Hong Kong. Mrs May, who will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, is travelling at the head of a 50-strong business delegation, including BP and Jaguar Land Rover, as well as small firms and universities including Manchester and Liverpool. Her first stop, Wuhan, in central China, is home to the largest number of students of any city in the world. The education deal includes: Extension of a maths teacher exchange programme for a further two years to 2020, enabling around 200 English teachers to visit China Joint training of pre-school staff in the UK and China Better information-sharing on vocational education The launch of an ""English is GREAT"" campaign to promote English language learning in China Education deals worth more than Â£550m, which it is claimed will create 800 jobs in the UK Mrs May said new agreements signed on her trip would ""enable more children and more young people than ever to share their ideas about our two great nations"", helping to ensure that ""our golden era of co-operation will endure for generations to come"". Foreign adventures cannot obscure May's Brexit backdrop Could the UK really join TPP? During the three-day trip, Mrs May is expected to focus on extending existing commercial partnerships rather than scoping out new post-Brexit deals. She said she expected China to play a ""huge role"" in the economic development of the world, adding: ""I want that future to work for Britain, which is why, during my visit, I'll be deepening co-operation with China on key global and economic issues that are critical to our businesses, to our people, and to what the UK stands for."" She acknowledged that her agenda ""will not be delivered in one visit: it must be our shared objective over the coming years"". But she added: ""I'm confident that, as China continues to open up, co-operation and engagement will ensure its growing role on the global stage delivers not just for China, but for the UK and the wider world."" In a statement ahead of the visit, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said Beijing saw Mrs May's trip as ""an opportunity to achieve new development of the China-UK global comprehensive strategic partnership"". But asked whether the UK had achieved its aim of becoming China's closest partner in the West, he replied: ""Co-operation can always be bettered. As to whether China and Britain have become the closest partners, we may need to wait and see how Prime Minister May's visit this time plays out."" Critics accuse China of abandoning its ""one country, two systems"" pledge on Hong Kong In recent years, both countries have hailed a ""golden era"" in UK-Sino relations. China has signalled its desire to invest in high-profile UK infrastructure projects, including the building of a new nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point - although its involvement has raised some national security concerns. British trade with China has increased by 60% since 2010 and UK ministers are expected to use the trip to stress that the UK will remain an ""excellent place to do business"" after it leaves the EU next year. The UK has said it will prioritise negotiating free trade agreements with major trading partners such as the United States, Australia and Canada after it leaves the EU in March 2019. Earlier this year, the UK said it would not rule out becoming a member of the Trans Pacific Partnership free-trade zone, whose members include Japan, South Korea and Vietnam and which is considered by many as a counter-weight to Chinese influence in the region. US President Donald Trump and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have both visited China recently Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, has urged Mrs May to use the visit to privately raise what he says has been the steady erosion of freedoms and rights in the former British colony in recent years. Hong Kong is supposed to have distinct legal autonomy under the terms of its handover to China in 1997. In a letter to the PM, Lord Patten and ex-Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said its residents needed assurances that the UK's growing commercial relationship with China would not ""come at the cost of our obligations to them"".

What to watch for,"It is the blockbuster US news event of the week, with an estimated 40 million people preparing to tune in to watch President Donald Trump deliver his first State of the Union address. The keynote speech will be an opportunity for the president to outline his agenda for the next 12 months, shape political policy and highlight past accomplishments. ""It's a big speech, an important speech,"" Mr Trump said on Monday. But what can we expect? ""The economy will be front and centre,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday. After a turbulent first year in office, President Trump is very likely to start with the positives - his tax reforms that were passed through the Senate at the end of last year. They are the most significant overhaul of the US tax code in a generation, slashing corporate and individual tax rates. Many expect him to link these reforms with America's improving economy, roaring stock markets and lowering unemployment rates. Plans to rebuild some of America's aging roads and other infrastructure may also get a mention, as well as demands for reciprocal trade with China. Trump tax cuts: Why they matter to us all Deep divisions remain between Democrats and Republicans over immigration reform, and the president is expected to push for a bipartisan solution. At the heart of his proposal are the 700,000 young people who entered the US illegally and without documents as children, so-called Dreamers. His decision to overturn a scheme - Daca - that shields these people from deportation outraged Democrats. The president may touch on the subject as he is hoping to draw Democrats in with a deal to overturn these plans, in return for securing billions for a proposed border wall with Mexico, and cuts to legal immigration levels. All eyes and cameras will be trained on at least 24 Democratic lawmakers who are bringing Dreamers as their guests to watch the show, according to ABC News. What is this immigration debate all about? It won't be his first speech in Congress as Donald Trump addressed both houses last February, when he stated the US was witnessing a ""renewal of the American spirit"". In fact,he surprised many by adopting a more presidential and measured tone than expected. However, just days after this speech, he returned with a claim on Twitter that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had hacked his phones during the presidential campaign. The tone of his maiden State of the Union address remains to be seen, but many will be wondering whether he will stick to the script - or the teleprompter - like he did last time. What is the State of the Union speech? The issue that has completely overshadowed Donald Trump's first year in office is unlikely to come up today - the investigation into whether he or his campaign colluded with Russia to sway the election in his favour. Mr Trump has condemned the Russia probe as a witch hunt, though he recently said he would testify under oath if his lawyers agreed. While it would take many by surprise if he raised the subject, it would not be the first time a sitting president has addressed an ongoing investigation around them. Bill Clinton avoided mentioning his impeachment trial in the State of the Union in 1999 In 1974 Richard Nixon used his State of the Union address to call for an end to the Watergate investigation, telling lawmakers: ""One year of Watergate is enough!"" Months later he resigned over the scandal which involved a web of political spying, sabotage and bribery. President Bill Clinton adopted a different approach more than two decades later, when he was on trial for perjury and obstruction of justice over an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. He failed to mention the case in his address in 1999 and was later acquitted of the charges.

Scottish firefighters to be offered 20% pay rise,"Scotland's firefighters are being offered a pay rise of up to 20% if they agree to take on new responsibilities. It is expected that between 200 and 300 jobs could be cut from the service as part of the deal. Rather than a pay rise, it is being described as a new reward package for a new expanded role, tackling terrorism and providing emergency medical care. The Fire Brigades Union Scotland said it was ""wholly unacceptable"" that members had been contacted directly. In a Facebook post, it said the union had been in ongoing negotiations on standardisation of terms and conditions and received the final proposal on Monday along with a first proposal on ""service transformation for uniformed employees"". It said the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) bypassed nationally agreed collective bargaining processes and provided details of the service transformation proposal to its members directly before it could be considered by the union's Scottish regional committee and executive council. The amount officers get will depend on their current level of pay and special allowances. The offer is due to be discussed by the Scottish and UK Fire Brigade Union next week. Fire stations and crews 'to be cut' Fire service 'faces Â£43m funding gap' In a letter sent to rank and file officers, Scotland's fire chief Alasdair Hay outlines proposals to increase basic pay from Â£29,934 to Â£35,800 by 2021/22. He says the proposed new firefighter role would include emergency medical response and terrorism response. Firefighters would also be expected to respond to environmental events, wider youth and social prevention work and inspection and enforcement responsibilities. In their letter to officers, Mr Hay and Kirsty Darwent, chairwoman of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) board, say: ""For too long your pay has been eroded in real terms and we believe you deserve better."" And they rule out compulsory redundancies, insisting that the ""small reduction in whole time firefighter posts"" will be achieved through planned retirements. In a statement, Dr Darwent said the fire service would now enter negotiations with staff and unions. ""This service has set out very clearly how it needs to transform to meet the significant new and emerging risks that Scotland now faces, such as severe weather-related flooding and terror attack,"" she said. ""We are offering to pay our firefighters more - but we are asking them to do a lot more, by taking on a completely new role to enhance the safety of the communities they serve. ""This is a proposal. We will now enter into formal negotiations with staff and unions, and believe we can reach the right outcome for our firefighters and the people of Scotland."" There were 7,834 staff employed by Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) at 31 March 2017. This figure is 1% lower than in 2016 There are 700 fewer firefighters than 2013 when the fire service was merged The number of fire stations in Scotland on 31 March 2017 was unchanged from 2016 at 356 stations Two-thirds of all fire stations (240) are primarily RDS (retained duty system). These are mainly rural stations crewed by on-call, part-time fire officers 21% (74 stations) are full-time 12% (42 stations) are volunteer crewed A Scottish government spokesman said the government had provided extra funding for the fire service. ""Much progress has been made through fire reform, improving outcomes and access to specialist facilities while protecting frontline services and keeping people safe,"" he said. ""In the draft budget, we have increased spending capacity of SFRS by Â£15.5m for 2018-19, providing Â£5.5m extra and ensuring they keep Â£10m in full from VAT costs, to invest in transformation plans. ""This is on top of the Â£21.7m increase in the operational budget for the fire and rescue service this year to support investment in equipment and resources."" He added: ""Operational decisions on the allocation of resources are a matter for the SFRS board and chief officer, who have been exploring for some time now how best to develop the service to meet new and emerging risks, including how transformation could see SFRS do more for the people of Scotland. ""The process involves liaison with staff, partners and the public. ""The SFRS has indicated that their proposed reward package would be for a new, expanded role for firefighters, which, of course, is still to be negotiated and agreed with unions."" FBU Scotland said: ""It is wholly unacceptable for SFRS to now ignore our FBU structures by contacting members directly stating that the offer ""represents an extremely attractive proposal"" without giving any specific details on that proposal as well as any details on harmonisation of terms and conditions. ""We believe this could constitute a deliberate attempt to undermine our consultation with our members. ""We therefore strongly advise members not to engage with SFRS's request in considering the service transformation proposal as the FBU have not fully discussed the impact and details of this."" Scotland's eight regional fire services were merged into a single service almost five years ago. Since April 2013, the SFRS, which has a budget of about Â£260m, has lost more than 700 firefighters and been under pressure to keep costs down. In 2015,Audit Scotland warned of a potential funding gapof Â£42.7m by 2019/20. Documents seen by BBC Scotland last year revealed thatfire stations were to be closed and firefighter numbers cut.

Joe Kennedy to respond,"Joseph Kennedy III, part of the Kennedy political dynasty, will deliver the Democrats' response to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address on Tuesday. The speech will make him the public face of his party and the main voice countering the president's politics. Mr Kennedy came to attention last year for his criticism of Republican attempts to end Obamacare. The Massachusetts representative is considered a Democratic rising star. The speech will also greatly elevate the 37-year-old's profile and suggests the Democrats are willing to have a younger generation represent the party. What is the State of the Union speech? A kinder, gentler Trump Some political observers believe the three-time congressman will appeal to working- and middle-class voters, who the Democrats would argue have been neglected by Trump, despite his campaign pledges. ""Congressman Kennedy is a relentless fighter for working Americans,"" Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press release announcing his selection. Speaking to the Boston Globe, Mr Kennedy said: ""From healthcare to economic justice to civil rights,the Democratic agenda stands in powerful contrast to President Trump's broken promises to American families,external."" Mr Kennedy's speech will be followed by a Spanish-language response delivered by Elizabeth Guzman, the first Hispanic female immigrant elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. Joe Kennedy's great-uncle was President John F Kennedy (L) and his grandfather was Senator Robert Kennedy (R) Joe P Kennedy III comes from strong political stock. He is the grandson of Senator Robert Kennedy and the great-nephew of President John F Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s. His father, Joe P Kennedy II, was also Democratic member of the House of Representatives. Next week, the young Kennedy will follow in the footsteps of his other great-uncle, Edward Kennedy, who delivered the Democrats' official response to Ronald Reagan's State of the Union address in 1982.

Trump to hail 'new American moment',"This video can not be played Standing ovation v stony-faced silence A bullish US President Donald Trump has proclaimed a ""new American moment"" as he delivered his maiden State of the Union speech to Congress. In a primetime address, the Republican leader said he was ""extending an open hand"" to Democrats to work together. Mr Trump also saidhe was ordering Guantanamo Bay to be kept open, reversing an Obama-era directive to close the controversial detention camp. The American economy is booming but Mr Trump's approval rating languishes. Trump's speech: As it happened Four reactions to Trump speech Melania defies tradition to arrive alone In an upbeat message a world away from his apocalyptic ""American carnage"" inaugural speech of just a year ago, Mr Trump said his administration was ""building a safe, strong and proud America"". ""There has never been a better time to start living the American dream,"" he told lawmakers in a one-hour-and-20-minute speech. Nearly 46 million television viewers were expected to tune in as he implored the nation to come together as ""one team, one people and one American family"". Mr Trump made a plea for the kind of bipartisan co-operation that has been in short supply during a turbulent first year in office. The president, who has enraged Democrats by withdrawing protections for immigrants who entered the US illegally as children, offered an olive branch. ""Tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, colour and creed."" US First Lady Melania Trump arrived separately from her husband But he insisted on a border wall with Mexico and other concessions from Democrats as part of any over-arching immigration deal. Some Democrats hissed. This video can not be played What did a Trump voter and a 'Dreamer' think of the State of the Union? Reality Check: Seven Trump claims fact-checked What is the State of the Union speech? Mr Trump again touted his pet plan to rebuild America's ageing roads and other infrastructure, though he did not offer many details. The president said that 2.4 million jobs had been created on his watch. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low as the US continues its recovery from the recession of a decade ago. But Mr Trump's average job approval is jammed at 40%, according to Real Clear Politics. Massachusetts congressman Joseph Kennedy III, a great-nephew of President John F Kennedy, delivered the Democratic rebuttal. He attempted to seize Mr Trump's political mantle by purporting to speak for ""Americans who feel forgotten and forsaken"". This video can not be played Democratic congressman Joseph Kennedy III said he was speaking for all Americans Bewailing a ""fractured country"" and depicting the Trump presidency as ""chaos"", Mr Kennedy, 37, said: ""Many have spent the past year anxious, angry, afraid."" ""Bullies may land a punch,"" he said. ""They might leave a mark. ""But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defence of their future."" A new Kennedy in the political spotlight In one telling moment from Mr Trump's speech, members of the Democratic Congressional Black Caucus sat in stony-faced silence amid a standing ovation as the president noted African-American unemployment has hit a record low. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said Mr Trump's appeal for unity, after a year of ""divisive actions, petty insults and disgraceful race-baiting... ring hollow"". About a dozen Democratic lawmakers said they would boycott this State of the Union. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News You can tell a lot about a State of the Union address by where a president chooses to begin. On Tuesday night, Donald Trump delivered a polished speech that started by touting his economic record. Lower unemployment. Restored consumer and business confidence. A higher stock market. Mr Trump's poll numbers have lagged below the mark one would expect a leader presiding over a prosperous economy. The president, in his speech, set about trying to change that. When it came to policy, Mr Trump offered some bipartisan suggestions with few details, such as addressing high prescription drug prices, infrastructure investment, job training and prison reform. Where the president lingered, however, were on topics that will prove as divisive as ever. The paeans to patriotism and traditional values will be viewed by Democrats as a rekindling of culture wars. He spoke of religious liberty and standing for the national anthem, and Democrats sat stone-faced. The president's pledge to offer an open hand on immigration negotiations was surrounded by extended passages about immigrant crime and a veiled swipe that ""Americans are dreamers, too"". This speech had a softer touch. The language was smooth. The edge, however, was still as sharp. Read more of Anthony's analysis of the speech Trump calls for unity but divides media Mr Trump condemned ""depraved"" North Korea. He warned that Pyongyang's ""reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. ""We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening."" Mr Trump paid tribute to a disabled defector from the regime, Ji Seong-ho, who fled the country on crutches and was in the audience. Harrowing tale of Trump's North Korean defector The president also noted that nearly all the territory in Syria and Iraq once controlled by the Islamic State group has been retaken. ""We will continue our fight until [the Islamic State group] is defeated,"" Mr Trump vowed. While his two White House predecessors have used their State of the Union speeches to forecast victory for American forces in Afghanistan, Mr Trump largely skirted what is now America's longest war. In an apparent acknowledgment ofthe deteriorating security situationthere, he said the US ""military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines"". He only mentioned Russia once alongside China as a rival. Mr Trump did not refer to the federal inquiry into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, a controversy that is dogging his presidency and which both he and Russia have denied.

"May announces education deals with ChinaThe UK prime minister hopes her trip ""will intensify the golden era in UK-China relations"".1han hour agoUK Politics","Trade between China and the UK is worth Â£59bn Theresa May has announced new education links with China as she arrives for a three-day visit to boost trade and investment after Brexit. The initiative includes the extension of a Maths teacher exchange programme and a campaign to promote English language learning in China. The UK prime minister has claimed her visit ""will intensify the golden era in UK-China relations"". But she has stressed China must adhere to free and fair trade practices. In an article for the Financial Times ahead of her arrival, she acknowledged that London and Beijing did not see ""eye-to-eye"" on a number of issues - and she promised to raise concerns from UK industry about the over-production of steel and the protection of intellectual property against piracy. Other issues likely to be discussed include North Korea and climate change. It is not clear whether they will include human rights in Hong Kong. Mrs May, who will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, is travelling at the head of a 50-strong business delegation, including BP and Jaguar Land Rover, as well as small firms and universities including Manchester and Liverpool. Her first stop, Wuhan, in central China, is home to the largest number of students of any city in the world. The education deal includes: Extension of a maths teacher exchange programme for a further two years to 2020, enabling around 200 English teachers to visit China Joint training of pre-school staff in the UK and China Better information-sharing on vocational education The launch of an ""English is GREAT"" campaign to promote English language learning in China Education deals worth more than Â£550m, which it is claimed will create 800 jobs in the UK Mrs May said new agreements signed on her trip would ""enable more children and more young people than ever to share their ideas about our two great nations"", helping to ensure that ""our golden era of co-operation will endure for generations to come"". Foreign adventures cannot obscure May's Brexit backdrop Could the UK really join TPP? During the three-day trip, Mrs May is expected to focus on extending existing commercial partnerships rather than scoping out new post-Brexit deals. She said she expected China to play a ""huge role"" in the economic development of the world, adding: ""I want that future to work for Britain, which is why, during my visit, I'll be deepening co-operation with China on key global and economic issues that are critical to our businesses, to our people, and to what the UK stands for."" She acknowledged that her agenda ""will not be delivered in one visit: it must be our shared objective over the coming years"". But she added: ""I'm confident that, as China continues to open up, co-operation and engagement will ensure its growing role on the global stage delivers not just for China, but for the UK and the wider world."" In a statement ahead of the visit, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said Beijing saw Mrs May's trip as ""an opportunity to achieve new development of the China-UK global comprehensive strategic partnership"". But asked whether the UK had achieved its aim of becoming China's closest partner in the West, he replied: ""Co-operation can always be bettered. As to whether China and Britain have become the closest partners, we may need to wait and see how Prime Minister May's visit this time plays out."" Critics accuse China of abandoning its ""one country, two systems"" pledge on Hong Kong In recent years, both countries have hailed a ""golden era"" in UK-Sino relations. China has signalled its desire to invest in high-profile UK infrastructure projects, including the building of a new nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point - although its involvement has raised some national security concerns. British trade with China has increased by 60% since 2010 and UK ministers are expected to use the trip to stress that the UK will remain an ""excellent place to do business"" after it leaves the EU next year. The UK has said it will prioritise negotiating free trade agreements with major trading partners such as the United States, Australia and Canada after it leaves the EU in March 2019. Earlier this year, the UK said it would not rule out becoming a member of the Trans Pacific Partnership free-trade zone, whose members include Japan, South Korea and Vietnam and which is considered by many as a counter-weight to Chinese influence in the region. US President Donald Trump and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have both visited China recently Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, has urged Mrs May to use the visit to privately raise what he says has been the steady erosion of freedoms and rights in the former British colony in recent years. Hong Kong is supposed to have distinct legal autonomy under the terms of its handover to China in 1997. In a letter to the PM, Lord Patten and ex-Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said its residents needed assurances that the UK's growing commercial relationship with China would not ""come at the cost of our obligations to them"".

What to watch for in Trump's State of the Union speech,"It is the blockbuster US news event of the week, with an estimated 40 million people preparing to tune in to watch President Donald Trump deliver his first State of the Union address. The keynote speech will be an opportunity for the president to outline his agenda for the next 12 months, shape political policy and highlight past accomplishments. ""It's a big speech, an important speech,"" Mr Trump said on Monday. But what can we expect? ""The economy will be front and centre,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday. After a turbulent first year in office, President Trump is very likely to start with the positives - his tax reforms that were passed through the Senate at the end of last year. They are the most significant overhaul of the US tax code in a generation, slashing corporate and individual tax rates. Many expect him to link these reforms with America's improving economy, roaring stock markets and lowering unemployment rates. Plans to rebuild some of America's aging roads and other infrastructure may also get a mention, as well as demands for reciprocal trade with China. Trump tax cuts: Why they matter to us all Deep divisions remain between Democrats and Republicans over immigration reform, and the president is expected to push for a bipartisan solution. At the heart of his proposal are the 700,000 young people who entered the US illegally and without documents as children, so-called Dreamers. His decision to overturn a scheme - Daca - that shields these people from deportation outraged Democrats. The president may touch on the subject as he is hoping to draw Democrats in with a deal to overturn these plans, in return for securing billions for a proposed border wall with Mexico, and cuts to legal immigration levels. All eyes and cameras will be trained on at least 24 Democratic lawmakers who are bringing Dreamers as their guests to watch the show, according to ABC News. What is this immigration debate all about? It won't be his first speech in Congress as Donald Trump addressed both houses last February, when he stated the US was witnessing a ""renewal of the American spirit"". In fact,he surprised many by adopting a more presidential and measured tone than expected. However, just days after this speech, he returned with a claim on Twitter that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had hacked his phones during the presidential campaign. The tone of his maiden State of the Union address remains to be seen, but many will be wondering whether he will stick to the script - or the teleprompter - like he did last time. What is the State of the Union speech? The issue that has completely overshadowed Donald Trump's first year in office is unlikely to come up today - the investigation into whether he or his campaign colluded with Russia to sway the election in his favour. Mr Trump has condemned the Russia probe as a witch hunt, though he recently said he would testify under oath if his lawyers agreed. While it would take many by surprise if he raised the subject, it would not be the first time a sitting president has addressed an ongoing investigation around them. Bill Clinton avoided mentioning his impeachment trial in the State of the Union in 1999 In 1974 Richard Nixon used his State of the Union address to call for an end to the Watergate investigation, telling lawmakers: ""One year of Watergate is enough!"" Months later he resigned over the scandal which involved a web of political spying, sabotage and bribery. President Bill Clinton adopted a different approach more than two decades later, when he was on trial for perjury and obstruction of justice over an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. He failed to mention the case in his address in 1999 and was later acquitted of the charges. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Echoes of Watergate resurface Joseph Kennedy III, a rising star who is also part of the Kennedy political dynasty, faces the daunting task of delivering the Democrats' response to President Trump's address. The 37-year-old Massachusetts representative rose to the spotlight after his criticism of Republican attempts to end Obamacare. His nomination as rebutter-in-chief suggests the Democrats are willing to have a younger generation represent the party. Some observers believe he will appeal to working- and middle-class voters who his party argues have been neglected by Trump. 2016 hopeful Bernie Sanders will also offer his own take on the union address on his various social media platforms. Joe Kennedy to respond to Trump speech As is customary, the president brings along a group of guests, sometimes called ""Skutniks"". The name comes from a man, Lenny Skutnik, who was honoured by President Ronald Reagan in his 1982 address after jumping into the icy Potomac river in Maryland to rescue survivors of a plane crash. President Trump's guests include first responders, military veterans, a welder from Ohio who says he is benefiting from recent tax cuts and the parents of children killed byan El Salvadorean street gang, MS-13,which the president has vowed to wipe out. This video can not be played Nisa Mickens, 15, was killed by an MS-13 gang including undocumented immigrants Lawmakers are also allowed to bring their own guests. Dreamers, sexual assault victims and victims of gun violence are all said to be on the list of attendees. Some prominent Democratic legislators won't be showing up at all - including John Lewis, Maxine Waters and Jan Schakowsky - in protest against the president, who has caused outrage in recent weeks over his crude remarks about African countries, leading to accusations of racism. And at least one member of Trump's cabinet will miss the proceedings - the designated survivor, who remains in a secure location to ensure continuity of government should a catastrophic event occur.
