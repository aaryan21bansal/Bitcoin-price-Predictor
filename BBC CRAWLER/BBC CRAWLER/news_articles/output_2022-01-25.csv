"Police party investigation ups pressure on PMBoris Johnson faces a decisive 48 hours, with an official inquiry into lockdown events also due.UK Politics","Downing Street may have officially ""welcomed"" the police inquiry into the shenanigans behind closed doors in No 10 during lockdown. But what is likely to emerge in the next few days may be anything but welcome for Boris Johnson. It is only the second time in a century that a serving prime minister has been part of a police investigation. It is embarrassing, serious and could end up finding that some of the most powerful people in the country broke the law. For a Conservative leader of the party that prides itself on being the guarantor of law and order, that is deeply uncomfortable. Police to investigate No 10 lockdown parties What action could police take over No 10 parties? Birthday celebration for PM sparks new party row Before the police inquiry completes its work, Westminster and Whitehall is now braced for the results of the official inquiry into what went on, which could be published as early as Wednesday. I'm told the report prepared by senior official Sue Gray, who pulls no punches, is essentially complete. As I write late on Tuesday night, it is yet to be delivered officially to Downing Street, but Ms Gray is understood to be on the verge of submitting it. She is also keen, I'm told, that the inquiry is published in its entirety with no summary, or redactions which could blur or mask some of its more pointed information. The report is said to be full and frank, and is not expected to be easy reading either for the government, or the civil service itself. It's understood that there has been no shortage of evidence, with photographs and Whatsapp messages passed to her. Much of that evidence has over recent days been passed to the police, explaining why the Met concluded on Tuesday that it was important for them to publicly announce that they would also investigate. A dispute over whether the publication of the inquiry report would have to be delayed caused a frenzy in Westminster on Tuesday. But in the end, short of more twists in this bizarre and serious story, the report will be published very soon, quite separately and in advance of the police's conclusions. Publication could be crunch time politically, because remember, many Tory MPs have been so angered and embarrassed by weeks of allegations that they have been pondering seriously whether it's time to call a halt to Boris Johnson's time in office. For some of them, the report will give the cover they seek to make public their view that he ought to go. For many others, who might see themselves as the reasonable rump of the party, the findings of the report and how Boris Johnson explains himself immediately after will be the deciding factor into whether they will continue to back him or not. What they are acutely conscious of too is the reason why all the weeks of allegations have been so toxic. It's not that Boris Johnson and his staff had a slice of cake, or shared a hunk of Cheddar in the Downing Street back garden. It's because the impression has been created that while millions of members of the public were suffering because of the lockdown rules, those who had written and imposed them were not paying attention at all. There is a strand of opinion in the Tory party and among the public too, that, as we discussed yesterday, it's ridiculous to consider removing a prime minister over people having a sausage roll or a gin and tonic when they weren't meant to. Yet with the involvement of the police, a potentially bruising official inquiry and the broad public reaction reflected in the polls, there is no question that these are intensely difficult days for Downing Street, and a decisive 48 hours for Boris Johnson.

"Families may need help with bills, says IMF expertThe IMF says the global economy is entering 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected.BusinessComments","Struggling UK families may need help with energy bills as inflation soars, an International Monetary Fund expert has said. It comes as the IMF predicted that the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic. The forecast for UK growth in 2022 was cut to 4.7% from 5% in the IMF's latest world economic outlook. However, this will be the fastest in the G7 industrialised nations. It partly reflects a rebound from sharp falls the UK suffered during initial pandemic lockdowns two years ago. The International Monetary Fund is an organisation of 190 countries that works to secure financial stability. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, told the BBC that targeted help might be needed to help vulnerable households deal with higher energy bills as they face a cost-of-living squeeze. She said: ""The UK has done very well on the vaccination front, on testing and tracing and so on. ""All that has to be continued. An argument can be made that, especially for instance, in April, as more of the energy price pass-through happens, then that could be a big, sharp increase in the cost of living. ""And one could see a case for very, very targeted help to highly vulnerable households for a short space of time."" Surging food and energy prices drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in a blow to struggling families. The International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see energy prices go even higher and stay there for longer. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, backed the idea of help with spiralling energy bills in the UK. That intervention could be helpful to the Treasury, which is currently deciding what type of help could be given to mitigate a Â£50-a-month rise in bills. Some MPs want the government to delay its announced rise in National Insurance, especially after lower-than-expected public borrowing figures. The Treasury is believed to be looking instead at focusing support on those most in need. On Tuesday, the IMF sharply downgraded its forecasts for the two biggest global economies - the US and China - citing high energy prices and new Covid curbs among its reasons. Overall, the IMF now expects global growth to go from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for this year than in its last prediction in October 2021. ""The global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected,"" said the IMF report. As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spread, countries had reimposed restrictions, it added. ""Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the US and many emerging market and developing economies. ""And the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have limited growth prospects."" The IMF predicted that the higher levels of inflation currently seen in the global economy would go on for longer than it anticipated in its last forecast, persisting for most of 2022. It said supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility and localised wage pressures meant that ""uncertainty around inflation and policy paths"" was high. US economic growth for this year was downgraded by the IMF from 5.2% to 4% after it removed the effects of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its calculations. The legislation is currently stalled in Congressand is unlikely to be enacted in its present form. China's forecast for 2022 was cut from 5.6% to 4.8%. ""In China, disruption in the housing sector has served as a prelude to a broader slowdown,"" the IMF report said. ""With a strict zero-Covid strategy leading to recurrent mobility restrictions and deteriorating prospects for construction sector employment, private consumption is likely to be lower than anticipated."" The IMF said the cut in expectations for global growth also reflected revisions among some other large emerging markets. In particular, the two biggest Latin American economies, Brazil and Mexico, suffered the largest growth downgrades. Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking re-election later this year, is now expected to grow by just 0.3% in 2022, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. Mexico also saw a downgrade of 1.2 percentage points and is now predicted to see growth of 2.8%.

US could sanction Putin if Russia invades - Biden,"This video can not be played Watch: US President Joe Biden says a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""would change the world"" US President Joe Biden says he would consider personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr Biden said there would be ""enormous consequences"" for the world if Russia made a move on the nation, which sits on its south-western border. His comments came as other Western leaders repeated warnings that Russia would pay a heavy price for invasion. Russia has accused the US and others of ""escalating tensions"" over the issue and denies planning to enter Ukraine. However, Moscow has deployed an estimated 100,000 soldiers near the border. The Kremlin has said it sees the Western military alliance Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not add new members further east, including neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion. Fears of invasion have prompted Western embassies in Kyiv to withdraw some personnel. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba however told reporters on Wednesday that while the troop build up ""poses a threat to Ukraine"", he believes it is ""insufficient for a full-scale offensive"". Diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France gathered in Paris on Wednesday for talks about the ongoing tensions. Taking questions from reporters on Tuesday, Mr Biden replied ""yes"" when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally in the event of an invasion. Such a move across Ukraine's border would mean ""enormous consequences worldwide"" and could amount to ""the largest invasion since World War Two"", he said. On Wednesday UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss echoed Mr Biden's words, telling the BBC's Today programme that the government has ""ruled nothing out"" - including sanctions against the Russian leader - and said the UK is looking to ""toughen up"" its sanctions on people, banks and businesses. ""What is important is that all of our allies do the same. It is by collective action. By showing Putin we're united, we will help deter a Russian incursion,"" she said. Western powers agreed to ""unprecedented"" sanctions against Russia if it were to invade during crisis talks earlier this week. On Tuesday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson raised the issue of banning Russia from the Swift international payments system, a move which senior Russian officials said meant Europe would not be able to pay for and receive Russian products. Stoicism and stockpiling on Ukraineâs uneasy borders Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Russia responded angrily to Mr Biden's remarks. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Mr Putin, said such sanctions would not be ""painful"" for the president, but would be ""politically destructive"". He added that Russia's top government officials were banned from having any assets or accounts abroad, and that Mr Putin's salary went to the Rossiya bank. Separately, Mr Biden's administration said it wasworking with oil and gas suppliers around the world to boost shipments to Europe,externalin the event of Russia cutting off supplies, the New York Times reports. Russia currently provides about one-third of the crude oil and gas imported by the European Union. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, President of the European Council Charles Michel warned that aggression against Ukraine would result in serious consequences. ""A threat against Ukraine is a threat against Europe,"" he said. It is not unprecedented for Western powers to impose sanctions on heads of government or heads of state. Past recipients of international punitive action include the likes of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. But to sanction a despot is one thing, to sanction the leader of a major regional power is another. Targeting the head of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is rare, if not unprecedented, and to do so would plunge the UN into chaos. Sanctioning Putin would make co-operation harder on other issues. The West needs his help to revive the Iran nuclear deal. That support might disappear if Putin were sanctioned. It might also make it harder for Western leaders to meet Putin personally to discuss international crises. He might not be able to travel to Geneva or it might be illegal for the Western leader to meet him in Moscow. Sanctioning Putin might also make him more popular at home - Mugabe certainly used his sanctions as an electoral asset. They also might not work in a technical sense. Russia experts say that much of Putin's personal wealth is hidden away in the hands of third party proxies. And then there is politics. Sanctions are often done - and are best done - with allies. It might be hard to get unanimous support say, within the European Union, for personal sanctions against the Russian leader. Mr Biden also said on Tuesday that he would feel obliged to beef up Nato's presence in eastern Europe if Russia invaded, but he repeated that there were no plans to send US troops to Ukraine itself. The US has already put 8,500 combat-ready troops on alert to deploy at short notice. Russia has accused the US and NATO of ""flooding"" Ukraine with weapons and Western advisers. Washington has also warned Russian ally Belarus that it would ""face a swift and decisive response"" if it assisted in an invasion. Russia seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.

Doug Beattie to stay as UUP leader after tweets row,"This video can not be played Doug Beattie says the UUP cannot be ""collateral damage"" after his ""serious mistakes"" Doug Beattie is to remain as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader after he received the support of his party's MLAs and officers. It followed accusations of misogyny and racism over a number of his historical tweets. Mr Beattie said the tweets were ""pretty horrific"" andhe was ""deeply ashamed"" of them. However, he denied he was a racist or a misogynist. Mr Beattie said the tweets are ""not who I am"". On Tuesday afternoon, Mr Beattie said: ""I have had detailed conversations with all of my MLAs, I apologised for what I had done directly to each one of them and then I spoke [about] whether or not I still had their support to remain as party leader - overwhelmingly every one of them said 'yes, I did'."" Mr Beattie said that he had also received the backing of the party chairman and its officers and conversations would continue with other UUP members over the historical tweets. A number of the posts, mostly dating from before the former soldier joined the UUP in 2014, have been shared on social media. They feature derogatory comments about women and Muslims, the use of a strong racist slur and use of an offensive term for the Traveller community. Most of the posts being circulated have previously been deleted, but it is not possible to say when that happened. Robbie Butler said Mr Beattie had the support of UUP MLAs and officers On Tuesday afternoon, the UUP's deputy leader Robbie Butler confirmed that Mr Beattie had the support of the MLA group and party officers. In a brief statement at Stormont, he paid tribute to Mr Beattie for ""the manner in which he has responded and how serious he takes this issue and these events"". Earlier, Mr Beattie said that if the MLAs or party officers wanted him to stand down, he would. Doug Beattie has faced his share of battles - on the front lines in Afghanistan, and in turning around the fortunes of the Ulster Unionists at Stormont. Today came his biggest political fight - managing the backlash over his use of social media. But he didn't have to wait long to find out his fate, with senior party colleagues publicly cementing support for him this afternoon. But, privately, there is deep disappointment and hurt over how this controversy surrounding their leader has played out. The so-called Beattie bounce that had been predicted for the assembly election may also have fallen flat. Eight months ago, he was the only person in the frame to take over as party leader after Steve Aiken resigned. Avoiding the optics of a fifth leader in four years may partially explain why Doug Beattie is staying on and not stepping down. Later, the Upper Bann assembly member told Talkback thathe had been ""on the cusp"" of resigning as leader on Monday. ""I feel quite broken,"" he said. Doug Beattie in The Nolan Show studio on Tuesday morning Before he gathered support from party members, he told the programme: ""So look, I offered my resignation and people said let's look, let's engage - let's engage and see where we go. ""I've never had an easy life so I'll take whatever I have to take. ""I suppose if I believe in what I believe, and I do believe - that Northern Ireland deserves better, but maybe it needs better than me. ""Or maybe it needs me to confront what I did in the past, so that I learn for the future, maybe that's what I need to do."" The posts emerged after Mr Beattie apologised for tweeting a joke about former DUP leader Edwin Poots and his wife on Saturday night. Mr Poots said his wife had been ""disgusted"" by it and it was widely condemned by Northern Ireland political leaders. On Tuesday, Donnelly & Wall Solicitors said it had instigated legal proceedings on behalf of Mr and Mrs Poots against Mr Beattie and Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, in relation to the tweet. It is understood Mr Hoare retweeted Mr Beattie's post, before later deleting it. Patrick Higgins, a partner at the law firm, said the post ""constitutes a grave and unwarranted attack on my clients reputation"". Edwin Poots said on Monday he accepted Doug Beattie's apology but believed the UUP leader's judgement was ""poor"" On Monday, Mr Beattie issued apersonal statement on Twitter,externalin which he said he was ""deeply ashamed and embarrassed"" by the content of previous tweets. He did not share details of the tweets, but they later came to be widely circulated on social media. Mr Beattie, who was an Army officer before he joined the UUP, told the Nolan Show that some of the tweets were sent when he was ""still in a male-dominated environment, still in the military"". He described some as having a ""dark humour"" that was used ""as a coping mechanism"". Mr Beattie added: ""What I did 10 years ago was absolutely fundamentally wrong then, it's wrong now."" He said he was not hiding away from his ""mistakes"" and that he was not a misogynist or a racist. ""All I can do is front up to them and make the case that I am deeply sorry and apologise to everybody - the whole of society, certainly to women who may feel let down, to those people who I brought into the party,"" he said. ""I will absolutely accept that my tweets were misogynistic and I will absolutely stand up to that, but I am not a misogynist."" He added that he also ""will not accept"" that he is a racist. As a soldier, Mr Beattie, served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, and was awarded a Military Cross for bravery during operations to retake the town of Garmsir in Helmand, Afghanistan. He said he had defended Islam and would ""completely refute anybody who thinks I have an issue with Islam or with Muslims"". On Tuesday, two Ulster Unionist female politicians tweeted their support for Mr Beattie. Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston, a former Progressive Unionist Party councillor who joined the UUP last year, said ""there is no other leader I trust more with my children's future"" than Mr Beattie.

An assembly election candidate for North Down, Naomi McBurney, said she respected her party leader ""and what he has delivered and can continue to deliver for Northern Ireland"", and had ""huge admiration"" for ""owning the past"" on BBC's The Nolan Show. A number of Northern Ireland's political leaders have condemned the tweets. The DUP's Diane Dodds said the misogynistic language in some of Mr Beattie's tweets did not promote positive attitudes towards women. ""I am troubled that the type of language that is used is deeply worrying for young women and for women in general,"" she said. ""I have a young daughter, of just over 20 starting out in the workplace, I would not like to think that her leader in the workplace, her boss in the workplace, was using such deeply, deeply sexist, misogynistic language."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted on Tuesday that Mr Beattie's comments on ""women, race and others are outrageous and totally unacceptable"". ""There is a litany of abuse on his account and the public will make up its own mind on that. ""These regressive, outdated attitudes in society must be faced down."" The Green Party leader Clare Bailey described some of Mr Beattie's posts as ""deeply disturbing"". ""Nobody gets a personality transplant when they take elected office,"" she said. ""His tweets have really demonstrated deeply disturbing attitudes, not only to women, but to Muslims; to Travellers; there's been slurs about people with mental illness. ""So if this is his union of people, he can certainly count me out."" SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said they were ""deeply, deeply offensive"" and she was ""shocked and deeply disappointed"". ""What I'm so shocked at is it's not just one-off-the-cuff tweet,"" she added. ""It's the volume and the level. They are deeply offensive and seem to have been relentless during that period, targeting women in particular and a wide range of minority groups."" On Monday, Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""genuinely shocked at just how casually misogynistic"" the tweet referring to Mr Poots' wife was, saying it would ""have made many a 1970s comic blush"".

"Report fails to find cause of Glasgow art school fireA three-year investigation into the 2018 fire says the cause is ""undetermined"" because of the damage caused.Glasgow & West Scotland","Fire investigators have failed to find a cause for the fire that destroyed Glasgow School of Art's world-renowned Mackintosh building in 2018. The blaze broke out on 15 June - four years after an earlier fire had caused major damage to the building. But following an investigation lasting more than three years,the final report,externalconcluded that the cause of the second blaze remained ""undetermined"". It said this was due to extensive damage and the destruction of evidence. The art school said it ""shared the regret"" that the exact cause of the fire had not been identified and would take time to consider the report and its recommendations. Investigators had to sift through hundreds of tonnes of fire-damaged debris The fire investigation, which lasted until 30 September 2021, involved the excavation and physical examination of hundreds of tonnes of fire-damaged debris. Witness testimonies, CCTV and photographic footage were also analysed. Glasgow School of Art: A timeline of two fires Many questions remain over art school fire The fire took hold as the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building on Renfrew Street neared the end of a Â£48m restoration, followingthe earlier blaze in 2014. The alarm was raised by a security guard at 23:19, with the first fire appliances on scene within six minutes. A passer-by noticed a glow in the building and smoke coming from the roof at 23:21 and took a photograph. This was also captured on CCTV cameras on the Reid building opposite. However, investigators later learned that the first possible indication of fire in the area was one hour and 34 minutes before the first 999 call. A member of the public walking along Renfrew Street at about 21:45 smelled ""burned material"", but attributed it to the ongoing renovation works or a residual fire smell. At its height, more than 120 firefighters worked to contain and extinguish the fire. There were no casualties. Firefighting operations continued for a further 10 days. The neighbouring O2 ABC and other premises, including Jumpin Jaks nightclub, were also severely damaged in the fire. The fire also caused severe damage to the adjoining 02 ABC The report found that it was likely the fire started on the east side, on or above level four of the Mackintosh building. It added that an unlimited air supply fed through the duct system which served to intensify the fire, ""promoting uncontrolled fire growth and rapid development"". Glasgow art school should be 'faithfully' restored Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Within 38 minutes of the arrival of firefighters, 50% of the building, which had 10 levels, was well alight. The initial external observations of the building found that there had been a ""failure of approximately 97% of the windows, severe spalling of the sandstone outer faÃ§ade, warping of steel beams and severe fire and heat damage to the scaffolding structure that encased the building. A member of the public took this photo showing the glow of the fire at 23:21 ""The entire roof structure had perished with only stone, brick and distorted steel structural members remaining."" Inside the building, timber flooring and ceilings had been ""consumed by fire"". The report added: ""Remaining exposed steelwork was warped and twisted, hardly any timber remained, and walls were stripped to brickwork as surface finishes had been consumed in the intense heat."" Some of the footage used in the investigation was taken by the BBC, which had been making a programme documenting the restoration of the art school. Some of the debris was 4m (13ft) in height and heavily compacted Fire investigators looked at a number of possible causes. Some were discounted, but others could not be ruled out. Was it started deliberately?Scaffolding which was in place for ongoing restoration work had an alarm that detected any movement and alerted security guards. However, it did not cover the entire structure. The report said someone could have accessed the building via the scaffolding and would have had ""full access to combustible materials and an unknown ignition source"". CCTV footage from St Aloysius College captured a lone figure in a car park three hours after the fire was started. The person appeared to watch the fire crews for 78 minutes. However, they have never been traced. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) investigation found no evidence to suggest the cause of the fire was due to a deliberate act - but the report said wilful fireraising could not be fully discounted. Was there an electrical fault?The investigation considered seven theories that could support an electrical source as the cause of ignition. One of the possibilities that could not be ruled out was ignition caused by temporary site supplies such as cables, transformers, batteries and lighting. However, investigators said there was a lack of evidence to support this theory. Was it accidental ignition?The possibility that the fire was started by a discarded cigarette was considered to be unlikely but could not be fully ruled out. And a theory that the fire was caused by a sander was also thought to be unlikely but could not be fully discounted. Ross Haggart, SFRS deputy chief officer, said the investigation had been ""a deeply complex and protracted process"". ""Due to the nature of the ongoing restoration and construction works combined with other factors such as the air supply into the building, the fire was unfortunately able to take hold, spread and ultimately cause catastrophic damage,"" he said. ""This presented a number of challenges to our investigation, namely working within a structurally dangerous site to physically examine hundreds of tonnes of debris which was up to four metres in height and heavily compacted."" This video can not be played Fire Brigade Deputy Chief Officer Ross Haggart says 50% of the art school was ablaze less than 40 minutes after firefighters arrived He said the brigade was ""acutely aware"" of the cultural significance of the Mackintosh building and the pressing need for answers. ""We scrutinised every aspect of this fire to ensure our investigation was as robust and thorough as possible,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, almost everything within the building was severely damaged or consumed in the fire and that included any potential items of evidence that could have provided those answers."" He added: ""We were unable to find sufficient evidence to support any credible origin and it has not been possible to establish a definitive cause. ""However, we have made a number of recommendations, including the introduction of new mechanisms to enhance information sharing around ongoing construction projects within Scotland to ensure the safety of our firefighters and our communities."" Much of the evidence was destroyed in the fire - such as this CCTV hard drive The report says future projects should appoint ""competent persons with the appropriate skills, knowledge, qualifications and experience"" to make sure full fire risks are considered. It says a fire risk assessment should put in place, which should be continuously reviewed and evaluated. Prof Penny Macbeth, director of the art school, and Kristen Bennie, interim chair of the board of governors, thanked the SFRS for its ""meticulous approach to this incredibly complex investigation"". ""It has been a very difficult time for the city, and in particular our closest neighbours, for students, staff and the wider heritage sector, all of whom have been impacted in myriad ways by both Mackintosh Building fires,"" they said. ""While the SFRS fire investigation report is detailed and comprehensive, we share the regret that many will feel that the exact cause of the fire has not been identified. The fire ripped through the building which was undergoing restoration Large crowds looked on as firefighters tackled the blaze ""Taking time to study and consider the report thoroughly, in particular the recommendations, we will now undertake and share a lessons learned exercise on all aspects of the restoration to inform future construction projects."" Their statement added that the report was an ""important milestone"", allowing the art school to go ahead with its plans to faithfully reinstate the Mackintosh building. The fire broke out while the building was in the process of being fully refurbished following the 2014 fire. That blaze significantly damaged much of the west side of the building, destroying most of the library area, several art studios and office accommodation. Refurbishment work had started during the summer of 2016, with numerous contractors and restoration experts involved in the project.

Masks required in Wales' schools until half term,"All schools in Wales reopened in January, albeit two days later than planned Face coverings will be required in Welsh classrooms until the end of the February half term, under new plans. It will then be up to schools and councils to decide what restrictions they may need in their class. The Welsh government changes, announced at a press conference, will depend on how the Covid situation looks in just over two weeks. Exams - which were cancelled for two years running - are also planned to go ahead. The final decision on Covid rules in schools will be taken on 10 February, at the next review of coronavirus rules. Schools with staggered starts will also be told to revert to their normal timetables. The Welsh Conservatives accused Labour's Education Minister Jeremy Miles of being scared to go against the teaching unions, who broadly welcomed the announcement. What are the Covid rules in UK schools? 'It's as cold in the school as it is outside' 'Hugely upsetting' impact of Covid on pupils Exams need to be Covid-safe and fair, union says Following the emergence of the Omicron variant before Christmas, some schools moved to online learning and January's classes started two days late. Schools were also told touse face masks in class. In England, schools are scrapping restrictions in the classroom, including the need to wear masks. Half-term starts on Monday 21 February, with term time resuming on 28 February. This video can not be played Pupils share their thoughts on the exam uncertainty due to Covid. One Maesteg Comprehensive School pupil said pupils had been ""thrown in the deep end"" on exams. Abbie, 18, said: ""Because obviously we haven't had the prep in the past to prepare us with revision techniques - everything we're going to need to try and balance alongside schoolwork. ""So we've been thrown in the deep end, and I feel like most of us would agree that we're not really prepared for going into exam season when it finally shows up because of the lack of exams and the revision that we had previously because of the Covid pandemic."" She said masks could be a pain ""because you're in lessons and sometimes you miss what the teacher said or you're walking in the corridor and, because it's so congested, you can't breathe"". Gwion said he supported masks in communal areas, while Rhys said not if restrictions had been lifted elsewhere At Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, Gwion, 17, said he supported masks ""in communal areas and other areas where you're coming into people from other bubbles"". ""In terms of the classroom, you're already in the same bubble,"" he said. Rhys, also 17, said if restrictions have been lifted in other aspects of life ""then I can't see why it wouldn't be the same in school, because obviously rugby training is only like an hour a week, maybe two, that we would be in contact with those people and it's outdoors also"". Jeremy Miles said the Welsh government would decide whether to ease school Covid rules on 10 February The education minister said face coverings in schools helped ""make sure schools remain safe places to learn and that we limit transmission of Covid-19"". Current guidance requires pupils and staff wear masks in both communal areas and classrooms. He said: ""There will be an opportunity to review that of course on February 10 but my expectation at the moment is that that would extend until the end of this half term."" Mr Miles said ""if the evidence supports it"" the Welsh government would be able to confirm on 10 February if schools can return to local decisions after half term. He said he was asking schools that work with councils and public health advisers ""to determine the measures they may need to take"". It means that measures could differ between different local areas, or even schools. Some special schools have had staggered start and finish times - they can continue to do so until half term, but afterwards it is expected all schools will revert to their normal timetable. Meanwhile Mr Miles said exams would go ahead ""unless the public health situation makes it impossible for them to physically run them - which we do not envisage"". He told the briefing: ""For those doing A-levels that summer, I want them to have a level playing field with those sitting exams in other parts of the UK."" One group warned masks can leave deaf children at a disadvantage. Debbie Thomas, from the National Deaf Children's Society Cymru, said: ""Public health should always be a priority, but face coverings can leave deaf learners unable to understand their teachers and isolated from their friends and classmates. Essentially, the education minister said face coverings and other Covid measures in schools will be in place for at least another month. The plan is to stand down from the ""very high risk"" footing now, which often means strict limits on pupils mixing and one-way systems, back to schools and councils deciding. That will probably mean big variations between schools and no sense of when there might be something closer to pre-pandemic normality. Many staff and pupils have welcomed a cautious approach while others question tight restrictions in class with nightclubs opening this weekend. Mr Miles tried to dispel any uncertainty about exams - saying in the strongest terms yet that they will go ahead. Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""While some decisions require a local solution, the majority - like with facemasks - should be taken at the top to ensure equality of educational provision across Wales. ""It is not good enough that we have a minister scared to go toe-to-toe with the unions, and who is comfortable going against scientific evidence, when making such important decisions about safety and education provision."" Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of teachers union NASUWT, said it welcomes ""the more cautious approach being taken in Wales"". ""It is vital that we sustain learner and teacher numbers in schools and a gradual easing of mitigations helps with this without impacting detrimentally on teaching and learning."" Headteachers union ASCL Cymru said it had ""reservations about the effectiveness of the woolly measures"" in the Covid framework that would be used to determine rules in schools. ""But schools are at least familiar with them and have great experience to fall back on"". School leaders group NAHT Cymru urged the Welsh government not to relax too many Covid restrictions, also known as mitigations, in schools ""too soon"". ""No-one wants to see mitigations in schools, but the priority must be to keep schools open as safely as possible for staff and learners."" NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel said.

Playboy condemns 'abhorrent' Hefner over drug claims,"Hugh Hefner Playboy has said it ""strongly supports"" women who recently came forward with ""allegations of abhorrent actions"" by the company's late founder Hugh Hefner. A new 10-part US docuseries accuses Hefner - who died in 2017 aged 91 - of coercing and drugging women into sex at the Playboy mansion and at nightclubs. Former girlfriends describe the iconic publisher as ""like a vampire"" who ""sucked the life"" out of young girls. The company is pledging to ""actively listen and learn"" from the women. ""Today's Playboy is not Hugh Hefner's Playboy,"" readan open letter,externalpublished over the weekend. ""We trust and validate these women and their stories and we strongly support those individuals who have come forward to share their experiences."" Touting its sex-positive brand and overwhelmingly female workforce, Playboy added it would ""continue to confront any parts of our legacy that do not reflect our values today"". Was the Playboy revolution good for women? Obituary: Hugh Hefner Secrets of Playboy premiered on the A&E Network on 24 January. In it, veteran insiders and ex-girlfriends recount a ""cult-like"" atmosphere around the man known to fans as ""Hef"". ""Women had been groomed and led to believe they were part of his family,"" said Miki Garcia, a former director of Playmate promotions, who claims she saw many Playmates overdose on drugs. Holly Madison, who dated Hefner for eight years and became his ""special one"", described the lifestyle as ""a cycle of gross things"" that led her to drink heavily and consider taking her life. Ms Madison moved into the mansion at age 21 but says Hefner ""brainwashed"" and controlled her to the point she was afraid to leave. ""I watched girl after girl show up, fresh-faced, adorable and their beauty just washed away. We were nothing to him,"" said Sondra Theodore, a former model and actress who dated Hefner in the 1970s and 80s. She claimed the mansion hosted group sex events, fuelled by drugs, five nights a week. In one Thursday night tradition known as ""Pig Night"", sex workers (""pigs"") would allegedly be examined by a doctor and then be used for sex by Hefner's VIP friends. Theodore, now 65, said Hefner would send her on cocaine runs and the powder was often so plentiful at home the dogs became addicted to licking it off the floor. A former executive assistant to Hefner said he kept a stockpile of Quaalude sedatives that he called ""leg-spreaders"". The show also details at least three tragic deaths in the publication's heyday.

Scotland's work from home guidance to be relaxed,"This video can not be played Scotland to begin 'phased return' to the office from Monday Guidance urging people to work from home wherever possible in Scotland is to be relaxed in favour of a ""hybrid"" system of office and remote working. Employers have been asked to phase workers back into spending some time in the office from Monday 31 January. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was possible due to a ""significant"" fall in Covid-19 cases. But she warned that a ""mass return"" to offices overnight could run the risk of pushing infection levels up again. Meanwhile, the requirement for 2m physical distancing in some indoor settings like churches is to be relaxed, while the rules for schools are being ""kept under close and regular review"". Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid rules Easing of Covid restrictions 'significant moment' Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Covid case numbers in Scotland had fallen by ""just over a quarter"" in the past week, from an average of 10,000 infections per day to just over 7,000. The number of people being admitted to hospital with the virus has also fallen, as has the number in intensive care. Monday marked a ""significant return to normality"" with nightclubs reopening, curbs on hospitality businesses being eased and crowd limits for indoor events being dropped. And the first minister said the ""significantly improved situation"" meant that restrictions could be eased further. Scottish employers had been urged to enable home working wherever practical, but from Monday this will be replaced by a ""hybrid"" system. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We would not expect to see a wholesale return to the office next week - indeed, given that the level of infection though falling remains high, a mass return at this stage is likely to set progress back. ""But we know there are many benefits to both employees and employers, and to the economy as a whole, in at least a partial return to the office at this stage."" Finance Secretary Kate Forbes later confirmed there would be no fixed timetable on when all workers should return to the office. She toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""Setting an arbitrary date doesn't particularly help. We know different businesses will be able to use home working to various degrees."" She added: ""As of next Monday, the work from home guidance means that employers should go back to working in a hybrid sense. ""We know that there are many businesses that are unlikely to go back to working as they used to, pre-pandemic. ""But, quite obviously, it's really important for our high streets and city centres that employers have that discretion and employees can work from home and work in an office building."" From Friday, the requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be cut from 2m to 1m. And on the same day, face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped people would enjoy returning to concerts, shows and sporting events, and meeting up with larger groups of friends. However she urged them to ""continue to exercise appropriate care and caution"", with the health services still under ""immense pressure"". Business groups welcomed the move, with the Scottish Chambers of Commerce saying it would help ""revive our workplaces and our town and city centres, which have been hit hard by the absence of office workers"". And CBI Scotland said hybrid working ""is here to stay for many firms"", adding: ""It's up to them and their staff to work together to maximise the benefits of a balanced approach"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said decisions about home and office working should be ""left to employers and the workers themselves"". He said: ""Going forward it is vital that we trust people across Scotland to judge what is best for them and their families."" Mr Ross also called on the government to relax rules on the use of face coverings in schools. Ms Sturgeon said she knew young people ""want to see the back"" of masks in schools as soon as possible, but said they provide ""important protection"" when case numbers among younger age groups remain high. She said she would not ""pluck dates out of mid-air"" and would take decisions responsibly. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said a new approach to managing the virus was needed in future, saying that ""we cannot expect people to live their lives in perpetual crisis"". He said there should be ""clear triggers"" for future restrictions, a framework for financial support for firms and workers, and a robust system for testing and contact tracing. The government is to set out a blueprint for dealing with future outbreaks in the coming weeks, with Ms Sturgeon saying the goal was to ""manage the virus less restrictively"". However, she stressed that ""living with this does not simply mean giving the virus a free ride"", and that the response would need to be ""smart"" and ""flexible"".

Star Hobson council stripped of child services,"Star Hobson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of catastrophic injuries and died in September 2020 Bradford Council is to be stripped of control of its children's services in the wake of Star Hobson's murder. The authority's department will instead be operated by a council-owned trust led by an independent board. Ofsted rated children's services as ""inadequate"" in 2018 and a commissioner was appointed a year after 16-month-old Star was killed in September 2020. The trust's creation follows recommendations by the commissioner to Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Zahawi said: ""Keeping vulnerable children safe from harm is non-negotiable. ""Where a council is not meeting its duty to do this, we will take action to protect children and put their needs first."" He said that it was clear from commissioner Steve Walker's recommendations the council needed support to improve. Mr Zahawi added:  ""I'm pleased that Bradford council have agreed to establish a new trust that will bring positive change for the council and independent oversight that drives improvements."" Commissioner Mr Walkerwas appointed by the governmentin September 2021 over the ""slow pace of change"" after Ofsted inspectors had said some children remained ""at risk of serious harm"". He began his review a year after Star died following months of ""neglect, cruelty and injury"". Bradford Council was contacted on a number of occasions about the treatment of Star Hobson by Savannah Brockhill (left) and Frankie Smith in the run up to her death Savannah Brockhill, 28, wasjailed for a minimum of 25 years for her murder. Star's mother, Frankie Smith, 20, was sentenced to eight years for causing or allowing her death. Their trial heard of at least five occasions when concerned family members and friends made referrals about Star's treatment to the council's social services department. Star bled to death after suffering ""catastrophic"" injuries at the hands of Brockhill, her mother's ""violent-tempered"" girlfriend, at the couple's home in Keighley. Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe acknowledged the ""pace of improvement needs to quicken"" but said the trust would enable the authority to focus on ""delivering consistently high-quality care"". ""Inevitably this will take time and we're acutely conscious that there can be no pause in our improvement journey,"" she said. Ms Hinchcliffe said the Labour-controlled authority was committed to supporting ""front-line staff"". She said the new arrangement would give members of the children's services department ""certainty over the future direction"" and an opportunity to draw on resources and expertise nationally. A whistleblower who works for Bradford Council's children's services department has told BBC Look North about the difficulties faced by people employed by the authority. They said staff had raised issues with managers in the department about working conditions due to their high case loads, exacerbated by the number of people leaving. ""It's unmanageable workloads. Individual social workers are being set up to fail,"" the anonymous employee told the BBC. They added that senior colleagues were ""constantly afraid"" of hearing things not being done correctly and ""just wanted to cover it up"". The whistleblower said staff in the department were ""overworked, under-trained, unsupported and voiceless because any grievance you raise, it will be shut down and you will be made an example of"". An independent review examining how the authorities responded to social services referrals in the months leading to Star's death will be rolled into the national review launched in the wake of the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, the government also said. Bradford West MP Naz Shah said there had been ""opportunities to get this right"" Robbie Moore, Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, said children across Bradford had been ""repeatedly"" failed by the council. ""Vulnerable and looked-after children deserve much better. ""Our area has been haunted by such failings for far too long which has led to so many tragedies in our area, including cases of neglect, continuous child sexual exploitation and the recent tragic murder of Star Hobson which could have been prevented had Children's Services acted upon repeated warnings,"" said Mr Moore. He echoed previous calls for Ms Hinchliffe and authority chief executive Kersten England to resign and said he had ""no confidence"" in their leadership. Star Hobson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of catastrophic injuries and died on 22 September 2020 High caseloads, high staff turnover and the use of lots of agency staff are among the problems Bradford's children's services has struggled with over past years. We don't yet know whether or not those pressures were a factor in the way child protection services responded to the concerns raised by family and friends about Star Hobson. That will be for the official review to decide. However, the government-appointed commissioner is clear in his conclusion that ""the council doesn't have the capacity and capability to improve services at pace on its own"". The new arm's-length organisation will be one of about a dozen independent trusts in England set up after local authority children's services have failed to improve quickly enough. In some cases, that has led to significant improvement. In others, progress has been much slower. Not least because changing the structure of services does not in itself deal with underlying problems, such as the difficulty of recruiting and keeping experienced staff. Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West said there was a ""dysfunction across many areas"" of the council related to leadership, organisational culture, and a lack of resources, with the latter causing ""stresses and strains"". ""But you can only use the issue of resources for so long as a mitigating factor. ""The truth is it requires leadership, it takes bold and brave leadership especially given that concerns have been raised, I raised them in 2016 and I've been raising them since. ""This hasn't been happening overnight."" Anne Longfield, the former Children's Commissioner for England,external, welcomed the government announcement and said she hoped it ""marks the beginning of a period of major reform"" and investment in children's social care, adding: ""We cannot hope to protect vulnerable children on the cheap"".

Families 'may need help with energy bills',"Struggling UK families may need help with energy bills as inflation soars, an International Monetary Fund expert has said. It comes as the IMF predicted that the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic. The forecast for UK growth in 2022 was cut to 4.7% from 5% in the IMF's latest world economic outlook. However, this will be the fastest in the G7 industrialised nations. It partly reflects a rebound from sharp falls the UK suffered during initial pandemic lockdowns two years ago. The International Monetary Fund is an organisation of 190 countries that works to secure financial stability. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, told the BBC that targeted help might be needed to help vulnerable households deal with higher energy bills as they face a cost-of-living squeeze. She said: ""The UK has done very well on the vaccination front, on testing and tracing and so on. ""All that has to be continued. An argument can be made that, especially for instance, in April, as more of the energy price pass-through happens, then that could be a big, sharp increase in the cost of living. ""And one could see a case for very, very targeted help to highly vulnerable households for a short space of time."" Surging food and energy prices drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in a blow to struggling families. The International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see energy prices go even higher and stay there for longer. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, backed the idea of help with spiralling energy bills in the UK. That intervention could be helpful to the Treasury, which is currently deciding what type of help could be given to mitigate a Â£50-a-month rise in bills. Some MPs want the government to delay its announced rise in National Insurance, especially after lower-than-expected public borrowing figures. The Treasury is believed to be looking instead at focusing support on those most in need. On Tuesday, the IMF sharply downgraded its forecasts for the two biggest global economies - the US and China - citing high energy prices and new Covid curbs among its reasons. Overall, the IMF now expects global growth to go from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for this year than in its last prediction in October 2021. ""The global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected,"" said the IMF report. As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spread, countries had reimposed restrictions, it added. ""Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the US and many emerging market and developing economies. ""And the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have limited growth prospects."" The IMF predicted that the higher levels of inflation currently seen in the global economy would go on for longer than it anticipated in its last forecast, persisting for most of 2022. It said supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility and localised wage pressures meant that ""uncertainty around inflation and policy paths"" was high. US economic growth for this year was downgraded by the IMF from 5.2% to 4% after it removed the effects of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its calculations. The legislation is currently stalled in Congressand is unlikely to be enacted in its present form. China's forecast for 2022 was cut from 5.6% to 4.8%. ""In China, disruption in the housing sector has served as a prelude to a broader slowdown,"" the IMF report said. ""With a strict zero-Covid strategy leading to recurrent mobility restrictions and deteriorating prospects for construction sector employment, private consumption is likely to be lower than anticipated."" The IMF said the cut in expectations for global growth also reflected revisions among some other large emerging markets. In particular, the two biggest Latin American economies, Brazil and Mexico, suffered the largest growth downgrades. Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking re-election later this year, is now expected to grow by just 0.3% in 2022, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. Mexico also saw a downgrade of 1.2 percentage points and is now predicted to see growth of 2.8%.

Playboy decries 'abhorrent' Hefner over drug claims,"Hugh Hefner Playboy has said it ""strongly supports"" women who recently came forward with ""allegations of abhorrent actions"" by the company's late founder Hugh Hefner. A new 10-part US docuseries accuses Hefner - who died in 2017 aged 91 - of coercing and drugging women into sex at the Playboy mansion and at nightclubs. Former girlfriends describe the iconic publisher as ""like a vampire"" who ""sucked the life"" out of young girls. The company is pledging to ""actively listen and learn"" from the women. ""Today's Playboy is not Hugh Hefner's Playboy,"" readan open letter,externalpublished over the weekend. ""We trust and validate these women and their stories and we strongly support those individuals who have come forward to share their experiences."" Touting its sex-positive brand and overwhelmingly female workforce, Playboy added it would ""continue to confront any parts of our legacy that do not reflect our values today"". Was the Playboy revolution good for women? Obituary: Hugh Hefner Secrets of Playboy premiered on the A&E Network on 24 January. In it, veteran insiders and ex-girlfriends recount a ""cult-like"" atmosphere around the man known to fans as ""Hef"". ""Women had been groomed and led to believe they were part of his family,"" said Miki Garcia, a former director of Playmate promotions, who claims she saw many Playmates overdose on drugs. Holly Madison, who dated Hefner for eight years and became his ""special one"", described the lifestyle as ""a cycle of gross things"" that led her to drink heavily and consider taking her life. Ms Madison moved into the mansion at age 21 but says Hefner ""brainwashed"" and controlled her to the point she was afraid to leave. ""I watched girl after girl show up, fresh-faced, adorable and their beauty just washed away. We were nothing to him,"" said Sondra Theodore, a former model and actress who dated Hefner in the 1970s and 80s. She claimed the mansion hosted group sex events, fuelled by drugs, five nights a week. In one Thursday night tradition known as ""Pig Night"", sex workers (""pigs"") would allegedly be examined by a doctor and then be used for sex by Hefner's VIP friends. Theodore, now 65, said Hefner would send her on cocaine runs and the powder was often so plentiful at home the dogs became addicted to licking it off the floor. A former executive assistant to Hefner said he kept a stockpile of Quaalude sedatives that he called ""leg-spreaders"". The show also details at least three tragic deaths in the publication's heyday. Playboy goes from private to public in new venture Hefner founded Playboy in 1953. It became the largest-selling men's magazine in the world, shifting seven million copies a month at its peak. The company stopped printing its magazine and relisted on the stock market in 2020. Was the Playboy revolution good for women?

Cardi B awarded almost Â£1m in defamation case win,"Cardi B has been awarded over Â£2 million in damages after winning a defamation lawsuit against a YouTuber. The rapper and songwriter, known for songs including I Like It, Money and WAP, was subjected to a ""malicious campaign"" of false accusations by Latasha Kebe, known online as Tasha K. Kebe hosts gossip site UnWineWithTashaK which has one million subscribers. She was previously made to pay damages of almost Â£1 million. On Tuesday, a jury in the state of Georgia ordered that Kebe pay a further Â£1,109,625.00 in damages and Â£990,342.88 in legal fees. The total she now has to pay to Cardi B is Â£3,027,405.38, documents obtained by the PA news agency show. During the trial, lawyers for the singer, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis AlmÃ¡nzar, said Kebe had waged ""a campaign to damage and destroy [Cardi B's] reputation among her fans and the consuming public"". They claimed Kebe started making ""degrading and harassing statements"" in early 2018 and continued to do so, at one point falsely claiming the star had worked as a prostitute. Cardi B's lawyers said comments and videos on Kebe's channel caused the singer ""embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional distress"".

Mr Ross also challenges the first minister on face masks remaining mandatory in secondary schools beyond this month, when Scotland's national clinical director has said ""the day is coming"" when they should be scrapped. Ms Sturgeon says she is desperate for an end to disruption in education but anyone who looks at recent figures on cases in the under-15s being up by 41% and says this is the time to relax rules ""is frankly not being responsible"".

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the latest data is very positive.

travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland â although they will still be required to complete a passenger locator form. Travellers to Scotland who are not fully
vaccinated will still be required to take a pre-departure test no more than two
days before they board their plane, and also take a PCR test on, or before, day two
of their arrival here. For international travel purposes, people are
deemed to be fully vaccinated if they have completed at least a primary course
of vaccination â for most people, that means at least two doses. This
international definition, which doesnât currently require booster or third
vaccines, will be kept under review. The first minister says: ""While these changes will be very welcome to travellers
and the travel industry, it is important to point out that no government can
completely rule out having to tighten travel requirements again if certain
circumstances - most obviously another new variant - were to arise."" However, Ms Sturgeon says - for now - there will be no change to rules on face coverings in secondary schools. She says this is a matter which will stay  under review and ""receive careful consideration"". I know young people want to see the back of them as soon as possible. But I also know that many young people understand and agree - especially when cases in the younger age group are rising - that face coverings do provide important protection."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The FM confirms two other changes to guidance: From Friday, the requirement for two-metre distancing in indoor settings will revert to one metre. Also from Friday, face coverings will no longer be required for
any adult taking part in organised activities when they are directly
interacting with children under the age of five. More workers will be heading back to the office Ms Sturgeon tells the chamber the current guidance on working from home -
strengthened in response to Omicron - will be now be updated. ""Instead of recommending home working whenever
practical, the new guidance will pave the way for a phased return to the
office."" From Monday 31 January,
employers should consider implementing hybrid working â following appropriate
guidance - with workers spending some time in the office and some time at home. ""We would not expect to see a wholesale return
to the office next week â indeed, given that the level of infection, though
falling, remains high, a mass return at this stage is likely to set progress
back."" ""But we know there are many benefits to both
employees and employers, and to the economy as a whole, in at least a partial
return to the office at this stage."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

normality can be made with confidence, we should still exercise some caution. "" Ms Sturgeon says yesterday marked a significant return to
normality with the lifting of all of the following measures: The first minister says the data from this last week paint a ""broadly positive picture"". Ms Sturgeon goes on to say: ""There have been significant reductions in every

increased by 41%."" Nicola Sturgeon gets to her feet and begins, as ever, with the latest Covid statistics. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Report fails to find cause of Glasgow art school fireA three-year investigation into the 2018 fire said the cause was ""undetermined"" because of the damage caused.Glasgow & West Scotland","Fire investigators have failed to find a cause for the fire that destroyed Glasgow School of Art's world-renowned Mackintosh building in 2018. The blaze broke out on 15 June - four years after an earlier fire had caused major damage to the building. But following an investigation lasting more than three years,the final report,externalconcluded that the cause of the second blaze remained ""undetermined"". It said this was due to extensive damage and the destruction of evidence. The art school said it ""shared the regret"" that the exact cause of the fire had not been identified and would take time to consider the report and its recommendations. Investigators had to sift through hundreds of tonnes of fire-damaged debris The fire investigation, which lasted until 30 September 2021, involved the excavation and physical examination of hundreds of tonnes of fire-damaged debris. Witness testimonies, CCTV and photographic footage were also analysed. Glasgow School of Art: A timeline of two fires Many questions remain over art school fire The fire took hold as the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building on Renfrew Street neared the end of a Â£48m restoration, followingthe earlier blaze in 2014. The alarm was raised by a security guard at 23:19, with the first fire appliances on scene within six minutes. A passer-by noticed a glow in the building and smoke coming from the roof at 23:21 and took a photograph. This was also captured on CCTV cameras on the Reid building opposite. However, investigators later learned that the first possible indication of fire in the area was one hour and 34 minutes before the first 999 call. A member of the public walking along Renfrew Street at about 21:45 smelled ""burned material"", but attributed it to the ongoing renovation works or a residual fire smell. At its height, more than 120 firefighters worked to contain and extinguish the fire. There were no casualties. Firefighting operations continued for a further 10 days. The neighbouring O2 ABC and other premises, including Jumpin Jaks nightclub, were also severely damaged in the fire. The fire also caused severe damage to the adjoining 02 ABC The report found that it was likely the fire started on the east side, on or above level four of the Mackintosh building. It added that an unlimited air supply fed through the duct system which served to intensify the fire, ""promoting uncontrolled fire growth and rapid development"". Glasgow art school should be 'faithfully' restored Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Within 38 minutes of the arrival of firefighters, 50% of the building, which had 10 levels, was well alight. The initial external observations of the building found that there had been a ""failure of approximately 97% of the windows, severe spalling of the sandstone outer faÃ§ade, warping of steel beams and severe fire and heat damage to the scaffolding structure that encased the building. A member of the public took this photo showing the glow of the fire at 23:21 ""The entire roof structure had perished with only stone, brick and distorted steel structural members remaining."" Inside the building, timber flooring and ceilings had been ""consumed by fire"". The report added: ""Remaining exposed steelwork was warped and twisted, hardly any timber remained, and walls were stripped to brickwork as surface finishes had been consumed in the intense heat."" Some of the footage used in the investigation was taken by the BBC, which had been making a programme documenting the restoration of the art school. Some of the debris was 4m (13ft) in height and heavily compacted Fire investigators looked at a number of possible causes. Some were discounted, but others could not be ruled out. Was it started deliberately?Scaffolding which was in place for ongoing restoration work had an alarm that detected any movement and alerted security guards. However, it did not cover the entire structure. The report said someone could have accessed the building via the scaffolding and would have had ""full access to combustible materials and an unknown ignition source"". CCTV footage from St Aloysius College captured a lone figure in a car park three hours after the fire was started. The person appeared to watch the fire crews for 78 minutes. However, they have never been traced. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) investigation found no evidence to suggest the cause of the fire was due to a deliberate act - but the report said wilful fireraising could not be fully discounted. Was there an electrical fault?The investigation considered seven theories that could support an electrical source as the cause of ignition. One of the possibilities that could not be ruled out was ignition caused by temporary site supplies such as cables, transformers, batteries and lighting. However, investigators said there was a lack of evidence to support this theory. Was it accidental ignition?The possibility that the fire was started by a discarded cigarette was considered to be unlikely but could not be fully ruled out. And a theory that the fire was caused by a sander was also thought to be unlikely but could not be fully discounted. Ross Haggart, SFRS deputy chief officer, said the investigation had been ""a deeply complex and protracted process"". ""Due to the nature of the ongoing restoration and construction works combined with other factors such as the air supply into the building, the fire was unfortunately able to take hold, spread and ultimately cause catastrophic damage,"" he said. ""This presented a number of challenges to our investigation, namely working within a structurally dangerous site to physically examine hundreds of tonnes of debris which was up to four metres in height and heavily compacted."" This video can not be played Fire Brigade Deputy Chief Officer Ross Haggart says 50% of the art school was ablaze less than 40 minutes after firefighters arrived He said the brigade was ""acutely aware"" of the cultural significance of the Mackintosh building and the pressing need for answers. ""We scrutinised every aspect of this fire to ensure our investigation was as robust and thorough as possible,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, almost everything within the building was severely damaged or consumed in the fire and that included any potential items of evidence that could have provided those answers."" He added: ""We were unable to find sufficient evidence to support any credible origin and it has not been possible to establish a definitive cause. ""However, we have made a number of recommendations, including the introduction of new mechanisms to enhance information sharing around ongoing construction projects within Scotland to ensure the safety of our firefighters and our communities."" Much of the evidence was destroyed in the fire - such as this CCTV hard drive The report says future projects should appoint ""competent persons with the appropriate skills, knowledge, qualifications and experience"" to make sure full fire risks are considered. It says a fire risk assessment should put in place, which should be continuously reviewed and evaluated. Prof Penny Macbeth, director of the art school, and Kristen Bennie, interim chair of the board of governors, thanked the SFRS for its ""meticulous approach to this incredibly complex investigation"". ""It has been a very difficult time for the city, and in particular our closest neighbours, for students, staff and the wider heritage sector, all of whom have been impacted in myriad ways by both Mackintosh Building fires,"" they said. ""While the SFRS fire investigation report is detailed and comprehensive, we share the regret that many will feel that the exact cause of the fire has not been identified. The fire ripped through the building which was undergoing restoration Large crowds looked on as firefighters tackled the blaze ""Taking time to study and consider the report thoroughly, in particular the recommendations, we will now undertake and share a lessons learned exercise on all aspects of the restoration to inform future construction projects."" Their statement added that the report was an ""important milestone"", allowing the art school to go ahead with its plans to faithfully reinstate the Mackintosh building. The fire broke out while the building was in the process of being fully refurbished following the 2014 fire. That blaze significantly damaged much of the west side of the building, destroying most of the library area, several art studios and office accommodation. Refurbishment work had started during the summer of 2016, with numerous contractors and restoration experts involved in the project.

UK economy set to grow more slowly than forecast,"Struggling UK families may need help with energy bills as inflation soars, an International Monetary Fund expert has said. It comes as the IMF predicted that the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic. The forecast for UK growth in 2022 was cut to 4.7% from 5% in the IMF's latest world economic outlook. However, this will be the fastest in the G7 industrialised nations. It partly reflects a rebound from sharp falls the UK suffered during initial pandemic lockdowns two years ago. The International Monetary Fund is an organisation of 190 countries that works to secure financial stability. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, told the BBC that targeted help might be needed to help vulnerable households deal with higher energy bills as they face a cost-of-living squeeze. She said: ""The UK has done very well on the vaccination front, on testing and tracing and so on. ""All that has to be continued. An argument can be made that, especially for instance, in April, as more of the energy price pass-through happens, then that could be a big, sharp increase in the cost of living. ""And one could see a case for very, very targeted help to highly vulnerable households for a short space of time."" Surging food and energy prices drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in a blow to struggling families. The International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see energy prices go even higher and stay there for longer. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, backed the idea of help with spiralling energy bills in the UK. That intervention could be helpful to the Treasury, which is currently deciding what type of help could be given to mitigate a Â£50-a-month rise in bills. Some MPs want the government to delay its announced rise in National Insurance, especially after lower-than-expected public borrowing figures. The Treasury is believed to be looking instead at focusing support on those most in need. On Tuesday, the IMF sharply downgraded its forecasts for the two biggest global economies - the US and China - citing high energy prices and new Covid curbs among its reasons. Overall, the IMF now expects global growth to go from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for this year than in its last prediction in October 2021. ""The global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected,"" said the IMF report. As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spread, countries had reimposed restrictions, it added. ""Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the US and many emerging market and developing economies. ""And the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have limited growth prospects."" The IMF predicted that the higher levels of inflation currently seen in the global economy would go on for longer than it anticipated in its last forecast, persisting for most of 2022. It said supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility and localised wage pressures meant that ""uncertainty around inflation and policy paths"" was high. US economic growth for this year was downgraded by the IMF from 5.2% to 4% after it removed the effects of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its calculations. The legislation is currently stalled in Congressand is unlikely to be enacted in its present form. China's forecast for 2022 was cut from 5.6% to 4.8%. ""In China, disruption in the housing sector has served as a prelude to a broader slowdown,"" the IMF report said. ""With a strict zero-Covid strategy leading to recurrent mobility restrictions and deteriorating prospects for construction sector employment, private consumption is likely to be lower than anticipated."" The IMF said the cut in expectations for global growth also reflected revisions among some other large emerging markets. In particular, the two biggest Latin American economies, Brazil and Mexico, suffered the largest growth downgrades. Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking re-election later this year, is now expected to grow by just 0.3% in 2022, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. Mexico also saw a downgrade of 1.2 percentage points and is now predicted to see growth of 2.8%.

Inflation surge sends UK interest payments higher,"Interest payments on government borrowing last month hit a record high for December as surging inflation increased the cost of debt. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said interest on government debt hit Â£8.1bn last month - up from Â£2.7bn a year earlier. The increase came as soaring energy costs sent inflation to a 30-year high. Official borrowing - the gap between spending and tax receipts - last month was a lower-than-forecast Â£16.8bn. The figure was down Â£7.6bn from the same month a year earlier, with the Treasury's coffers bolstered by more income from housing stamp duty and fuel taxes. But public debt interest payments are linked to the Retail Prices Index of inflation, which hit 7.5% last month, the highest rate since March 1991. For the financial year to date, borrowing has now reached Â£146.8bn, the second-highest figure for the period since records began in 1993. Where does the government borrow billions from? Why are prices rising so quickly? Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Chancellor Rishi Sunak, under pressure to relax planned tax rises in April, underlined the impact of rising debt repayments in a statement after the figures were released. He said: ""We are supporting the British people as we recover from the pandemic through our Plan for Jobs and business grants, loans and tax reliefs. ""Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments. ""Our fiscal rules mean we will reduce our debt burden while continuing to invest in the future of the UK."" In total, more than 50 schemes have been announced by the UK government and devolved nations to support individuals and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The consensus among economists was that December borrowing would reach about Â£18.5bn. However, with the rate of inflation set to continue rising until about April, analysts at Capital Economics said further falls were unlikely. National Insurance (NI) is set to rise in April, piling more cost-of-living pressure on struggling households. Although Mr Sunak has so far given no signal he will bow to pressure to scrap the rise, Capital Economics said the December figures suggest he ""would have enough fiscal room to cancel"" the NI rise without too much damage to the nation's finances. Overall the public purse may be in better shape than some had feared - but that doesn't mean the chancellor is in a generous mood. The amount of interest the Treasury paid on its debts in December was three times what it was a year ago. About a quarter of public debt is linked to inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index. And that inflation is now at a 30-year high of over 7%, and is set to rise further in the coming months. Moreover, interest rates themselves are likely to rise in a bid to curb price rises - and every 1% on rates adds Â£20bn to the cost of public debt repayments. It's mounting cost that a chancellor who is intent on reducing borrowing has zoomed in on. Rishi Sunak has stressed that it's ""important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments"". That may be his way of hinting that he won't be swayed by calls to delay looming tax changes that are set to take a further chunk out of household budgets, and that the Treasury is prepared to give only limited help to reduce the pain of soaring energy costs. Economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies say that the chancellor does have the financial wiggle room to at least delay tax rises for now. But they also say that those rises will have to eventually come, faced with rising demands from the likes of an ageing population, the public finances are to be knocked into a more sustainable state.

Council stripped of children's services control,"Star Hobson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of catastrophic injuries and died in September 2020 Bradford Council is to be stripped of control of its children's services in the wake of Star Hobson's murder. The authority's department will instead be operated by a council-owned trust led by an independent board. Ofsted rated children's services as ""inadequate"" in 2018 and a commissioner was appointed a year after 16-month-old Star was killed in September 2020. The trust's creation follows recommendations by the commissioner to Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Zahawi said: ""Keeping vulnerable children safe from harm is non-negotiable. ""Where a council is not meeting its duty to do this, we will take action to protect children and put their needs first."" He said that it was clear from commissioner Steve Walker's recommendations the council needed support to improve. Mr Zahawi added:  ""I'm pleased that Bradford council have agreed to establish a new trust that will bring positive change for the council and independent oversight that drives improvements."" Commissioner Mr Walkerwas appointed by the governmentin September 2021 over the ""slow pace of change"" after Ofsted inspectors had said some children remained ""at risk of serious harm"". He began his review a year after Star died following months of ""neglect, cruelty and injury"". Bradford Council was contacted on a number of occasions about the treatment of Star Hobson by Savannah Brockhill (left) and Frankie Smith in the run up to her death Savannah Brockhill, 28, wasjailed for a minimum of 25 years for her murder. Star's mother, Frankie Smith, 20, was sentenced to eight years for causing or allowing her death. Their trial heard of at least five occasions when concerned family members and friends made referrals about Star's treatment to the council's social services department. Star bled to death after suffering ""catastrophic"" injuries at the hands of Brockhill, her mother's ""violent-tempered"" girlfriend, at the couple's home in Keighley. Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe acknowledged the ""pace of improvement needs to quicken"" but said the trust would enable the authority to focus on ""delivering consistently high-quality care"". ""Inevitably this will take time and we're acutely conscious that there can be no pause in our improvement journey,"" she said. Ms Hinchcliffe said the Labour-controlled authority was committed to supporting ""front-line staff"". She said the new arrangement would give members of the children's services department ""certainty over the future direction"" and an opportunity to draw on resources and expertise nationally. A whistleblower who works for Bradford Council's children's services department has told BBC Look North about the difficulties faced by people employed by the authority. They said staff had raised issues with managers in the department about working conditions due to their high case loads, exacerbated by the number of people leaving. ""It's unmanageable workloads. Individual social workers are being set up to fail,"" the anonymous employee told the BBC. They added that senior colleagues were ""constantly afraid"" of hearing things not being done correctly and ""just wanted to cover it up"". The whistleblower said staff in the department were ""overworked, under-trained, unsupported and voiceless because any grievance you raise, it will be shut down and you will be made an example of"". An independent review examining how the authorities responded to social services referrals in the months leading to Star's death will be rolled into the national review launched in the wake of the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, the government also said. Bradford West MP Naz Shah said there had been ""opportunities to get this right"" Robbie Moore, Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, said children across Bradford had been ""repeatedly"" failed by the council. ""Vulnerable and looked-after children deserve much better. ""Our area has been haunted by such failings for far too long which has led to so many tragedies in our area, including cases of neglect, continuous child sexual exploitation and the recent tragic murder of Star Hobson which could have been prevented had Children's Services acted upon repeated warnings,"" said Mr Moore. He echoed previous calls for Ms Hinchliffe and authority chief executive Kersten England to resign and said he had ""no confidence"" in their leadership. Star Hobson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of catastrophic injuries and died on 22 September 2020 High caseloads, high staff turnover and the use of lots of agency staff are among the problems Bradford's children's services has struggled with over past years. We don't yet know whether or not those pressures were a factor in the way child protection services responded to the concerns raised by family and friends about Star Hobson. That will be for the official review to decide. However, the government-appointed commissioner is clear in his conclusion that ""the council doesn't have the capacity and capability to improve services at pace on its own"". The new arm's-length organisation will be one of about a dozen independent trusts in England set up after local authority children's services have failed to improve quickly enough. In some cases, that has led to significant improvement. In others, progress has been much slower. Not least because changing the structure of services does not in itself deal with underlying problems, such as the difficulty of recruiting and keeping experienced staff. Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West said there was a ""dysfunction across many areas"" of the council related to leadership, organisational culture, and a lack of resources, with the latter causing ""stresses and strains"". ""But you can only use the issue of resources for so long as a mitigating factor. ""The truth is it requires leadership, it takes bold and brave leadership especially given that concerns have been raised, I raised them in 2016 and I've been raising them since. ""This hasn't been happening overnight."" Anne Longfield, the former Children's Commissioner for England,external, welcomed the government announcement and said she hoped it ""marks the beginning of a period of major reform"" and investment in children's social care, adding: ""We cannot hope to protect vulnerable children on the cheap"".

travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland â although they will still be required to complete a passenger locator form. Travellers to Scotland who are not fully
vaccinated will still be required to take a pre-departure test no more than two
days before they board their plane, and also take a PCR test on, or before, day two
of their arrival here. For international travel purposes, people are

She says this is a matter which will stay  under review and ""receive careful consideration"". I know young people want to see the back of them as soon as possible.

Employers have been asked to phase workers back into spending some time in the office from Monday 31 January. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was possible due to a ""significant"" fall in Covid-19 cases. But she warned that a ""mass return"" to offices overnight could run the risk of pushing infection levels up again. Meanwhile, the requirement for 2m physical distancing in some indoor settings like churches is to be relaxed, while the rules for schools are being ""kept under close and regular review"". Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid rules Easing of Covid restrictions 'significant moment' Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Covid case numbers in Scotland had fallen by ""just over a quarter"" in the past week, from an average of 10,000 infections per day to just over 7,000. The number of people being admitted to hospital with the virus has also fallen, as has the number in intensive care. Monday marked a ""significant return to normality"" with nightclubs reopening, curbs on hospitality businesses being eased and crowd limits for indoor events being dropped. And the first minister said the ""significantly improved situation"" meant that restrictions could be eased further. Scottish employers had been urged to enable home working wherever practical, but from Monday this will be replaced by a ""hybrid"" system. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We would not expect to see a wholesale return to the office next week - indeed, given that the level of infection though falling remains high, a mass return at this stage is likely to set progress back. ""But we know there are many benefits to both employees and employers, and to the economy as a whole, in at least a partial return to the office at this stage."" Finance Secretary Kate Forbes later confirmed there would be no fixed timetable on when all workers should return to the office. She toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""Setting an arbitrary date doesn't particularly help. We know different businesses will be able to use home working to various degrees."" She added: ""As of next Monday, the work from home guidance means that employers should go back to working in a hybrid sense. ""We know that there are many businesses that are unlikely to go back to working as they used to, pre-pandemic. ""But, quite obviously, it's really important for our high streets and city centres that employers have that discretion and employees can work from home and work in an office building."" From Friday, the requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be cut from 2m to 1m. And on the same day, face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped people would enjoy returning to concerts, shows and sporting events, and meeting up with larger groups of friends. However she urged them to ""continue to exercise appropriate care and caution"", with the health services still under ""immense pressure"". Business groups welcomed the move, with the Scottish Chambers of Commerce saying it would help ""revive our workplaces and our town and city centres, which have been hit hard by the absence of office workers"". And CBI Scotland said hybrid working ""is here to stay for many firms"", adding: ""It's up to them and their staff to work together to maximise the benefits of a balanced approach"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said decisions about home and office working should be ""left to employers and the workers themselves"". He said: ""Going forward it is vital that we trust people across Scotland to judge what is best for them and their families."" Mr Ross also called on the government to relax rules on the use of face coverings in schools. Ms Sturgeon said she knew young people ""want to see the back"" of masks in schools as soon as possible, but said they provide ""important protection"" when case numbers among younger age groups remain high. She said she would not ""pluck dates out of mid-air"" and would take decisions responsibly. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said a new approach to managing the virus was needed in future, saying that ""we cannot expect people to live their lives in perpetual crisis"". He said there should be ""clear triggers"" for future restrictions, a framework for financial support for firms and workers, and a robust system for testing and contact tracing. The government is to set out a blueprint for dealing with future outbreaks in the coming weeks, with Ms Sturgeon saying the goal was to ""manage the virus less restrictively"". However, she stressed that ""living with this does not simply mean giving the virus a free ride"", and that the response would need to be ""smart"" and ""flexible"".

Holiday bookings jump as Covid travel tests axed,"Holiday bookings have jumped with ""notable increases"" in trips planned for February half-term and Easter ahead of Covid travel tests being scrapped. Jet2 said bookings had increased by 30% on last week after the announcements that rules would be relaxed for people arriving in the UK. The rule changes mean fully-vaccinated people arriving in those countries from abroad do not need to take Covid tests. The change will come into effect from 04:00 GMT on 11 February. Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2, told the BBC the removal of testing was ""game-changer"" for the travel industry. He said demand was ""already strong"" before the rule changes for England and Scotland were announced on Monday, but said bookings had since risen further. On Tuesday, the Welsh government confirmed it was ""reluctantly retaining alignment"" with the UK government to also remove tests. However, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the devolved government would ""implement measures to encourage travellers arriving into Wales to take a lateral flow test, plus a follow-up PCR test if positive"". Northern Ireland has since announced it will align with the other nations. The phasing out of domestic testing rules has resulted in demand growing for flights and holidays through January, though the increase in bookings is from a lower base than pre-pandemic times. What are the travel rules? Jet2 has said it has planned a larger summer holiday package for 2022 than 2019. ""We have seen a notable increase in demand for holidays and flights across all seasons, particularly February half term, the Easter holidays and Summer 22,"" Mr Heapy said. The company said the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, mainland Spain, Italy and Portugal were ""selling strongly"". It added there was ""enormous growth"" for bookings for Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. Ski flights to Geneva, Salzburg Grenoble, Chambery and Lyon were also up, the company said, after being buoyed by France also easing some restrictions on UK travellers. Although testing requirements have been removed in the UK, people travelling abroad will also be required to follow the isolation and testing requirements of the country they are heading to. According to online travel search firm Skyscanner, there are currently 106 countries, including Spain, Italy and the US, with low restrictions where people who are fully vaccinated can visit by showing proof of vaccine status or a negative test. The Netherlands, along with 19 other destinations, have moderative restrictions where forms of quarantine are required. A total of 30 places still have major travel restrictions, such as Australia and New Zealand. Laura Lindsay, head of consumer travel at Skycanner, said ""confidence"" was returning for people to book, with the travel search engine seeing the ""firm favourites get straight back on travellers' agendas"". ""Spain, Portugal and the US are all topping the charts again as they did in 2019 before the pandemic,"" she said. Aside from changes for fully-jabbed travellers, rules have been eased for unvaccinated people, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate, but will still need pre-departure and day two tests. However, everyone arriving in the UK, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form. Tour operator Tui told the BBC it had also seen a ""big increase in bookings"". Andrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK said, the removal of arrival tests was a ""huge leap forwards in getting travel back to normal"". Long-haul destinations including Mexico, Dominican Republic, Cape Verde and the Canary Islands were proving the most popular for winter escapes, he added ""We now expect summer 2022 bookings to be back to pre-pandemic levels."" EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said every occasion the government had reduced some international travel restrictions, the airline had seen ""big surges in the sales numbers"". ""We now hope testing and travel is a thing of the past which it should because it was never an efficient measure in anyway to reduce the spread of the virus,"" he told the BBC. Elsewhere, Thomas Cook, which was rebranded as an online holiday company after it collapsed in 2019, said Turkey and Italy were among the most in-demand destinations for summer holidays. It said overall weekly bookings were up by ""more than 300% on 2021"". Boss Alan French said: ""After two years of bans and changing rules, it feels like we've really turned a corner and with the end of testing in sight we expect to see even more people look ahead to a summer of sunshine, beaches and glistening blue seas."" However, the trade body for the testing firm industry has said the rules have been lifted too quickly. On Monday, Tom Watson, chairman of the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, said the body had ""consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions"", but added the ""only way"" to avoid future lockdowns was to maintain ""a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants"".

"Marmite maker to axe 1,500 jobs worldwide","Consumer goods giant Unilever has confirmed it will cut about 1,500 jobs globally as part of an overhaul of its management and structure. The Marmite-to-Domestos maker said the cuts would not affect shopfloor jobs in factories. Unilever is under pressure after a failed Â£50bn bid for a division of GlaxoSmithKline, and some shareholders have demanded changes. The firm employs more than 6,000 people in its UK and Ireland operations. Plans for jobs cuts and a re-organisation have been underway for many months. Unilever said the proposed job cuts would reduce the number of senior management roles by about 15% and there would be 5% fewer junior management roles. PG Tips maker will not raise Â£50bn bid for rival The new Unilever will be re-organised around five divisions, including beauty, personal care and ice cream, resulting in several senior executive changes along with cuts further down the management chain. ""Our new organisational model has been developed over the last year and is designed to continue the step-up we are seeing in the performance of our business,"" said chief executive Alan Jope. ""Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery. Growth remains our top priority and these changes will underpin our pursuit of this."" Unilever's 80 brands are currently divided into three divisions: Beauty & Personal Care, Food & Refreshment, Home Care. The new structure spins off brands Ben & Jerry's, Magnum and Cornetto into a separate division called Ice Cream, headed by Matt Close. Unilever said Ben & Jerry's will retain its separate independent board, a structure agreed when Unilever bought the brand in 2000. The announcement comes just a week after Unilever sparked anger from some investors when it dropped a short-lived pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) healthcare business. Unilever had initially said it wanted a bigger slice of the personal healthcare and hygiene market, to offset slow growth in its foods business. But GSK, which owns brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, said the offer ""fundamentally undervalued"" the division and Unilever has since refused to raise its bid. The saga has sparked unease about the firm's management under Mr Jope, with the head of Unilever's 13th biggest investor labelling the GSK bid as a ""near death experience"". Unilever chief executive Alan Jope is under pressure after a failed bid for GSK's consumer healthcare arm In a scathing attack, influential fund manager Terry Smith, who runs Fundsmith, criticised Unilever's ""meaningless platitudes"" over its social and environmental commitments and told Mr Jope to focus on improving the existing businesses ""before taking on any more challenges"" like the GSK bid. Unilever, one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100, is also one of the biggest dividend payers to shareholders and pension funds. Powerful activist investor Nelson Peltz has also been agitating for change, raising a question mark over Mr Jope's future. After the humiliation of having its bids for GSK's consumer healthcare business repeatedly rejected, this is a real ""What next?"" moment for Unilever. The answer appears to be to knuckle down and focus on the existing business, trimming out excess fat and attempting to accelerate growth, rather than building new empires. It is likely to be a more popular approach with leading investors, several of whom were deeply unhappy with the idea of a move into the personal healthcare business. The fact that activist investor Nelson Peltz has come on board is likely to add extra urgency to the restructuring process. But that still leaves question marks hanging over chief executive Alan Jope and his team. Can they restore their lost credibility - and do they have anything else up their sleeves? Mr Peltz's hedge fund Trian Partners has previously demanded reforms at rival consumer goods firms Procter & Gamble and Mondelez. It emerged on Monday that Trian had taken a stake in Unilever. The size of the stake is not known but Mr Peltz's decision pleased investors, with shares in the company jumping by 7.3% in London on Monday. In a note, analysts at Barclays said Mr Peltz's investment ""will not be that much of a surprise to industry specialists"". ""From Unilever's perspective, the status quo is not an option,"" they added. ""It would seem that the stars are aligning with both Unilever management and an activist pushing for more urgency."" Analyst Susannah Streeter, from stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tuesday's announcement was an attempt by management ""to show they are getting the house in order"". Unilever shares rose briefly after the news, but have since lost ground. ""Some investors [are] not satisfied that cost cutting alone will be enough to ensure Unilever turns a corner,"" Ms Streeter said. She added: ""Clearly more clarity is being demanded about the direction ahead, and Alan Jope is still under pressure to come up with a brand new strategy.""

Mr Ross also challenges the first minister on face masks remaining mandatory in secondary schools beyond this month, when Scotland's national clinical director has said ""the day is coming"" when they should be scrapped. Ms Sturgeon says she is desperate for an end to disruption in education but anyone who looks at recent figures on cases in the under-15s being up by 41% and says this is the time to relax rules ""is frankly not being responsible"". The first minister moves on to financial support for businesses affected by closure and staff shortages, saying payments are already being made in every council area in the country. And let me remind Douglas Ross again that this is funding available in Scotland which has not been available in the rest of the UK."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a mas return to the office would have implications for people using public transport Ms Sturgeon tells Douglas Ross she has already confirmed that the new guidance says we should allow businesses to determine how to manage hybrid working in consultation with staff and trade unions. She says anyone looking at the data right now must accept that a ""mass return to the office"" with all its implications for public transport and too may people coming together would risk setting us back.  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the latest data is very positive. But he says it is vital that in the weeks and months ahead, the people of Scotland must be trusted ""to judge what's best for them and their families"". So, he questions, why is the first minister still advising against a wholescale return to office work and not leaving it to bosses and staff to choose? Mr Ross also calls on the FM to row back on this week's news that plans for a second independence referendum can start to be drawn up.

calm by taking the sensible steps we know help stem transmission.""  Ms Sturgeon concludes by saying: ""Stick with them to protect yourself, others and the NHS."" From this week, five to 11 year olds with
specific medical conditions are being invited for vaccine appointments. Parents and carers will either receive a letter
inviting them to call the national phone line, or a letter directly from their
local health board. More detail fromNHS Inform,external. The Distance Aware scheme is intended to help
people who might be worried about going out. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""Badges and lanyards with the
Distance Aware logo will be available to anyone who wants one, and will
indicate to other people that the person wearing the logo would like a bit of
extra space, and a bit more care taken around them. ""The badges and lanyards are available â free â
at mobile and community libraries across Scotland this week, and badges are
also available in most ASDA supermarkets. They are also available online from
some participating charities."" Read more about the scheme here. From Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated
travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland â although they will still be required to complete a passenger locator form. Travellers to Scotland who are not fully
vaccinated will still be required to take a pre-departure test no more than two
days before they board their plane, and also take a PCR test on, or before, day two
of their arrival here. For international travel purposes, people are
deemed to be fully vaccinated if they have completed at least a primary course
of vaccination â for most people, that means at least two doses. This
international definition, which doesnât currently require booster or third
vaccines, will be kept under review. The first minister says: ""While these changes will be very welcome to travellers
and the travel industry, it is important to point out that no government can
completely rule out having to tighten travel requirements again if certain
circumstances - most obviously another new variant - were to arise."" However, Ms Sturgeon says - for now - there will be no change to rules on face coverings in secondary schools. She says this is a matter which will stay  under review and ""receive careful consideration"". I know young people want to see the back of them as soon as possible. But I also know that many young people understand and agree - especially when cases in the younger age group are rising - that face coverings do provide important protection."" Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The FM confirms two other changes to guidance: From Friday, the requirement for two-metre distancing in indoor settings will revert to one metre. Also from Friday, face coverings will no longer be required for
any adult taking part in organised activities when they are directly
interacting with children under the age of five. More workers will be heading back to the office Ms Sturgeon tells the chamber the current guidance on working from home -
strengthened in response to Omicron - will be now be updated. ""Instead of recommending home working whenever
practical, the new guidance will pave the way for a phased return to the
office."" From Monday 31 January,
employers should consider implementing hybrid working â following appropriate
guidance - with workers spending some time in the office and some time at home. ""We would not expect to see a wholesale return
to the office next week â indeed, given that the level of infection, though
falling, remains high, a mass return at this stage is likely to set progress
back."" ""But we know there are many benefits to both
employees and employers, and to the economy as a whole, in at least a partial
return to the office at this stage."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

normality can be made with confidence, we should still exercise some caution. "" Ms Sturgeon says yesterday marked a significant return to
normality with the lifting of all of the following measures: The first minister says the data from this last week paint a ""broadly positive picture"". Ms Sturgeon goes on to say: ""There have been significant reductions in every

"Cardi B awarded almost Â£1m in defamation case winA court heard the rapper was subjected to a ""malicious campaign"" by YouTuber Latasha Kebe.Newsbeat","Cardi B has been awarded over Â£2 million in damages after winning a defamation lawsuit against a YouTuber. The rapper and songwriter, known for songs including I Like It, Money and WAP, was subjected to a ""malicious campaign"" of false accusations by Latasha Kebe, known online as Tasha K. Kebe hosts gossip site UnWineWithTashaK which has one million subscribers. She was previously made to pay damages of almost Â£1 million. On Tuesday, a jury in the state of Georgia ordered that Kebe pay a further Â£1,109,625.00 in damages and Â£990,342.88 in legal fees. The total she now has to pay to Cardi B is Â£3,027,405.38, documents obtained by the PA news agency show. During the trial, lawyers for the singer, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis AlmÃ¡nzar, said Kebe had waged ""a campaign to damage and destroy [Cardi B's] reputation among her fans and the consuming public"". They claimed Kebe started making ""degrading and harassing statements"" in early 2018 and continued to do so, at one point falsely claiming the star had worked as a prostitute. Cardi B's lawyers said comments and videos on Kebe's channel caused the singer ""embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional distress"".

"Breaking|Breaking newsNo cause found for Glasgow School of Art fireA three-year investigation into the 2018 fire said the cause was ""undetermined"" because of the damage caused.Glasgow & West Scotland","Fire investigators have failed to find a cause for the fire that destroyed Glasgow School of Art's world-renowned Mackintosh building in 2018. The blaze broke out on 15 June - four years after an earlier fire had caused major damage to the building. But following an investigation lasting more than three years,the final report,externalconcluded that the cause of the second blaze remained ""undetermined"". It said this was due to extensive damage and the destruction of evidence. The art school said it ""shared the regret"" that the exact cause of the fire had not been identified and would take time to consider the report and its recommendations. Investigators had to sift through hundreds of tonnes of fire-damaged debris The fire investigation, which lasted until 30 September 2021, involved the excavation and physical examination of hundreds of tonnes of fire-damaged debris. Witness testimonies, CCTV and photographic footage were also analysed. Glasgow School of Art: A timeline of two fires Many questions remain over art school fire The fire took hold as the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building on Renfrew Street neared the end of a Â£48m restoration, followingthe earlier blaze in 2014. The alarm was raised by a security guard at 23:19, with the first fire appliances on scene within six minutes. A passer-by noticed a glow in the building and smoke coming from the roof at 23:21 and took a photograph. This was also captured on CCTV cameras on the Reid building opposite. However, investigators later learned that the first possible indication of fire in the area was one hour and 34 minutes before the first 999 call. A member of the public walking along Renfrew Street at about 21:45 smelled ""burned material"", but attributed it to the ongoing renovation works or a residual fire smell. At its height, more than 120 firefighters worked to contain and extinguish the fire. There were no casualties. Firefighting operations continued for a further 10 days. The neighbouring O2 ABC and other premises, including Jumpin Jaks nightclub, were also severely damaged in the fire. The fire also caused severe damage to the adjoining 02 ABC The report found that it was likely the fire started on the east side, on or above level four of the Mackintosh building. It added that an unlimited air supply fed through the duct system which served to intensify the fire, ""promoting uncontrolled fire growth and rapid development"". Glasgow art school should be 'faithfully' restored Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Within 38 minutes of the arrival of firefighters, 50% of the building, which had 10 levels, was well alight. The initial external observations of the building found that there had been a ""failure of approximately 97% of the windows, severe spalling of the sandstone outer faÃ§ade, warping of steel beams and severe fire and heat damage to the scaffolding structure that encased the building. A member of the public took this photo showing the glow of the fire at 23:21 ""The entire roof structure had perished with only stone, brick and distorted steel structural members remaining."" Inside the building, timber flooring and ceilings had been ""consumed by fire"". The report added: ""Remaining exposed steelwork was warped and twisted, hardly any timber remained, and walls were stripped to brickwork as surface finishes had been consumed in the intense heat."" Some of the footage used in the investigation was taken by the BBC, which had been making a programme documenting the restoration of the art school. Some of the debris was 4m (13ft) in height and heavily compacted Fire investigators looked at a number of possible causes. Some were discounted, but others could not be ruled out. Was it started deliberately?Scaffolding which was in place for ongoing restoration work had an alarm that detected any movement and alerted security guards. However, it did not cover the entire structure. The report said someone could have accessed the building via the scaffolding and would have had ""full access to combustible materials and an unknown ignition source"". CCTV footage from St Aloysius College captured a lone figure in a car park three hours after the fire was started. The person appeared to watch the fire crews for 78 minutes. However, they have never been traced. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) investigation found no evidence to suggest the cause of the fire was due to a deliberate act - but the report said wilful fireraising could not be fully discounted. Was there an electrical fault?The investigation considered seven theories that could support an electrical source as the cause of ignition. One of the possibilities that could not be ruled out was ignition caused by temporary site supplies such as cables, transformers, batteries and lighting. However, investigators said there was a lack of evidence to support this theory. Was it accidental ignition?The possibility that the fire was started by a discarded cigarette was considered to be unlikely but could not be fully ruled out. And a theory that the fire was caused by a sander was also thought to be unlikely but could not be fully discounted. Ross Haggart, SFRS deputy chief officer, said the investigation had been ""a deeply complex and protracted process"". ""Due to the nature of the ongoing restoration and construction works combined with other factors such as the air supply into the building, the fire was unfortunately able to take hold, spread and ultimately cause catastrophic damage,"" he said. ""This presented a number of challenges to our investigation, namely working within a structurally dangerous site to physically examine hundreds of tonnes of debris which was up to four metres in height and heavily compacted."" This video can not be played Fire Brigade Deputy Chief Officer Ross Haggart says 50% of the art school was ablaze less than 40 minutes after firefighters arrived He said the brigade was ""acutely aware"" of the cultural significance of the Mackintosh building and the pressing need for answers. ""We scrutinised every aspect of this fire to ensure our investigation was as robust and thorough as possible,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, almost everything within the building was severely damaged or consumed in the fire and that included any potential items of evidence that could have provided those answers."" He added: ""We were unable to find sufficient evidence to support any credible origin and it has not been possible to establish a definitive cause. ""However, we have made a number of recommendations, including the introduction of new mechanisms to enhance information sharing around ongoing construction projects within Scotland to ensure the safety of our firefighters and our communities."" Much of the evidence was destroyed in the fire - such as this CCTV hard drive The report says future projects should appoint ""competent persons with the appropriate skills, knowledge, qualifications and experience"" to make sure full fire risks are considered. It says a fire risk assessment should put in place, which should be continuously reviewed and evaluated. Prof Penny Macbeth, director of the art school, and Kristen Bennie, interim chair of the board of governors, thanked the SFRS for its ""meticulous approach to this incredibly complex investigation"". ""It has been a very difficult time for the city, and in particular our closest neighbours, for students, staff and the wider heritage sector, all of whom have been impacted in myriad ways by both Mackintosh Building fires,"" they said. ""While the SFRS fire investigation report is detailed and comprehensive, we share the regret that many will feel that the exact cause of the fire has not been identified. The fire ripped through the building which was undergoing restoration Large crowds looked on as firefighters tackled the blaze ""Taking time to study and consider the report thoroughly, in particular the recommendations, we will now undertake and share a lessons learned exercise on all aspects of the restoration to inform future construction projects."" Their statement added that the report was an ""important milestone"", allowing the art school to go ahead with its plans to faithfully reinstate the Mackintosh building. The fire broke out while the building was in the process of being fully refurbished following the 2014 fire. That blaze significantly damaged much of the west side of the building, destroying most of the library area, several art studios and office accommodation. Refurbishment work had started during the summer of 2016, with numerous contractors and restoration experts involved in the project.

School Covid rules to be decided locally in Wales,"All schools in Wales reopened in January, albeit two days later than planned Face coverings will be required in Welsh classrooms until the end of the February half term, under new plans. It will then be up to schools and councils to decide what restrictions they may need in their class. The Welsh government changes, announced at a press conference, will depend on how the Covid situation looks in just over two weeks. Exams - which were cancelled for two years running - are also planned to go ahead. The final decision on Covid rules in schools will be taken on 10 February, at the next review of coronavirus rules. Schools with staggered starts will also be told to revert to their normal timetables. The Welsh Conservatives accused Labour's Education Minister Jeremy Miles of being scared to go against the teaching unions, who broadly welcomed the announcement. What are the Covid rules in UK schools? 'It's as cold in the school as it is outside' 'Hugely upsetting' impact of Covid on pupils Exams need to be Covid-safe and fair, union says Following the emergence of the Omicron variant before Christmas, some schools moved to online learning and January's classes started two days late. Schools were also told touse face masks in class. In England, schools are scrapping restrictions in the classroom, including the need to wear masks. Half-term starts on Monday 21 February, with term time resuming on 28 February. This video can not be played Pupils share their thoughts on the exam uncertainty due to Covid. One Maesteg Comprehensive School pupil said pupils had been ""thrown in the deep end"" on exams. Abbie, 18, said: ""Because obviously we haven't had the prep in the past to prepare us with revision techniques - everything we're going to need to try and balance alongside schoolwork. ""So we've been thrown in the deep end, and I feel like most of us would agree that we're not really prepared for going into exam season when it finally shows up because of the lack of exams and the revision that we had previously because of the Covid pandemic."" She said masks could be a pain ""because you're in lessons and sometimes you miss what the teacher said or you're walking in the corridor and, because it's so congested, you can't breathe"". Gwion said he supported masks in communal areas, while Rhys said not if restrictions had been lifted elsewhere At Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, Gwion, 17, said he supported masks ""in communal areas and other areas where you're coming into people from other bubbles"". ""In terms of the classroom, you're already in the same bubble,"" he said. Rhys, also 17, said if restrictions have been lifted in other aspects of life ""then I can't see why it wouldn't be the same in school, because obviously rugby training is only like an hour a week, maybe two, that we would be in contact with those people and it's outdoors also"". Jeremy Miles said the Welsh government would decide whether to ease school Covid rules on 10 February The education minister said face coverings in schools helped ""make sure schools remain safe places to learn and that we limit transmission of Covid-19"". Current guidance requires pupils and staff wear masks in both communal areas and classrooms. He said: ""There will be an opportunity to review that of course on February 10 but my expectation at the moment is that that would extend until the end of this half term."" Mr Miles said ""if the evidence supports it"" the Welsh government would be able to confirm on 10 February if schools can return to local decisions after half term. He said he was asking schools that work with councils and public health advisers ""to determine the measures they may need to take"". It means that measures could differ between different local areas, or even schools. Some special schools have had staggered start and finish times - they can continue to do so until half term, but afterwards it is expected all schools will revert to their normal timetable. Meanwhile Mr Miles said exams would go ahead ""unless the public health situation makes it impossible for them to physically run them - which we do not envisage"". He told the briefing: ""For those doing A-levels that summer, I want them to have a level playing field with those sitting exams in other parts of the UK."" One group warned masks can leave deaf children at a disadvantage. Debbie Thomas, from the National Deaf Children's Society Cymru, said: ""Public health should always be a priority, but face coverings can leave deaf learners unable to understand their teachers and isolated from their friends and classmates. Essentially, the education minister said face coverings and other Covid measures in schools will be in place for at least another month. The plan is to stand down from the ""very high risk"" footing now, which often means strict limits on pupils mixing and one-way systems, back to schools and councils deciding. That will probably mean big variations between schools and no sense of when there might be something closer to pre-pandemic normality. Many staff and pupils have welcomed a cautious approach while others question tight restrictions in class with nightclubs opening this weekend. Mr Miles tried to dispel any uncertainty about exams - saying in the strongest terms yet that they will go ahead. Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""While some decisions require a local solution, the majority - like with facemasks - should be taken at the top to ensure equality of educational provision across Wales. ""It is not good enough that we have a minister scared to go toe-to-toe with the unions, and who is comfortable going against scientific evidence, when making such important decisions about safety and education provision."" Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of teachers union NASUWT, said it welcomes ""the more cautious approach being taken in Wales"". ""It is vital that we sustain learner and teacher numbers in schools and a gradual easing of mitigations helps with this without impacting detrimentally on teaching and learning."" Headteachers union ASCL Cymru said it had ""reservations about the effectiveness of the woolly measures"" in the Covid framework that would be used to determine rules in schools. ""But schools are at least familiar with them and have great experience to fall back on"". School leaders group NAHT Cymru urged the Welsh government not to relax too many Covid restrictions, also known as mitigations, in schools ""too soon"". ""No-one wants to see mitigations in schools, but the priority must be to keep schools open as safely as possible for staff and learners."" NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel said.

Royal Mail to cut jobs amid ongoing postal delays,"Royal Mail plans to cut around 700 management jobs as it tries to reduce costs amid growing competition from rivals. The move, part of a restructuring plan, comes as the firm faces heavy criticism over ongoing postal delays. The company has been struggling to cope with Covid-related staff absences. Those have led to severe delays in some areas and the regulator, Ofcom, has said it may impose fines where services have fallen short. Some customers have complained of waiting up to a month for important deliveries, including prescriptions and legal documents as well as late Christmas cards. Ofcom said recently that it was ""concerned about these delays and have made it clear to Royal Mail that it must take steps to improve its performance as the effects of the pandemic subside"". Large parts of London, Manchester, Hertfordshire, Wales and Scotland, have been particularly affected by the delays. In early January, around 15,000 - or more than one in 10 - of Royal Mail's staff were off sick or isolating. But Simon Thompson, who took over as chief executive of the delivery firm a year ago, said the situation was now improving. Royal Mail staff absences almost double 2018 level London hit worst by Royal Mail delivery delays Are you experiencing postal delays? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Mr Thompson said absences had been ""a headwind"" in delivering productivity targets. Between April and December last year the firm had spent more than Â£340m on overtime, additional temporary staffing and sick pay, he said. Royal Mail said the latest planned job cuts would incur a charge of Â£70m but would deliver annual savings of around Â£40m. The company axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic. Royal Mail has seen deliveries particularly hard hit by staff sickness and absences with the advent of Omicron, with around one in eight staff affected over the Christmas period. But even before that, it had repeatedly failed to meet delivery targets. With pressure from customers, the regulator and shareholders for more efficient operations, Royal Mail is undertaking an overhaul. And its managers will bear the brunt. The company says that losing 700 posts will enable it to streamline its structure and improve local performance and ultimately, save Â£40m per year.  It will now have to consult unions on the proposals. In the first year of the pandemic Royal Mail saw rising demand for its services as people switched to shopping online at home. Over the past year, with High Street stores open again, that demand has fallen back, but Royal Mail's chairman Keith Williams said the trend for higher numbers of parcels being delivered remained. The volume of domestic parcels being delivered by Royal Mail between October and December was 33% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019, but 7% lower than in 2020. However, the number of letters Royal Mail handled in the October to December period declined compared to both 2020 and 2021. Royal Mail said it believed it was retaining its share of the deliveries market, although it saw a slower than expected pick-up around the Black Friday shopping period. ""The past few months have demonstrated that the challenge for Royal Mail is to improve both quality and efficiency,"" Mr Williams said. Price rises in the UK and elsewhere have raised costs for both its domestic and international businesses, Royal Mail said. ""Looking forwards, the delivery of our transformation and modernisation plans remain incredibly important in light of the fastâpaced change we are seeing and ongoing inflationary pressures."" Royal Mail also said that as government guidance over Covid-19 changed, there would be fluctuations in the number of Covid tests it would be delivering. The firm agreed in December to double deliveries of tests to a total of 900,000 a day, including both PCR and lateral flow tests. Over the nine months to the end of last year, Covid tests accounted for between 4% and 6% of Royal Mail's parcel volumes.

Nadal, whose only title at Melbourne Park came in 2009, needed medication for what seemed to be a stomach issue. The 35-year-old faces seventh seed Matteo Berrettini in the last four. Italian Berrettini overcame a fightback by French 17th seed Gael Monfils to win 6-4 6-4 3-6 3-6 6-2 and become the first Italian man to reach the Australian Open semi-finals. The Wimbledon runner-up earned decisive breaks in the opening two sets before Monfils, buoyed by the vocal support of the Rod Laver crowd, hit back in the third and carried that momentum through to take the fourth and level the match. But the 35-year-old could not sustain that energy in the decider as Berrettini held his nerve - despite a rowdy fan being ejected - to clinch victory and gesture to the crowd that he could no longer hear them. ""It feels unbelievable,"" he said. ""I am really happy for myself, what a great match, a lot of emotions, I thought I had him in the third and then found myself in the fifth! ""It is full of people, I like it - some of them are not really tennis fans I think, but it is what it is, you cannot control everybody. To be respectful is something you have to do anyway. It's fine, I win and I'm happy."" Shapovalov says Nadal gets 'preferential treatment' from umpires 'Australia late to show LGBT support but now we're here' Keys races into Australian Open semi-finals Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Nadal is two more victories away from earning a record 21st Grand Slam men's title, which would move him clear of long-time rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. Nadal's relief at coming through the toughest of tests was evident after Shapovalov pushed a backhand volley wide on the Spaniard's first match point. Grinning widely, Nadal celebrated by standing in front of his box and staring at his team while shaking both fists. In contrast, Shapovalov demolished his racquet on the court. Afterwards, Nadal said he ""didn't know"" how he managed to win on a Melbourne afternoon where temperatures topped 30C. ""I was completely destroyed,"" he said. ""It was a very tough day, very warm, I didn't practice for it. ""At the beginning of the match I was playing great, I know how difficult it is to play against a player like Denis. ""I had my chances at the beginning of the third, I didn't get it and then started to feel a bit more tired and he pushed me."" In the absence of the deported Djokovic and the injured Federer in Melbourne, Nadal can move ahead of his great rivals in the race to finish with most major titles. While eager to win as many Grand Slam titles as possible, Nadal has often said he is not motivated by beating Djokovic and Federer. At this year's Australian Open, he is grateful to be even playing. Nadal missed five months because of a foot injury which - he revealed last week - left him doubting whether he would even return to the top-level. A bout of coronavirus in mid-December also left him ""very sick with fever"". After beating Shapovalov to move closer to another Grand Slam title, Nadal said: ""Of course, I'm surprised to be here. ""We can create history but the real thrill is that two months ago we didn't know if we could be able to get back on tour. ""For me this is a present of life to be playing tennis again and I am just enjoying it."" Shapovalov (left), who was bidding for his second Grand Slam semi-final after reaching the Wimbledon last four in July, had a discussion with Nadal (right) at the net following his complaint Throughout his career, Nadal has exerted every bit of energy and fight possible - with all those trademark qualities on show in an absorbing contest with 14th seed Shapovalov. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly for Spaniard when he led by two sets against the 22-year-old, who was aiming to reach his first Australian Open semi-final. Nadal broke once in each of the opening two sets and did not face a break point himself. Shapovalov, who struggled with his returning game in particular, showed his frustrations at the start of the second set. First, he complained to umpire Carlos Bernardes about how long it took Nadal to change his kit. Shapovalov asked the official to give a time violation and after he declined, Shapovalov shouted: ""You guys are all corrupt."" The Canadian remonstrated with Bernardes again before the second game of the second set, now about the time Nadal was taking to serve. Eventually he regained his composure and changed the momentum of the match in third set. Shapovalov, now guided by Andy Murray's former coach Jamie Delgado, was unable to convert either of the two break points in the sixth game but sealed the set with his fourth chance. Another break for the Canadian saw Nadal trail 4-1 in the fourth, when the Spaniard called the trainer for his stomach issue. Nadal grimaced as he discussed the issue with the medic, pointing to his abdominal area before taking medication to alleviate the problem. Shapovalov maintained his advantage to level the match and bring back memories of Nadal losing from two sets up against Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas in last year's quarter-finals. But Nadal broke serve in the second game of the decider, saving break points in his service games either side, to reach the Melbourne semi-finals for the first time since 2019. ""I am not 21 anymore, after this match it is great to have two days off,"" said Nadal, who went off court at the end of the fourth set for a medical examination. ""I felt quite good physically in terms of movement but the conditions haven't been that hot.""

Royal Mail to cut 700 management jobs,"Royal Mail plans to cut around 700 management jobs as it tries to reduce costs amid growing competition from rivals. The move, part of a restructuring plan, comes as the firm faces heavy criticism over ongoing postal delays. The company has been struggling to cope with Covid-related staff absences. Those have led to severe delays in some areas and the regulator, Ofcom, has said it may impose fines where services have fallen short. Some customers have complained of waiting up to a month for important deliveries, including prescriptions and legal documents as well as late Christmas cards. Ofcom said recently that it was ""concerned about these delays and have made it clear to Royal Mail that it must take steps to improve its performance as the effects of the pandemic subside"". Large parts of London, Manchester, Hertfordshire, Wales and Scotland, have been particularly affected by the delays. In early January, around 15,000 - or more than one in 10 - of Royal Mail's staff were off sick or isolating. But Simon Thompson, who took over as chief executive of the delivery firm a year ago, said the situation was now improving. Royal Mail staff absences almost double 2018 level London hit worst by Royal Mail delivery delays Are you experiencing postal delays? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Mr Thompson said absences had been ""a headwind"" in delivering productivity targets. Between April and December last year the firm had spent more than Â£340m on overtime, additional temporary staffing and sick pay, he said. Royal Mail said the latest planned job cuts would incur a charge of Â£70m but would deliver annual savings of around Â£40m. The company axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic. Royal Mail has seen deliveries particularly hard hit by staff sickness and absences with the advent of Omicron, with around one in eight staff affected over the Christmas period. But even before that, it had repeatedly failed to meet delivery targets. With pressure from customers, the regulator and shareholders for more efficient operations, Royal Mail is undertaking an overhaul. And its managers will bear the brunt. The company says that losing 700 posts will enable it to streamline its structure and improve local performance and ultimately, save Â£40m per year.  It will now have to consult unions on the proposals. In the first year of the pandemic Royal Mail saw rising demand for its services as people switched to shopping online at home. Over the past year, with High Street stores open again, that demand has fallen back, but Royal Mail's chairman Keith Williams said the trend for higher numbers of parcels being delivered remained. The volume of domestic parcels being delivered by Royal Mail between October and December was 33% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019, but 7% lower than in 2020. However, the number of letters Royal Mail handled in the October to December period declined compared to both 2020 and 2021. Royal Mail said it believed it was retaining its share of the deliveries market, although it saw a slower than expected pick-up around the Black Friday shopping period. ""The past few months have demonstrated that the challenge for Royal Mail is to improve both quality and efficiency,"" Mr Williams said. Price rises in the UK and elsewhere have raised costs for both its domestic and international businesses, Royal Mail said. ""Looking forwards, the delivery of our transformation and modernisation plans remain incredibly important in light of the fastâpaced change we are seeing and ongoing inflationary pressures."" Royal Mail also said that as government guidance over Covid-19 changed, there would be fluctuations in the number of Covid tests it would be delivering. The firm agreed in December to double deliveries of tests to a total of 900,000 a day, including both PCR and lateral flow tests. Over the nine months to the end of last year, Covid tests accounted for between 4% and 6% of Royal Mail's parcel volumes.

Government borrowed less than expected in December,"Interest payments on government borrowing last month hit a record high for December as surging inflation increased the cost of debt. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said interest on government debt hit Â£8.1bn last month - up from Â£2.7bn a year earlier. The increase came as soaring energy costs sent inflation to a 30-year high. Official borrowing - the gap between spending and tax receipts - last month was a lower-than-forecast Â£16.8bn. The figure was down Â£7.6bn from the same month a year earlier, with the Treasury's coffers bolstered by more income from housing stamp duty and fuel taxes. But public debt interest payments are linked to the Retail Prices Index of inflation, which hit 7.5% last month, the highest rate since March 1991. For the financial year to date, borrowing has now reached Â£146.8bn, the second-highest figure for the period since records began in 1993. Where does the government borrow billions from? Why are prices rising so quickly? Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Chancellor Rishi Sunak, under pressure to relax planned tax rises in April, underlined the impact of rising debt repayments in a statement after the figures were released. He said: ""We are supporting the British people as we recover from the pandemic through our Plan for Jobs and business grants, loans and tax reliefs. ""Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments. ""Our fiscal rules mean we will reduce our debt burden while continuing to invest in the future of the UK."" In total, more than 50 schemes have been announced by the UK government and devolved nations to support individuals and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The consensus among economists was that December borrowing would reach about Â£18.5bn. However, with the rate of inflation set to continue rising until about April, analysts at Capital Economics said further falls were unlikely. National Insurance (NI) is set to rise in April, piling more cost-of-living pressure on struggling households. Although Mr Sunak has so far given no signal he will bow to pressure to scrap the rise, Capital Economics said the December figures suggest he ""would have enough fiscal room to cancel"" the NI rise without too much damage to the nation's finances. Overall the public purse may be in better shape than some had feared - but that doesn't mean the chancellor is in a generous mood. The amount of interest the Treasury paid on its debts in December was three times what it was a year ago. About a quarter of public debt is linked to inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index. And that inflation is now at a 30-year high of over 7%, and is set to rise further in the coming months. Moreover, interest rates themselves are likely to rise in a bid to curb price rises - and every 1% on rates adds Â£20bn to the cost of public debt repayments. It's mounting cost that a chancellor who is intent on reducing borrowing has zoomed in on. Rishi Sunak has stressed that it's ""important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments"". That may be his way of hinting that he won't be swayed by calls to delay looming tax changes that are set to take a further chunk out of household budgets, and that the Treasury is prepared to give only limited help to reduce the pain of soaring energy costs. Economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies say that the chancellor does have the financial wiggle room to at least delay tax rises for now. But they also say that those rises will have to eventually come, faced with rising demands from the likes of an ageing population, the public finances are to be knocked into a more sustainable state. How does the government borrow money? Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Pay rises fail to keep up with the cost of living Sunak can fund new Covid support, says think tank Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Pressure mounts on Doug Beattie over tweetsIt follows the emergence of historical tweets, which have led to allegations of misogyny and racism.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Doug Beattie says the UUP cannot be ""collateral damage"" after his ""serious mistakes"" Doug Beattie is to remain as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader after he received the support of his party's MLAs and officers. It followed accusations of misogyny and racism over a number of his historical tweets. Mr Beattie said the tweets were ""pretty horrific"" andhe was ""deeply ashamed"" of them. However, he denied he was a racist or a misogynist. Mr Beattie said the tweets are ""not who I am"". On Tuesday afternoon, Mr Beattie said: ""I have had detailed conversations with all of my MLAs, I apologised for what I had done directly to each one of them and then I spoke [about] whether or not I still had their support to remain as party leader - overwhelmingly every one of them said 'yes, I did'."" Mr Beattie said that he had also received the backing of the party chairman and its officers and conversations would continue with other UUP members over the historical tweets. A number of the posts, mostly dating from before the former soldier joined the UUP in 2014, have been shared on social media. They feature derogatory comments about women and Muslims, the use of a strong racist slur and use of an offensive term for the Traveller community. Most of the posts being circulated have previously been deleted, but it is not possible to say when that happened. Robbie Butler said Mr Beattie had the support of UUP MLAs and officers On Tuesday afternoon, the UUP's deputy leader Robbie Butler confirmed that Mr Beattie had the support of the MLA group and party officers. In a brief statement at Stormont, he paid tribute to Mr Beattie for ""the manner in which he has responded and how serious he takes this issue and these events"". Earlier, Mr Beattie said that if the MLAs or party officers wanted him to stand down, he would. Doug Beattie has faced his share of battles - on the front lines in Afghanistan, and in turning around the fortunes of the Ulster Unionists at Stormont. Today came his biggest political fight - managing the backlash over his use of social media. But he didn't have to wait long to find out his fate, with senior party colleagues publicly cementing support for him this afternoon. But, privately, there is deep disappointment and hurt over how this controversy surrounding their leader has played out. The so-called Beattie bounce that had been predicted for the assembly election may also have fallen flat. Eight months ago, he was the only person in the frame to take over as party leader after Steve Aiken resigned. Avoiding the optics of a fifth leader in four years may partially explain why Doug Beattie is staying on and not stepping down. Later, the Upper Bann assembly member told Talkback thathe had been ""on the cusp"" of resigning as leader on Monday. ""I feel quite broken,"" he said. Doug Beattie in The Nolan Show studio on Tuesday morning Before he gathered support from party members, he told the programme: ""So look, I offered my resignation and people said let's look, let's engage - let's engage and see where we go. ""I've never had an easy life so I'll take whatever I have to take. ""I suppose if I believe in what I believe, and I do believe - that Northern Ireland deserves better, but maybe it needs better than me. ""Or maybe it needs me to confront what I did in the past, so that I learn for the future, maybe that's what I need to do."" The posts emerged after Mr Beattie apologised for tweeting a joke about former DUP leader Edwin Poots and his wife on Saturday night. Mr Poots said his wife had been ""disgusted"" by it and it was widely condemned by Northern Ireland political leaders. On Tuesday, Donnelly & Wall Solicitors said it had instigated legal proceedings on behalf of Mr and Mrs Poots against Mr Beattie and Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, in relation to the tweet. It is understood Mr Hoare retweeted Mr Beattie's post, before later deleting it. Patrick Higgins, a partner at the law firm, said the post ""constitutes a grave and unwarranted attack on my clients reputation"". Edwin Poots said on Monday he accepted Doug Beattie's apology but believed the UUP leader's judgement was ""poor"" On Monday, Mr Beattie issued apersonal statement on Twitter,externalin which he said he was ""deeply ashamed and embarrassed"" by the content of previous tweets. He did not share details of the tweets, but they later came to be widely circulated on social media. Mr Beattie, who was an Army officer before he joined the UUP, told the Nolan Show that some of the tweets were sent when he was ""still in a male-dominated environment, still in the military"". He described some as having a ""dark humour"" that was used ""as a coping mechanism"". Mr Beattie added: ""What I did 10 years ago was absolutely fundamentally wrong then, it's wrong now."" He said he was not hiding away from his ""mistakes"" and that he was not a misogynist or a racist. ""All I can do is front up to them and make the case that I am deeply sorry and apologise to everybody - the whole of society, certainly to women who may feel let down, to those people who I brought into the party,"" he said. ""I will absolutely accept that my tweets were misogynistic and I will absolutely stand up to that, but I am not a misogynist."" He added that he also ""will not accept"" that he is a racist. As a soldier, Mr Beattie, served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, and was awarded a Military Cross for bravery during operations to retake the town of Garmsir in Helmand, Afghanistan. He said he had defended Islam and would ""completely refute anybody who thinks I have an issue with Islam or with Muslims"". On Tuesday, two Ulster Unionist female politicians tweeted their support for Mr Beattie. Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston, a former Progressive Unionist Party councillor who joined the UUP last year, said ""there is no other leader I trust more with my children's future"" than Mr Beattie.

An assembly election candidate for North Down, Naomi McBurney, said she respected her party leader ""and what he has delivered and can continue to deliver for Northern Ireland"", and had ""huge admiration"" for ""owning the past"" on BBC's The Nolan Show. A number of Northern Ireland's political leaders have condemned the tweets. The DUP's Diane Dodds said the misogynistic language in some of Mr Beattie's tweets did not promote positive attitudes towards women. ""I am troubled that the type of language that is used is deeply worrying for young women and for women in general,"" she said. ""I have a young daughter, of just over 20 starting out in the workplace, I would not like to think that her leader in the workplace, her boss in the workplace, was using such deeply, deeply sexist, misogynistic language."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted on Tuesday that Mr Beattie's comments on ""women, race and others are outrageous and totally unacceptable"". ""There is a litany of abuse on his account and the public will make up its own mind on that. ""These regressive, outdated attitudes in society must be faced down."" The Green Party leader Clare Bailey described some of Mr Beattie's posts as ""deeply disturbing"". ""Nobody gets a personality transplant when they take elected office,"" she said. ""His tweets have really demonstrated deeply disturbing attitudes, not only to women, but to Muslims; to Travellers; there's been slurs about people with mental illness. ""So if this is his union of people, he can certainly count me out."" SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said they were ""deeply, deeply offensive"" and she was ""shocked and deeply disappointed"". ""What I'm so shocked at is it's not just one-off-the-cuff tweet,"" she added. ""It's the volume and the level. They are deeply offensive and seem to have been relentless during that period, targeting women in particular and a wide range of minority groups."" On Monday, Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""genuinely shocked at just how casually misogynistic"" the tweet referring to Mr Poots' wife was, saying it would ""have made many a 1970s comic blush"".

Marmite maker to cut thousands of jobs worldwide,"Consumer goods giant Unilever has confirmed it will cut about 1,500 jobs globally as part of an overhaul of its management and structure. The Marmite-to-Domestos maker said the cuts would not affect shopfloor jobs in factories. Unilever is under pressure after a failed Â£50bn bid for a division of GlaxoSmithKline, and some shareholders have demanded changes. The firm employs more than 6,000 people in its UK and Ireland operations. Plans for jobs cuts and a re-organisation have been underway for many months. Unilever said the proposed job cuts would reduce the number of senior management roles by about 15% and there would be 5% fewer junior management roles. PG Tips maker will not raise Â£50bn bid for rival The new Unilever will be re-organised around five divisions, including beauty, personal care and ice cream, resulting in several senior executive changes along with cuts further down the management chain. ""Our new organisational model has been developed over the last year and is designed to continue the step-up we are seeing in the performance of our business,"" said chief executive Alan Jope. ""Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery. Growth remains our top priority and these changes will underpin our pursuit of this."" Unilever's 80 brands are currently divided into three divisions: Beauty & Personal Care, Food & Refreshment, Home Care. The new structure spins off brands Ben & Jerry's, Magnum and Cornetto into a separate division called Ice Cream, headed by Matt Close. Unilever said Ben & Jerry's will retain its separate independent board, a structure agreed when Unilever bought the brand in 2000. The announcement comes just a week after Unilever sparked anger from some investors when it dropped a short-lived pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) healthcare business. Unilever had initially said it wanted a bigger slice of the personal healthcare and hygiene market, to offset slow growth in its foods business. But GSK, which owns brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, said the offer ""fundamentally undervalued"" the division and Unilever has since refused to raise its bid. The saga has sparked unease about the firm's management under Mr Jope, with the head of Unilever's 13th biggest investor labelling the GSK bid as a ""near death experience"". Unilever chief executive Alan Jope is under pressure after a failed bid for GSK's consumer healthcare arm In a scathing attack, influential fund manager Terry Smith, who runs Fundsmith, criticised Unilever's ""meaningless platitudes"" over its social and environmental commitments and told Mr Jope to focus on improving the existing businesses ""before taking on any more challenges"" like the GSK bid. Unilever, one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100, is also one of the biggest dividend payers to shareholders and pension funds. Powerful activist investor Nelson Peltz has also been agitating for change, raising a question mark over Mr Jope's future. After the humiliation of having its bids for GSK's consumer healthcare business repeatedly rejected, this is a real ""What next?"" moment for Unilever. The answer appears to be to knuckle down and focus on the existing business, trimming out excess fat and attempting to accelerate growth, rather than building new empires. It is likely to be a more popular approach with leading investors, several of whom were deeply unhappy with the idea of a move into the personal healthcare business. The fact that activist investor Nelson Peltz has come on board is likely to add extra urgency to the restructuring process. But that still leaves question marks hanging over chief executive Alan Jope and his team. Can they restore their lost credibility - and do they have anything else up their sleeves? Mr Peltz's hedge fund Trian Partners has previously demanded reforms at rival consumer goods firms Procter & Gamble and Mondelez. It emerged on Monday that Trian had taken a stake in Unilever. The size of the stake is not known but Mr Peltz's decision pleased investors, with shares in the company jumping by 7.3% in London on Monday. In a note, analysts at Barclays said Mr Peltz's investment ""will not be that much of a surprise to industry specialists"". ""From Unilever's perspective, the status quo is not an option,"" they added. ""It would seem that the stars are aligning with both Unilever management and an activist pushing for more urgency."" Analyst Susannah Streeter, from stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tuesday's announcement was an attempt by management ""to show they are getting the house in order"". Unilever shares rose briefly after the news, but have since lost ground. ""Some investors [are] not satisfied that cost cutting alone will be enough to ensure Unilever turns a corner,"" Ms Streeter said. She added: ""Clearly more clarity is being demanded about the direction ahead, and Alan Jope is still under pressure to come up with a brand new strategy.""

Government borrowed less than expected last month,"Interest payments on government borrowing last month hit a record high for December as surging inflation increased the cost of debt. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said interest on government debt hit Â£8.1bn last month - up from Â£2.7bn a year earlier. The increase came as soaring energy costs sent inflation to a 30-year high. Official borrowing - the gap between spending and tax receipts - last month was a lower-than-forecast Â£16.8bn. The figure was down Â£7.6bn from the same month a year earlier, with the Treasury's coffers bolstered by more income from housing stamp duty and fuel taxes. But public debt interest payments are linked to the Retail Prices Index of inflation, which hit 7.5% last month, the highest rate since March 1991. For the financial year to date, borrowing has now reached Â£146.8bn, the second-highest figure for the period since records began in 1993. Where does the government borrow billions from? Why are prices rising so quickly? Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Chancellor Rishi Sunak, under pressure to relax planned tax rises in April, underlined the impact of rising debt repayments in a statement after the figures were released. He said: ""We are supporting the British people as we recover from the pandemic through our Plan for Jobs and business grants, loans and tax reliefs. ""Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments. ""Our fiscal rules mean we will reduce our debt burden while continuing to invest in the future of the UK."" In total, more than 50 schemes have been announced by the UK government and devolved nations to support individuals and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The consensus among economists was that December borrowing would reach about Â£18.5bn. However, with the rate of inflation set to continue rising until about April, analysts at Capital Economics said further falls were unlikely. National Insurance (NI) is set to rise in April, piling more cost-of-living pressure on struggling households. Although Mr Sunak has so far given no signal he will bow to pressure to scrap the rise, Capital Economics said the December figures suggest he ""would have enough fiscal room to cancel"" the NI rise without too much damage to the nation's finances. Overall the public purse may be in better shape than some had feared - but that doesn't mean the chancellor is in a generous mood. The amount of interest the Treasury paid on its debts in December was three times what it was a year ago. About a quarter of public debt is linked to inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index. And that inflation is now at a 30-year high of over 7%, and is set to rise further in the coming months. Moreover, interest rates themselves are likely to rise in a bid to curb price rises - and every 1% on rates adds Â£20bn to the cost of public debt repayments. It's mounting cost that a chancellor who is intent on reducing borrowing has zoomed in on. Rishi Sunak has stressed that it's ""important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments"". That may be his way of hinting that he won't be swayed by calls to delay looming tax changes that are set to take a further chunk out of household budgets, and that the Treasury is prepared to give only limited help to reduce the pain of soaring energy costs. Economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies say that the chancellor does have the financial wiggle room to at least delay tax rises for now. But they also say that those rises will have to eventually come, faced with rising demands from the likes of an ageing population, the public finances are to be knocked into a more sustainable state.

Pressure mounts on Doug Beattie over tweets,"This video can not be played Doug Beattie says the UUP cannot be ""collateral damage"" after his ""serious mistakes"" Doug Beattie is to remain as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader after he received the support of his party's MLAs and officers. It followed accusations of misogyny and racism over a number of his historical tweets. Mr Beattie said the tweets were ""pretty horrific"" andhe was ""deeply ashamed"" of them. However, he denied he was a racist or a misogynist. Mr Beattie said the tweets are ""not who I am"". On Tuesday afternoon, Mr Beattie said: ""I have had detailed conversations with all of my MLAs, I apologised for what I had done directly to each one of them and then I spoke [about] whether or not I still had their support to remain as party leader - overwhelmingly every one of them said 'yes, I did'."" Mr Beattie said that he had also received the backing of the party chairman and its officers and conversations would continue with other UUP members over the historical tweets. A number of the posts, mostly dating from before the former soldier joined the UUP in 2014, have been shared on social media. They feature derogatory comments about women and Muslims, the use of a strong racist slur and use of an offensive term for the Traveller community. Most of the posts being circulated have previously been deleted, but it is not possible to say when that happened. Robbie Butler said Mr Beattie had the support of UUP MLAs and officers On Tuesday afternoon, the UUP's deputy leader Robbie Butler confirmed that Mr Beattie had the support of the MLA group and party officers. In a brief statement at Stormont, he paid tribute to Mr Beattie for ""the manner in which he has responded and how serious he takes this issue and these events"". Earlier, Mr Beattie said that if the MLAs or party officers wanted him to stand down, he would. Doug Beattie has faced his share of battles - on the front lines in Afghanistan, and in turning around the fortunes of the Ulster Unionists at Stormont. Today came his biggest political fight - managing the backlash over his use of social media. But he didn't have to wait long to find out his fate, with senior party colleagues publicly cementing support for him this afternoon. But, privately, there is deep disappointment and hurt over how this controversy surrounding their leader has played out. The so-called Beattie bounce that had been predicted for the assembly election may also have fallen flat. Eight months ago, he was the only person in the frame to take over as party leader after Steve Aiken resigned. Avoiding the optics of a fifth leader in four years may partially explain why Doug Beattie is staying on and not stepping down. Later, the Upper Bann assembly member told Talkback thathe had been ""on the cusp"" of resigning as leader on Monday. ""I feel quite broken,"" he said. Doug Beattie in The Nolan Show studio on Tuesday morning Before he gathered support from party members, he told the programme: ""So look, I offered my resignation and people said let's look, let's engage - let's engage and see where we go. ""I've never had an easy life so I'll take whatever I have to take. ""I suppose if I believe in what I believe, and I do believe - that Northern Ireland deserves better, but maybe it needs better than me. ""Or maybe it needs me to confront what I did in the past, so that I learn for the future, maybe that's what I need to do."" The posts emerged after Mr Beattie apologised for tweeting a joke about former DUP leader Edwin Poots and his wife on Saturday night. Mr Poots said his wife had been ""disgusted"" by it and it was widely condemned by Northern Ireland political leaders. On Tuesday, Donnelly & Wall Solicitors said it had instigated legal proceedings on behalf of Mr and Mrs Poots against Mr Beattie and Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, in relation to the tweet. It is understood Mr Hoare retweeted Mr Beattie's post, before later deleting it. Patrick Higgins, a partner at the law firm, said the post ""constitutes a grave and unwarranted attack on my clients reputation"". Edwin Poots said on Monday he accepted Doug Beattie's apology but believed the UUP leader's judgement was ""poor"" On Monday, Mr Beattie issued apersonal statement on Twitter,externalin which he said he was ""deeply ashamed and embarrassed"" by the content of previous tweets. He did not share details of the tweets, but they later came to be widely circulated on social media. Mr Beattie, who was an Army officer before he joined the UUP, told the Nolan Show that some of the tweets were sent when he was ""still in a male-dominated environment, still in the military"". He described some as having a ""dark humour"" that was used ""as a coping mechanism"". Mr Beattie added: ""What I did 10 years ago was absolutely fundamentally wrong then, it's wrong now."" He said he was not hiding away from his ""mistakes"" and that he was not a misogynist or a racist. ""All I can do is front up to them and make the case that I am deeply sorry and apologise to everybody - the whole of society, certainly to women who may feel let down, to those people who I brought into the party,"" he said. ""I will absolutely accept that my tweets were misogynistic and I will absolutely stand up to that, but I am not a misogynist."" He added that he also ""will not accept"" that he is a racist. As a soldier, Mr Beattie, served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, and was awarded a Military Cross for bravery during operations to retake the town of Garmsir in Helmand, Afghanistan. He said he had defended Islam and would ""completely refute anybody who thinks I have an issue with Islam or with Muslims"". On Tuesday, two Ulster Unionist female politicians tweeted their support for Mr Beattie. Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston, a former Progressive Unionist Party councillor who joined the UUP last year, said ""there is no other leader I trust more with my children's future"" than Mr Beattie.

An assembly election candidate for North Down, Naomi McBurney, said she respected her party leader ""and what he has delivered and can continue to deliver for Northern Ireland"", and had ""huge admiration"" for ""owning the past"" on BBC's The Nolan Show. A number of Northern Ireland's political leaders have condemned the tweets. The DUP's Diane Dodds said the misogynistic language in some of Mr Beattie's tweets did not promote positive attitudes towards women. ""I am troubled that the type of language that is used is deeply worrying for young women and for women in general,"" she said. ""I have a young daughter, of just over 20 starting out in the workplace, I would not like to think that her leader in the workplace, her boss in the workplace, was using such deeply, deeply sexist, misogynistic language."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted on Tuesday that Mr Beattie's comments on ""women, race and others are outrageous and totally unacceptable"". ""There is a litany of abuse on his account and the public will make up its own mind on that. ""These regressive, outdated attitudes in society must be faced down."" The Green Party leader Clare Bailey described some of Mr Beattie's posts as ""deeply disturbing"". ""Nobody gets a personality transplant when they take elected office,"" she said. ""His tweets have really demonstrated deeply disturbing attitudes, not only to women, but to Muslims; to Travellers; there's been slurs about people with mental illness. ""So if this is his union of people, he can certainly count me out."" SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said they were ""deeply, deeply offensive"" and she was ""shocked and deeply disappointed"". ""What I'm so shocked at is it's not just one-off-the-cuff tweet,"" she added. ""It's the volume and the level. They are deeply offensive and seem to have been relentless during that period, targeting women in particular and a wide range of minority groups."" On Monday, Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""genuinely shocked at just how casually misogynistic"" the tweet referring to Mr Poots' wife was, saying it would ""have made many a 1970s comic blush"".

Homes with oil-powered heating see 50% price rise,"This video can not be played ""People are having to make their choices as to whether they heat or eat"" As millions of UK families prepare for a hike in their energy bills, some are already feeling the pinch because their heating is powered by oil. Sara Bate, 43, is one of 1.5 million UK householders whose heating is powered by oil as her home in rural west Wales does not have mains gas supply. As many worry about theenergy price cap rise, higher bills are a reality for oil customers such as Sara. ""Everything has got a bit more basic,"" she said. The mother-of-one added: ""I eat basic food and I need new shoes but they are going to have to wait. ""I juggle the bills. I could get rid of my car but I'm looking for work and round here you need a car because there isn't a bus service up here anymore."" Four things that are going up in price and why Why is the cost of living going up? Sara has not bought any clothes ""for quite a long time"" because her heating costs are soaring as the temperatures drop with thecost of oil reaching a seven-year high. It comes amid a cost of living crisis with prices in the UK rising at thefastest rate in nearly 30 yearsandpeople have been warnedit could get worse. Some customers who have oil heating have seen bills rise by more than 50% in the past year Costs to heat homes of oil customers have risen sharply - some by more than 50% in the past year - and it is particularly affecting rural areas like where Sara lives. While oil heats 4% of UK homes, more than 33% of homes in Ceredigion are heated this way and Office for National Statistics research said the county had faced the highest increase in fuel bills of any area in mainland UK in the past year - Â£863 on average. The energy price cap, which limits how much providers can charge for energy per unit, is expected to soar in the spring because of ""unprecedented""rises in gas pricesand will affect the three-quarters of UK households. This video can not be played What does high inflation mean? The BBC's Colletta Smith explains in 90 seconds Oil customers, though, also feel vulnerable as they are not protected by the energy cap. It would cost Sara, who lives with her 13-year-old daughter in Llandysul, about Â£1,000 to fill the oil tank in her garden. But as she is dependent on benefits and gets Â£220 a fortnight, she tops up Â£18 worth of oil a week - so uses heating sparingly and concentrates on keeping her daughter's room warm. How to smooth over the energy price shock 'I only put heating on when my grandkids visit' With oil price rises expected to continue, Sara said: ""What will we do then? ""Am I going to have longer and longer periods without heat. I don't want to do that as it's not fair on the little girl to say you've got to be cold and put a jumper on. It's worrying."" Sara Bate said her car is vital in rural west Wales as public transport is poor She was so worried about how to pay her bills that she went to her local Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) for help. It said it had seen an increase in the number of people across Ceredigion wanting guidance on paying their energy bills. ""We're being inundated with clients who are really concerned about their bills,"" said William Jones from CAB. ""It's putting so much pressure on people. They are having to make the choice of whether they heat or eat. What we see a lot of the time is that people are underheating their homes so they are trying to make things last longer."" William Jones is the energy advice supervisor at Ceredigion CAB Pressure groupsdescribed the increases in fuel prices as reaching crisis point,external. The Liberal Democrats predict both Ceredigion and Gwynedd will experience the steepest energy price rises - and suggested abolishing the 5% VAT rate on energy bills to help families. The party's leader in Wales said removing VAT would see ""Â£100 come off the bill straight away"". ""We want to see a system here in Wales where actually there is much more commitment to ensuring the warm homes discount is doubled, particularly for vulnerable people,"" said Jane Dodds, who represents mid and west Wales in the Welsh Parliament. ""For the UK government we want them to introduce what we're calling a Robin Hood tax - that is a transaction tax on the big energy companies."" Allow YouTube content?

But Fay Jones, Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, said a cut to VAT was not the solution and government and industry needed to come together. ""We do have to think holistically, we can't just look at quick fixes like cutting VAT,"" she said. The Welsh government said: ""Rural households are included within the scope of our Discretionary Assistance Fund (DAF), which supports eligible off-grid homes with the cost of fuel and boiler repairs. ""The DAF is also working closely with our single advice fund services so more vulnerable people can get the advice and support they need to tackle the root causes of their financial problems and improve their longer term outcomes."" The UK government said families could be eligible for theWarm Home Discount,external, which it said could take Â£150 off annual bills by October. ""Homes which are off the gas grid but on the electricity grid are still protected by the energy price cap,"" added a UK government spokesman.
