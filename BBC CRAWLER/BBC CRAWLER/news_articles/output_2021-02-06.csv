Myanmar shuts down internet amid anti-coup rallies,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands of people take part in the largest protest in Myanmar in more than a decade Myanmar's military rulers have shut down the country's internet as thousands of people joined the largest rally yet against Monday's coup. A near-total internet blackout is in effect with connectivity falling to 16% of ordinary levels, said the monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory. In the main city, Yangon, crowds chanted ""Military dictator, fail, fail; Democracy, win, win"". Police with riot shields have blocked the main roads into the city centre. The internet shutdown happened hours after the military blocked access to Twitter and Instagram to stop people mobilising for protests. Facebook had been banned a day earlier. Many users had evaded the restrictions on social media by using virtual private networks (VPNs) but the more general blackout severely disrupted that. How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet In pictures: Myanmar protests defy military coup What Myanmar's coup means for Aung San Suu Kyi Civil society organisations urged internet providers and mobile networks to challenge the blackout order, Reuters news agency reported. Human rights group Amnesty International called the shutdown ""heinous and reckless"" and warned it could put the people of Myanmar at risk of human rights violations. The military has not commented. It temporarily blocked access to the internet following the coup on 1 February. On Saturday morning, protesters - including factory workers and young students - called for the release of those detained by the army, including elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. They marched through the streets of Yangon as city buses sounded their horns in support. Bystanders flashed the three-finger Hunger Games salute, which has become a symbol of defiance against authoritarianism, while residents clapped or banged pots and pans on their doorsteps. Many households have also been displaying red stickers in their windows in support of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, the BBC's Burmese editor Soe Win Than reports. Protesters in Yangon received support from thousands of residents, who clapped on doorsteps Police with riot shields used barbed wire to block roads and water cannon were put in place in some areas as a precaution, but the demonstration reportedly remained peaceful, with no attempt by protesters to pass police lines. Demonstrators gave police roses and bottles of drinking water, calling on them to support the people not the new regime. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? One female protester, who asked not to be named, said she would not accept the ""unjust seizing of power"". ""Because of military dictatorship, many of our lives have been destroyed,"" she said, adding: ""We cannot allow our future generations to meet the same fate."" Speaking from Yangon, Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, told the BBC that people were taking to the streets in increasing numbers. ""The grief and the sadness of the last few days is gradually turning to anger,"" he said, adding: ""Doctors are refusing to work and civil servants have been refusing to work... There's quite a sense around the country of unhappiness at what's happened - and outrage."" Police in riot gear have blocked roads in Yangon Another demonstration took place on Saturday in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. Myanmar - also known as Burma - has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, and there were no immediate reports of violence after Saturday's protests. More demonstrations were expected to be held later. The military authorities are hunkered down in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw, and have so far avoided direct engagement with the protesters. The BBC's Nyein Chan in Yangon says the Burmese know very well the violent crackdowns that the military is capable of.  The country was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. But now that people have had time to digest what is happening, they are finding different ways to get their voices heard, our correspondent says. Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. Police documents show she is accused of illegally importing and using communications equipment - walkie-talkies - at her home in the capital. The coup took place as a new session of parliament was set to open, following November's landslide election win by the NLD party. This video can not be played ""We wish them to fall"": Teachers in the city of Yangon have joined protests against Monday's military coup Many Burmese watched the events unfold in real time on Facebook, which is the country's primary source of information and news. But three days later, internet providers were ordered to block the platform for stability reasons. Following the ban, thousands of users were active on Twitter and Instagram using hashtags to express their opposition to the takeover. By 22:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Friday access to those platforms had also been denied. Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? There was no official word from the coup leaders but AFP reported it had seen an unverified ministry document that said the two social media sites were being used to ""cause misunderstanding among the public"". A spokeswoman for Twitter said the ban undermined ""the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard"". Facebook, which owns Instagram, called on the authorities to ""restore connectivity"". Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, either directly or indirectly,  leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Buta deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslimssent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and her previous supporters in the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. But she has remained hugely popular at home, shown in her party's landslide win in the November election. Have you been affected by recent events in Myanmar?

Reforms planned for NHS in England,"The government is planning to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under David Cameron in 2012, a leaked document suggests. The changes would aim to tackle bureaucracy and encourage health services from hospitals to GP surgeries and social care to work more closely. The draft policy paper also says the health secretary would take more direct control over NHS England. The Department for Health and Social Care said it did not comment on leaks. A spokesman added that details would be set out in due course. Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss 11 charts on the problems facing the NHS The reforms by Mr Cameron's government in 2012saw the creation of NHS England- to run the health service - and the scrapping of primary care trusts in favour of GP-led clinical commissioning groups to organise local services. Under the latest proposals, set out in a leaked document published by health news websiteHealth Policy Insight,external, there will be ""enhanced powers of direction for the government"" to ""ensure that decision makers overseeing the health system at a national level are effectively held to account"". Instead of a system that requires competitive tendering for contracts - sometimes involving private companies, the NHS and local authorities will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other, says the draft White Paper, designed to set out proposed legislation. There will also be more focus on GPs, hospitals and social care services working together to improve patient care. The paper stresses that the Covid pandemic ""demonstrated plainly that this broader approach to health and care is not only desirable, but essential"". Richard Murray, chief executive of health charity The King's Fund, said the proposals amounted to ""major reform"", giving ministers more direct control of the NHS and public health. But he raised concerns around the timing of such a move. ""While many might agree with the ultimate objective of more integrated health and care services, there are clear risks in distracting the service when the NHS is still battling Covid-19 and in the midst of the biggest vaccination programme in our history,"" Mr Murray added. The trade unions for doctors and nurses, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing respectively, would not comment on the leaked proposals. A Conservative government headed by Boris Johnson is about to start reversing health reforms in England introduced under David Cameron. That in itself is a significant moment, though it has been in the offing for a while. The Health and Social Care Act of 2012,externalwas highly controversial. The left hated it because of the introduction of competitive tendering which was seen as a vehicle for private companies to undermine the NHS. Many Conservative politicians came to dislike it because of bureaucratic costs and confused lines of accountability. Sir Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, called for a redrafting of legislation to simplify the system. Now Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is grasping the nettle and will soon publish a government White Paper with plans to give ministers more control over the complex web of health entities in England. NHS organisations and local authorities will be told to focus on working together for the benefit of their local populations. But the detail, as always, will be closely scrutinised. Some will question why the government has chosen to launch the plans with the pandemic still raging. Others may ask whether this is a power grab by ministers which won't necessarily improve patient care. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of health policy think tank the Nuffield Trust, said the reforms should allow GPs, hospitals, community services and social care to ""work better and more effectively together"" in the longer term. He told the BBC he hoped ""the changes in the wiring behind the dashboard shouldn't be too noticeable to patients and when it is, it will be in the longer term because the results they're getting are better"". But he warned against over-optimism, saying structural change could help but was not ""the magic ingredient"" to better delivery of care. Meanwhile, Dr John Lister, of campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said: ""The leaked draft of the White Paper has been interpreted as planning to 'scrap forced privatisation and competition within the NHS', but the draft makes clear that 'there will continue to be an important role for voluntary and independent sector providers'."" Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the proposed changes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Last year was the first year in history where, across the world, there were more over-65s than under-fives, so we are all having to deal with this big change in our health provision of the growth in older people and what that means is you need a lot more joined up care."" He added: ""The structures need to be improved to make that possible and I think that's what these reforms are intended to do, so I think they could be very positive."" However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hunt warned against the emergence of ""cosy local monopolies"" and said the reforms needed to include ""a proper accountability mechanism"" - similar to Ofsted inspecting schools, he added. ""How we make sure that the NHS continues to be held accountable for these huge sums of public money is something that, I am sure, people will want to ask."" The 2012 Health and Social Care Act, brought in by the coalition government led by then-Conservative Prime Minister Mr Cameron, alongside his Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, put NHS England at arms length from the secretary of state. It gave more control over budgets to GPs and other clinicians, while greater competition with the private sector was encouraged. However, the changes attracted criticism from professional bodies representing doctors, nurses and other NHS workers as well as opposition MPs. An NHS spokesman said the service had come together ""to draw up practical proposals that will make it easier for those delivering health and care to work together to deliver the best possible care for patients, without some of the bureaucracy and fragmentation implicit in the 2012 act"". ""Theseproposals were set out publicly in the NHS Long Term Planin 2019 and further developed last year, drawing on what the best local health systems are already doing,"" they added.

Vaccine chief 'optimistic' about over-50s May goal,"The UK can meet the target of vaccinating all over-50s by May, the chairman of the vaccines taskforce has said, adding he is ""very optimistic"". Dr Clive Dix told the BBC the taskforce has met every target set. The UK would be ""ahead of the game"" in terms of anticipating variants of coronavirus and was making ""libraries of future vaccines"", he said. He added that the UK would not hoard supplies but would distribute them globally, once the UK target is met. Downing Street has said everyone in the UK aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May. Previously, ministers had said it was their ""ambition"" to vaccinate thefirst nine priority groupsby the spring. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February. The latest figures also showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. Oxford-AZ vaccine 'effective against Kent variant' How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Coronavirus variants: The science explained Dr Dix, who heads the government unit charged with developing and producing vaccines, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will work day and night to ensure we meet whatever the target that's feasible can be met. ""So I'm very optimistic that we will meet the May target."" Questions have been raised around the efficacy of vaccines against variants of the virus - including the one first identified in Kent. On Friday, Oxford-AstraZeneca said its vaccinegave people good protection against the UK variant. Variants in South Africa and Brazil have also been identified. Dr Dix, who is also chief executive of drug discovery company C4X Discovery, said the UK was ""at the forefront of surveying"" the variants, allowing scientists to ""second-guess"" mutations that have not yet occurred. They can then make vaccines for those variants, he told the programme. ""We'll make libraries of future vaccines, just small amounts, enough to then, if it does occur, do a quick clinical study to see that it works and then start manufacturing it,"" he said. The NHS has the staff, the volunteers and the clinics needed to vaccinate the 15 million in these next priority groups as well as give second doses to those who have already had their first jab. But vaccine production is a biological process so there are no guarantees about how much can be grown. However, there is growing confidence in the UK supply chain. The bulk of the supplies are now coming from UK-based plants producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the yields from these are now consistently in line with expectation unlike those in Europe which started producing the vaccine later and have had less time to iron out the teething problems. On top of this, supplies from Pfizer-BioNTech are expected to increase from mid-February after a slowdown in recent weeks. There will also be a third vaccine made by US firm Moderna to help. The first batches of the 17 million ordered will start arriving before Easter. It will all be needed as there can be no let up if the over-50s are to get vaccinated in the timeframe set out. Asked whether there could be a vaccine-busting variant at some stage, Dr Dix said: ""There's a possibility, but we'll be ahead of the game, we're not going to be waiting for it to happen. ""We now have the capabilities in the UK to be responsive and that capability won't just be for the use of the UK of course. ""Once we've done it, it will actually help the whole world because it will be part of that whole surveillance and reaction."" Wales leads the UK on first vaccine dose rate Scottish vaccination 'exceeding expectations' How many people have been vaccinated so far? Will the vaccine work on new variants? And other questions Speaking to BBC Breakfast, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that mutations of the virus could lead to a ""cycle"" of lockdowns in the future if measures were not put in place, such as effective contact tracing. ""The worry that we have to really plan for is the possibility that we will have a new mutation that is actually immune to the vaccines that we're giving out at the moment,"" Mr Hunt said. ""So, in order to make sure that we don't get caught out by that again, we need to get transmission levels down to the kind of levels where we can do incredibly thorough contact tracing, like they do in Korea and Taiwan."" He also repeated his call for the government to consider more financial support for people told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers, for example by offering to ""make up any salary losses"". Despite the promising news over vaccines, doctors have warned against relaxing rules too quickly. Dr Daniele Bryden, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, told Today: ""I think the vaccination is really encouraging, but we really can't let our guard down and relax the rules. ""For example, the average age of a patient on intensive care at the moment is only 60 and 40% of people on intensive care are less than that age. So it's going to take some time before we see the impact of vaccination."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Every adult in the UK will be offered a vaccine by the autumn,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidlast month. Meanwhile, surge testing is being rolled out to further areas to control and suppress the spread of coronavirus variants, including in: targeted areasaround Worcestershire an area in Sefton, Merseyside (PR9) and areas in Bristol and South Gloucestershire The Department for Health and Social Care said people living in targeted areas were ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid test this week, whether showing symptoms or not. Testing for the South African variant is also due to be increased inSouthport after a second case was detected.

Clarity call on reopening Wales to tourists,"Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower said it was inundated with inquiries on Friday Tourism bosses are seeking a ""roadmap"" to help the sector to prepare ahead of any decision to reopen in Wales. It comes after First Minister Mark Drakeford said some sectionscould open by Easteras long as the Covid-19 situation continues to improve. One caravan park had 100 bookings on Friday - compared with the usual 25 - after Mr Drakeford's comments. But another site with customers mostly from north-west England said they seemed cautious about booking ahead. The Welsh Government said it wants businesses to be open and trading ""as soon it is safe to do so"". Wales has been under alevel four lockdownsince before Christmas with some businesses closed and people ordered to avoid all but essential travel. Tom Beynon, from Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower, said inquiries ""went around the bend"" on Friday with a lot of customers from Wales looking to holiday closer to home. Tourism in Wales 'may start reopening by Easter' Hope for tourism after 'devastating' Covid impact UK staycation boom predicted for 2021 He said daily bookings and inquiries at this time of year had already doubled from 25 to 50 but they shot up to 100 on Friday night ""due to Mr Drakeford's positivity"". ""Is that people reading between the lines that you can go away but [stay] within Wales?"" he said. The park's season traditionally runs between April and October and staff are preparing to reopen as usual ""unless told otherwise"", said Mr Beynon. The Welsh coast saw tourists return in their droves when Covid rules eased last year Barmouth mayor, councillor Katie Price, who also owns a B&B in the Gwynedd town, said a ""roadmap"" was needed so hospitality businesses ""know where they stand"". ""People may have to make new adaptations to their businesses, but how can they start to put things in place when they have no promise of an income or deadline as to when that needs to be done?"" she said. ""The process of reopening has to have full community confidence, so people who live here feel safe, as well as our customers."" She said that tourism was ""one of the biggest parts of the economy"" in Barmouth and added that ""from a business point of view"" footfall is needed when hospitality reopens, which should be reflected in travel rules. Most of Fron Farm Country Holiday Park's customers visit from north-west England Ceri Roberts, from Fron Farm Country Holiday Park, at Hendre, near Mold, Flintshire, said the tourism industry and holidaymakers needed ""certainty, definite dates for people to be able to book with confidence"". She said 98% of customers came from over the English border with people ""cautious"" about booking a place at the site due to differing Covid restrictions last year. Mrs Roberts said the business had pledged to offer refunds if cancellations were necessary to give customers confidence. She has also called for guidance about what could be allowed to reopen as campers were unable to book a pitch for a time last year when shared amenity blocks had to remain closed due to Covid rules. ""I'm more positive about taking caravan and static bookings,"" she said. Berin Jones, of the Shelbourne Hotel, in Llandudno, was ""delighted"" by the news there was a possibility of reopening. ""We traded for 10 weeks of last year in the last 12 months,"" he said. ""It's absolutely essential that all the supporting industries, suppliers and everything else, are able to start planning to reopen and get working again. ""We really need a timetable from (Mark Drakeford) now, we need to understand well in advance when it is he expects to open up campsites, when it is he expects to open up hotels."" Meanwhile, Gwynedd council is planning to hold a summit next month with councillors and Snowdonia National Park Authority officials following ""unprecedented"" visitors to Snowdon since the pandemic began, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Council leader Dyfrig Siencyn told the education and economy scrutiny committee that such ""unsustainable tourism"" could not continue to be accommodated. ""I've been personally accused of being anti-tourism despite growing up in a home which was let out as a bed and breakfast, and it's right that we remember it's an important industry for us,"" he said. ""But the pandemic has perhaps shown we're almost wholly reliant on tourism in rural areas such as Gwynedd and have very little choice, which drives us to create a much more varied economy rather than all our eggs being in one basket."" A Welsh Government spokesman said that restrictions in Wales are kept ""under constant review"" and it will ""always work with sectors to ensure businesses have as much notice as possible"" about changes to Covid rules. ""The public health situation is improving thanks to everyone's hard work and sacrifices but we all need to stay at home for a while longer to bring levels of the virus down further.""

'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on,"Dr Li Wenliang has been hailed a hero by many in China Tributes have been paid on social media in China commemorating a doctor who raised the alarm about the country's coronavirus outbreak, one year after he died with Covid-19. Thousands paid tribute to Li Wenliang ahead of the first anniversary of his death on 7 February 2020. He died after contracting Covid-19 while treating patients in Wuhan. Dr Li had tried to warn fellow medics of a disease that looked like Sars - another deadly coronavirus. But he was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". Dr Li was an eye doctor at a hospital in Wuhan - the central Chinese city where the first case of the coronavirus was detected at the end of 2019. Dr Li's death prompted a rare wave of grief and public anger over the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Sunday marks the first anniversary of Dr Li's death As hospitals filled up in Wuhan, the government was accused of downplaying the severity of the virus and concealing the extent of its spread. Only when anger reached fever pitch was Dr Li exonerated and honoured as a hero by the Chinese government. Since then, more than 105 million people have been infected with coronavirus and 2.3 million have died with Covid-19 worldwide. China coronavirus doctor's widow gives birth to son The Chinese doctor who tried to warn about coronavirus Freedom of speech is limited in China, where the government has promoted an official narrative hinged on its successful handling of the coronavirus outbreak. China does routinely censor comments on social media. But Dr Li's personal page on Weibo - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - has become a rare space for users to express themselves about the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Li's post saying he was ill with Covid-19 has been flooded with comments Hundreds of thousands of messages have been left in the comments section of his posts. Many more appeared on Saturday. 'Wailing Wall' for China's virus whistleblowing doctor ""Dr Li, history and the people will never forget you!,"" one wrote in the comments of Dr Li's final post. ""I thought everyone would have forgotten you after a year,"" another wrote. ""I was wrong, you live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people."" This video can not be played Back inside the Wuhan market where Covid-19 was first traced Citizens in Wuhan have also been paying tribute. Close to the hospital where Dr Li worked, Li Pan told Reuters: ""He was the first to tell us about the virus. ""He must have considered the impact would be huge, but he still raised the alarm. That was really brave.""

"Sea border issues clear when Brexit deal was doneThe NI Protocol problems, which have been in sharp focus this week, were predicted by civil servants.Northern Ireland","On 17 October 2019 Boris Johnson was in ebullient form. He had just sealed the Brexit withdrawal deal with the EU. At a Brussels press conference, the prime minister hailed the agreement as marking the beginning of a ""very exciting"" time for the UK. ""I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK,"" he said. ""And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together. ""And it means we can decide our future together, we can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together."" Meanwhile civil servants were doing the work of turning the deal into domestic UK law - what would become the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. Just four days after Mr Johnson's Brussels triumph, the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) hadproduced an analysis of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill,external. It is that piece of work which shows that the problems with the Irish Sea border were foreseen virtually from the moment the deal was signed. The DExEU civil servants produced a prescient study that almost precisely describes the issues which have come into sharp focus over the past week. Boris Johnson vowed that his Brexit deal would lead to a ""very exciting"" time for the UK The Northern Ireland part of the deal - the Protocol - keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That is to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but at the expense of a new trade border within the UK. The DExEU report was clear about what this meant: ""Goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be required to complete both import declarations and Entry Summary Declarations because the UK will be applying the EU's custom code in Northern Ireland. ""This will result in additional administrative costs to businesses. ""Businesses that do not currently trade outside the EU will incur familiarisation costs as they have not had to engage with customs processes."" It went on to explain that the heaviest burden would fall on small businesses. ""The proposals will have an effect on all UK businesses that move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, irrespective of the business's size. ""Economic theory suggests that a 'one size fits all' approach for business trade requirements is likely to have a disproportionate effect on small and micro businesses (SMBs) in particular. ""There would be both fixed and variable costs for firms as a consequence of the Protocol, consequently these costs are likely to be a larger proportion of SMBs' operating costs and therefore disproportionately affect them."" It is the trade in food and plant products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that has faced the greatest disruption since 1 January. The problems with the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland were predicted by the government The DExEU report devotes a lengthy section to that issue and again spelled out the implications. ""There will be additional documentation required on all agri-food goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to ensure that they comply with the necessary regulations,"" it stated. ""These could include Export Health Certificates for products of animal origin, fish and live animals; and phytosanitary certificates for plants. ""This would result in an additional administrative cost to businesses moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" DExEU was not the only government department with a clear view of what was coming. During the 2019 UK general election campaign the Labour Partyreleased a leaked Treasury presentation. The language in the document was even blunter. It said: ""The Withdrawal Agreement has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK's internal market."" It also correctly anticipated the way in which the Protocol would be perceived by many unionists: ""Northern Ireland symbolically separated from the union/economic union undermined."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Five steps that led to an Irish Sea border UK and EU in 'constructive' talks on NI trade row Northern Ireland is of little interest to most voters or journalists in Great Britain so the issue sank without trace during the election campaign. After winning that election, the government did act to mitigate the looming impacts of the Protocol. Some potential requirements for new processes on Northern Ireland-Great Britain trade were negotiated away in further talks with the EU. About Â£500m is being spent on a Trader Support Service to help with customs and a Movement Assistance Service to help with the certification costs of agri-food goods. There are ""grace periods"", meaning some of the new processes are being phased in. But the fundamental character of the Protocol has not changed since those DExEU officials explained it all more than 15 months ago.

It also cites Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, two lawyers who represented Mr Trump. The company accused the group of intentionally repeating the false claim that it was ""responsible for stealing"" the election by ""switching and altering votes to rig"" the election for Joe Biden.

Unions dispute council claim on Brexit port threat,"Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew workers from Larne Port Three leading trade unions have distanced themselves from a council's account of alleged threats to workers conducting Brexit checks at Larne Port. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council was told by its mayor that unions had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"", including apparent attempts to record staff car registrations. However, Nipsa, Unite and GMB said they made no such claim. The council withdrew workers from Larne portover security concerns. On Friday, that decision was overturned andworkers returned to duty. The trade unions have now written to the council asking for the disputed comments to be withdrawn, Belfast Live has reported. The comments were made in a public statement by the mayor, DUP councillor Peter Johnston, during a council meeting on Monday. It came as councillors agreed to withdraw 12 staff from the port. The unions said their only communication with the council about threats to workers prior to Monday evening's decision was an email from Unite that afternoon about graffiti. In a joint letter to the council, written on behalf of the unions by TUS secretary Alan Law, they called for the comments to be ""withdrawn and the official record amended"". ""As this was an official statement issued on behalf of council at the monthly meeting please would you clarify which trade union made this claim as neither Nipsa, GMB nor Unite did, and we absolutely distance ourselves from these remarks,"" the letter said. The letter added that trade unions took ""great exception"" to the council issuing any statement attributing remarks to the unions. Mr Law also wrote to the council's chief executive Anne Donaghy seeking clarification. The council was not available for comment on Saturday. Alliance councillor Danny Donnelly told BBC News NI he was ""very surprised and shocked"" to hear the unions dispute claims that they had reported concerns about suspicious activity. ""Our priority has always been the safety of the workers on this, but each day more and more serious questions have developed,"" Mr Donnelly said. Danny Donnelly said councillors want answers from the mayor and the council's chief executive ""The decision to withdraw staff was unanimous, based on the information we were given at the time, but now questions around the credibility of that threat have arisen and around communication with trade unions."" Mr Donnelly said elected representatives now need answers about the credibility of the threat and the timeline of events which led up to the decision to withdraw staff. He called on the mayor and the council's chief executive to give councillors and opportunity to pose questions and ""have those questions answered in an open and transparent manner"". Council staff return to Larne port after threats Edwin Poots 'asked for port staff to be stood down' Mid and East Antrim Borough Council took the decision to withdraw workers last Monday. The council said it had carried out its own risk assessment and staff safety was its priority. Physical checks were also temporarily suspended on most goods by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) at both Larne and Belfast. It followed the appearance of graffiti in Larne on 21 January which referred to those involved in the work as targets. There were also claims that staff car registrations had been recorded. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said there was nothing to indicate loyalist paramilitary involvement nor that registrations had been taken. Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly were told during the week that former agriculture ministerEdwin Poots was central to the decisionto temporarily suspend physical checks and that he ""was not convinced that the PSNI had a full understanding of the risk"". This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to remove an assertion that the council workers were withdrawn after a threat assessment by police.

Sea border issues clear when Brexit deal was done,"On 17 October 2019 Boris Johnson was in ebullient form. He had just sealed the Brexit withdrawal deal with the EU. At a Brussels press conference, the prime minister hailed the agreement as marking the beginning of a ""very exciting"" time for the UK. ""I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK,"" he said. ""And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together. ""And it means we can decide our future together, we can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together."" Meanwhile civil servants were doing the work of turning the deal into domestic UK law - what would become the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. Just four days after Mr Johnson's Brussels triumph, the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) hadproduced an analysis of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill,external. It is that piece of work which shows that the problems with the Irish Sea border were foreseen virtually from the moment the deal was signed. The DExEU civil servants produced a prescient study that almost precisely describes the issues which have come into sharp focus over the past week. Boris Johnson vowed that his Brexit deal would lead to a ""very exciting"" time for the UK The Northern Ireland part of the deal - the Protocol - keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. That is to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but at the expense of a new trade border within the UK. The DExEU report was clear about what this meant: ""Goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be required to complete both import declarations and Entry Summary Declarations because the UK will be applying the EU's custom code in Northern Ireland. ""This will result in additional administrative costs to businesses. ""Businesses that do not currently trade outside the EU will incur familiarisation costs as they have not had to engage with customs processes."" It went on to explain that the heaviest burden would fall on small businesses. ""The proposals will have an effect on all UK businesses that move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, irrespective of the business's size. ""Economic theory suggests that a 'one size fits all' approach for business trade requirements is likely to have a disproportionate effect on small and micro businesses (SMBs) in particular. ""There would be both fixed and variable costs for firms as a consequence of the Protocol, consequently these costs are likely to be a larger proportion of SMBs' operating costs and therefore disproportionately affect them."" It is the trade in food and plant products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that has faced the greatest disruption since 1 January. The problems with the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland were predicted by the government The DExEU report devotes a lengthy section to that issue and again spelled out the implications. ""There will be additional documentation required on all agri-food goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to ensure that they comply with the necessary regulations,"" it stated. ""These could include Export Health Certificates for products of animal origin, fish and live animals; and phytosanitary certificates for plants. ""This would result in an additional administrative cost to businesses moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" DExEU was not the only government department with a clear view of what was coming. During the 2019 UK general election campaign the Labour Partyreleased a leaked Treasury presentation. The language in the document was even blunter. It said: ""The Withdrawal Agreement has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK's internal market."" It also correctly anticipated the way in which the Protocol would be perceived by many unionists: ""Northern Ireland symbolically separated from the union/economic union undermined."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Five steps that led to an Irish Sea border UK and EU in 'constructive' talks on NI trade row Northern Ireland is of little interest to most voters or journalists in Great Britain so the issue sank without trace during the election campaign. After winning that election, the government did act to mitigate the looming impacts of the Protocol. Some potential requirements for new processes on Northern Ireland-Great Britain trade were negotiated away in further talks with the EU. About Â£500m is being spent on a Trader Support Service to help with customs and a Movement Assistance Service to help with the certification costs of agri-food goods. There are ""grace periods"", meaning some of the new processes are being phased in. But the fundamental character of the Protocol has not changed since those DExEU officials explained it all more than 15 months ago.

"Reforms planned for NHS in EnglandThe plans, revealed in a leaked document, would reverse changes made under David Cameron.Health","The government is planning to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under David Cameron in 2012, a leaked document suggests. The changes would aim to tackle bureaucracy and encourage health services from hospitals to GP surgeries and social care to work more closely. The draft policy paper also says the health secretary would take more direct control over NHS England. The Department for Health and Social Care said it did not comment on leaks. A spokesman added that details would be set out in due course. Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss 11 charts on the problems facing the NHS The reforms by Mr Cameron's government in 2012saw the creation of NHS England- to run the health service - and the scrapping of primary care trusts in favour of GP-led clinical commissioning groups to organise local services. Under the latest proposals, set out in a leaked document published by health news websiteHealth Policy Insight,external, there will be ""enhanced powers of direction for the government"" to ""ensure that decision makers overseeing the health system at a national level are effectively held to account"". Instead of a system that requires competitive tendering for contracts - sometimes involving private companies, the NHS and local authorities will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other, says the draft White Paper, designed to set out proposed legislation. There will also be more focus on GPs, hospitals and social care services working together to improve patient care. The paper stresses that the Covid pandemic ""demonstrated plainly that this broader approach to health and care is not only desirable, but essential"". Richard Murray, chief executive of health charity The King's Fund, said the proposals amounted to ""major reform"", giving ministers more direct control of the NHS and public health. But he raised concerns around the timing of such a move. ""While many might agree with the ultimate objective of more integrated health and care services, there are clear risks in distracting the service when the NHS is still battling Covid-19 and in the midst of the biggest vaccination programme in our history,"" Mr Murray added. The trade unions for doctors and nurses, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing respectively, would not comment on the leaked proposals. A Conservative government headed by Boris Johnson is about to start reversing health reforms in England introduced under David Cameron. That in itself is a significant moment, though it has been in the offing for a while. The Health and Social Care Act of 2012,externalwas highly controversial. The left hated it because of the introduction of competitive tendering which was seen as a vehicle for private companies to undermine the NHS. Many Conservative politicians came to dislike it because of bureaucratic costs and confused lines of accountability. Sir Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, called for a redrafting of legislation to simplify the system. Now Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is grasping the nettle and will soon publish a government White Paper with plans to give ministers more control over the complex web of health entities in England. NHS organisations and local authorities will be told to focus on working together for the benefit of their local populations. But the detail, as always, will be closely scrutinised. Some will question why the government has chosen to launch the plans with the pandemic still raging. Others may ask whether this is a power grab by ministers which won't necessarily improve patient care. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of health policy think tank the Nuffield Trust, said the reforms should allow GPs, hospitals, community services and social care to ""work better and more effectively together"" in the longer term. He told the BBC he hoped ""the changes in the wiring behind the dashboard shouldn't be too noticeable to patients and when it is, it will be in the longer term because the results they're getting are better"". But he warned against over-optimism, saying structural change could help but was not ""the magic ingredient"" to better delivery of care. Meanwhile, Dr John Lister, of campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said: ""The leaked draft of the White Paper has been interpreted as planning to 'scrap forced privatisation and competition within the NHS', but the draft makes clear that 'there will continue to be an important role for voluntary and independent sector providers'."" Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the proposed changes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Last year was the first year in history where, across the world, there were more over-65s than under-fives, so we are all having to deal with this big change in our health provision of the growth in older people and what that means is you need a lot more joined up care."" He added: ""The structures need to be improved to make that possible and I think that's what these reforms are intended to do, so I think they could be very positive."" However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hunt warned against the emergence of ""cosy local monopolies"" and said the reforms needed to include ""a proper accountability mechanism"" - similar to Ofsted inspecting schools, he added. ""How we make sure that the NHS continues to be held accountable for these huge sums of public money is something that, I am sure, people will want to ask."" The 2012 Health and Social Care Act, brought in by the coalition government led by then-Conservative Prime Minister Mr Cameron, alongside his Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, put NHS England at arms length from the secretary of state. It gave more control over budgets to GPs and other clinicians, while greater competition with the private sector was encouraged. However, the changes attracted criticism from professional bodies representing doctors, nurses and other NHS workers as well as opposition MPs. An NHS spokesman said the service had come together ""to draw up practical proposals that will make it easier for those delivering health and care to work together to deliver the best possible care for patients, without some of the bureaucracy and fragmentation implicit in the 2012 act"". ""Theseproposals were set out publicly in the NHS Long Term Planin 2019 and further developed last year, drawing on what the best local health systems are already doing,"" they added.

Clarity call on reopening Wales to touristsCaravan park and B&B owners seek more details about when the tourism sector could reopen in Wales.Wales,"Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower said it was inundated with inquiries on Friday Tourism bosses are seeking a ""roadmap"" to help the sector to prepare ahead of any decision to reopen in Wales. It comes after First Minister Mark Drakeford said some sectionscould open by Easteras long as the Covid-19 situation continues to improve. One caravan park had 100 bookings on Friday - compared with the usual 25 - after Mr Drakeford's comments. But another site with customers mostly from north-west England said they seemed cautious about booking ahead. The Welsh Government said it wants businesses to be open and trading ""as soon it is safe to do so"". Wales has been under alevel four lockdownsince before Christmas with some businesses closed and people ordered to avoid all but essential travel. Tom Beynon, from Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower, said inquiries ""went around the bend"" on Friday with a lot of customers from Wales looking to holiday closer to home. Tourism in Wales 'may start reopening by Easter' Hope for tourism after 'devastating' Covid impact UK staycation boom predicted for 2021 He said daily bookings and inquiries at this time of year had already doubled from 25 to 50 but they shot up to 100 on Friday night ""due to Mr Drakeford's positivity"". ""Is that people reading between the lines that you can go away but [stay] within Wales?"" he said. The park's season traditionally runs between April and October and staff are preparing to reopen as usual ""unless told otherwise"", said Mr Beynon. The Welsh coast saw tourists return in their droves when Covid rules eased last year Barmouth mayor, councillor Katie Price, who also owns a B&B in the Gwynedd town, said a ""roadmap"" was needed so hospitality businesses ""know where they stand"". ""People may have to make new adaptations to their businesses, but how can they start to put things in place when they have no promise of an income or deadline as to when that needs to be done?"" she said. ""The process of reopening has to have full community confidence, so people who live here feel safe, as well as our customers."" She said that tourism was ""one of the biggest parts of the economy"" in Barmouth and added that ""from a business point of view"" footfall is needed when hospitality reopens, which should be reflected in travel rules. Most of Fron Farm Country Holiday Park's customers visit from north-west England Ceri Roberts, from Fron Farm Country Holiday Park, at Hendre, near Mold, Flintshire, said the tourism industry and holidaymakers needed ""certainty, definite dates for people to be able to book with confidence"". She said 98% of customers came from over the English border with people ""cautious"" about booking a place at the site due to differing Covid restrictions last year. Mrs Roberts said the business had pledged to offer refunds if cancellations were necessary to give customers confidence. She has also called for guidance about what could be allowed to reopen as campers were unable to book a pitch for a time last year when shared amenity blocks had to remain closed due to Covid rules. ""I'm more positive about taking caravan and static bookings,"" she said. Berin Jones, of the Shelbourne Hotel, in Llandudno, was ""delighted"" by the news there was a possibility of reopening. ""We traded for 10 weeks of last year in the last 12 months,"" he said. ""It's absolutely essential that all the supporting industries, suppliers and everything else, are able to start planning to reopen and get working again. ""We really need a timetable from (Mark Drakeford) now, we need to understand well in advance when it is he expects to open up campsites, when it is he expects to open up hotels."" Meanwhile, Gwynedd council is planning to hold a summit next month with councillors and Snowdonia National Park Authority officials following ""unprecedented"" visitors to Snowdon since the pandemic began, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Council leader Dyfrig Siencyn told the education and economy scrutiny committee that such ""unsustainable tourism"" could not continue to be accommodated. ""I've been personally accused of being anti-tourism despite growing up in a home which was let out as a bed and breakfast, and it's right that we remember it's an important industry for us,"" he said. ""But the pandemic has perhaps shown we're almost wholly reliant on tourism in rural areas such as Gwynedd and have very little choice, which drives us to create a much more varied economy rather than all our eggs being in one basket."" A Welsh Government spokesman said that restrictions in Wales are kept ""under constant review"" and it will ""always work with sectors to ensure businesses have as much notice as possible"" about changes to Covid rules. ""The public health situation is improving thanks to everyone's hard work and sacrifices but we all need to stay at home for a while longer to bring levels of the virus down further.""

"Vaccine chief 'optimistic' about over-50s May goalThe UK is ""ahead of the game"" in terms of anticipating coronavirus variants, Dr Clive Dix adds.UK","The UK can meet the target of vaccinating all over-50s by May, the chairman of the vaccines taskforce has said, adding he is ""very optimistic"". Dr Clive Dix told the BBC the taskforce has met every target set. The UK would be ""ahead of the game"" in terms of anticipating variants of coronavirus and was making ""libraries of future vaccines"", he said. He added that the UK would not hoard supplies but would distribute them globally, once the UK target is met. Downing Street has said everyone in the UK aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May. Previously, ministers had said it was their ""ambition"" to vaccinate thefirst nine priority groupsby the spring. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February. The latest figures also showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. Oxford-AZ vaccine 'effective against Kent variant' How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Coronavirus variants: The science explained Dr Dix, who heads the government unit charged with developing and producing vaccines, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will work day and night to ensure we meet whatever the target that's feasible can be met. ""So I'm very optimistic that we will meet the May target."" Questions have been raised around the efficacy of vaccines against variants of the virus - including the one first identified in Kent. On Friday, Oxford-AstraZeneca said its vaccinegave people good protection against the UK variant. Variants in South Africa and Brazil have also been identified. Dr Dix, who is also chief executive of drug discovery company C4X Discovery, said the UK was ""at the forefront of surveying"" the variants, allowing scientists to ""second-guess"" mutations that have not yet occurred. They can then make vaccines for those variants, he told the programme. ""We'll make libraries of future vaccines, just small amounts, enough to then, if it does occur, do a quick clinical study to see that it works and then start manufacturing it,"" he said. The NHS has the staff, the volunteers and the clinics needed to vaccinate the 15 million in these next priority groups as well as give second doses to those who have already had their first jab. But vaccine production is a biological process so there are no guarantees about how much can be grown. However, there is growing confidence in the UK supply chain. The bulk of the supplies are now coming from UK-based plants producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the yields from these are now consistently in line with expectation unlike those in Europe which started producing the vaccine later and have had less time to iron out the teething problems. On top of this, supplies from Pfizer-BioNTech are expected to increase from mid-February after a slowdown in recent weeks. There will also be a third vaccine made by US firm Moderna to help. The first batches of the 17 million ordered will start arriving before Easter. It will all be needed as there can be no let up if the over-50s are to get vaccinated in the timeframe set out. Asked whether there could be a vaccine-busting variant at some stage, Dr Dix said: ""There's a possibility, but we'll be ahead of the game, we're not going to be waiting for it to happen. ""We now have the capabilities in the UK to be responsive and that capability won't just be for the use of the UK of course. ""Once we've done it, it will actually help the whole world because it will be part of that whole surveillance and reaction."" Wales leads the UK on first vaccine dose rate Scottish vaccination 'exceeding expectations' How many people have been vaccinated so far? Will the vaccine work on new variants? And other questions Speaking to BBC Breakfast, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that mutations of the virus could lead to a ""cycle"" of lockdowns in the future if measures were not put in place, such as effective contact tracing. ""The worry that we have to really plan for is the possibility that we will have a new mutation that is actually immune to the vaccines that we're giving out at the moment,"" Mr Hunt said. ""So, in order to make sure that we don't get caught out by that again, we need to get transmission levels down to the kind of levels where we can do incredibly thorough contact tracing, like they do in Korea and Taiwan."" He also repeated his call for the government to consider more financial support for people told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers, for example by offering to ""make up any salary losses"". Despite the promising news over vaccines, doctors have warned against relaxing rules too quickly. Dr Daniele Bryden, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, told Today: ""I think the vaccination is really encouraging, but we really can't let our guard down and relax the rules. ""For example, the average age of a patient on intensive care at the moment is only 60 and 40% of people on intensive care are less than that age. So it's going to take some time before we see the impact of vaccination."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Every adult in the UK will be offered a vaccine by the autumn,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidlast month. Meanwhile, surge testing is being rolled out to further areas to control and suppress the spread of coronavirus variants, including in: targeted areasaround Worcestershire an area in Sefton, Merseyside (PR9) and areas in Bristol and South Gloucestershire The Department for Health and Social Care said people living in targeted areas were ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid test this week, whether showing symptoms or not.

"Unions dispute council claim on Brexit port threatThree trade unions ask a council to withdraw remarks attributed to them about ""suspicious activity"".Northern Ireland","Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew workers from Larne Port Three leading trade unions have distanced themselves from a council's account of alleged threats to workers conducting Brexit checks at Larne Port. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council was told by its mayor that unions had raised concerns about ""suspicious activity"", including apparent attempts to record staff car registrations. However, Nipsa, Unite and GMB said they made no such claim. The council withdrew workers from Larne portover security concerns. On Friday, that decision was overturned andworkers returned to duty. The trade unions have now written to the council asking for the disputed comments to be withdrawn, Belfast Live has reported. The comments were made in a public statement by the mayor, DUP councillor Peter Johnston, during a council meeting on Monday. It came as councillors agreed to withdraw 12 staff from the port. The unions said their only communication with the council about threats to workers prior to Monday evening's decision was an email from Unite that afternoon about graffiti. In a joint letter to the council, written on behalf of the unions by TUS secretary Alan Law, they called for the comments to be ""withdrawn and the official record amended"". ""As this was an official statement issued on behalf of council at the monthly meeting please would you clarify which trade union made this claim as neither Nipsa, GMB nor Unite did, and we absolutely distance ourselves from these remarks,"" the letter said. The letter added that trade unions took ""great exception"" to the council issuing any statement attributing remarks to the unions. Mr Law also wrote to the council's chief executive Anne Donaghy seeking clarification. The council was not available for comment on Saturday. Alliance councillor Danny Donnelly told BBC News NI he was ""very surprised and shocked"" to hear the unions dispute claims that they had reported concerns about suspicious activity. ""Our priority has always been the safety of the workers on this, but each day more and more serious questions have developed,"" Mr Donnelly said. Danny Donnelly said councillors want answers from the mayor and the council's chief executive ""The decision to withdraw staff was unanimous, based on the information we were given at the time, but now questions around the credibility of that threat have arisen and around communication with trade unions."" Mr Donnelly said elected representatives now need answers about the credibility of the threat and the timeline of events which led up to the decision to withdraw staff. He called on the mayor and the council's chief executive to give councillors and opportunity to pose questions and ""have those questions answered in an open and transparent manner"". Council staff return to Larne port after threats Edwin Poots 'asked for port staff to be stood down' Mid and East Antrim Borough Council took the decision to withdraw workers last Monday. The council said it had carried out its own risk assessment and staff safety was its priority. Physical checks were also temporarily suspended on most goods by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) at both Larne and Belfast. It followed the appearance of graffiti in Larne on 21 January which referred to those involved in the work as targets. There were also claims that staff car registrations had been recorded. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said there was nothing to indicate loyalist paramilitary involvement nor that registrations had been taken. Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly were told during the week that former agriculture ministerEdwin Poots was central to the decisionto temporarily suspend physical checks and that he ""was not convinced that the PSNI had a full understanding of the risk"". This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to remove an assertion that the council workers were withdrawn after a threat assessment by police.

"Reforms planned for NHS in EnglandThe plans, revealed in a leaked document, would reverse controversial changes made by David Cameron.Health","The government is planning to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under David Cameron in 2012, a leaked document suggests. The changes would aim to tackle bureaucracy and encourage health services from hospitals to GP surgeries and social care to work more closely. The draft policy paper also says the health secretary would take more direct control over NHS England. The Department for Health and Social Care said it did not comment on leaks. A spokesman added that details would be set out in due course. Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss 11 charts on the problems facing the NHS The reforms by Mr Cameron's government in 2012saw the creation of NHS England- to run the health service - and the scrapping of primary care trusts in favour of GP-led clinical commissioning groups to organise local services. Under the latest proposals, set out in a leaked document published by health news websiteHealth Policy Insight,external, there will be ""enhanced powers of direction for the government"" to ""ensure that decision makers overseeing the health system at a national level are effectively held to account"". Instead of a system that requires competitive tendering for contracts - sometimes involving private companies, the NHS and local authorities will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other, says the draft White Paper, designed to set out proposed legislation. There will also be more focus on GPs, hospitals and social care services working together to improve patient care. The paper stresses that the Covid pandemic ""demonstrated plainly that this broader approach to health and care is not only desirable, but essential"". Richard Murray, chief executive of health charity The King's Fund, said the proposals amounted to ""major reform"", giving ministers more direct control of the NHS and public health. But he raised concerns around the timing of such a move. ""While many might agree with the ultimate objective of more integrated health and care services, there are clear risks in distracting the service when the NHS is still battling Covid-19 and in the midst of the biggest vaccination programme in our history,"" Mr Murray added. The trade unions for doctors and nurses, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing respectively, would not comment on the leaked proposals. A Conservative government headed by Boris Johnson is about to start reversing health reforms in England introduced under David Cameron. That in itself is a significant moment, though it has been in the offing for a while. The Health and Social Care Act of 2012,externalwas highly controversial. The left hated it because of the introduction of competitive tendering which was seen as a vehicle for private companies to undermine the NHS. Many Conservative politicians came to dislike it because of bureaucratic costs and confused lines of accountability. Sir Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, called for a redrafting of legislation to simplify the system. Now Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is grasping the nettle and will soon publish a government White Paper with plans to give ministers more control over the complex web of health entities in England. NHS organisations and local authorities will be told to focus on working together for the benefit of their local populations. But the detail, as always, will be closely scrutinised. Some will question why the government has chosen to launch the plans with the pandemic still raging. Others may ask whether this is a power grab by ministers which won't necessarily improve patient care. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of health policy think tank the Nuffield Trust, said the reforms should allow GPs, hospitals, community services and social care to ""work better and more effectively together"" in the longer term. He told the BBC he hoped ""the changes in the wiring behind the dashboard shouldn't be too noticeable to patients and when it is, it will be in the longer term because the results they're getting are better"". But he warned against over-optimism, saying structural change could help but was not ""the magic ingredient"" to better delivery of care. Meanwhile, Dr John Lister, of campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said: ""The leaked draft of the White Paper has been interpreted as planning to 'scrap forced privatisation and competition within the NHS', but the draft makes clear that 'there will continue to be an important role for voluntary and independent sector providers'."" Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the proposed changes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Last year was the first year in history where, across the world, there were more over-65s than under-fives, so we are all having to deal with this big change in our health provision of the growth in older people and what that means is you need a lot more joined up care."" He added: ""The structures need to be improved to make that possible and I think that's what these reforms are intended to do, so I think they could be very positive."" However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hunt warned against the emergence of ""cosy local monopolies"" and said the reforms needed to include ""a proper accountability mechanism"" - similar to Ofsted inspecting schools, he added. ""How we make sure that the NHS continues to be held accountable for these huge sums of public money is something that, I am sure, people will want to ask."" The 2012 Health and Social Care Act, brought in by the coalition government led by then-Conservative Prime Minister Mr Cameron, alongside his Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, put NHS England at arms length from the secretary of state. It gave more control over budgets to GPs and other clinicians, while greater competition with the private sector was encouraged. However, the changes attracted criticism from professional bodies representing doctors, nurses and other NHS workers as well as opposition MPs. An NHS spokesman said the service had come together ""to draw up practical proposals that will make it easier for those delivering health and care to work together to deliver the best possible care for patients, without some of the bureaucracy and fragmentation implicit in the 2012 act"". ""Theseproposals were set out publicly in the NHS Long Term Planin 2019 and further developed last year, drawing on what the best local health systems are already doing,"" they added.

Vaccine chief 'optimistic' about over-50s May target,"The UK can meet the target of vaccinating all over-50s by May, the chairman of the vaccines taskforce has said, adding he is ""very optimistic"". Dr Clive Dix told the BBC the taskforce has met every target set. The UK would be ""ahead of the game"" in terms of anticipating variants of coronavirus and was making ""libraries of future vaccines"", he said. He added that the UK would not hoard supplies but would distribute them globally, once the UK target is met. Downing Street has said everyone in the UK aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May. Previously, ministers had said it was their ""ambition"" to vaccinate thefirst nine priority groupsby the spring. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February. The latest figures also showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. Oxford-AZ vaccine 'effective against Kent variant' How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Coronavirus variants: The science explained Dr Dix, who heads the government unit charged with developing and producing vaccines, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will work day and night to ensure we meet whatever the target that's feasible can be met. ""So I'm very optimistic that we will meet the May target."" Questions have been raised around the efficacy of vaccines against variants of the virus - including the one first identified in Kent. On Friday, Oxford-AstraZeneca said its vaccinegave people good protection against the UK variant. Variants in South Africa and Brazil have also been identified. Dr Dix, who is also chief executive of drug discovery company C4X Discovery, said the UK was ""at the forefront of surveying"" the variants, allowing scientists to ""second-guess"" mutations that have not yet occurred. They can then make vaccines for those variants, he told the programme. ""We'll make libraries of future vaccines, just small amounts, enough to then, if it does occur, do a quick clinical study to see that it works and then start manufacturing it,"" he said. The NHS has the staff, the volunteers and the clinics needed to vaccinate the 15 million in these next priority groups as well as give second doses to those who have already had their first jab. But vaccine production is a biological process so there are no guarantees about how much can be grown. However, there is growing confidence in the UK supply chain. The bulk of the supplies are now coming from UK-based plants producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the yields from these are now consistently in line with expectation unlike those in Europe which started producing the vaccine later and have had less time to iron out the teething problems. On top of this, supplies from Pfizer-BioNTech are expected to increase from mid-February after a slowdown in recent weeks. There will also be a third vaccine made by US firm Moderna to help. The first batches of the 17 million ordered will start arriving before Easter. It will all be needed as there can be no let up if the over-50s are to get vaccinated in the timeframe set out. Asked whether there could be a vaccine-busting variant at some stage, Dr Dix said: ""There's a possibility, but we'll be ahead of the game, we're not going to be waiting for it to happen. ""We now have the capabilities in the UK to be responsive and that capability won't just be for the use of the UK of course. ""Once we've done it, it will actually help the whole world because it will be part of that whole surveillance and reaction."" Wales leads the UK on first vaccine dose rate Scottish vaccination 'exceeding expectations' How many people have been vaccinated so far? Will the vaccine work on new variants? And other questions Speaking to BBC Breakfast, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that mutations of the virus could lead to a ""cycle"" of lockdowns in the future if measures were not put in place, such as effective contact tracing. ""The worry that we have to really plan for is the possibility that we will have a new mutation that is actually immune to the vaccines that we're giving out at the moment,"" Mr Hunt said. ""So, in order to make sure that we don't get caught out by that again, we need to get transmission levels down to the kind of levels where we can do incredibly thorough contact tracing, like they do in Korea and Taiwan."" He also repeated his call for the government to consider more financial support for people told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers, for example by offering to ""make up any salary losses"". Despite the promising news over vaccines, doctors have warned against relaxing rules too quickly. Dr Daniele Bryden, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, told Today: ""I think the vaccination is really encouraging, but we really can't let our guard down and relax the rules. ""For example, the average age of a patient on intensive care at the moment is only 60 and 40% of people on intensive care are less than that age. So it's going to take some time before we see the impact of vaccination."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

What will happen in Trump's Senate trial?,"Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol. Last month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress. Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"". The article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January. Now a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge. This is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office. So, what can we expect? The trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge. A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. This video can not be played House delivers impeachment charge against Donald Trump to the Senate The trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. Each side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. There will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Both Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. It is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called. Democrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters. ""That's a high crime and misdemeanour,"" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. ""If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing."" They say Mr Trump is ""personally responsible"" for the riot and must be convicted. This video can not be played Jamie Raskin: 'They thought they were going to die' According toa pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an ""incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect"". Mr Trump's ""statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow"", they will argue. Although he is no longer in office, Mr Trump ""must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last"", Democrats argue. They have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again. On the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. Defence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using ""the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise"" those who support Donald Trump. His lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. This video can not be played Trump's lawyer, David Schoen: 'Overriding emotion is to cry for the US Constitution' According to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. The former president's call to ""fight"" was not meant to be taken literally, they say. ""To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'"" they add. Moreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said. It is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say. Impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974. So Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional. Some lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office. What happens to impeached presidents? What impeachment means for Trump, Biden and America That is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath ""at a mutually convenient time and place"". The prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true. Within hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt. They made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead. Prosecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers. Mr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen. All 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial. Democrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party. That is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump. Ten Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it. But Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction. At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters 'Like a medieval battle': The riots frontline If he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024. This could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment. If he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding ""any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States"". So 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power. This could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party. There has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. However, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office. That was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing. He was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter. Mr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate. Hang on, why was Trump impeached again?

Climate crisis deaths 'will be worse than Covid'Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney calls for more investment to tackle the climate crisis.Business,"Mark Carney headed the Bank of England for nearly seven years, up to March 2020 The world is heading for mortality rates equivalent to the Covid crisis every year by mid-century unless action is taken, according to Mark Carney. The former central banker said the investment needed to avert millions of deaths was double current rates. But with governments ploughing billions into keeping economies afloat, a question mark hangs over whether the recovery will be green enough. The answer lies in smarter investment, Mr Carney said. Mr Carney, who was the Bank of England governor up until last year, and the head of the Bank of Canada before that, is now the United Nations envoy for climate action and finance. Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? Biden's climate agenda: An end to fossil fuels? What is Mark Carney's Bank of England legacy? He told the BBC that while there were parallels between the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change, damage to the environment and ecosystems has the potential to cause many more deaths. ""One of the biggest issues is you cannot self-isolate from climate,"" he said. ""That is not an option. We cannot retreat in and wait out climate change, it will just get worse,"" he told Talking Business Asia: The Climate Change Challenge. ""When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event. So it is an issue that needs to be addressed now."" But governments pouring trillions of dollars into stimulus plans to rescue their ailing economies are mainly addressing job losses and the economic damage inflicted from lockdowns. Very little of that cash is heading towards reducing carbon emissions, although emissions have fallen in the past year because people aren't travelling as much. Mr Carney, who is tasked with persuading policymakers, chief executives, bankers and investors to focus on the environment, said: ""The scale of investment in energy, sustainable energy and sustainable infrastructure needs to double. ""Every year, for the course of the next three decades, $3.5 trillion (Â£2.5tn) a year, for 30 years. It is an enormous investment opportunity."" He said the answer lies in a global pot of $170tn of private capital which, he says, ""is looking for disclosure"". Banks, investment funds and individuals increasingly want to know how their money will be used. It is not just about disclosing the carbon position of companies, he says, but ""where it's going to go tomorrow in order to make these kinds of investment and lending decisions"". That pot is bigger than the total economic output of the world for a year, he said. ""The issue is about putting that money to work."" China is part of the solution to lowering carbon emissions Mr Carney said that as the US returns to the world stage in the battle against climate change, there's renewed momentum to the issue, especially as last year China, the world's largest polluter,aimed to become carbon neutral by 2060. Although China continues to build coal-fired power plants, and draws about 70% of its power from fossil fuel, the country is a crucial part of the solution. ""There clearly are issues in terms of coal in China, and the sooner China moves on that, the better for them and for the world. ""But China also produces 60% of the global solar photovoltaic panels. It is also the largest producer of electric vehicles. So China has many sides to this."" The US has the ""largest and most sophisticated financial sector"" along with the ""engineering and technological expertise"" to get to net zero emissions, he said. Biden signs orders on 'existential' climate crisis 'Exceptionally hot' 2020 concludes warmest decade Part of his role at the UN is to tap into this financial sector. It is the ""power of money"" that will ultimately play the biggest role in combating climate change, he said. ""We're getting the system in a position where, whether it's a bank, or somebody who's investing a small amount of savings in the market, or your pension, they can choose [how it is invested]. ""They have the information and they can choose to be part of the solution, transitioning to net zero, or be part of the problem.""

Crowd protests against military rule in Myanmar,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands of people take part in the largest protest in Myanmar in more than a decade Myanmar's military rulers have shut down the country's internet as thousands of people joined the largest rally yet against Monday's coup. A near-total internet blackout is in effect with connectivity falling to 16% of ordinary levels, said the monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory. In the main city, Yangon, crowds chanted ""Military dictator, fail, fail; Democracy, win, win"". Police with riot shields have blocked the main roads into the city centre. The internet shutdown happened hours after the military blocked access to Twitter and Instagram to stop people mobilising for protests. Facebook had been banned a day earlier. Many users had evaded the restrictions on social media by using virtual private networks (VPNs) but the more general blackout severely disrupted that. How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet In pictures: Myanmar protests defy military coup What Myanmar's coup means for Aung San Suu Kyi Civil society organisations urged internet providers and mobile networks to challenge the blackout order, Reuters news agency reported. Human rights group Amnesty International called the shutdown ""heinous and reckless"" and warned it could put the people of Myanmar at risk of human rights violations. The military has not commented. It temporarily blocked access to the internet following the coup on 1 February. On Saturday morning, protesters - including factory workers and young students - called for the release of those detained by the army, including elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. They marched through the streets of Yangon as city buses sounded their horns in support. Bystanders flashed the three-finger Hunger Games salute, which has become a symbol of defiance against authoritarianism, while residents clapped or banged pots and pans on their doorsteps. Many households have also been displaying red stickers in their windows in support of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, the BBC's Burmese editor Soe Win Than reports. Protesters in Yangon received support from thousands of residents, who clapped on doorsteps Police with riot shields used barbed wire to block roads and water cannon were put in place in some areas as a precaution, but the demonstration reportedly remained peaceful, with no attempt by protesters to pass police lines. Demonstrators gave police roses and bottles of drinking water, calling on them to support the people not the new regime. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? One female protester, who asked not to be named, said she would not accept the ""unjust seizing of power"". ""Because of military dictatorship, many of our lives have been destroyed,"" she said, adding: ""We cannot allow our future generations to meet the same fate."" Speaking from Yangon, Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, told the BBC that people were taking to the streets in increasing numbers. ""The grief and the sadness of the last few days is gradually turning to anger,"" he said, adding: ""Doctors are refusing to work and civil servants have been refusing to work... There's quite a sense around the country of unhappiness at what's happened - and outrage."" Police in riot gear have blocked roads in Yangon Another demonstration took place on Saturday in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. Myanmar - also known as Burma - has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, and there were no immediate reports of violence after Saturday's protests. More demonstrations were expected to be held later. The military authorities are hunkered down in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw, and have so far avoided direct engagement with the protesters. The BBC's Nyein Chan in Yangon says the Burmese know very well the violent crackdowns that the military is capable of.  The country was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. But now that people have had time to digest what is happening, they are finding different ways to get their voices heard, our correspondent says. Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. Police documents show she is accused of illegally importing and using communications equipment - walkie-talkies - at her home in the capital. The coup took place as a new session of parliament was set to open, following November's landslide election win by the NLD party. This video can not be played ""We wish them to fall"": Teachers in the city of Yangon have joined protests against Monday's military coup Many Burmese watched the events unfold in real time on Facebook, which is the country's primary source of information and news. But three days later, internet providers were ordered to block the platform for stability reasons. Following the ban, thousands of users were active on Twitter and Instagram using hashtags to express their opposition to the takeover. By 22:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Friday access to those platforms had also been denied. Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? There was no official word from the coup leaders but AFP reported it had seen an unverified ministry document that said the two social media sites were being used to ""cause misunderstanding among the public"". A spokeswoman for Twitter said the ban undermined ""the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard"". Facebook, which owns Instagram, called on the authorities to ""restore connectivity"". Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, either directly or indirectly,  leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Buta deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslimssent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and her previous supporters in the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. But she has remained hugely popular at home, shown in her party's landslide win in the November election. Have you been affected by recent events in Myanmar?

Biden leaves Republicans behind on $1.9tn relief bill,"This video can not be played Biden pledges to ""act fast"" on stimulus US President Joe Biden is forging ahead with plans to ram through a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief bill without Republican support after disappointing jobs data. Despite an Obama-era economist's warnings the stimulus package may be too big, Mr Biden vowed to ""act fast"". The new president's fellow Democrats run Congress, and plan to pass the final bill using a budget manoeuvre. Mr Biden's speech is being seen by US media as a shift in tone after he entered office pledging bipartisanship. He met 10 Republican senators at the White House on Monday in the hope of a breakthrough, but brushed off their counter-proposal for a slimmed-down $618bn coronavirus relief bill. When might life in US return to normal? Speaking at the White House on Friday after meeting congressional Democratic leaders, he said: ""A lot of folks are losing hope. ""I believe the American people are looking right now to their government for help, to do our job, to not let them down. ""So I'm going to act. I'm going to act fast. I'd like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. They're just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go."" This video can not be played Biden: ""No need for Trump's intelligence briefing"" Under the Biden-backed ""American Rescue Plan"", $1,400 cheques would be sent directly to most Americans. The Democratic president cited lower-than-expected numbers that showed the country added only 49,000 jobs in January. US job growth sluggish as virus hampers recovery The US economy remains 10 million jobs under its level before the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed nearly 460,000 Americans. Mr Biden said: ""Are we going to say to millions of Americans who are out of work - many out of work for six months or longer, who have been scared by this economic and public health crisis - 'Don't worry, hang on, things are going to get better.' ""That's the Republican answer right now. I can't in good conscience do that."" The president's party, which now commands narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, plans to fast-track the package through a process known as budget reconciliation. Such bills - which can be brought only once a year - may pass the Senate by 51 votes instead of the 60 usually required. In a pre-dawn session on Friday, Senate Democrats charged ahead with a procedural vote to advance the budget reconciliation option. Vice-President Kamala Harris cast her first tie-breaking vote to approve the measure by 51-50, without a single Republican on board. Later in the day, the House of Representatives passed the budget plan by 219-209, again with no Republican votes. The Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, predicted the final coronavirus relief bill would pass by mid-March. ""Our work to crush the coronavirus and deliver relief to the American people is urgent and of the highest priority,"" she wrote in a letter to Democrats shortly before the vote. Larry Summers, who was top economic adviser to President Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served as vice-president - has said the stimulus bill may be too big. In a Washington Post op-ed,external, he warned of ""inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability"". ""Stimulus measures of the magnitude contemplated are steps into the unknown,"" added Mr Summers, who served as an informal adviser on the Biden election campaign. But Jared Bernstein, a member of Mr Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN that Mr Summers was ""wrong in a pretty profound way"". Biden ends deadlock over WTO leadership Meanwhile, Republican lawmaker Michael Burgess of Texas argued that Congress had yet to spend all $4tn of the previous pandemic relief, noting $1tn had yet to go out the door. ""Why is it suddenly so urgent that we pass another $2tn bill?"" he asked. A disproportionately high number of women have dropped out of the labour force during the pandemic, a trend widely attributed to childcare needs. The Biden administration has pledged to reopen schools and to follow the science, though critics accuse him of paying too much heed to teachers' unions. 'It's OK to have a bad day' The unions donated more to his campaign than any other presidential candidate, and they have resisted reopening schools, citing the need to reduce class sizes, improve building ventilation and buy protective gear to prevent virus transmission. The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said at the White House on Wednesday that teachers do not need to be vaccinated - another key union demand - before schools can reopen safely. A day later, White House press secretary Jen Psaki played down the comments from the public health agency leading the pandemic response, saying the CDC director had spoken in a ""personal capacity"".

Myanmar coup leaders block Twitter and Instagram,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands of people take part in the largest protest in Myanmar in more than a decade Myanmar's military rulers have shut down the country's internet as thousands of people joined the largest rally yet against Monday's coup. A near-total internet blackout is in effect with connectivity falling to 16% of ordinary levels, said the monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory. In the main city, Yangon, crowds chanted ""Military dictator, fail, fail; Democracy, win, win"". Police with riot shields have blocked the main roads into the city centre. The internet shutdown happened hours after the military blocked access to Twitter and Instagram to stop people mobilising for protests. Facebook had been banned a day earlier. Many users had evaded the restrictions on social media by using virtual private networks (VPNs) but the more general blackout severely disrupted that. How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet In pictures: Myanmar protests defy military coup What Myanmar's coup means for Aung San Suu Kyi Civil society organisations urged internet providers and mobile networks to challenge the blackout order, Reuters news agency reported. Human rights group Amnesty International called the shutdown ""heinous and reckless"" and warned it could put the people of Myanmar at risk of human rights violations. The military has not commented. It temporarily blocked access to the internet following the coup on 1 February. On Saturday morning, protesters - including factory workers and young students - called for the release of those detained by the army, including elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. They marched through the streets of Yangon as city buses sounded their horns in support. Bystanders flashed the three-finger Hunger Games salute, which has become a symbol of defiance against authoritarianism, while residents clapped or banged pots and pans on their doorsteps. Many households have also been displaying red stickers in their windows in support of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, the BBC's Burmese editor Soe Win Than reports. Protesters in Yangon received support from thousands of residents, who clapped on doorsteps Police with riot shields used barbed wire to block roads and water cannon were put in place in some areas as a precaution, but the demonstration reportedly remained peaceful, with no attempt by protesters to pass police lines. Demonstrators gave police roses and bottles of drinking water, calling on them to support the people not the new regime. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? One female protester, who asked not to be named, said she would not accept the ""unjust seizing of power"". ""Because of military dictatorship, many of our lives have been destroyed,"" she said, adding: ""We cannot allow our future generations to meet the same fate."" Speaking from Yangon, Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, told the BBC that people were taking to the streets in increasing numbers. ""The grief and the sadness of the last few days is gradually turning to anger,"" he said, adding: ""Doctors are refusing to work and civil servants have been refusing to work... There's quite a sense around the country of unhappiness at what's happened - and outrage."" Police in riot gear have blocked roads in Yangon Another demonstration took place on Saturday in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. Myanmar - also known as Burma - has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, and there were no immediate reports of violence after Saturday's protests. More demonstrations were expected to be held later. The military authorities are hunkered down in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw, and have so far avoided direct engagement with the protesters. The BBC's Nyein Chan in Yangon says the Burmese know very well the violent crackdowns that the military is capable of.  The country was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. But now that people have had time to digest what is happening, they are finding different ways to get their voices heard, our correspondent says. Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. Police documents show she is accused of illegally importing and using communications equipment - walkie-talkies - at her home in the capital. The coup took place as a new session of parliament was set to open, following November's landslide election win by the NLD party. This video can not be played ""We wish them to fall"": Teachers in the city of Yangon have joined protests against Monday's military coup Many Burmese watched the events unfold in real time on Facebook, which is the country's primary source of information and news. But three days later, internet providers were ordered to block the platform for stability reasons. Following the ban, thousands of users were active on Twitter and Instagram using hashtags to express their opposition to the takeover. By 22:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Friday access to those platforms had also been denied. Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? There was no official word from the coup leaders but AFP reported it had seen an unverified ministry document that said the two social media sites were being used to ""cause misunderstanding among the public"". A spokeswoman for Twitter said the ban undermined ""the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard"". Facebook, which owns Instagram, called on the authorities to ""restore connectivity"". Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, either directly or indirectly,  leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Buta deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslimssent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and her previous supporters in the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. But she has remained hugely popular at home, shown in her party's landslide win in the November election. Have you been affected by recent events in Myanmar?
