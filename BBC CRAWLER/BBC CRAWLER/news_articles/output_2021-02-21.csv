PM to unveil 'cautious' England lockdown exit plan,"This video can not be played Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi outlined some lockdown-easing measures in England All schools in England are to reopen on 8 March as part of the prime minister's ""cautious"" four-part plan to lift the coronavirus lockdown. Boris Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT. Up to six people or two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 29 March, the vaccines minister said. Rules will be lifted in stages and four conditions must be met at each stage. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out more details on the plan in a Commons statement, which is expected at around 15:30. The first stage of easing will be split into two parts: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in a public space - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Although schools are set to reopen to all pupils on 8 March, it is thought a few days' flexibility may be built in to allow measures like testing to be put in place. Also on 8 March, new rules will alloweach care home resident in England to have one regular visitor, with whom they can hold hands. And from 29 March it is also understood that people will once again be able to travel out of their areas - although guidance will likely still recommend staying local, and overnight stays will not be permitted. The gap between each stage of restrictions being eased is expected to be five weeks, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It comes aschildren aged three to seven in Wales return to the classroom, along with some students on practical college courses. Scotland's youngest pupils are also returning to face-to-face teachingin the first step of the phased reopening of schools there. Meanwhile, vaccination has had a significant impact on the risk of serious illness from Covid-19,analysis by Public Health Scotland shows. Figures for England are expected later. What time will lockdown changes be announced? How risky are the routes out of lockdown? Gym boss: 'We are burning through about Â£500,000 a day' 'Reckless' if all pupils back 8 March, say unions Data will be used to inform ""every step"" of lifting restrictions, Mr Johnson said. ""We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe,"" he added. The roadmap will outline four steps for easing restrictions. But before proceeding to each next step, the government will examine the data to assess the impact of previous changes. The four conditions that must be met at each phase of lockdown easing are: The coronavirus vaccine programme continues to go to plan Evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently reducing the number of people dying with the virus or needing hospital treatment Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospital admissions New variants of the virus do not fundamentally change the risk of lifting restrictions Downing Street said the four tests are currently being met so the first step of lockdown easing in England will proceed as planned on 8 March. The first stage of easing restrictions will be across the whole of England, Downing Street added, due to the current uniform spread of the virus. MPs will be given the chance to vote on the regulations enabling England's roadmap in the coming weeks. Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said the government needed ""flexibility"" if infections levels dropped more quickly than expected. ""You can't have a timeline and say you you're going to be data driven. You can either have one or the other,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. The rules of combat are beginning to change. No longer is controlling infection and keeping R below 1 seen as the be-all and end-all. That much is clear from the government's four tests for its roadmap to lift lockdown in England. Infection rates are only being seen as a problem if they risk a surge in hospital admissions. The reasons for that change can be found from the early results published on the UK vaccination programme. Scottish researchers have found a ""spectacular"" reduction in the risk of serious illness four weeks after the first dose of the vaccine is given. The link between infections and serious illness is being broken. That is not to say a surge in infections can or will be tolerated - the number of Covid patients in hospital is still only just below where it was in the first peak and not all vulnerable people have been vaccinated yet. But it does give ministers some room for manoeuvre. That is important. Schools are not seen as a significant driver of infection, but reopening them for all could push infection levels up. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the prime minister ""to learn the lessons of the last two lockdowns"" when ""he came out too quickly"". He told LBC that with restrictions in place for longer, businesses ""desperately"" needed more support, including the extension of business rates relief and VAT cuts for the hospitality sector. All four UK nations have been in lockdown for weeks, after hospitals were put under unprecedented pressure due to the rapid spread of a variant of the virus, first detected in Kent. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. She added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of restrictions being eased in time for Easter. A review of current measures will take place on 18 March. Pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to threewill return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school. Children of key workers and vulnerable pupils have been able to attend school in all parts of the UK throughout the lockdown. On Sunday,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""early data"" suggesting a reduction in transmission of the virus in people who have had a vaccine, adding that hospital admissions were falling ""much more sharply"" than they were in the pandemic's first wave. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the number of people in hospital - currently around 18,000 - was still ""far too high"". Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, said the data on factors like hospital admissions and deaths were ""extremely positive"" and ""better than people would have predicted"". However, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government would need to ""keep in reserve"" the option of using local measures to tackle outbreaks because of the big difference in infection rates in different parts of the country.

"Unionist parties to join NI Protocol legal bidThe DUP, UUP and TUV say they will be part of a legal challenge against the NI Protocol.Northern Ireland","Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster; Ulster Unionist (UUP) leader Steve Aiken; and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister Northern Ireland's major unionist parties will be part of a legal bid to challenge the NI Protocol. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionists (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) have said they are supporting judicial review proceedings. Former MEP Ben Habib and former Labour MP Kate Hoey are also backing it. DUP leader Arlene Foster said they were committed to challenging the NI Protocol ""in the courts, in Parliament, in Stormont and in Brussels"". She added that the judicial review proceedings will challenge the NI Protocol's ""compatibility with the Act of Union 1800, the Northern Ireland Act of 1998 and the Belfast Agreement"". The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Unionism 'coming together' to oppose NI Protocol What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? Unionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union. The DUP said Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster will be named parties in the proceedings along with deputy leader Nigel Dodds, Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Sammy Wilson, the party's Westminster chief whip. Arlene Foster said that unionists' concerns will not be silenced Mrs Foster said Mr Habib, Mrs Hoey and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister were so far ""committed to these proceedings but we expect others to also join this path"". She said the protocol ""drove a coach and horses"" through both the Act of Union and the Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement. ""We are following our five-point plan of opposition to the protocol and will challenge its imposition in the courts, in Parliament, in Stormont and in Brussels,"" she added. ""The views of unionists will not be side-lined nor our concerns silenced."" UUP leader Steve Aiken said that ""testing the NI Protocol in the courts is a fair and legitimate thing to do"". He added that the actions that brought the protocol into force ""fundamentally undermine the principle of consent and laid out in the Belfast Agreement"". ""The absurdities of the protocol affect everyone in Northern Ireland; every legitimate action needs to be taken to deal with this very unequal, disproportionate and divisive treaty,"" he added. TUV leader Jim Allister said he welcomed the planned judicial review challenge and that he hoped ""all strands of unionism will join in this necessary effort"". He said that ""without Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey we would not be at this point"". However, he said that it was ""not a substitute or alternative to sustained and effective political action against the protocol"". The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), who campaigned against Brexit and have said parties must work together to make the protocol work, described the legal action as ""ill-judged"". ""There will be few with sympathy for the argument that the protocol, which prevents a hard border in Ireland and guarantees dual market access for local businesses, breaches the Good Friday Agreement,"" said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. ""That notion is stretched even further when the argument is made by a party that opposed the agreement in the first place. ""I'm sure the courts will decide what we all, including the DUP, already know. The protocol is necessary because of the hard Brexit that they supported."" Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said those supporting the judicial review were ""the same unionists who saddled up to the Tories, who throughout the course of the Brexit shambles have treated the people here with utter contempt"". He added that the protocol ""safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, and avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, and ensures the maintenance of north-south co-operation"". ""What matters is that executive ministers fulfil their legal duty and implement the protocol where they have responsibility to do so, in accordance with the law.""

"Global response to moonflower bloom 'amazing'Having thousands watch a rare cactus bloom online leaves the team that planted it ""overwhelmed"".Cambridgeshire","This video can not be played Cambridge moonflower: Time-lapse video captures 'UK first' The team who cared for a rare Amazonian cactus that flowered for just one night have been ""overwhelmed"" by the global response to the bloom. Experts at Cambridge University Botanic Garden believe it is the first time the moonflowerSelenicereus wittiihas bloomed in the UK. Thousands tuned in as the flowering drew close and a YouTube stream has had almost 195,000 views. Glasshouse supervisor Alex Summers said the experience had been ""amazing"". Mr Summers said the flower's scent changed from ""lovely"" to something ""in the realm of public toilets"" The cactus -which normally flowers at night for just 12 hours- caught many of those awaiting the bloom off guardwhen it started to blossom at about 15:00 GMT on Saturday. A webcam had been focused on the single bud for the previous 11 days. Mr Summers said the flower,which was spotted developing in November, had been ""supposed to come out"" at 21:00, ""but plants never read the books"". He said since the bloom, the team had ""been able to record it, pollinate it and share it with as many people as possible"". 'Rotten flesh' flower finally flourishes Botanic garden's plant collection listed online Uni garden shares 'asparagus on steroids' plants However, only the glasshouse's staff have been able to experience its unique scent, which Mr Summers said had ""started off... like honeysuckle or gardenias"", but by morning, had ""slightly altered and we're now in the realm of public toilets"". The bud was spotted developing by the garden's staff in November The plant normally grows high above the Amazonian floodplains by attaching itself to a host plant and flowers at night to attract its two pollinating species of hawkmoth. The delicate petals of the white flower, measuring 11in (28cm) long by 6in (15cm) wide and sitting at a height of 12ft (3.5m) on the plant, started to fade overnight. Thegarden's dedicated moonflower page,externalhas received nearly 205,000 views, from people as far afield as Australia, Finland and Thailand. The moonflower started to bloom in the early afternoon and not at sunset as expected Mr Summers said he thought the interest was due to the cactus usually being ""inaccessible"" where it grows in the ""deepest, darkest Amazon"".

"Iran to stop 'snap' nuclear checks, IAEA confirms","The assassination in November of a top Iranian nuclear scientist further raised tensions on the issue Iran and the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, have agreed to temporary measures to offset Iran's decision to restrict access to inspectors. These would enable the agency to retain the ""necessary degree of monitoring and verification work"", IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said, without going into detail. The move comes ahead of a deadline set by Iran to stop intrusive checks of sites unless US sanctions are lifted. Tensions have soared since the US left a nuclear deal with Iran in 2018. Then-President Donald Trump reimposed crippling economic sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran refused and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments. IAEA experts have been monitoring Iran's activities under the 2015 deal The crisis over Iran's nuclear programme has been on the international agenda for almost 20 years. Iran says the programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and others suspect Iran has ambitions to develop nuclear weapons. Iran is a nuclear worry:Some countries have long suspected that Iran has secret ambitions to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this. So a deal was struck:In 2015 a major agreement between Iran and six other countries meant Iran accepted limits on its nuclear activities in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, that hurt its economy. What is the problem now?Iran re-started banned nuclear work after former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move. The ""temporary technical"" arrangement reached between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ""salvages the situation"", Mr Grossi told reporters on Sunday after a visit to Iran. ""We were able to retain the necessary degree of monitoring and verification work,"" he said, without elaborating, but added: ""There is less access [to Iranian sites], let's face it."" Why Iranâs nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack Clock ticks in Iran as rivals square up Under the plan, for the next three months Iran would hold recordings from monitoring equipment installed at sites by the IAEA but would not release the information unless sanctions were lifted within that timeframe, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) said. If sanctions remained, the data would be erased, it added. Cameras and other apparatus have been put in place by the IAEA to help verify that Iran does not carry out nuclear activities prohibited under the deal. However, Iran and the US are at loggerheads over the removal of sanctions. Washington insists Tehran must return to full compliance with the 2015 deal first, while Tehran says that will only happen once sanctions are lifted. Analysis by Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic correspondent The IAEA's boss, Rafael Grossi, called this ""a good result"". It certainly seems likely to defuse a mounting sense of crisis surrounding Iran's nuclear activities and efforts to breathe new life into the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Crucially, it significantly reduces the impact of a new Iranian law, due to come into effect on Tuesday, which would have seriously hampered the IAEA's ability to do its work. Iran will still suspend implementation of the so-called Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA substantially enhanced tools with which to carry out inspections. But Mr Grossi clearly believes the ""temporary bilateral technical understanding"" reached after talks in Tehran this weekend will allow his inspectors to continue doing their job to a satisfactory degree. The deal will have its sceptics, particularly among those for whom the JCPOA was always a mistake, and who also believe it's pointless, or even dangerous, to try and rescue it. But coming at a time when the Biden administration has indicated its willingness to return to the negotiating table, this deal buys some precious time. A law is due to come into force on Tuesday in Iran requiring the government to stop allowing the inspection at short-notice of declared or undeclared nuclear sites by IAEA experts. Iran had agreed to allow the resumption of snap inspections - a voluntary measure - under the 2015 deal, having previously suspended them in 2006. Less intrusive routine inspections of declared nuclear sites will continue - and Iran has said the new law will not lead to the expulsion of inspectors. However, the abandonment by Iran of another commitment will heighten international alarm. This video can not be played Iran's nuclear programme: What's been happening at its key nuclear sites? In the short term, Iran wants to put further pressure on the US and other parties to the JCPOA - France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China - to get Washington to lift sanctions on Iran's oil, banking and financial sectors. Iran has increasingly stopped complying with its obligations under the 2015 dealsince the US withdrew, deepening concern among the remaining members that its resumption of banned activities could ease the path towards a bomb. Last month, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said he believed it would currently take Iran ""a few months"" to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so. But he warned that it ""could get down to a matter of weeks"" if Iran continued to lift some of the restraints imposed by the deal. Recent Israeli assessments suggest it would take Iran about two years to develop a deliverable device.

Regulator investigates Â£30m Covid contract firm,"Hinpack was awarded a Â£30m contract to make test tubes during the pandemic A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". A Department of Health spokesman said early in the UK's epidemic it asked ""suppliers in multiple industries"" to help to support the national effort to secure products needed for Covid tests. All suppliers must pass through ""a rigorous regulatory and validations process"" to ensure they meet quality standards, he said. ""We continue to ensure all contracts are awarded in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines,"" he added. The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by the Department of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Lawyers for Mr Bourne told the Guardian the test tubes that Hinpack manufactures are ""by no means complicated and are well within our client's existing skillset"". They also said the MHRA had previously approved and inspected Hinpack's products and working practices, and allegations being reported against them were ""untrue"". Asked about it at a Downing Street press conference in December, Mr Hancock said: ""I had absolutely nothing to do with that contract."" Hancock: 'Right' to delay contract transparency Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Labour urges ministers to 'clean up' Covid contracts The confirmation comes in the same weekMr Hancock was ruled to have acted unlawfullyin failing to publish details of government contracts within 30 days. Earlier, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it had been ""the right thing to do"" so his staff could focus on sourcing PPE at the height of the pandemic. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the inquiry into Mr Bourne's company was ""extremely worrying"", adding: ""The reasons for handing this contract out in the first place must be investigated and shared in the public interest"". Director of devices at the MHRA, Graeme Tunbridge, said he could not disclose why the company was being investigated as the inquiry was ongoing. But in a statement, he said: ""We are currently investigating the allegations about Hinpack and will take appropriate action as necessary. ""Patient safety is our top priority.""

Huge crowds mourn woman killed in Myanmar protests,"This video can not be played Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head just before her 20th birthday by security forces Huge crowds in Myanmar's capital Nay Pyi Taw have attended the funeral of a young woman killed in protests against a military coup. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head just before her 20th birthday, the first of at least three people to die in the protests. On Sunday, thousands lined the streets to honour her, some making the three-fingered salutes used by demonstrators. The military overthrew the elected government earlier this month. Promises to hold early elections have failed to satisfy demonstrators, who are also seeking the release of the elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. The military alleges the NLD's landslide election win last year was fraudulent but has not provided proof. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? How Facebook became the 'digital tea shop' The shooting of a young protester Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing, a supermarket worker, was injured when police tried to disperse protesters earlier this month. She was kept on life support for 10 days but died on Friday. She has become a focal point for demonstrators, with her image often displayed by people resisting the coup. Her coffin was driven through the streets in a black and gold hearse, accompanied by hundreds of motorbikes. Protesters took to the streets across the country again on Sunday, despite the previous day seeing the worst violence yet in weeks of protests. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing's body was driven through the streets of the capital Two protesters were shot dead when police used live ammunition to disperse crowds. The deaths brought widespread condemnation, withUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres,externalsaying: ""The use of lethal force, intimidation & harassment against peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable."" Also on Sunday, the wife of prominent actor Lu Min said he had been arrested after posting a video denouncing the military leadership. The two-week-old civil disobedience movement in Myanmar now has its martyrs - represented in posters, paintings and cartoons at rallies which have continued to take place across the country. Their deaths will inflame public anger against the military government, but remind people too of the cost of resisting it. The plan now is to escalate the daily protests into a nationwide general strike, starting next week. This must damage an economy which is already suffering from the Covid pandemic - but its effect on the generals who seized power is harder to predict. In the early hours of Monday, Myanmar entered its second week of nightly internet shutdowns, monitoring group NetBlocks reported. The junta has been regularly blocking the web to try to stifle mass protests. Earlier, social media giant Facebook deleted a news site run by the military. ""In line with our global policies, we've removed the Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page from Facebook for repeated violations of our Community Standards prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm,"" the company said. This video can not be played From blindfolded protests to dressing like Aung San Suu Kyi, why creatives are concerning Myanmar's army The site is the main one run by the military, used to issue warnings to protesters and push its allegations about the election results. Facebook is the primary source of information and news in Myanmar. An estimated 22 million of the 54 million people in Myanmar use Facebook.

Iran stops 'snap' nuclear checks in new challenge,"The assassination in November of a top Iranian nuclear scientist further raised tensions on the issue Iran and the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, have agreed to temporary measures to offset Iran's decision to restrict access to inspectors. These would enable the agency to retain the ""necessary degree of monitoring and verification work"", IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said, without going into detail. The move comes ahead of a deadline set by Iran to stop intrusive checks of sites unless US sanctions are lifted. Tensions have soared since the US left a nuclear deal with Iran in 2018. Then-President Donald Trump reimposed crippling economic sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran refused and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments. IAEA experts have been monitoring Iran's activities under the 2015 deal The crisis over Iran's nuclear programme has been on the international agenda for almost 20 years. Iran says the programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and others suspect Iran has ambitions to develop nuclear weapons. Iran is a nuclear worry:Some countries have long suspected that Iran has secret ambitions to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this. So a deal was struck:In 2015 a major agreement between Iran and six other countries meant Iran accepted limits on its nuclear activities in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, that hurt its economy. What is the problem now?Iran re-started banned nuclear work after former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move. The ""temporary technical"" arrangement reached between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ""salvages the situation"", Mr Grossi told reporters on Sunday after a visit to Iran. ""We were able to retain the necessary degree of monitoring and verification work,"" he said, without elaborating, but added: ""There is less access [to Iranian sites], let's face it."" Why Iranâs nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack Clock ticks in Iran as rivals square up Under the plan, for the next three months Iran would hold recordings from monitoring equipment installed at sites by the IAEA but would not release the information unless sanctions were lifted within that timeframe, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) said. If sanctions remained, the data would be erased, it added. Cameras and other apparatus have been put in place by the IAEA to help verify that Iran does not carry out nuclear activities prohibited under the deal. However, Iran and the US are at loggerheads over the removal of sanctions. Washington insists Tehran must return to full compliance with the 2015 deal first, while Tehran says that will only happen once sanctions are lifted. Analysis by Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic correspondent The IAEA's boss, Rafael Grossi, called this ""a good result"". It certainly seems likely to defuse a mounting sense of crisis surrounding Iran's nuclear activities and efforts to breathe new life into the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Crucially, it significantly reduces the impact of a new Iranian law, due to come into effect on Tuesday, which would have seriously hampered the IAEA's ability to do its work. Iran will still suspend implementation of the so-called Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA substantially enhanced tools with which to carry out inspections. But Mr Grossi clearly believes the ""temporary bilateral technical understanding"" reached after talks in Tehran this weekend will allow his inspectors to continue doing their job to a satisfactory degree. The deal will have its sceptics, particularly among those for whom the JCPOA was always a mistake, and who also believe it's pointless, or even dangerous, to try and rescue it. But coming at a time when the Biden administration has indicated its willingness to return to the negotiating table, this deal buys some precious time. A law is due to come into force on Tuesday in Iran requiring the government to stop allowing the inspection at short-notice of declared or undeclared nuclear sites by IAEA experts. Iran had agreed to allow the resumption of snap inspections - a voluntary measure - under the 2015 deal, having previously suspended them in 2006. Less intrusive routine inspections of declared nuclear sites will continue - and Iran has said the new law will not lead to the expulsion of inspectors. However, the abandonment by Iran of another commitment will heighten international alarm. This video can not be played Iran's nuclear programme: What's been happening at its key nuclear sites? In the short term, Iran wants to put further pressure on the US and other parties to the JCPOA - France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China - to get Washington to lift sanctions on Iran's oil, banking and financial sectors. Iran has increasingly stopped complying with its obligations under the 2015 dealsince the US withdrew, deepening concern among the remaining members that its resumption of banned activities could ease the path towards a bomb. Last month, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said he believed it would currently take Iran ""a few months"" to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so. But he warned that it ""could get down to a matter of weeks"" if Iran continued to lift some of the restraints imposed by the deal. Recent Israeli assessments suggest it would take Iran about two years to develop a deliverable device.

Global response to moonflower bloom 'amazing',"This video can not be played Cambridge moonflower: Time-lapse video captures 'UK first' The team who cared for a rare Amazonian cactus that flowered for just one night have been ""overwhelmed"" by the global response to the bloom. Experts at Cambridge University Botanic Garden believe it is the first time the moonflowerSelenicereus wittiihas bloomed in the UK. Thousands tuned in as the flowering drew close and a YouTube stream has had almost 195,000 views. Glasshouse supervisor Alex Summers said the experience had been ""amazing"". Mr Summers said the flower's scent changed from ""lovely"" to something ""in the realm of public toilets"" The cactus -which normally flowers at night for just 12 hours- caught many of those awaiting the bloom off guardwhen it started to blossom at about 15:00 GMT on Saturday. A webcam had been focused on the single bud for the previous 11 days. Mr Summers said the flower,which was spotted developing in November, had been ""supposed to come out"" at 21:00, ""but plants never read the books"". He said since the bloom, the team had ""been able to record it, pollinate it and share it with as many people as possible"". 'Rotten flesh' flower finally flourishes Botanic garden's plant collection listed online Uni garden shares 'asparagus on steroids' plants However, only the glasshouse's staff have been able to experience its unique scent, which Mr Summers said had ""started off... like honeysuckle or gardenias"", but by morning, had ""slightly altered and we're now in the realm of public toilets"". The bud was spotted developing by the garden's staff in November The plant normally grows high above the Amazonian floodplains by attaching itself to a host plant and flowers at night to attract its two pollinating species of hawkmoth. The delicate petals of the white flower, measuring 11in (28cm) long by 6in (15cm) wide and sitting at a height of 12ft (3.5m) on the plant, started to fade overnight. Thegarden's dedicated moonflower page,externalhas received nearly 205,000 views, from people as far afield as Australia, Finland and Thailand. The moonflower started to bloom in the early afternoon and not at sunset as expected Mr Summers said he thought the interest was due to the cactus usually being ""inaccessible"" where it grows in the ""deepest, darkest Amazon"". He said the team had been ""overwhelmed"", adding: ""People have followed it from start to finish."" Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

Rashford helps Man Utd back to second,"Marcus Rashford scored his 18th goal of the season Marcus Rashford played a key role in a win over struggling Newcastle as Manchester United returned to second place in the Premier League. The England striker helped the hosts overcome a stuttering start when he lashed in an 18th goal of the season by beating Karl Darlow at the near post after 30 minutes. Allan Saint-Maximin then scored a deserved equaliser with his first goal since coming back from a two-month absence caused by coronavirus symptoms, slamming in after Harry Maguire failed to clear. The Newcastle winger threatened again early in the second half, but the game turned after 57 minutes when Daniel James re-established the lead. That led to the visitors' confidence draining away, with Rashford then earning a penalty as he drew a foul from Joe Willock before Bruno Fernandes knocked in his 22nd goal of the season. Defeat for Steve Bruce's side was an eighth in 10 Premier League games, leaving them three points above the drop zone - and a relegation scrap with Fulham is now set to ensue. For Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, it was only a second win in six league matches, and a welcome victory after a draw at West Brom last weekend. But they remain 10 points behind leaders Manchester City, who beat Arsenal earlier on Sunday. On the face of it, this looked as if it would be a routine win for the hosts over a team fighting for Premier League survival. But although Solskjaer insisted that his team had ""found themselves a little bit"" after the 4-0 win over Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday, there were still signs here of the concerns that have plagued his team for much of the season. Manchester United were slow to start and jittery in defence. David de Gea was called into action early on and almost gifted Newcastle a goal with a poor backpass. Fernandes, normally their talisman, was quiet for much of the game before a trademark penalty. But in contrast to Newcastle, Solskjaer's side have matchwinners all over the pitch. When they went ahead, it was from their first proper chance. Rashford skipped past Emil Krafth on the touchline, before cutting inside and unleashing a fierce shot, although Darlow should have stopped his near-post effort. The lead only lasted six minutes, however, as a short corner was played to Willock and his cross was half-headed away by Maguire, allowing Saint-Maximin to fire in. The home side - missing the injured Scott McTominay and several coaching staff who were self-isolating - also started the second period quietly. Solskjaer's concern was evident on the touchline, before James gave them breathing space. The Welsh winger, who scored in midweek, was rewarded with his first Premier League start since 26 December and lashed past Darlow at his near post again. As Newcastle retreated, the hosts moved up the gears before Fernandes sealed victory. It was not a vintage display, but it did not need to be as Solskjaer's side finally found their rhythm, allowing them to hand a debut to 17-year-old Shola Shoretire as they extended their run to one defeat in 19 Premier League games. This video can not be played Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praises Daniel James after Newcastle win If Bruce did not regard his team as being a relegation battle before this week, then they certainly are now. Fulham's seven-point yield in the past week means the 10-point gap between Newcastle and the relegation zone - as it was two weeks ago - now stands at three. Bruce's side have shown an upturn in form in recent weeks, with wins over Everton and Southampton, but this game underlined the value of absent top scorer Callum Wilson, who is set to be out for another month with a hamstring injury. It was tempting to wonder whether Wilson would have profited from Newcastle's early chances. Joelinton looked hesitant when there were several early opportunities to go ahead. Jonjoe Shelvey also skied over. Having gone behind, though, at least Newcastle showed a response. Saint-Maximin, who was struck down by coronavirus symptoms for most of December and January, looked sharp and tested De Gea before he scored. His emotional celebration hinted at the difficulties he has been through this season, and he could have put the visitors ahead when he fired at De Gea following a well-worked free-kick routine. But James' goal and the manner of it undermined all their hard work. When the ball was played across their box by Nemanja Matic, Jamal Lewis failed to clear as Fernandes got a vital touch and Darlow was beaten at the near post again. Once Willock failed to keep his composure as Rashford danced into the penalty area, conceding a penalty, there was no way back from Bruce's side. Perhaps a win at Old Trafford was not to be expected, but with games against Wolves, West Brom, Aston Villa and Brighton to come, Newcastle will need to pick up points quickly. This video can not be played Steve Bruce speaks on the changes he's made to Newcastle's football Manchester United have scored 53 goals in 25 games in the Premier League this term - their most at this stage of a top-flight campaign since the 2012-13 season (60), which was the last time they won the title. Newcastle have lost each of their past 21 away games against opponents starting the day in the Premier League's top three, in a run dating back to February 2012. Marcus Rashford's opener for Manchester United was his 40th goal in all competitions since the beginning of last season, with only Raheem Sterling (44), Harry Kane (45) and Mohamed Salah (47) managing more among all Premier League players. Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes (15 goals, 10 assists) is the third player within Europe's top five leagues this season to reach double figures for both goals and assists in league matches, alongside Harry Kane (13 goals, 11 assists) and Thomas Muller (10 goals, 10 assists). Daniel James has scored five goals in 13 games for Manchester United this season, one more than he managed in 46 games across all competitions last season. Only Callum Wilson (15) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than Allan Saint-Maximin for Newcastle this season (five - two goals, three assists), despite this only being the Frenchman's 11th start in the competition this term. Manchester United face Real Sociedad in the second leg of their last 32 Europa League last-32 tie with a 4-0 lead on Thursday (20:00 GMT) before travelling to Chelsea next Sunday in the Premier League (16:30). Newcastle host Wolves in the Premier League next Saturday (20:00).

Safety assurance ahead of pupils' return to schools,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Safety assurance ahead of pupils' return to schools Education Secretary John Swinney has insisted it is safe for Scotland's youngest pupils to return to the classroom. Children in early years education and the first three years of primary will go back to school on Monday. It is the first step in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. Mr Swinney said ""detailed clinical analysis"" assured him it was safe. It followed concerns raised by the EIS teaching union and one epidemiologist about the measures put in place to reduce risk of transmission in schools. How will the phased return to school work?

""I do believe it is safe to do what we are doing tomorrow and I base that view on the very detailed clinical analysis prepared for us by our education clinical advisory group that was published earlier on in February,"" he toldBBC Scotland's The Sunday Show. ""The rates of infection amongst the youngest children, who will be the ones primarily going back to school tomorrow or back to early learning and childcare, are more than half those of the general presence within the population.

Unionist parties to join NI Protocol legal bid,"Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster; Ulster Unionist (UUP) leader Steve Aiken; and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister Northern Ireland's major unionist parties will be part of a legal bid to challenge the NI Protocol. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionists (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) have said they are supporting judicial review proceedings. Former MEP Ben Habib and former Labour MP Kate Hoey are also backing it. DUP leader Arlene Foster said they were committed to challenging the NI Protocol ""in the courts, in Parliament, in Stormont and in Brussels"". She added that the judicial review proceedings will challenge the NI Protocol's ""compatibility with the Act of Union 1800, the Northern Ireland Act of 1998 and the Belfast Agreement"". The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Unionism 'coming together' to oppose NI Protocol What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? Unionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union. The DUP said Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster will be named parties in the proceedings along with deputy leader Nigel Dodds, Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Sammy Wilson, the party's Westminster chief whip. Arlene Foster said that unionists' concerns will not be silenced Mrs Foster said Mr Habib, Mrs Hoey and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister were so far ""committed to these proceedings but we expect others to also join this path"". She said the protocol ""drove a coach and horses"" through both the Act of Union and the Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement. ""We are following our five-point plan of opposition to the protocol and will challenge its imposition in the courts, in Parliament, in Stormont and in Brussels,"" she added. ""The views of unionists will not be side-lined nor our concerns silenced."" UUP leader Steve Aiken said that ""testing the NI Protocol in the courts is a fair and legitimate thing to do"". He added that the actions that brought the protocol into force ""fundamentally undermine the principle of consent and laid out in the Belfast Agreement"". ""The absurdities of the protocol affect everyone in Northern Ireland; every legitimate action needs to be taken to deal with this very unequal, disproportionate and divisive treaty,"" he added. TUV leader Jim Allister said he welcomed the planned judicial review challenge and that he hoped ""all strands of unionism will join in this necessary effort"". He said that ""without Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey we would not be at this point"". However, he said that it was ""not a substitute or alternative to sustained and effective political action against the protocol"". The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), who campaigned against Brexit and have said parties must work together to make the protocol work, described the legal action as ""ill-judged"". ""There will be few with sympathy for the argument that the protocol, which prevents a hard border in Ireland and guarantees dual market access for local businesses, breaches the Good Friday Agreement,"" said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. ""That notion is stretched even further when the argument is made by a party that opposed the agreement in the first place. ""I'm sure the courts will decide what we all, including the DUP, already know. The protocol is necessary because of the hard Brexit that they supported."" Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said those supporting the judicial review were ""the same unionists who saddled up to the Tories, who throughout the course of the Brexit shambles have treated the people here with utter contempt"". He added that the protocol ""safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, and avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, and ensures the maintenance of north-south co-operation"". ""What matters is that executive ministers fulfil their legal duty and implement the protocol where they have responsibility to do so, in accordance with the law.""

Today's live page has been the work of: Jennifer Meierhans, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Alice Evans, Claire Heald and Sarah Collerton. Weâll be back with more on Monday â and we hope you can join us. As our live page draws to a close, hereâs a final round-up of the latest headlines from the UK and around the world today: Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The number of free ICU beds in Covid wards is dwindling across the country Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has signalled that more children may not begin to return to school on 1 March as promised, as the virus situation is so bad. It's been exacerbated by the spread of the UK variant and public non-compliance and widespread resignation. There are also problems with sourcing the antigen tests necessary to make it happen, after the prime minister said a tender to supply them should be cancelled over lack of transparency. Official figures show that in eight of the country's 14 regions, the number of free ICU beds in wards designated for Covid patients has fallen to single figures. The capital Prague - a city of 1.2 million people - currently has eight free ICU beds in Covid wards. Health Minister Jan Blatny says authorities may have to take drastic measures if the situation does not improve. According to the European Centre for Disease Control, the Czech Republic has had the highest number of new Covid cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous 14 days than any other country in the EU/EEA. According to Our World in Data, the country now has the fourth highest total number of Covid deaths per million inhabitants in the world. At 1,783 per million, it is more than the UK (1,776) or Italy (1,579). These graphs show the trajectory of the vaccination numbers in the UK as a steep incline, with more than 17.5m people receiving their first doses. Here are the daily coronavirus figures for the UK in graphs. They show the number of daily cases have fallen beneath the November high but are not yet lower than the peak during the first wave in March 2020. The number of patients in hospital is close to where we were at the height of the first wave and daily deaths are on their way down. The team is operating from a mobile vaccination unit Nearly 200 homeless people in Brighton have been given coronavirus vaccinations in the past fortnight as part of a drive to protect vulnerable communities. Arch Healthcare, a group which helps homeless people in the city, has carried out the programme and wants to vaccinate 1,000 people over eight weeks. Lead nurse Hannah Bishop said people experiencing homelessness have high levels of underlying health conditions, long-term conditions and mental health conditions which make it hard for them to access the mass vaccination sites. She said: ""We really believe it'sreally important for everybody to have access to this vaccine."" The team, operating from a mobile vaccination unit visiting key locations in the city, is working with St John Ambulance, Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust and homeless charity Justlife. A woman who turns 111 next month has had her coronavirus vaccine and is urging others to have theirs. May Willis, who lives in Bexhill, East Sussex, says: ""I've had my Covid jab and I think everyone should have it. It doesn't cost them anything and it helps to stop things spreading."" She says: ""Once lockdown is over and we can go back to the things we love doing I shall love to look forward to go back and see my friends."" And what's her secret to living to a ripe old age? No smoking, no alcohol and plenty of chocolate... This video can not be played 'I'm almost 111 and I make the most of what I've got' The vaccine shipment entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt A shipment of 20,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Gaza, donated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Health officials in the territory said they would begin vaccination on Monday. Gaza received 2,000 doses of the vaccine from the Palestinian Authority last week, but this new delivery is reported to have been organised by a former senior Palestinian official, Mohammad Dahlan, who now lives in the UAE. He was forced out of the territory a decade ago after clashing with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Gaza is
controlled by the Palestinian leader's Islamist Hamas rivals. Analysts say it's an attempt to score points ahead of a planned Palestinian election later this year. Gaza has registered more than 54,000 cases with 543 deaths,external. Palestinians have had little access to coronavirus vaccines, in contrast with Israel, which is easing lockdown restrictions after inoculating almost half its population. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme is ""ahead of schedule,"" health officials have said, after Boris Johnson announced new UK-wide targets of offeringall UK adults a first dose of vaccine by the end of July. The previous target was September for first dose completion, but the PM has now said it should ""go further and faster"" to help ease lockdown rules. Stormont's Department of Health said itsplans were dependent on supply. The UK's devolved nations each have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations and have different lockdown rules and vaccination programmes. Northern Ireland's programme started well and by Friday of last week, just over 23% of the local population had received their first dose of vaccine. However, that figure was slightly behind other parts of the UK, with Wales leading at 26.8%; Scotland second at 25.7%; and England third at 25.4%. A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by theDepartment of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Mademoiselle Desserts makes large round cakes that are sold on to wholesalers and mostly end up sliced in coffee shops, restaurants and garden centre cafes - but production is on hold due to lockdown. Its three UK sites are running at about 10-15% of pre-pandemic activity, with many staff furloughed. Its UK managing director, Nigel Taylor, is keenly awaitingPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcementof how restrictions will be eased on Monday. He says getting enough notice ahead of a definite restart for hospitality is crucial so he can restock ingredients that can take weeks to arrive from abroad. Wholesaler Bidfood, which supplies meals to care homes, pubs and restaurants, is also awaiting news of when the hospitality industry can reopen. Its chief executive, Andrew Selley, says: ""It's not just a case of turning on a switch and providing the product. ""The customers have to plan what menus they want to offer and they have to tell us what volumes they're expecting, based on what the government is saying the regulations are going to be."" Read more here The total number of people to receive their first vaccination in the UK has risen to 17,582,121,according to today's figures.,external Another 615,148 people have also had their second dose. A further 215 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,daily figures,externalfrom the government show. It takes the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 120,580. There have also been a further 9,834 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours. Police said the car park was ""evidently not a place of worship"" A church pastor who organised a group worship in a pub car parkhas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching lockdown rules. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police said the Church on the Streets service on Saturday involved about 30 people in Bardney Drive, Bulwell, gathering with tents, food and a sound system. Pastor Chez Weir has said she will contest the fine. Insp James Walker, from the force, said they had been advising the group for a number of weeks about how and where they could worship during lockdown. ""Whilst the rules state you can attend places of worship, this car park is evidently not a place of worship,"" he said. ""Despite the warnings given over the last week in particular, this event continued to go ahead and that is why we have implemented our last resort of enforcement."" Government coronavirus guidance states a place of worship can be somewhereused for religious gatherings,external, even sites usually used for other things. But it adds they must be permitted to be open during lockdown and ""additional guidance may be applicable"". It also recommends that, where possible, places of worship continue to stream worship or other events to avoid large gatherings. The WHO asked Tanzania to take ""robust action"" after people travelling from the country tested positive for Covid-19 If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a round-up of the
latest coronavirus headlines the UK and around the world: Thousands of lorry drivers were stuck in Kent in December, when France closed its border with the UK People driving lorries into the UK from France will no longer be required to have a negative coronavirus test before they are allowed to re-enter France, if they've been in the UK for less than 48 hours, the UK transport secretary says. Grant Shapps says,externalthat from 23:00 GMT tonight, hauliers will only have to show evidence of the time they entered the UK, to allow them back into France without a negative Covid test result. French authorities will also recognise proof of a negative test taken in Ireland if the test was taken less than 72 hours before departure from the UK for France,according to updated UK government guidance.,external France demanded in December that lorry drivers returning to France would have to show proof of a negative test to combat the fast-spreading variant of the virus that was first detected in Kent, south-east England. The Road Haulage Association has acknowledged the change in guidance, but says it's still examining the detail of how it will work in practice. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary says he's noticed that his medical colleagues show a preference for one vaccine, while members of the public often prefer another. This isn't a time to be choosy, he writes. The dash for vaccines has thrown up a rather peculiar situation. With so many pharmaceutical companies competing in this greatest of scientific races, we now have a variety of vaccines, and people are starting to ask me, ""Do I get a choice?"" And ""Which vaccine would you recommend?"" The concept of consumer choice when it comes to immunisation, or even medications, is alien. No-one asks about the brand of their annual flu jab, or which company produces the MMR vaccine that will protect their precious children. But the intense global relief that greeted the Pfizer Covid vaccine, and then Moderna, AstraZeneca and most recently Novavax and Janssen vaccines (though the last two are still awaiting regulatory approval) has created brand awareness in a population that has had a crash course in epidemiology and infectious diseases. My answer is a simple one: we take whatever vaccine we are given and thank the lucky Northern stars that we live in a developed country. The idea of choice seems so wrong, when there is such an acute shortage of vaccines across the world. Read more from John's diary here. As we reported earlier, Israelhas been easinglockdown restrictions, following the success of its vaccination programme. Shops, libraries and museums are now allowed to open. People are now able to enter some tourist attractions such as zoos and theatres... ...as well as gyms and swimming pools. To be able to access these facilities, people are required to show a ""green passport"" (which is contained in an app), a certificate that can only be obtained once you have been vaccinated. Schools have also reopened, almost two months after they were closed because of the pandemic. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world. More than 49% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. We've been telling you about DJ Jo Whiley's sister Frances, who is in hospital with coronavirus. Jo says she was offered a vaccine ahead of her sister, who has learning disabilities and diabetes. Now, the charity Mencap is calling for everyone with learning disabilities to be prioritised for a vaccine. Chief executive, Edel Harris, told the BBC Frances' story ""is highlighting huge health inequalities"" that see 1,200 people with learning disabilities ""dying avoidably every year"". ""What Covid has done is shone a really bright light on this most important and most pressing issue,"" she says. ""We are urging the government and the JCVI to remove this arbitrary definition of severe and profound learning disability, because people who apparently fall into that category are in group six for the vaccination. We are just asking them to include all people with a learning disability as being a priority for a vaccination."" She says people who have learning disabilities are ""up to six times more likely to die if they contract Covid"" and going into hospital can be traumatic for them. The mayor of Nice would like to reduce the flow of tourists to his city for now The mayor of Nice says the southern city and its surrounding area need either a weekend lockdown or a local tightening of the nationwide curfew to combat coronavirus figures that are the worst in France. Christian Estrosi says visitors, including many from abroad, are still flocking to Nice and this needs to be suspended without restricting economic activity. ""The weather is nice, everybody rushes to come here. A
weekend lockdown would put a stop to that, without halting
economic activity in the city,"" he told French radio. ""We will be happy to receive lots of tourists this summer,
once we win this battle, but it is better to have a period while
we say 'do not come here, this is not the moment'."" The whole of France is already under a daily 12-hour curfew which starts at 18:00 (17:00 GMT). ""We need strong measures that go beyond the nationwide 6pm curfew, either a tighter curfew, or a partial and time-specific lockdown. A weekend lockdown would make sense,"" he says. France's Health Minister, Olivier VÃ©ran, said on Saturday he was requesting stricter measures in the Alpes-Maritime region in which Nice is situated. New weekly cases in the area are triple the national average,,externalaccording to

"Regulator investigates Â£30m Covid contract firmHinpack, which makes test tubes, is run by the former landlord of a pub near Matt Hancock's old home.UK Politics","Hinpack was awarded a Â£30m contract to make test tubes during the pandemic A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". A Department of Health spokesman said early in the UK's epidemic it asked ""suppliers in multiple industries"" to help to support the national effort to secure products needed for Covid tests. All suppliers must pass through ""a rigorous regulatory and validations process"" to ensure they meet quality standards, he said. ""We continue to ensure all contracts are awarded in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines,"" he added. The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by the Department of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Lawyers for Mr Bourne told the Guardian the test tubes that Hinpack manufactures are ""by no means complicated and are well within our client's existing skillset"". They also said the MHRA had previously approved and inspected Hinpack's products and working practices, and allegations being reported against them were ""untrue"". Asked about it at a Downing Street press conference in December, Mr Hancock said: ""I had absolutely nothing to do with that contract."" Hancock: 'Right' to delay contract transparency Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Labour urges ministers to 'clean up' Covid contracts The confirmation comes in the same weekMr Hancock was ruled to have acted unlawfullyin failing to publish details of government contracts within 30 days. Earlier, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it had been ""the right thing to do"" so his staff could focus on sourcing PPE at the height of the pandemic. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the inquiry into Mr Bourne's company was ""extremely worrying"", adding: ""The reasons for handing this contract out in the first place must be investigated and shared in the public interest"". Director of devices at the MHRA, Graeme Tunbridge, said he could not disclose why the company was being investigated as the inquiry was ongoing. But in a statement, he said: ""We are currently investigating the allegations about Hinpack and will take appropriate action as necessary. ""Patient safety is our top priority.""

Lloyd's seeks archivist to investigate slave links,"Insurance market Lloyd's of London is seeking an archivist who would examine its artefacts for historical links to the slave trade. It has posted an advert for an expert to investigate its collection of more than 3,000 items, including paintings, swords and furniture. It is not yet clear what will happen to the objects following the research. Last June, Lloyd's apologised for its ""shameful"" role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lloyd's, which was founded in 1688, insured slave ships. It is often lauded as the world's leading insurance market, focusing on specialist areas, such as marine, energy and political risk. Journals published by the insurance market in the 18th and 19th Centuries also often contained advertisements for slave ships. The new recruit to the Lloyd's archives will carry out research ""to ascertain what artefacts and objects link to African and Caribbean history (specifically slavery and abolition)"", according to the job advert. For example, they will look into the swords and pieces of silverware the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave out as prizes to those in the military who ""went above the call of duty"" and have since been returned to its collections. Pub chain and insurance hub 'sorry' for slave links Aunt Jemima to rebrand as Pearl Milling Company this summer George Floyd: Why are companies speaking up this time? A spokeswoman for Lloyd's of London said: ""As society evolves, it is right and proper for us to take a look at those symbols and artefacts and make a decision as to whether or not what they stand for reflects where we are. ""Of course, it is important to fully understand history, but we must do so in a way that reflects changing sentiments and societal views as we more fully understand that history - the good, and the bad."" Dr Katie Donington, a senior lecturer in history at the London South Bank University said that the move by Lloyd's was ""very welcome"". ""The work of analysing the historical relationship between commercial organisations and the business of slavery must take place within the context of evidence-based research. That process begins with examining the archive as well as relevant material culture held by Lloyds,"" she said. She added that transparency around the research is key, and hopes details on any linked records or artefacts will be made available to historians of slavery, community groups and the public ""so they can understand the ways in which slavery and its legacies shaped both Lloyd's and the wider City of London during this period."" Activists in September protested outside London financial institutions with historical links to the slave trade After racial justice protests swept across the United States in 2020 following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody, pressure on firms to address links to slavery and tackle racial inequality has intensified. In a statement in June 2020, Lloyd's said: ""There are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. ""In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd's market in the 18th and 19th Century slave trade."" ""This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period."" At the time, the centuries-old insurance market also committed to providing financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups. It was one of a number of firms identified inan investigation by the Telegraph newspaper,externalto have historical links to the slave trade. Pub chain Greene King, for example, apologised after it was found that one of its founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean. The company said it would make a ""substantial investment to benefit the BAME community"", after consulting with its staff on how this money can best be used.

Claims made for RAF sonic boom 'household damage',"RAF Typhoons, similar to the aircraft pictured, took off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and escorted the civilian aircraft to London Stansted Airport Claims for damage to a household TV and roof tiles have been made after a sonic boom was caused by RAF Typhoons that were intercepting a private plane. The Typhoons""safely escorted""the civilian aircraft to Stansted Airport in Essex on 12 January. Six damage claims have been made to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after the boom was heard across eastern England. An RAF spokesman said compensation could be paid ""subject to the provision of supporting evidence"". ""The RAF is responsible for policing UK airspace and would prefer not to cause any disturbance to those on the ground, however, the safety and security of the nation remains paramount,"" he said. This video can not be played People's reaction to the sonic boom was caught on camera The RAF Typhoons were authorised to fly at supersonic speed when they were deployed from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept the private jet. That aircraft was believed to have been flying from Germany to Birmingham and had lost communications - sparking an alert. The boom, at about 13:05 GMT, was reported across social media by people in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and parts of London. It led the RAF tooffer a ""helping hand""to those home-schooling by sharing a lesson on sonic booms. Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the MoD said it ""received notification of six claims"", three of which were from people in Essex, although the locations of the other three were not specified. ""The alleged damage is to windows (two claims), dislodged roof tiles (two claims), a television and a wall picture,"" the MoD said. It added: ""The MoD has not settled any claims arising from the sonic incident on 12 January 2021."" The RAF video explains how supersonic aeroplanes cause sonic booms When an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has ""nowhere to escape"", saidDr Jim Wild of Lancaster University. A sonic boom happens when that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap. The speed of sound varies. It is about 770mph (1,200km/h) at sea level, but slower at higher altitudes. A plane flying at 30,000ft would reach the speed of sound at about 675mph (1,085km/h), according toNASA's educational website,external. It can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake of a boat spreading out behind the vessel. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic over populated areas in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft.

Today's live page has been the work of: Jennifer Meierhans, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Alice Evans, Claire Heald and Sarah Collerton. Weâll be back with more on Monday â and we hope you can join us. As our live page draws to a close, hereâs a final round-up of the latest headlines from the UK and around the world today: Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The number of free ICU beds in Covid wards is dwindling across the country Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has signalled that more children may not begin to return to school on 1 March as promised, as the virus situation is so bad. It's been exacerbated by the spread of the UK variant and public non-compliance and widespread resignation. There are also problems with sourcing the antigen tests necessary to make it happen, after the prime minister said a tender to supply them should be cancelled over lack of transparency. Official figures show that in eight of the country's 14 regions, the number of free ICU beds in wards designated for Covid patients has fallen to single figures. The capital Prague - a city of 1.2 million people - currently has eight free ICU beds in Covid wards. Health Minister Jan Blatny says authorities may have to take drastic measures if the situation does not improve. According to the European Centre for Disease Control, the Czech Republic has had the highest number of new Covid cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous 14 days than any other country in the EU/EEA. According to Our World in Data, the country now has the fourth highest total number of Covid deaths per million inhabitants in the world. At 1,783 per million, it is more than the UK (1,776) or Italy (1,579). These graphs show the trajectory of the vaccination numbers in the UK as a steep incline, with more than 17.5m people receiving their first doses. Here are the daily coronavirus figures for the UK in graphs. They show the number of daily cases have fallen beneath the November high but are not yet lower than the peak during the first wave in March 2020. The number of patients in hospital is close to where we were at the height of the first wave and daily deaths are on their way down. The team is operating from a mobile vaccination unit Nearly 200 homeless people in Brighton have been given coronavirus vaccinations in the past fortnight as part of a drive to protect vulnerable communities. Arch Healthcare, a group which helps homeless people in the city, has carried out the programme and wants to vaccinate 1,000 people over eight weeks. Lead nurse Hannah Bishop said people experiencing homelessness have high levels of underlying health conditions, long-term conditions and mental health conditions which make it hard for them to access the mass vaccination sites. She said: ""We really believe it'sreally important for everybody to have access to this vaccine."" The team, operating from a mobile vaccination unit visiting key locations in the city, is working with St John Ambulance, Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust and homeless charity Justlife. A woman who turns 111 next month has had her coronavirus vaccine and is urging others to have theirs. May Willis, who lives in Bexhill, East Sussex, says: ""I've had my Covid jab and I think everyone should have it. It doesn't cost them anything and it helps to stop things spreading."" She says: ""Once lockdown is over and we can go back to the things we love doing I shall love to look forward to go back and see my friends."" And what's her secret to living to a ripe old age? No smoking, no alcohol and plenty of chocolate... This video can not be played 'I'm almost 111 and I make the most of what I've got' The vaccine shipment entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt A shipment of 20,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Gaza, donated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Health officials in the territory said they would begin vaccination on Monday. Gaza received 2,000 doses of the vaccine from the Palestinian Authority last week, but this new delivery is reported to have been organised by a former senior Palestinian official, Mohammad Dahlan, who now lives in the UAE. He was forced out of the territory a decade ago after clashing with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Gaza is
controlled by the Palestinian leader's Islamist Hamas rivals. Analysts say it's an attempt to score points ahead of a planned Palestinian election later this year. Gaza has registered more than 54,000 cases with 543 deaths,external. Palestinians have had little access to coronavirus vaccines, in contrast with Israel, which is easing lockdown restrictions after inoculating almost half its population. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme is ""ahead of schedule,"" health officials have said, after Boris Johnson announced new UK-wide targets of offeringall UK adults a first dose of vaccine by the end of July. The previous target was September for first dose completion, but the PM has now said it should ""go further and faster"" to help ease lockdown rules. Stormont's Department of Health said itsplans were dependent on supply. The UK's devolved nations each have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations and have different lockdown rules and vaccination programmes. Northern Ireland's programme started well and by Friday of last week, just over 23% of the local population had received their first dose of vaccine. However, that figure was slightly behind other parts of the UK, with Wales leading at 26.8%; Scotland second at 25.7%; and England third at 25.4%. A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by theDepartment of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Mademoiselle Desserts makes large round cakes that are sold on to wholesalers and mostly end up sliced in coffee shops, restaurants and garden centre cafes - but production is on hold due to lockdown. Its three UK sites are running at about 10-15% of pre-pandemic activity, with many staff furloughed. Its UK managing director, Nigel Taylor, is keenly awaitingPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcementof how restrictions will be eased on Monday. He says getting enough notice ahead of a definite restart for hospitality is crucial so he can restock ingredients that can take weeks to arrive from abroad. Wholesaler Bidfood, which supplies meals to care homes, pubs and restaurants, is also awaiting news of when the hospitality industry can reopen. Its chief executive, Andrew Selley, says: ""It's not just a case of turning on a switch and providing the product. ""The customers have to plan what menus they want to offer and they have to tell us what volumes they're expecting, based on what the government is saying the regulations are going to be.""

According to Our World in Data, the country now has the fourth highest total number of Covid deaths per million inhabitants in the world. At 1,783 per million, it is more than the UK (1,776) or Italy (1,579). These graphs show the trajectory of the vaccination numbers in the UK as a steep incline, with more than 17.5m people receiving their first doses. Here are the daily coronavirus figures for the UK in graphs. They show the number of daily cases have fallen beneath the November high but are not yet lower than the peak during the first wave in March 2020. The number of patients in hospital is close to where we were at the height of the first wave and daily deaths are on their way down. The team is operating from a mobile vaccination unit Nearly 200 homeless people in Brighton have been given coronavirus vaccinations in the past fortnight as part of a drive to protect vulnerable communities. Arch Healthcare, a group which helps homeless people in the city, has carried out the programme and wants to vaccinate 1,000 people over eight weeks. Lead nurse Hannah Bishop said people experiencing homelessness have high levels of underlying health conditions, long-term conditions and mental health conditions which make it hard for them to access the mass vaccination sites. She said: ""We really believe it'sreally important for everybody to have access to this vaccine."" The team, operating from a mobile vaccination unit visiting key locations in the city, is working with St John Ambulance, Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust and homeless charity Justlife. A woman who turns 111 next month has had her coronavirus vaccine and is urging others to have theirs. May Willis, who lives in Bexhill, East Sussex, says: ""I've had my Covid jab and I think everyone should have it. It doesn't cost them anything and it helps to stop things spreading."" She says: ""Once lockdown is over and we can go back to the things we love doing I shall love to look forward to go back and see my friends."" And what's her secret to living to a ripe old age? No smoking, no alcohol and plenty of chocolate... This video can not be played 'I'm almost 111 and I make the most of what I've got' The vaccine shipment entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt A shipment of 20,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Gaza, donated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Health officials in the territory said they would begin vaccination on Monday. Gaza received 2,000 doses of the vaccine from the Palestinian Authority last week, but this new delivery is reported to have been organised by a former senior Palestinian official, Mohammad Dahlan, who now lives in the UAE. He was forced out of the territory a decade ago after clashing with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Gaza is
controlled by the Palestinian leader's Islamist Hamas rivals. Analysts say it's an attempt to score points ahead of a planned Palestinian election later this year. Gaza has registered more than 54,000 cases with 543 deaths,external. Palestinians have had little access to coronavirus vaccines, in contrast with Israel, which is easing lockdown restrictions after inoculating almost half its population. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme is ""ahead of schedule,"" health officials have said, after Boris Johnson announced new UK-wide targets of offeringall UK adults a first dose of vaccine by the end of July. The previous target was September for first dose completion, but the PM has now said it should ""go further and faster"" to help ease lockdown rules. Stormont's Department of Health said itsplans were dependent on supply. The UK's devolved nations each have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations and have different lockdown rules and vaccination programmes. Northern Ireland's programme started well and by Friday of last week, just over 23% of the local population had received their first dose of vaccine. However, that figure was slightly behind other parts of the UK, with Wales leading at 26.8%; Scotland second at 25.7%; and England third at 25.4%. A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by theDepartment of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Mademoiselle Desserts makes large round cakes that are sold on to wholesalers and mostly end up sliced in coffee shops, restaurants and garden centre cafes - but production is on hold due to lockdown. Its three UK sites are running at about 10-15% of pre-pandemic activity, with many staff furloughed. Its UK managing director, Nigel Taylor, is keenly awaitingPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcementof how restrictions will be eased on Monday. He says getting enough notice ahead of a definite restart for hospitality is crucial so he can restock ingredients that can take weeks to arrive from abroad. Wholesaler Bidfood, which supplies meals to care homes, pubs and restaurants, is also awaiting news of when the hospitality industry can reopen. Its chief executive, Andrew Selley, says: ""It's not just a case of turning on a switch and providing the product. ""The customers have to plan what menus they want to offer and they have to tell us what volumes they're expecting, based on what the government is saying the regulations are going to be.""

A further 215 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,daily figures,externalfrom the government show. It takes the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 120,580. There have also been a further 9,834 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours. Police said the car park was ""evidently not a place of worship"" A church pastor who organised a group worship in a pub car parkhas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching lockdown rules. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police said the Church on the Streets service on Saturday involved about 30 people in Bardney Drive, Bulwell, gathering with tents, food and a sound system. Pastor Chez Weir has said she will contest the fine. Insp James Walker, from the force, said they had been advising the group for a number of weeks about how and where they could worship during lockdown. ""Whilst the rules state you can attend places of worship, this car park is evidently not a place of worship,"" he said. ""Despite the warnings given over the last week in particular, this event continued to go ahead and that is why we have implemented our last resort of enforcement."" Government coronavirus guidance states a place of worship can be somewhereused for religious gatherings,external, even sites usually used for other things. But it adds they must be permitted to be open during lockdown and ""additional guidance may be applicable"". It also recommends that, where possible, places of worship continue to stream worship or other events to avoid large gatherings. The WHO asked Tanzania to take ""robust action"" after people travelling from the country tested positive for Covid-19 If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a round-up of the
latest coronavirus headlines the UK and around the world: Thousands of lorry drivers were stuck in Kent in December, when France closed its border with the UK People driving lorries into the UK from France will no longer be required to have a negative coronavirus test before they are allowed to re-enter France, if they've been in the UK for less than 48 hours, the UK transport secretary says. Grant Shapps says,externalthat from 23:00 GMT tonight, hauliers will only have to show evidence of the time they entered the UK, to allow them back into France without a negative Covid test result. French authorities will also recognise proof of a negative test taken in Ireland if the test was taken less than 72 hours before departure from the UK for France,according to updated UK government guidance.,external France demanded in December that lorry drivers returning to France would have to show proof of a negative test to combat the fast-spreading variant of the virus that was first detected in Kent, south-east England. The Road Haulage Association has acknowledged the change in guidance, but says it's still examining the detail of how it will work in practice. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary says he's noticed that his medical colleagues show a preference for one vaccine, while members of the public often prefer another. This isn't a time to be choosy, he writes. The dash for vaccines has thrown up a rather peculiar situation. With so many pharmaceutical companies competing in this greatest of scientific races, we now have a variety of vaccines, and people are starting to ask me, ""Do I get a choice?"" And ""Which vaccine would you recommend?"" The concept of consumer choice when it comes to immunisation, or even medications, is alien. No-one asks about the brand of their annual flu jab, or which company produces the MMR vaccine that will protect their precious children. But the intense global relief that greeted the Pfizer Covid vaccine, and then Moderna, AstraZeneca and most recently Novavax and Janssen vaccines (though the last two are still awaiting regulatory approval) has created brand awareness in a population that has had a crash course in epidemiology and infectious diseases. My answer is a simple one: we take whatever vaccine we are given and thank the lucky Northern stars that we live in a developed country. The idea of choice seems so wrong, when there is such an acute shortage of vaccines across the world. Read more from John's diary here. As we reported earlier, Israelhas been easinglockdown restrictions, following the success of its vaccination programme. Shops, libraries and museums are now allowed to open. People are now able to enter some tourist attractions such as zoos and theatres... ...as well as gyms and swimming pools. To be able to access these facilities, people are required to show a ""green passport"" (which is contained in an app), a certificate that can only be obtained once you have been vaccinated. Schools have also reopened, almost two months after they were closed because of the pandemic. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world. More than 49% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. We've been telling you about DJ Jo Whiley's sister Frances, who is in hospital with coronavirus. Jo says she was offered a vaccine ahead of her sister, who has learning disabilities and diabetes. Now, the charity Mencap is calling for everyone with learning disabilities to be prioritised for a vaccine. Chief executive, Edel Harris, told the BBC Frances' story ""is highlighting huge health inequalities"" that see 1,200 people with learning disabilities ""dying avoidably every year"". ""What Covid has done is shone a really bright light on this most important and most pressing issue,"" she says. ""We are urging the government and the JCVI to remove this arbitrary definition of severe and profound learning disability, because people who apparently fall into that category are in group six for the vaccination. We are just asking them to include all people with a learning disability as being a priority for a vaccination."" She says people who have learning disabilities are ""up to six times more likely to die if they contract Covid"" and going into hospital can be traumatic for them. The mayor of Nice would like to reduce the flow of tourists to his city for now The mayor of Nice says the southern city and its surrounding area need either a weekend lockdown or a local tightening of the nationwide curfew to combat coronavirus figures that are the worst in France. Christian Estrosi says visitors, including many from abroad, are still flocking to Nice and this needs to be suspended without restricting economic activity. ""The weather is nice, everybody rushes to come here. A
weekend lockdown would put a stop to that, without halting
economic activity in the city,"" he told French radio. ""We will be happy to receive lots of tourists this summer,
once we win this battle, but it is better to have a period while
we say 'do not come here, this is not the moment'."" The whole of France is already under a daily 12-hour curfew which starts at 18:00 (17:00 GMT). ""We need strong measures that go beyond the nationwide 6pm curfew, either a tighter curfew, or a partial and time-specific lockdown. A weekend lockdown would make sense,"" he says.

Weâll be back with more on Monday â and we hope you can join us. As our live page draws to a close, hereâs a final round-up of the latest headlines from the UK and around the world today: Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The number of free ICU beds in Covid wards is dwindling across the country Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has signalled that more children may not begin to return to school on 1 March as promised, as the virus situation is so bad. It's been exacerbated by the spread of the UK variant and public non-compliance and widespread resignation. There are also problems with sourcing the antigen tests necessary to make it happen, after the prime minister said a tender to supply them should be cancelled over lack of transparency. Official figures show that in eight of the country's 14 regions, the number of free ICU beds in wards designated for Covid patients has fallen to single figures. The capital Prague - a city of 1.2 million people - currently has eight free ICU beds in Covid wards. Health Minister Jan Blatny says authorities may have to take drastic measures if the situation does not improve.

Palestinians have had little access to coronavirus vaccines, in contrast with Israel, which is easing lockdown restrictions after inoculating almost half its population. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme is ""ahead of schedule,"" health officials have said, after Boris Johnson announced new UK-wide targets of offeringall UK adults a first dose of vaccine by the end of July. The previous target was September for first dose completion, but the PM has now said it should ""go further and faster"" to help ease lockdown rules. Stormont's Department of Health said itsplans were dependent on supply. The UK's devolved nations each have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations and have different lockdown rules and vaccination programmes. Northern Ireland's programme started well and by Friday of last week, just over 23% of the local population had received their first dose of vaccine. However, that figure was slightly behind other parts of the UK, with Wales leading at 26.8%; Scotland second at 25.7%; and England third at 25.4%. A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by theDepartment of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Mademoiselle Desserts makes large round cakes that are sold on to wholesalers and mostly end up sliced in coffee shops, restaurants and garden centre cafes - but production is on hold due to lockdown.

Its UK managing director, Nigel Taylor, is keenly awaitingPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcementof how restrictions will be eased on Monday. He says getting enough notice ahead of a definite restart for hospitality is crucial so he can restock ingredients that can take weeks to arrive from abroad.

Its chief executive, Andrew Selley, says: ""It's not just a case of turning on a switch and providing the product.

It takes the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 120,580. There have also been a further 9,834 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours. Police said the car park was ""evidently not a place of worship"" A church pastor who organised a group worship in a pub car parkhas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching lockdown rules. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police said the Church on the Streets service on Saturday involved about 30 people in Bardney Drive, Bulwell, gathering with tents, food and a sound system. Pastor Chez Weir has said she will contest the fine. Insp James Walker, from the force, said they had been advising the group for a number of weeks about how and where they could worship during lockdown. ""Whilst the rules state you can attend places of worship, this car park is evidently not a place of worship,"" he said.

The WHO asked Tanzania to take ""robust action"" after people travelling from the country tested positive for Covid-19 If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a round-up of the
latest coronavirus headlines the UK and around the world: Thousands of lorry drivers were stuck in Kent in December, when France closed its border with the UK People driving lorries into the UK from France will no longer be required to have a negative coronavirus test before they are allowed to re-enter France, if they've been in the UK for less than 48 hours, the UK transport secretary says. Grant Shapps says,externalthat from 23:00 GMT tonight, hauliers will only have to show evidence of the time they entered the UK, to allow them back into France without a negative Covid test result. French authorities will also recognise proof of a negative test taken in Ireland if the test was taken less than 72 hours before departure from the UK for France,according to updated UK government guidance.,external France demanded in December that lorry drivers returning to France would have to show proof of a negative test to combat the fast-spreading variant of the virus that was first detected in Kent, south-east England. The Road Haulage Association has acknowledged the change in guidance, but says it's still examining the detail of how it will work in practice. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary says he's noticed that his medical colleagues show a preference for one vaccine, while members of the public often prefer another. This isn't a time to be choosy, he writes. The dash for vaccines has thrown up a rather peculiar situation. With so many pharmaceutical companies competing in this greatest of scientific races, we now have a variety of vaccines, and people are starting to ask me, ""Do I get a choice?"" And ""Which vaccine would you recommend?"" The concept of consumer choice when it comes to immunisation, or even medications, is alien. No-one asks about the brand of their annual flu jab, or which company produces the MMR vaccine that will protect their precious children. But the intense global relief that greeted the Pfizer Covid vaccine, and then Moderna, AstraZeneca and most recently Novavax and Janssen vaccines (though the last two are still awaiting regulatory approval) has created brand awareness in a population that has had a crash course in epidemiology and infectious diseases. My answer is a simple one: we take whatever vaccine we are given and thank the lucky Northern stars that we live in a developed country. The idea of choice seems so wrong, when there is such an acute shortage of vaccines across the world. Read more from John's diary here. As we reported earlier, Israelhas been easinglockdown restrictions, following the success of its vaccination programme. Shops, libraries and museums are now allowed to open. People are now able to enter some tourist attractions such as zoos and theatres... ...as well as gyms and swimming pools. To be able to access these facilities, people are required to show a ""green passport"" (which is contained in an app), a certificate that can only be obtained once you have been vaccinated. Schools have also reopened, almost two months after they were closed because of the pandemic. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world. More than 49% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. We've been telling you about DJ Jo Whiley's sister Frances, who is in hospital with coronavirus. Jo says she was offered a vaccine ahead of her sister, who has learning disabilities and diabetes. Now, the charity Mencap is calling for everyone with learning disabilities to be prioritised for a vaccine. Chief executive, Edel Harris, told the BBC Frances' story ""is highlighting huge health inequalities"" that see 1,200 people with learning disabilities ""dying avoidably every year"". ""What Covid has done is shone a really bright light on this most important and most pressing issue,"" she says. ""We are urging the government and the JCVI to remove this arbitrary definition of severe and profound learning disability, because people who apparently fall into that category are in group six for the vaccination. We are just asking them to include all people with a learning disability as being a priority for a vaccination."" She says people who have learning disabilities are ""up to six times more likely to die if they contract Covid"" and going into hospital can be traumatic for them. The mayor of Nice would like to reduce the flow of tourists to his city for now The mayor of Nice says the southern city and its surrounding area need either a weekend lockdown or a local tightening of the nationwide curfew to combat coronavirus figures that are the worst in France. Christian Estrosi says visitors, including many from abroad, are still flocking to Nice and this needs to be suspended without restricting economic activity.

Today's live page has been the work of: Jennifer Meierhans, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Alice Evans, Claire Heald and Sarah Collerton. Weâll be back with more on Monday â and we hope you can join us. As our live page draws to a close, hereâs a final round-up of the latest headlines from the UK and around the world today: Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The number of free ICU beds in Covid wards is dwindling across the country Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has signalled that more children may not begin to return to school on 1 March as promised, as the virus situation is so bad. It's been exacerbated by the spread of the UK variant and public non-compliance and widespread resignation. There are also problems with sourcing the antigen tests necessary to make it happen, after the prime minister said a tender to supply them should be cancelled over lack of transparency. Official figures show that in eight of the country's 14 regions, the number of free ICU beds in wards designated for Covid patients has fallen to single figures. The capital Prague - a city of 1.2 million people - currently has eight free ICU beds in Covid wards. Health Minister Jan Blatny says authorities may have to take drastic measures if the situation does not improve. According to the European Centre for Disease Control, the Czech Republic has had the highest number of new Covid cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous 14 days than any other country in the EU/EEA. According to Our World in Data, the country now has the fourth highest total number of Covid deaths per million inhabitants in the world. At 1,783 per million, it is more than the UK (1,776) or Italy (1,579). These graphs show the trajectory of the vaccination numbers in the UK as a steep incline, with more than 17.5m people receiving their first doses. Here are the daily coronavirus figures for the UK in graphs. They show the number of daily cases have fallen beneath the November high but are not yet lower than the peak during the first wave in March 2020. The number of patients in hospital is close to where we were at the height of the first wave and daily deaths are on their way down. The team is operating from a mobile vaccination unit Nearly 200 homeless people in Brighton have been given coronavirus vaccinations in the past fortnight as part of a drive to protect vulnerable communities. Arch Healthcare, a group which helps homeless people in the city, has carried out the programme and wants to vaccinate 1,000 people over eight weeks. Lead nurse Hannah Bishop said people experiencing homelessness have high levels of underlying health conditions, long-term conditions and mental health conditions which make it hard for them to access the mass vaccination sites. She said: ""We really believe it'sreally important for everybody to have access to this vaccine."" The team, operating from a mobile vaccination unit visiting key locations in the city, is working with St John Ambulance, Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust and homeless charity Justlife. A woman who turns 111 next month has had her coronavirus vaccine and is urging others to have theirs. May Willis, who lives in Bexhill, East Sussex, says: ""I've had my Covid jab and I think everyone should have it. It doesn't cost them anything and it helps to stop things spreading."" She says: ""Once lockdown is over and we can go back to the things we love doing I shall love to look forward to go back and see my friends."" And what's her secret to living to a ripe old age? No smoking, no alcohol and plenty of chocolate... This video can not be played 'I'm almost 111 and I make the most of what I've got' The vaccine shipment entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt A shipment of 20,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Gaza, donated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Health officials in the territory said they would begin vaccination on Monday. Gaza received 2,000 doses of the vaccine from the Palestinian Authority last week, but this new delivery is reported to have been organised by a former senior Palestinian official, Mohammad Dahlan, who now lives in the UAE. He was forced out of the territory a decade ago after clashing with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Gaza is

Police said the car park was ""evidently not a place of worship"" A church pastor who organised a group worship in a pub car parkhas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching lockdown rules. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police said the Church on the Streets service on Saturday involved about 30 people in Bardney Drive, Bulwell, gathering with tents, food and a sound system. Pastor Chez Weir has said she will contest the fine. Insp James Walker, from the force, said they had been advising the group for a number of weeks about how and where they could worship during lockdown. ""Whilst the rules state you can attend places of worship, this car park is evidently not a place of worship,"" he said. ""Despite the warnings given over the last week in particular, this event continued to go ahead and that is why we have implemented our last resort of enforcement."" Government coronavirus guidance states a place of worship can be somewhereused for religious gatherings,external, even sites usually used for other things. But it adds they must be permitted to be open during lockdown and ""additional guidance may be applicable"". It also recommends that, where possible, places of worship continue to stream worship or other events to avoid large gatherings. The WHO asked Tanzania to take ""robust action"" after people travelling from the country tested positive for Covid-19 If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a round-up of the
latest coronavirus headlines the UK and around the world: Thousands of lorry drivers were stuck in Kent in December, when France closed its border with the UK People driving lorries into the UK from France will no longer be required to have a negative coronavirus test before they are allowed to re-enter France, if they've been in the UK for less than 48 hours, the UK transport secretary says. Grant Shapps says,externalthat from 23:00 GMT tonight, hauliers will only have to show evidence of the time they entered the UK, to allow them back into France without a negative Covid test result. French authorities will also recognise proof of a negative test taken in Ireland if the test was taken less than 72 hours before departure from the UK for France,according to updated UK government guidance.,external France demanded in December that lorry drivers returning to France would have to show proof of a negative test to combat the fast-spreading variant of the virus that was first detected in Kent, south-east England. The Road Haulage Association has acknowledged the change in guidance, but says it's still examining the detail of how it will work in practice. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary says he's noticed that his medical colleagues show a preference for one vaccine, while members of the public often prefer another. This isn't a time to be choosy, he writes. The dash for vaccines has thrown up a rather peculiar situation. With so many pharmaceutical companies competing in this greatest of scientific races, we now have a variety of vaccines, and people are starting to ask me, ""Do I get a choice?"" And ""Which vaccine would you recommend?"" The concept of consumer choice when it comes to immunisation, or even medications, is alien. No-one asks about the brand of their annual flu jab, or which company produces the MMR vaccine that will protect their precious children. But the intense global relief that greeted the Pfizer Covid vaccine, and then Moderna, AstraZeneca and most recently Novavax and Janssen vaccines (though the last two are still awaiting regulatory approval) has created brand awareness in a population that has had a crash course in epidemiology and infectious diseases. My answer is a simple one: we take whatever vaccine we are given and thank the lucky Northern stars that we live in a developed country. The idea of choice seems so wrong, when there is such an acute shortage of vaccines across the world. Read more from John's diary here. As we reported earlier, Israelhas been easinglockdown restrictions, following the success of its vaccination programme. Shops, libraries and museums are now allowed to open. People are now able to enter some tourist attractions such as zoos and theatres... ...as well as gyms and swimming pools. To be able to access these facilities, people are required to show a ""green passport"" (which is contained in an app), a certificate that can only be obtained once you have been vaccinated. Schools have also reopened, almost two months after they were closed because of the pandemic. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world. More than 49% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. We've been telling you about DJ Jo Whiley's sister Frances, who is in hospital with coronavirus. Jo says she was offered a vaccine ahead of her sister, who has learning disabilities and diabetes. Now, the charity Mencap is calling for everyone with learning disabilities to be prioritised for a vaccine. Chief executive, Edel Harris, told the BBC Frances' story ""is highlighting huge health inequalities"" that see 1,200 people with learning disabilities ""dying avoidably every year"". ""What Covid has done is shone a really bright light on this most important and most pressing issue,"" she says. ""We are urging the government and the JCVI to remove this arbitrary definition of severe and profound learning disability, because people who apparently fall into that category are in group six for the vaccination. We are just asking them to include all people with a learning disability as being a priority for a vaccination."" She says people who have learning disabilities are ""up to six times more likely to die if they contract Covid"" and going into hospital can be traumatic for them. The mayor of Nice would like to reduce the flow of tourists to his city for now The mayor of Nice says the southern city and its surrounding area need either a weekend lockdown or a local tightening of the nationwide curfew to combat coronavirus figures that are the worst in France. Christian Estrosi says visitors, including many from abroad, are still flocking to Nice and this needs to be suspended without restricting economic activity. ""The weather is nice, everybody rushes to come here. A
weekend lockdown would put a stop to that, without halting
economic activity in the city,"" he told French radio. ""We will be happy to receive lots of tourists this summer,
once we win this battle, but it is better to have a period while
we say 'do not come here, this is not the moment'."" The whole of France is already under a daily 12-hour curfew which starts at 18:00 (17:00 GMT). ""We need strong measures that go beyond the nationwide 6pm curfew, either a tighter curfew, or a partial and time-specific lockdown. A weekend lockdown would make sense,"" he says.

Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid beganThe figures suggest the decision to extend the furlough scheme has helped to prevent wider job losses.Business,"Some 292 British employers made plans to cut jobs in January, the lowest figure since the pandemic began. A total of 32,000 redundancies were proposed, up 9% on last January, despite new lockdown rules closing businesses across most of the UK. The figures suggest that the decision to extend the furlough scheme has helped to prevent wider job losses. The numbers were released by the Insolvency Service in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request. Employers planning 20 or more redundancies are obliged to notify the Insolvency Service at the start of the process by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. This gives an early indication of the state of the labour market ahead of the redundancy statistics published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which can be several months behind. The numbers for January showed that, in total, 32,000 jobs were described as at risk in those plans. It is the lowest figure since the start of the pandemic, excluding December, which usually sees less activity because of the Christmas holidays. This was despite lockdowns across almost all of the UK, which closed schools and many businesses including restaurants, bars and retailers deemed ""non-essential"". ""This seems to suggest that the extension of the furlough scheme from 31 October to 30 April has been effective in preventing another surge in job losses,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? Almost two million in UK 'have not worked for six months' The lockdown last spring led to the largest increase in redundancies on record, with about 150,000 jobs at risk of redundancy in June and July. The latest data from the ONS showed a record 395,000 redundancies in the period from September to November. But these figures appear with a time lag, as they are based on a survey asking people if they have been made redundant in the previous three months - so some of those jobs will have been lost as far back as July. ONS weekly estimates suggest redundancies peaked in September, and have since started to come down. As Insolvency Service figures only cover firms making 20 or more job cuts, the total number of redundancies made is usually larger. However, individual employers often make fewer jobs redundant than the number they initially notify. Firms in Northern Ireland notify the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and are not included in the Insolvency Service figures. Who are the millions of Britons not working?

Today's live page has been the work of: Jennifer Meierhans, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Alice Evans, Claire Heald and Sarah Collerton. Weâll be back with more on Monday â and we hope you can join us. As our live page draws to a close, hereâs a final round-up of the latest headlines from the UK and around the world today: Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The number of free ICU beds in Covid wards is dwindling across the country Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has signalled that more children may not begin to return to school on 1 March as promised, as the virus situation is so bad. It's been exacerbated by the spread of the UK variant and public non-compliance and widespread resignation. There are also problems with sourcing the antigen tests necessary to make it happen, after the prime minister said a tender to supply them should be cancelled over lack of transparency. Official figures show that in eight of the country's 14 regions, the number of free ICU beds in wards designated for Covid patients has fallen to single figures. The capital Prague - a city of 1.2 million people - currently has eight free ICU beds in Covid wards. Health Minister Jan Blatny says authorities may have to take drastic measures if the situation does not improve. According to the European Centre for Disease Control, the Czech Republic has had the highest number of new Covid cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous 14 days than any other country in the EU/EEA. According to Our World in Data, the country now has the fourth highest total number of Covid deaths per million inhabitants in the world. At 1,783 per million, it is more than the UK (1,776) or Italy (1,579). These graphs show the trajectory of the vaccination numbers in the UK as a steep incline, with more than 17.5m people receiving their first doses. Here are the daily coronavirus figures for the UK in graphs. They show the number of daily cases have fallen beneath the November high but are not yet lower than the peak during the first wave in March 2020. The number of patients in hospital is close to where we were at the height of the first wave and daily deaths are on their way down. The team is operating from a mobile vaccination unit Nearly 200 homeless people in Brighton have been given coronavirus vaccinations in the past fortnight as part of a drive to protect vulnerable communities. Arch Healthcare, a group which helps homeless people in the city, has carried out the programme and wants to vaccinate 1,000 people over eight weeks. Lead nurse Hannah Bishop said people experiencing homelessness have high levels of underlying health conditions, long-term conditions and mental health conditions which make it hard for them to access the mass vaccination sites. She said: ""We really believe it'sreally important for everybody to have access to this vaccine."" The team, operating from a mobile vaccination unit visiting key locations in the city, is working with St John Ambulance, Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust and homeless charity Justlife. A woman who turns 111 next month has had her coronavirus vaccine and is urging others to have theirs. May Willis, who lives in Bexhill, East Sussex, says: ""I've had my Covid jab and I think everyone should have it. It doesn't cost them anything and it helps to stop things spreading."" She says: ""Once lockdown is over and we can go back to the things we love doing I shall love to look forward to go back and see my friends."" And what's her secret to living to a ripe old age? No smoking, no alcohol and plenty of chocolate... This video can not be played 'I'm almost 111 and I make the most of what I've got' The vaccine shipment entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt A shipment of 20,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Gaza, donated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Health officials in the territory said they would begin vaccination on Monday. Gaza received 2,000 doses of the vaccine from the Palestinian Authority last week, but this new delivery is reported to have been organised by a former senior Palestinian official, Mohammad Dahlan, who now lives in the UAE. He was forced out of the territory a decade ago after clashing with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Gaza is
controlled by the Palestinian leader's Islamist Hamas rivals. Analysts say it's an attempt to score points ahead of a planned Palestinian election later this year. Gaza has registered more than 54,000 cases with 543 deaths,external. Palestinians have had little access to coronavirus vaccines, in contrast with Israel, which is easing lockdown restrictions after inoculating almost half its population. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme is ""ahead of schedule,"" health officials have said, after Boris Johnson announced new UK-wide targets of offeringall UK adults a first dose of vaccine by the end of July. The previous target was September for first dose completion, but the PM has now said it should ""go further and faster"" to help ease lockdown rules. Stormont's Department of Health said itsplans were dependent on supply. The UK's devolved nations each have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations and have different lockdown rules and vaccination programmes. Northern Ireland's programme started well and by Friday of last week, just over 23% of the local population had received their first dose of vaccine. However, that figure was slightly behind other parts of the UK, with Wales leading at 26.8%; Scotland second at 25.7%; and England third at 25.4%. A firm is being investigated by the UK medical regulator after it was awarded a Â£30m contract during the pandemic. Alex Bourne - who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home in West Suffolk - made vials for Covid testing through his firm Hinpack, which had no history of medical goods. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed it is now investigating the company. Mr Hancock has previously said he had nothing to do with the contract. The MHRA said it took ""all reports of non-compliance very seriously"". The Guardian reported,externalMr Bourne had offered his services to the government via a personal WhatsApp message to the health secretary, saying they had known each other for years. The businessman told the newspaper that messages had been exchanged between the pair over several months, but he said there was ""no evidence"" he was given preferential treatment by theDepartment of Health and Social Care because of the connection. Mademoiselle Desserts makes large round cakes that are sold on to wholesalers and mostly end up sliced in coffee shops, restaurants and garden centre cafes - but production is on hold due to lockdown. Its three UK sites are running at about 10-15% of pre-pandemic activity, with many staff furloughed. Its UK managing director, Nigel Taylor, is keenly awaitingPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcementof how restrictions will be eased on Monday. He says getting enough notice ahead of a definite restart for hospitality is crucial so he can restock ingredients that can take weeks to arrive from abroad. Wholesaler Bidfood, which supplies meals to care homes, pubs and restaurants, is also awaiting news of when the hospitality industry can reopen. Its chief executive, Andrew Selley, says: ""It's not just a case of turning on a switch and providing the product. ""The customers have to plan what menus they want to offer and they have to tell us what volumes they're expecting, based on what the government is saying the regulations are going to be.""

A further 215 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,daily figures,externalfrom the government show.

Claims made for RAF sonic boom 'household damage'Homes were shaken across eastern England after RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept a plane.Essex,"RAF Typhoons, similar to the aircraft pictured, took off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and escorted the civilian aircraft to London Stansted Airport Claims for damage to a household TV and roof tiles have been made after a sonic boom was caused by RAF Typhoons that were intercepting a private plane. The Typhoons""safely escorted""the civilian aircraft to Stansted Airport in Essex on 12 January. Six damage claims have been made to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after the boom was heard across eastern England. An RAF spokesman said compensation could be paid ""subject to the provision of supporting evidence"". ""The RAF is responsible for policing UK airspace and would prefer not to cause any disturbance to those on the ground, however, the safety and security of the nation remains paramount,"" he said. This video can not be played People's reaction to the sonic boom was caught on camera The RAF Typhoons were authorised to fly at supersonic speed when they were deployed from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept the private jet. That aircraft was believed to have been flying from Germany to Birmingham and had lost communications - sparking an alert. The boom, at about 13:05 GMT, was reported across social media by people in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and parts of London. It led the RAF tooffer a ""helping hand""to those home-schooling by sharing a lesson on sonic booms. Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the MoD said it ""received notification of six claims"", three of which were from people in Essex, although the locations of the other three were not specified. ""The alleged damage is to windows (two claims), dislodged roof tiles (two claims), a television and a wall picture,"" the MoD said. It added: ""The MoD has not settled any claims arising from the sonic incident on 12 January 2021."" The RAF video explains how supersonic aeroplanes cause sonic booms When an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has ""nowhere to escape"", saidDr Jim Wild of Lancaster University. A sonic boom happens when that air ""escapes"", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap. The speed of sound varies. It is about 770mph (1,200km/h) at sea level, but slower at higher altitudes. A plane flying at 30,000ft would reach the speed of sound at about 675mph (1,085km/h), according toNASA's educational website,external. It can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake of a boat spreading out behind the vessel. RAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic over populated areas in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft.
