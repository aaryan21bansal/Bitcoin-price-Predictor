Alabama hunt for missing prison inmate and guard,"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicki White - the pair are not related US police are searching for an escaped inmate who is facing murder charges, and a guard who may have helped him. Inmate Casey White and corrections officer Vicki White were last seen on Friday morning at the Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office in Alabama. Ms White said she was taking him to a mental evaluation, but officials later realised it had not been scheduled. Police now believe Ms White helped orchestrate the escape and have issued a warrant for her arrest. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton noted that Ms White had sold her house about a month ago and had ""talked about going to the beach"". Friday - the day the pair went missing - was supposed to be her final day at work. Despite their matching surnames, the pair are not related. Authorities say Casey White should be considered ""armed and extremely dangerous"" - in part because he may now have access to the officer's gun. Mr Singleton said Ms White left the detention centre with the prisoner at about 09:30 CDT (15:30 BST). She had told after colleagues she was going to drop him at the courthouse for a mental health evaluation. Ms White said she would then get some medical attention because she was not feeling well, Sheriff Singleton added. Authorities now believe this appointment was not real and formed part of the escape plan. Shortly after 11:00 someone found her vehicle in a shopping centre car park. At about 15:30 officials realised the prisoner had not been returned to custody, and no one could contact the officer. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton said that authorities believe the escape was ""orchestrated"", and that Ms White participated, although the exact circumstances remain unclear. ""Whether she did that willingly or was coerced somehow, we're not really sure,"" he said. Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office released this image of Casey White, who is 6ft 9in tall, saying it is the most recent photo of him The warrant against Ms White is for first-degree permitting of facilitating escape. The US Marshals Serviceis offering a reward,externalof up to $10,000 (Â£7,950) for information leading to Casey White's recapture and the location of Vicki White. Mr Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised police officers to not ""take any chances"" with him. ""He has nothing to lose,"" he added. ""I will emphasize as much as I can: we're concerned about everybody."" Ms White has been with the department for about 25 years. She is the assistant director of corrections, and part of her role involves arranging courthouse transportation. Her decision to take the prisoner to the courthouse by herself violated policy, he explained, as someone charged with such a severe crime would normally be accompanied by two deputies. Authorities are now reviewing video footage and phone calls to determine whether she had a relationship with Casey White before the escape took place. Sheriff Singleton had previously said Ms White had been voted employee of the year several times and was an ""exemplary employee"". ""This is not the Vicki White we know, by any stretch of the imagination,"" he said on Monday. In an interview with Alabama network WAAY-TV on Monday, Ms White's mother appealed for her to daughter to come home. She said that her daughter had been living with her for the past five weeks since selling her home, adding that she had never before heard of the inmate she is now accused of aiding. ""I never heard of him, never seen his picture, nothing. I didn't know anything about him,"" she said. Casey White, 38, was charged with two counts of capital murder in September 2020 over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway, according to the US Marshals Service. The US federal law enforcement agency said he was already serving time for a series of crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft, and a police chase. He confessed to the murder and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. White has planned to escape from prison before, Sheriff Singleton told ABC News. But officials found out about the plan - which involved taking a hostage - before he could attempt it in 2020.

Anne Robinson to step down from Countdown,"Anne Robinson on the set of Channel 4's Countdown with Rachel Riley (left) and Susie Dent Anne Robinson is stepping down as the host of Channel 4 quiz show Countdown after a year. The former Weakest Link presenter, 77, joined the daytime staple in 2021, becoming its sixth presenter and the first woman to take the role. She said she had a ""blast"" hosting the show but it was now time for ""an older woman to take the reins"". Robinson, who recorded 265 episodes, will appear in shows until the summer, Channel 4 said. Anne Robinson on Countdown and cancel culture She said she had enjoyed hosting the ""wonderful show"" but had ""stayed longer than I signed up for"". Robinson added: ""I hope too I've encouraged TV bosses to realise that not all women at the wrong end of their 70s are in care homes playing bingo and watching conjuring tricks. ""In fact the genius of Countdown is that it's a brilliant way to keep the brain exercised. I run 5km most days of the week. ""And I can now do an anagram at twice the speed I could this time last year. ""But I have grandchildren, a large garden and a home in New York, all deserving more of my attention."" She joined mathematician Rachel Riley and lexicographer Susie Dent in an all female line-up on the daytime show, with her first instalment broadcast on 28 June. Robinson in her role as host on The Weakest Link Robinson followed in the footsteps of Richard Whiteley, Des Lynam, Des O'Connor, Jeff Stelling and Nick Hewer as the presenter of Countdown, which launched in 1982. A show spokesperson said: ""Quick-witted Anne has been a brilliant host on this iconic show."" A former journalist, Robinson became known for her trademark-style of delivering cutting remarks to contestants when she presented Weakest Link, which ran from 2000 until 2012.

EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy,"Energy costs have risen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine European Union countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence on Russian energy supplies. While sanctions have been applied to other areas of business, the EU remains heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas. Germany's economic minister said the country would be able to weather a Russian oil ban by the end of 2022, as he appeared to back tougher sanctions. However, Hungary has said it opposes such a move, stating it would not back measures that could endanger supplies. EU ministers met on Monday to discuss how to manage the situation, under intense pressure to reduce the revenue stream supporting President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. There are two main challenges faced by members states - how to pay for Russian energy in a way which doesn't breach or undermine EU sanctions, and also how to source and develop alternative supplies to move away from reliance on Russia. At a press conference on Monday, the EU's energy policy chief Kadri Simson said Russia halting gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria had strengthened the bloc's will to become independent of Russian fossil fuels. Butaccording to the Centre of Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA),external, the EU has imported about Â£37bn worth of fossil fuels since the conflict began. The two largest importers worldwide were Germany followed by Italy. Energy giant Gazprom stopped gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria last week after those countries refused to comply with Russian demands to switch to payment in roubles, and many other member countries are set to face the same issue around mid-May. Poland and Bulgaria had planned to stop using Russian gas this year and say they can cope with the stoppage, but it has raised fears that other EU countries, including Europe's gas-reliant economic powerhouse Germany, could be next. Ms Simson repeated the European Commission's view on Monday that paying for gas in roubles would be a ""violation"" of sanctions and ""cannot be accepted."" She said member states were building up gas storage supplies before winter. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC it was ""pretty clear"" that the EU wanted to ""pivot away"" from Russian oil and gas, but added the lack of unity was being caused by the ""ability to actually make that happen"". Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, which is also the bloc's main oil supplier, but some countries are more dependent Russian fossil fuels than others, so sudden supply cuts could have huge economic impact. For example, Germany currently gets about 25% of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia, Slovakia and Hungary received 96% and 58% respectively of their oil imports from Russia last year, according to the International Energy Agency. Germany's economic minister Robert Habeck said his country had ""managed to reach a situation where Germany is able to bear an oil embargo"" and was ""on course to do the same for gas"". ""Other countries need a bit more time,"" he added. Diplomatic sources told the BBC that compromises to a complete bloc ban were being looked at, particularly for countries such as Hungary and Slovakia. Mr Piper said with oil, there were more options to get alternative supplies, compared to gas, which is transported most commonly through pipelines. He added it is also ""trickier"" for landlocked EU states to find new sources. He also warned while Germany might move to ban oil, switching off its Russian gas - which makes up 40% of its total imports - would ""take them years"". ""Russia could go 'if you want to go after our oil, how about we reduce our gas',"" he added. ""They could push up the price, reduce the volumes. They have a lot of bargaining power."" Elsewhere, energy research institute EWI said Germany should limit gas use now to prepare for the possibility of a future cut-off from Russia. Uniper, one of Germany's biggest energy firms, also warned an EU ban on Russian oil could prompt Russia to halt westward gas flows. The company said last weekit would pay in euros which will be converted into roubles,meeting the Kremlin's demand for all transactions to be made in the Russian currency. ""We consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Other European energy firms are reportedly preparing to do the same amid concerns about supply cuts. In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles to prop up its currency after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. Who's paying for Russian gas in roubles? The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Some countries are looking to turn to liquified natural gas (LNG), with the US agreeing to ship an additional 15 billion cubic metres to Europe by the end of the year. The US has already banned Russian oil imports and the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year. The EU has previously laid out a strategy to make it independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030, which includes greater use of greener sources of power.

Ukraine hunts for Bucha perpetrators,"Mass graves were discovered in Bucha after Russian troops left Ukraine has launched a hunt for 10 Russian soldiers accused of war crimes in Bucha - the town outside of the capital Kyiv where civilians were tortured, raped and murdered. The Ministry of Defence - which shared pictures of the soldiers - described them as ""the despicable 10"". Prosecutors say they are being investigated for ""premeditated murder"". They are also accused of holding innocent civilians hostage, beating them and looting homes. Moscow has denied any crimes were committed in Bucha, which was under the control of the 64th motorised infantry brigade for more than a month at the start of the war. Russia's President Vladimir Putin gave the brigade an honorary title - recognising what he says was ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage"" - on its return home. But in the time the brigade controlled Bucha, hundreds were killed. A mass grave was discovered at the church after the town's liberation, while bodies had been left lining the streets where they fell. Thousands of war crimes were documented by investigators. One of those who survived, Vitaliy Zhyvotovskyi, recalled the screams he heard to news agency AFP. ""We had no hope,"" he said, remembering how they used to tremble ""not because of the cold, but due to fear because we could hear what the Russians did to the captives"". On Thursday, Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova announced they had identified the 10 suspects in particular, sharing pictures of the young men. In a Facebook post, she explained they ""are suspected of cruel treatment of civilians and other violations of laws and customs of war"". ""The suspects will be declared wanted in order to detain them and bring them to justice,"" the statement added, appealing for any other information. Stephen Wilkinson, the manager of the Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre in Sweden, points out that the chance of a successful prosecution is quite low if they are in Russia. However, the 64th motorised infantry brigade is now back Ukraine, having moved east to Izium - on the frontline of the battle for the Donbas region. According to reports, it has suffered heavy losses. If the 10 are still with the brigade - and still alive - it is not impossible they will be found and tried. Indeed, back in 2014, Ukraine successfully prosecuted two Russian soldiers for ""terrorism"" after they were captured in the east. They were later handed back to Russia in a prisoner exchange. ""Domestic prosecutions are often the best and quickest way,"" Mr Wilkinson adds, despite the focus on international mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The fact they are ""foot soldiers"" rather than commanders may also make prosecution easier, Mr Wilkinson says - although ""that doesn't remove the need to look into criminal responsibility of the commanders"". This video can not be played Watch: UN chief stands outside destroyed buildings near Kyiv, calling the war ""an absurdity in the 21st century"" However, there are elements of the Ukrainians fight for justice which have raised some cause for concern for Mr Wilkinson. In particular, the way the photos have been distributed online. ""Even if you know there is strong evidence, the law states innocent until proven guilty. What about a free and fair trial? There is a lot of emotion behind this. I would say it puts it at risk, although doesn't fundamentally undermine it."" It has also emerged that an earlier list of the brigade released by Ukrainian authorities may have included a number of names of people from Tajikistan who were no longer serving in the unit. ""It is not known how many Tajiks in the brigade were in Ukraine, but eight Tajiks, whose names were mentioned in the list, and their relatives claim that they were not there,"" Radio Liberty's Tajik Service Ozodi said. None of the names mentioned match the list released on Thursday.

EU accuses Apple over contactless payments,"The US tech giant denies it is stifling competition The European Commission has accused Apple of abusing its market position for contactless smartphone payments. In a preliminary finding, it said the US company may have broken competition law by preventing rivals from accessing its ""tap and go"" technology. Apple denies the charge and has promised to engage with the Commission. If the charges are upheld, it could be fined up to 10% of its global turnover of $36.6bn (Â£29.2bn) based on its revenue last year. ""We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple's devices,"" EU Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. ""We preliminarily found that Apple may have restricted competition, to the benefit of its own solution Apple Pay,"" the EU official who is in charge of competition policy said. Accordingto the Commission,,externalthis behaviour from Apple has an ""exclusionary effect"" on competitors and ""leads to less innovation and less choice for consumers for mobile wallets on iPhones"". In response, the tech giant said its payment system was only one of many options available to European consumers. It added that it had ""ensured equal access"" to mobile payment technology, while ""setting industry-leading standards"" for privacy and security.

""We will continue to engage with the Commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment."" However, the EU antitrust regulators said their investigation had not found ""any evidence"" that would point to a more open design posing a ""higher security risk"". ""On the contrary, evidence on our file indicates that Apple's conduct cannot be justified by security concerns,"" Ms Vestager said. The Commission also accused Apple anti-competitive practices dating back to 2015 when it launched Apple Pay. More than 2,500 banks in Europe use Apple Pay and Apple smartphones represent around a third of the market across Europe. Next year, the EU plans to implement new rules for technology firms, detailed in its Digital Markets Act. EU regulators also charged Apple last year, accusing the firm of distorting competition in music streaming markets after rival company Spotify lodged a complaint.

O'Sullivan wins record-equalling seventh world title,"This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan wins record-equalling seventh World Snooker Championship title Ronnie O'Sullivan claimed his seventh World Championship title with an 18-13 win over Judd Trump to equal Stephen Hendry's record in the modern era. O'Sullivan, 46, becomes the oldest world champion in Crucible history, eclipsing Ray Reardon, who won his sixth title aged 45 in 1978. Trump won six of Monday afternoon's eight frames to battle back to 14-11. But O'Sullivan sealed his victory and the Â£500,000 top prize as he took four of the evening's first six frames. Reaction: O'Sullivan claims record-equalling seventh world title The 'Rocket' enjoyed runs of 82, 88, 75, and 85 - and shared an emotional embrace with Trump, which lasted more than a minute, at the end of the match before greeting his children who ran into the arena to share his special moment. O'Sullivan's triumph will add more fuel to any debate over who is the greatest snooker player of all time. The Englishman has now won 39 ranking titles, holds almost every major record in the game and will finish the season as the world's top ranked player. Asked about emulating Hendry's record at the Crucible, which was set in 1999, O'Sullivan told BBC Sport: ""We can share it for a year. I tried to be as relaxed as I could, but that is probably the greatest result I've had against somebody like Judd [Trump]. ""I've never bothered about records. When you get them, it's kind of nice. I don't have targets. I've loved every tournament this year, I've just loved playing. ""I like to win, but it's not the be-all and end-all. The Crucible brings out the worst in me. It's probably not the best idea but we'll probably go again next year."" This video can not be played 'He's the greatest player in the world' - watch O'Sullivan's best shots from final Despite having a significant seven-frame lead overnight, O'Sullivan's success was far from a formality, with Trump staging a superb fightback on Monday afternoon to claw a 12-5 deficit back to 14-11. It saw O'Sullivan lose his first session of the Championship as Trump, who had toiled badly on Sunday, produced his best form of the final to eye the second biggest turnaround in Crucible history - after Dennis Taylor's famous revival from 8-0 down to win the 1985 final against Steve Davis. A wonderful 107 was a highlight as he took five of the day's first six frames and he applied further pressure with a sublime 105 after benefitting from a fluked red. But in front of a raucous Crucible crowd, O'Sullivan immediately eased any pressure on himself as play got under way in the evening with several sizeable contributions after errors from Trump, who had adopted a policy of all-out attack. Trump, however, did deliver another moment of Crucible history with a record-breaking 109th century of the tournament - fittingly, with a clearance of 109 - to close the gap to 17-13, before O'Sullivan clinically rounded off his triumph in style. ""I was just glad to make a match out of it,"" Trump said. ""It's been a pleasure to share a table with him. ""It's an amazing achievement and he's the best player of all time - he keeps getting better and better. His determination and dedication are clear to see. He's been the best player in this tournament by quite a distance."" Six-time champion Steve Davis He's playing in a field of players far stronger than in previous generations and that's why he's needed more years to maybe match Stephen Hendry's seven titles. The longevity of his career is incredible because it didn't happen for me and it didn't happen for Stephen either. I think it is remarkable what he has achieved. There have been peaks and troughs along the way personally and professionally, but he has done brilliantly well to cope with everything. He is the person everyone wants to ask questions of, but he has the talent. The pressure he withstands is astonishing. The word 'genius' is bandied around a lot but he is a true genius of the game, and I think he has an eighth world title in him.

More than 2,500 banks in Europe use Apple Pay and Apple smartphones represent around a third of the market across Europe.

Stars voice anger over Cinderella closure,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, starring Carrie Hope Fletcher as Cinderella, opened last August Cinderella cast members have expressed their frustration after finding out the musical's West End run was cancelled on social media. Andrew Lloyd Webber's show will end on 12 June, it was announced on Sunday. But some cast members said they read the news on social media or news outlets before being told themselves. Lord Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group said efforts were made to ""ensure that the message was distributed as widely as possible as quickly as possible"". The theatre impresario said he was ""incredibly proud"" of the show but has not yet personally commented on the complaints about how the announcement was handled. No official reason was given for the show's early closure, but the Cinderella website says anyone with tickets for performances after 12 June would not lose their money. The cast of Cinderella were told about the show's early closure on Sunday afternoon, following a matinee performance. A message was thensent out to the show's actors and crew,externalwith producers thanking them for their ""immeasurable contribution to the show"" and confirming a statement was was being made to the press shortly. This video can not be played Cinderella opens in the West End, but it's not what you're expecting However, some cast members, including the show's star Carrie Hope Fletcher, were absent from Sunday's matinee performance, which meant the story began to appear in the press before all performers had heard the news. ""I wasn't in the show today and I was only informed via other cast members and a member of the music team,"" Fletcher wrote on Instagram. ""I had no official call from the company to let me know before it was posted online."" Furthermore, Cinderella - written by The Crown star Emerald Fennell - was due to welcome a new cast in the coming weeks. While many members of the current company were told in person, actors from the incoming cast complained that they were not informed at all. Allow Twitter content?

In a 164-minute video on Instagram,,externalactress Summer Strallen discussed the situation in detail, saying that, while her agent received an email, she ""basically got fired by social media, which is just not OK"". She said she recently had a wig fitting ahead of her taking over the role of The Queen from Rebecca Trehearn, and claimed she only found out the show was cancelled when a friend sent her an article on Sunday. Speaking later to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she added people working in theatre ""feel so disposable"" and she feared being ""blacklisted"" for her Instagram video. ""I just feel so strongly that it's so unfair, not just to the cast but also the front-of-house staff, the backstage crew and the musicians. There has been no regard for that at all,"" she said. The Really Useful Group, which is owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber and produces, licenses and promotes his shows, said it had made efforts to inform actors prior to the announcement, some via their agents. However, on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend, many agents would not have been checking their work emails, several actors pointed out on Twitter. In a statement to BBC News, a spokesperson for the Really Useful Group said: ""The entire company working yesterday were told in person after the matinee performance. There was no evening performance so this was not before a show last night. ""At the same time as the company were told, everyone not present was called or emailed by the wider RUG team. Every effort was made to ensure that the message was distributed as widely as possible as quickly as possible but clearly we had to move quickly as news was getting out on social media."" Andrew Lloyd Webber said he would risk arrest to put on Cinderella amid a row over lockdown rules in England last year Lord Lloyd Webber has not personally commented on the way the announcement was handled, but in his initial statement he said he was ""incredibly proud of Cinderella"". ""Not only did it get some of the best reviews of my career, but we led the charge to reopen the West End, ensuring that theatre and live entertainment remained relevant and in the news,"" he said. The composer thanked ""everyone involved"" in the show, adding that it would now be revamped ahead of a Broadway transfer in March 2023. But the disappointment and outrage from stars continued on social media over the following hours. Carrie Hope Fletcher plays the title role in Cinderella - described by critics as having a ""snappy contemporary edge"" Strictly Come Dancing finalist and TV chef John Whaite said he was due to join the cast in July and take over the role of Prince Charming and that the cancellation was ""heartbreaking"".

O'Sullivan wins record-equalling seventh world titleRonnie O'Sullivan claims his seventh World Championship title with an 18-13 win over Judd Trump to equal Stephen Hendry's record in the modern era.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan wins record-equalling seventh World Snooker Championship title Ronnie O'Sullivan claimed his seventh World Championship title with an 18-13 win over Judd Trump to equal Stephen Hendry's record in the modern era. O'Sullivan, 46, becomes the oldest world champion in Crucible history, eclipsing Ray Reardon, who won his sixth title aged 45 in 1978. Trump won six of Monday afternoon's eight frames to battle back to 14-11. But O'Sullivan sealed his victory and the Â£500,000 top prize as he took four of the evening's first six frames. Reaction: O'Sullivan claims record-equalling seventh world title The 'Rocket' enjoyed runs of 82, 88, 75, and 85 - and shared an emotional embrace with Trump, which lasted more than a minute, at the end of the match before greeting his children who ran into the arena to share his special moment. O'Sullivan's triumph will add more fuel to any debate over who is the greatest snooker player of all time. The Englishman has now won 39 ranking titles, holds almost every major record in the game and will finish the season as the world's top ranked player. Asked about emulating Hendry's record at the Crucible, which was set in 1999, O'Sullivan told BBC Sport: ""We can share it for a year. I tried to be as relaxed as I could, but that is probably the greatest result I've had against somebody like Judd [Trump]. ""I've never bothered about records. When you get them, it's kind of nice. I don't have targets. I've loved every tournament this year, I've just loved playing. ""I like to win, but it's not the be-all and end-all. The Crucible brings out the worst in me. It's probably not the best idea but we'll probably go again next year."" This video can not be played 'He's the greatest player in the world' - watch O'Sullivan's best shots from final Despite having a significant seven-frame lead overnight, O'Sullivan's success was far from a formality, with Trump staging a superb fightback on Monday afternoon to claw a 12-5 deficit back to 14-11. It saw O'Sullivan lose his first session of the Championship as Trump, who had toiled badly on Sunday, produced his best form of the final to eye the second biggest turnaround in Crucible history - after Dennis Taylor's famous revival from 8-0 down to win the 1985 final against Steve Davis. A wonderful 107 was a highlight as he took five of the day's first six frames and he applied further pressure with a sublime 105 after benefitting from a fluked red. But in front of a raucous Crucible crowd, O'Sullivan immediately eased any pressure on himself as play got under way in the evening with several sizeable contributions after errors from Trump, who had adopted a policy of all-out attack. Trump, however, did deliver another moment of Crucible history with a record-breaking 109th century of the tournament - fittingly, with a clearance of 109 - to close the gap to 17-13, before O'Sullivan clinically rounded off his triumph in style. ""I was just glad to make a match out of it,"" Trump said. ""It's been a pleasure to share a table with him. ""It's an amazing achievement and he's the best player of all time - he keeps getting better and better. His determination and dedication are clear to see. He's been the best player in this tournament by quite a distance."" Six-time champion Steve Davis He's playing in a field of players far stronger than in previous generations and that's why he's needed more years to maybe match Stephen Hendry's seven titles. The longevity of his career is incredible because it didn't happen for me and it didn't happen for Stephen either. I think it is remarkable what he has achieved. There have been peaks and troughs along the way personally and professionally, but he has done brilliantly well to cope with everything. He is the person everyone wants to ask questions of, but he has the talent. The pressure he withstands is astonishing. The word 'genius' is bandied around a lot but he is a true genius of the game, and I think he has an eighth world title in him.

'Children drank rainwater from puddles to survive'Yuliia ran under gunfire from her bunker to the nearest well so her daughters could get fresh water.Wales,"This video can not be played Nataliia Roberts is trying to help a childhood friend Hearing how her best friend's children were drinking rainwater from puddles to survive the war in Ukraine is why Nataliia Roberts wants her in the UK. Yuliia and her three daughters used to run out of their basement shelter in the besieged city of Mariupol after it'd rained as they were so thirsty. It wasn't just the basics of water and food, there was no toilet, shower or electricity in their refuge from bombs. Nataliia now wants her childhood friend with her in the sanctuary of Wales. ""We had a small bowl [of soup] for three kids once per day,"" explained Yuliia. ""And one glass of water for three kids to clean themselves."" Mariupol civilians taken to both sides' territory Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? In maps: Slow Russian advance continues in the east After her home was destroyed by Russian bombs, Yuliia and her daughters - aged 11, six and three - had to find sanctuary in a communal basement which offered some shelter but she barely had any food to feed the children. ""The kids were asking for food so much, that's why she tried to feed them at bed time, so they felt full before bed,"" said worried friend Nataliia, watching on from her home in north Wales. Two of Yuliia's children get some escapism as they watch a video on their mum's phone in their underground bunker ""When it started to rain first of all they were able to drink from the puddle and that water was so, so, tasty. Then they found some pans to fill with water."" Yuliia eventually had to leave her children hiding as she went to look for fresh water. Yuliia and her family were happily enjoying life just months ago ""There was a well three kilometres [two miles] away. I had to run there under gunfire, under bombs,"" Yuliia recalls in a video diary for theBBC Wales Investigatesprogramme. And when her middle daughter became unwell, there were no medicines. The port city of Mariupol has been encircled by Russian troops since the start of March Yuliia had to take refuge in an underground bunker after their apartment in Mariupol was destroyed by Russian bombs ""I had money but I couldn't buy anything because there was nothing anywhere, everything was broken, everything was looted and destroyed,"" she said. Yuliia and Nataliia, who moved from Ukraine to Wales to be with her husband Dewi five years ago, have been close friends since school and had always kept in touch - until war broke out in Ukraine in February. Nataliia speaks to Yuliia as often as she can to support her friend 2,000 miles away For days, sometimes weeks, it wasn't safe for Yuliia to text or call her friend 2,000 miles away. Nataliia had to make do with Yuliia's intermittent video diary updates from her underground bunker with her girls while her husband fought the Russians on the front line. Yuliia and her three daughters hid out in their underground refuge for several weeks The 32-year-old accountant has managed to get her mum and stepdad out of eastern Ukraine when the situation began to escalate and Liudmyla and Sasha now live with Nataliia, husband Dewi, four-year-old Julia and Jacob, one, in the safety of Caernarfon. Now Nataliia can't just look on as her friend struggles and is doing everything she can to help Yuliia and her young family become Ukrainian refugees in Wales. Yuliia and her daughters are desperate to join their family friend Nataliia in north Wales Yuliia and her girls are among11 million Ukrainians forced to fleetheir homes before they eventually escaped Mariupol, under fire - weeks before the start of the United Nations-ledevacuation from the strategically significant city. The port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled since the start of March, is now mostly under the control of Russian forces - although several hundred Ukrainian troops remain in the Azovstal metal works factory in the south of the city. Russian forces have blockaded the sprawling industrial complex and are continuing their aerial bombardment of it, but no attempt has been made yet to clear Ukrainian troops from a network of tunnels beneath the factory. Russia has been accused of war crimes for its intense shelling of the city, with the local mayor saying at least 20,000 civilians have been killed. More than 100,000 people remain trapped in the city. By train and then minibus, they headed for Poland, not knowing when they'd see her husband again, or whether they'd be able to join Nataliia and her family in Wales. But it is the sights of war that are leaving their mark on Yulia. Nataliia Roberts and her mum Liudmyla share a cup of tea in Nataliia's home in Caernarfon ""She did see dead people in Mariupol, the ones who were killed by rockets who had no hands, no legs, whose bodies were destroyed,"" said Nataliia. ""I would love to have Yuliia here in Wales. I was dreaming that one day we will have a cup of tea in our dining room altogether and they can see our life here and have a more happy life. I just would love it."" Ukraine - the narrative the West doesn't hear Why has Putin invaded Ukraine - what does he want? The Mariupol street strewn with bodies About 27,000 Ukrainian refugees - out of the 86,000 approved visas - are in the UK and Wales has said itwants to be a ""nation of sanctuary"" for thosefleeing the horrors of war in their home-land. About 10,000 Welsh households had offered homes to Ukrainian refugees but by the end of last month, the Home Office had issued 2,300 visas for those wanting to come to Wales. The Welsh government has sponsored nearly 700 visa applications so far, but couldn't tell BBC Wales Investigates how many refugees had arrived in Wales, insisting it has asked the UK government for the data but been told it's unavailable. The Home Office said it is working ""as fast as it can"" to provide the information for the devolved governments, adding more than 86,000 visas have been granted under various schemes and is simplifying forms and boosting staff numbers to speed up applications.

"Businesses need post-Covid loan help, say experts","Microfinance can be vital in keeping small businesses afloat Businesses who are struggling post-pandemic need better access to small loans, experts say. Charity Purple Shoots said it had helped companies that might struggle to get finance from big banks. Business specialist Prof Dylan Jones-Evans said the Welsh government's development bank should offer more help to these businesses. The Welsh government said it was committed to giving financial aid to small business. Microfinance is the lending of relatively small amounts, often to small businesses or sole-traders. Banks usually focus on bigger loans but these little ones can allow firms to make small but meaningful improvements. Black and multi-racial business owners on the hurdles they face Covid: Â£35m given to help small businesses recover Businesses face clean-up costs for dumped rubbish After starting a candle business online during the pandemic, Nicky Stephenson decided to open a gift shop in Newbridge. Purple Shoots lent her money for display cases. Ms Stephenson was hesitant to call the charity. Nicky Stephenson needed money for cabinets when she opened a shop ""I was thinking that it would be another 'no' once I had filled out all the forms and everything,"" she said. But Purple Shoots boss Karen Davies approved a loan to help Ms Stephenson's business in its new home. Ms Stephenson said: ""Everybody else had said no, we were at our wits end. ""I can honestly say if it wasn't for Purple Shoots and that little bit of investment that they gave to us, we wouldn't be open today. ""So I'm eternally grateful for the help that they gave."" Ms Davies started Purple Shoots in Pontypridd in 2014 to help people start businesses. ""I had been in the financial services industry for most of my working life and had been frustrated by the number of people that weren't funded by those institutions,"" she said. ""Usually it was because they had been out of work a long time, didn't have any money to put in or maybe had a bad credit score. Those people were targeted by Purple Shoots. It has since helped small businesses across Wales. Purple Shoots boss Karen Davies approved a loan to help The Welsh government's Development Bank of Wales also offers small loans and so do some banks. But University of South Wales entrepreneurship expert Prof Jones-Evans, said the Welsh government's bank could play a bigger role in the microfinance market. ""There's no point in a publicly-owned bank competing with the high street banks to fund businesses,"" he said. ""Their role should be to fill the market gaps, and this is a massive market gap. ""Now, to be fair, there is some funding that goes towards some microbusinesses in Wales. ""But the problem is far bigger than that."" Prof Jones-Evans said many companies would not need hundreds of thousands of pounds but perhaps between Â£5,000 and Â£20,000. ""Just to make those differences to the businesses that makes them competitive and enables them to make that contribution to the economy and society,"" he said. The Welsh government said it provided advice, support and finance to small businesses. Prof Dylan Jones-Evans said the Welsh government had a role in plugging a microfinance market gap It said its development bank played an important role in supporting Wales' economy and it had launched a Â£30m microloan fund in 2019. This provided loans from Â£1,000 to Â£50,000. A spokesman said: ""As of February 2022, DBW's (Development Bank of Wales) Wales microloan fund has supported 660 businesses, investing Â£14.5m directly and attracting over Â£4.3m of further private sector funds. ""The fund has created and safeguarded over 2,600 jobs, while also supporting 200 start-ups.""

Olympian Coxsey defends climbing during pregnancy,"Coxsey missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics Britain's most decorated elite climber Shauna Coxsey has defended her decision to continue the sport while pregnant. The 29-year-old, who retired from competitive climbing after the sport's Olympic debut in Tokyo, is 38 weeks pregnant with her first child. But her choice has led to some criticism on social media. ""Everyone assesses risk differently and I think people perceive me climbing as risky when I am actually climbing so well within my comfort zone,"" she said. Speaking to Radio 5 Live, she added: ""It feels way more risky for me to walk down the street. I feel much more likely to trip over on a bumpy road than I do to go up an easy climbing wall."" Coxsey created history in Tokyo as Britain's first competitor in the sport and finished 10th overall after being hampered by a back injury. Allow Instagram content?

The double World Championship bronze medallist has been involved in the sport since she was three years old. ""If I don't climb for a week or so, my body feels quite clunky and everything gets a bit achy,"" she added. ""As soon as I get back on that wall and start stretching and moving again, my body feels more connected and good and strong and also my mental health as well. ""I can't imagine stopping if I didn't need to and I haven't needed to and it feels great. I've been really fortunate. ""I wouldn't put my baby in danger. People think I might be able to fall and land on my stomach - which is something I have never ever done or seen happen before. ""For me to share a bit and communicate how I have gone about this pregnancy and say it is possible to keep climbing in a safe way has been really important. ""It's frustrating that other women are getting this judgement and choosing to give up something that they love and are comfortable with because of the fear of judgement.

Safe passage for civilians to leave Mariupol under way - UN,"An operation to evacuate civilians trapped in a steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol is under way, the UN says The Ukrainian president says a group of about 100 people have left and should arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow An evacuation plan for residents from other parts of Mariupol has been postponed until Monday morning The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has led a Congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky She promises American support ""until the fight is done"" and says Congress will move quickly to approve $33bn in aid for Ukraine Russian troops controlling the city of Kherson say the rouble will be used there from Sunday Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer Reuters saw civilians from Mariupol arriving in the Donetsk region earlier today We have moved our live page for technical reasons -please follow us at this webpage for all the latest. We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"".

restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
EU split on ending energy supplies from Russia,"Ukrainian officials say Russia has launched a major assault on the besieged Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol A senior Ukrainian MP says he has been told Russian forces have entered the site - we cannot verify this It's the last part of the city held by Ukrainian forces - at least 200 civilians are thought to be trapped there As many as 600 people were killed when Russia bombed a theatre in the city in March, new analysis suggests Meanwhile, Hungary says it will veto an EU proposal to ban Russian oil imports by the end of the year The plan was put forward by the European Commission as part of a new package of sanctions against Moscow Edited by Andrew Humphrey Those of us in London are pausing our live coverage now, and our team in Singapore will pick things up again in a few hours.

The editors were Chris Giles, Claudia Allen, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. As ever, you can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on ourhome page. Goodnight.  A church remains standing - but damanged - in the town of Malyn, near Kyiv We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's been happening in Ukraine today. Proposed oil ban The day started with the EU announcinga new plan to penalise Russia financially. It wants a total ban on oil imports from Russia by the end of the year. But several EU countries have voiced objections - most notably Hungary, who said it would veto the plan in its current form, as it would destroy the Hungarian economy. Missile strikes On the ground, several explosions have been reported in various cities across Ukraine. The UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia is trying to stop Ukraine from replenishing its supplies. There has been a suggestion that Russia will use its annual Victory Day celebrations - which it holds every year to mark victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 - to formally declare war on Ukraine.Russia has denied this. It is currently referred to as a special military operation. Mariupol steelworks There appears to be an escalation in fighting at the Azovstal steel plant, where the last of Ukraine's fighters in the city are holding out, along with hundreds of civilians. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have now entered the facility. Russia has said it will open a humanitarian corridor out of the plant tomorrow, but this has not been confirmed by Ukrainian officials. Theatre death toll Also in Mariupol,analysis by Associated Press,externalsuggests twice as many people as previously thought died in a Russian strike on a theatre in the city in March. Previous estimates put the death toll at 300, but the news agency now puts that at 600. Another 344 evacuees from various south-western cities including Mariupol have arrived in Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine's deputy prime minister Irina Vereshchuk. In a post on Telegram, she thanked the UN and Red Cross for their help, saying: ""These are women, children and elderly people from Mariupol, Manhush, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Vasylivka. All of them have just arrived in Zaporozhzhia"". The UN's humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, said many came with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. ""We will now support them during this difficult time, including with much- needed psychological support,"" she said. Lubrani added more must be done ""to make sure all civilians caught up in fighting can leave, in the direction they wish"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played The significance of Russian celebrations on 9 May's Victory Day is not lost on Ukrainians. MP Alyona Shkrum says she believes there will be an increase in fighting, inspired by the celebrations. Shkrum says Vladimir Putin is a ""delusional dictator"" who will turn the traditionally-celebrated day into a ""big fight right now against Nazis"". One of Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to ""denazify"" the country. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has dismissed speculation that Russia will declare all-out war against Ukraine on 9 May. What it is currently doing in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"". Will VernonReporting from Moscow In Russia, tanks, missile launchers and armoured vehicles thundered through central Moscow this evening as the military held another
dress rehearsal for the big Victory Day parade on 9 May. Muscovites gathered
to watch the weaponry roll past, some taking photos and waving to the troops perched
atop the tanks. The 9 May military parade on Red Square is an annual event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two,
although it has added significance this year following Russiaâs invasion of
Ukraine. Some analysts suggest President Putin wants to announce some sort of
victory on Victory Day, although it is difficult to see what further progress
Russian troops can make in Ukraine in the space of just a few days. There has
even been speculation here that Mr Putin will announce some sort of
mobilisation â such as a call-up of reservists â although a Kremlin
spokesperson denied today any such plans were in the works, calling the rumours
ârubbish"". Russian forces are supported by militia from separatist-run areas of Luhansk (file pic) Since the war started, we have heard little about life in two areas of Ukraine that were seized by Russian-backed proxies in 2014. But one resident in the city of Luhansk has told the BBC how it's very much like living in a powder keg. It's especially risky for men because of the constant threat of being drafted into the local militia to fight for Russia against the Ukrainian army. ""Total mobilisation is still happening â people call itmogilisationafter the Russian wordmogilawhich means grave,"" she says. ""Men have either stayed hiding in their homes for almost
three months, or they go out and pretend not to care, because they simply have
to get out to work as there are no other sources of income. ""There is an acute shortage of men - craftsmen, repairmen,
salesmen and builders. You keep hearing the phrase 'I'll come when the war is over'. Fear is acute too: wives fear for their husbands, mothers
for their sons. ""There are many dead
and many funerals. At Easter and on May Day, they were going around drafting
men direct from the cemetery."" Men who are drafted into the militia complain of being badly treated and she says theyâre so badly equipped ""they almost have to use their helmets
to dig trenches; theyâre badly fed, there arenât enough uniforms and they arenât allowed to call home"". Read more:Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east This video can not be played Ukraine conflict: Explosions at Azovstal steelworks seen in DNR video We've been reporting on the ongoing attack by Russian forces on the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, the Azovstal steel plant. We posted on this video earlier, that shows multiple explosions at the steelworks and gives an idea of the scale of the complex, and the bombardment it has suffered. Alongside the Ukrainian soldiers, it is thought there are hundreds of civilains, including more than 30 children, sheltering in the underground tunnels at the complex. The footage was shared by MVD DNR, a media outlet for pro-Russian separatists the Donetsk Peopleâs Republic. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the date on which the video was recorded, but it is thought to be after 3 May.  Away from the fighting in Mariupol, Russia is also attempting to hamper Ukrainian resupply efforts with missile strikes across the country, the UK's Ministry of Defence says. Ground operations are still focused on eastern Ukraine, itsays in its latest assessment of the fighting,external, and the targeting of key cities highlights Russia's desire to control access to the Black Sea. It says non-military targets such as schools, hospitals and residential properties continue to be hit, indicating Russia's willingness to target civilian infrastructure in an attempt to weaken Ukrainian resolve.  Ukrainian forces inside Mariupol's
Azovstal steel works have been fighting ""difficult bloody battles""
against Russian troops for a second day, the
commander of the controversial Azov regiment said. In a brief video message posted on Telegram, commander Denis Prokopenko said: ""I am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts
to contain the pressure of the enemy... the situation is
extremely difficult."" The message comes after a Ukrainian official said Russian forces had entered the territory of the plant - the final stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the shattered city of Mariupol. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked the UN secretary general for help to rescue the remaining injured Ukrainians at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. In a phone call on Wednesday, he thanked Antonio Guterres for his efforts to secure evacuations earlier this week. And he asked for further assistance: ""The lives of the people who remain there are in danger. Everyone is important to us. We ask for your help in saving them,"" he said, according tohis press service,external.  Slava (C) and his brother Volodymyr (R) were among those evacuated from Azovstal yesterday Russian forces are reported to have entered the Azovstal steelworks, the last hold-out of Ukrainian forces in the southern port city of Mariupol. Russia has besieged and bombarded the city for weeks. It is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. But why?  Read more:Why Mariupol is so important to Russia's plan As many as 600 people were killed when Russia bombed a theatre in Mariupol in March,analysis by the Associated Press (AP) news agency suggests,external. At the time of the strike, the word ""children"" had been written in giant letters on the ground outside the building, which was being used as a bomb shelter. The attack is believed to have caused the worst known loss of life in a single strike since the invasion began, and AP's investigation puts the death toll at around doublethe previous estimate of 300. The news agency spoke to 23 survivors, rescuers and those familiar with the theatre's use as a bomb shelter. They also built a 3D model of the building's floor plan and examined photos and videos of the theatre from before, during and after the event. Russia's military says it will open humanitarian corridors out of the besieged Azovstal steel complex for three days from Thursday, Reuters news agency reports. The military said routes out of the Mariupol plant will open from 08:00 to 18:00 Moscow time (GMT+3) on 5, 6, and 7 May. During this time Russian forces will cease military activities and withdraw units to a safe distance, the military said in a post online. We haven't heard anything about potential evacuations yet from Ukrainian officials. Dozens of civilians wereevacuated from the Azovstal plant late last week, with a large group of them travelling to Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia.  Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring There are reports of several Ukrainian cities being shelled this evening - Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Cherkasy, but information is patchy at this stage. Russia launched multiple missile strikes against targets across Ukraine yesterday evening, too. BBC Monitoring Dnipro's mayor Borys Filatov has said on Facebook that at least one Russian missile has hit the centre of the city. ""A strike right in the centre of Dnipro. Do not leave the shelters! Wait for official information from the military administration,"" he said. Ukrainian railways CEO Oleksandr Kamyshyn has said Dnipro's railway facilities have been hit. ""Another missile strike on railway infrastructure in Dnipro. No casualties among employees,"" he said on Telegram. Russian forces have entered the territory of the Azovstal steel works complex in Mariupol, a Ukrainian official has told a US broadcaster. The Azovstal plant is the last hold-out of Ukrainian forces in the destroyed port city, with civilians still sheltering underground in the sprawling industrial complex. David Arakhamia, Ukraine's ruling parliamentary faction head, told the broadcaster: ""Attempts to storm the plant continue for the second day. Russian troops are already on the territory of Azovstal."" Information on the ground has been scarce, but speaking to RFE/RL, Arakhamia said Ukraine's government was in contact with fighters at the plant. It comes after Mariupol's mayor earlier said they had lost communications with those inside. We'll bring you more detail on what's going on at the plant as and when we get it. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv Here in Lviv, the air raid sirens have gone off for the first
time today. It comes after a series of strikes on the outskirts of the city
yesterday that took out three power substations. I'm currently in the bunker of a shopping mall. Everyone here is
waiting around for the all clear. I'm sharing the bunker with babies, toddlers and someoneâs
family pet. The mood is quite calm but people are checking their phones for
information.  Now to Finland, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked a change of public opinion over Nato membership. The country, along with Sweden, has long held to a policy of military neutrality, but there are expectations that both will launch bids to join the alliance in the near future. Today, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is visiting Helsinki and he's said the UK would aid Finland if it were attacked by Russia, regardless of whether the country were a member of Nato. ""It is inconceivable that Britain would not come to the support of Finland, or Sweden, if it was ever attacked, without any big formal agreement. We are European countries who share the same values, who have deep, long histories,"" he said. Earlier, Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, said that in a Nato membership application, the key issue would be to keep the ratification process as short as possible.

Frozen conflicts are zones of ongoing instability,which Russia has previously been accused of using to its advantage. Zelensky says previous agreements with Russia such as Minsk-1 and 2, which sought to end the conflict in Ukraine's Donbas region, ""were violated"" by Russia and ""were not serious"".

GP clinic 'cannot afford' to open five days a week,"This video can not be played The Carnlough branch opened five years ago when it took on almost 1,400 new patients A County Antrim GP practice in Carnlough has said it is to significantly reduce its opening hours. The Glens of Antrim Medical Centre says it will only open two separate half days a week because of a funding cut. The Department of Health (DoH) has said additional payments made to the clinic between 2017 and 2021 were temporary. The practice, which has a main surgery in Cushendall, said it can no longer cover the costs of a full-time service in Carnlough. The medical centre opened the branch in Carnlough five years ago when it took on almost 1,400 new patients. It followed the closure of a practice in Glenarm when its only doctor retired. The DoH said the Glens of Antrim Medical Centre received an additional support payment when it agreed to accept the new patients. ""This temporary funding was to support the practice for a period of three years to enable them to manage the registration and complete an initial clinical review of these additional patients,"" it said. ""The funding was not indefinite, it was additional, temporary support offered to any GP practice which take on additional patients following the closure of a nearby GP practice."" The surgery says one doctor has already been let go Dr John McSparran, who works at the practice, said he ""vehemently"" disagreed with the response from the department. ""We were never under the impression it was for three years, otherwise we could never have entered the agreement in the first place,"" he said. ""We've tried to address the problem over the past yearâ¦ and have continued the service at our own cost. ""But it has now left us in a position financially that the practice is likely to be unviable."" The reduced opening hours are expected to take effect in the coming weeks. Dr McSparran said one doctor had already been let go. He said the practice had also not been able to fill receptionist positions because of the budget constraints. ""From a practice perspective it has created an awful difficulty,"" he said. ""But it is going to create a terrible difficulty for patients, particularly those who have difficulty travelling."" The Cushendall branch is 10 miles (16km) away. Other GP practices are at least 15 minutes away by car in Larne or Broughshane. Feargal Lynn manages a care home Feargal Lynn manages a care home in Carnlough and is worried about the impact of the reduced GP service in the village. ""If this practice goes to two half-days, that leaves no practice, apart from Cushendall, on this coast between Ballycastle and Larne."" Mr Lynn said it was ""totally unacceptable to ask this community to live with that"". ""The proposal for people of all ages in a rural setting to go to Cushendall surgery on the other days shows a tremendous lack of insight into the challenges the rural community face,"" he said. ""Not everybody can drive. Certainly, they can't if they are ill. ""We are at least a 20 to 25-minute drive for a GP that needs to travel this direction"" The DoH added that it continued to fund the rent and rates for the branch surgery premises in Carnlough. It said that despite the additional payment agreement ending in March 2021, the funding for the additional Carnlough patients ""forms part of the increased standard remuneration this practice now receives"".

'Children drank rainwater from puddles to survive',"This video can not be played Nataliia Roberts is trying to help a childhood friend Hearing how her best friend's children were drinking rainwater from puddles to survive the war in Ukraine is why Nataliia Roberts wants her in the UK. Yuliia and her three daughters used to run out of their basement shelter in the besieged city of Mariupol after it'd rained as they were so thirsty. It wasn't just the basics of water and food, there was no toilet, shower or electricity in their refuge from bombs. Nataliia now wants her childhood friend with her in the sanctuary of Wales. ""We had a small bowl [of soup] for three kids once per day,"" explained Yuliia. ""And one glass of water for three kids to clean themselves."" Mariupol civilians taken to both sides' territory Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? In maps: Slow Russian advance continues in the east After her home was destroyed by Russian bombs, Yuliia and her daughters - aged 11, six and three - had to find sanctuary in a communal basement which offered some shelter but she barely had any food to feed the children. ""The kids were asking for food so much, that's why she tried to feed them at bed time, so they felt full before bed,"" said worried friend Nataliia, watching on from her home in north Wales. Two of Yuliia's children get some escapism as they watch a video on their mum's phone in their underground bunker ""When it started to rain first of all they were able to drink from the puddle and that water was so, so, tasty. Then they found some pans to fill with water."" Yuliia eventually had to leave her children hiding as she went to look for fresh water. Yuliia and her family were happily enjoying life just months ago ""There was a well three kilometres [two miles] away. I had to run there under gunfire, under bombs,"" Yuliia recalls in a video diary for theBBC Wales Investigatesprogramme. And when her middle daughter became unwell, there were no medicines. The port city of Mariupol has been encircled by Russian troops since the start of March Yuliia had to take refuge in an underground bunker after their apartment in Mariupol was destroyed by Russian bombs ""I had money but I couldn't buy anything because there was nothing anywhere, everything was broken, everything was looted and destroyed,"" she said. Yuliia and Nataliia, who moved from Ukraine to Wales to be with her husband Dewi five years ago, have been close friends since school and had always kept in touch - until war broke out in Ukraine in February. Nataliia speaks to Yuliia as often as she can to support her friend 2,000 miles away For days, sometimes weeks, it wasn't safe for Yuliia to text or call her friend 2,000 miles away. Nataliia had to make do with Yuliia's intermittent video diary updates from her underground bunker with her girls while her husband fought the Russians on the front line. Yuliia and her three daughters hid out in their underground refuge for several weeks The 32-year-old accountant has managed to get her mum and stepdad out of eastern Ukraine when the situation began to escalate and Liudmyla and Sasha now live with Nataliia, husband Dewi, four-year-old Julia and Jacob, one, in the safety of Caernarfon. Now Nataliia can't just look on as her friend struggles and is doing everything she can to help Yuliia and her young family become Ukrainian refugees in Wales. Yuliia and her daughters are desperate to join their family friend Nataliia in north Wales Yuliia and her girls are among11 million Ukrainians forced to fleetheir homes before they eventually escaped Mariupol, under fire - weeks before the start of the United Nations-ledevacuation from the strategically significant city. The port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled since the start of March, is now mostly under the control of Russian forces - although several hundred Ukrainian troops remain in the Azovstal metal works factory in the south of the city. Russian forces have blockaded the sprawling industrial complex and are continuing their aerial bombardment of it, but no attempt has been made yet to clear Ukrainian troops from a network of tunnels beneath the factory. Russia has been accused of war crimes for its intense shelling of the city, with the local mayor saying at least 20,000 civilians have been killed. More than 100,000 people remain trapped in the city. By train and then minibus, they headed for Poland, not knowing when they'd see her husband again, or whether they'd be able to join Nataliia and her family in Wales. But it is the sights of war that are leaving their mark on Yulia. Nataliia Roberts and her mum Liudmyla share a cup of tea in Nataliia's home in Caernarfon ""She did see dead people in Mariupol, the ones who were killed by rockets who had no hands, no legs, whose bodies were destroyed,"" said Nataliia. ""I would love to have Yuliia here in Wales. I was dreaming that one day we will have a cup of tea in our dining room altogether and they can see our life here and have a more happy life. I just would love it."" Ukraine - the narrative the West doesn't hear Why has Putin invaded Ukraine - what does he want? The Mariupol street strewn with bodies About 27,000 Ukrainian refugees - out of the 86,000 approved visas - are in the UK and Wales has said itwants to be a ""nation of sanctuary"" for thosefleeing the horrors of war in their home-land. About 10,000 Welsh households had offered homes to Ukrainian refugees but by the end of last month, the Home Office had issued 2,300 visas for those wanting to come to Wales. The Welsh government has sponsored nearly 700 visa applications so far, but couldn't tell BBC Wales Investigates how many refugees had arrived in Wales, insisting it has asked the UK government for the data but been told it's unavailable. The Home Office said it is working ""as fast as it can"" to provide the information for the devolved governments, adding more than 86,000 visas have been granted under various schemes and is simplifying forms and boosting staff numbers to speed up applications.
