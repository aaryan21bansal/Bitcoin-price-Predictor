UK farmers to need 'thousands of foreign workers',"Some farmers say many UK workers could not cope with the hard labour Farmers are warning they will still need thousands of foreign workers for the UK harvest next year despite a campaign to attract domestic workers. National Farmers Union (NFU) figures, given exclusively to the BBC, reveal only 11% of seasonal workers in the 2020 season were UK residents. That is despite a high profile Pick for Britain campaign during the summer. The NFU now wants government assurances about labour for next year after the Brexit transition period ends. The Horticulture Seasonal Worker Survey covered 244 growers, recruiting more than 30,000 people - equating to nearly half the workforce. The NFU said the worker response was promising, but was not enough to sustain the industry long term. Vegetable farmer Martin Haines employs 150 seasonal workers in the Cotswolds, picking pumpkins, beans and broccoli. This video can not be played Generation Harvest: What it's like for the new fruit and veg picking Brits This year, facing the twin challenges of Brexit and Covid-19, he tried to find more local workers. However he only managed to recruit five British pickers - and they left before the end of the season to prepare for going to university. ""We're quite happy to have British workers,"" Mr Haines said. ""We will invest in their training to be able to do the job, but they just don't come and apply for the jobs. A lot of the work we do is on bonus - it's above minimum wage, so I'm not sure what we could do to attract more people."" Campaigns like the government-backed Pick For Britain saw a huge initial interest. But John Hardman, from Hops Labour Solutions, one of the biggest recruiters, said of around 30,000 applications they had from Britons, only 4% took up jobs and around 1% stayed past the initial six weeks. Mr Hardman said many domestic workers had an unrealistic 'Darling Buds of May' view of working on the land. ""It's hard physical labour. There is very little appetite in the domestic labour market for seasonal agricultural work because of the nature of the work. ""To be honest, EU citizens and those keen to work here are far more productive than the domestic labour force."" Defra says it is working closely with the Home Office to ensure there is a long term strategy for the farming workforce Mr Hardman added that, at this time of year, HOPS would normally be starting the process of finding overseas workers for next summer, but it is now halting recruitment until it knows more about the government's plans. ""It's like selling off an empty shelf. We are suspending recruiting people from Romania and Bulgaria for 2021 purely based on uncertainty,"" Mr Hardman said. NFU vice president Tom Bradshaw said: ""We are at a critical time in recruitment for many growers. As freedom of movement ends on December 31, those growers of iconic British daffodils, asparagus, and soft fruits still don't know where they will recruit experienced workers from."" The Seasonal Workers Pilot, which allows recruitment of a limited number of temporary migrants for specific seasonal roles in the horticultural sector, was extended from 2,500 to 10,000. But the industry wants assurances over whether it will run next year. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: ""Seasonal workers are essential to bring in the harvest every year, which is why we are continuing to work hard to ensure our farmers and growers have the support and workforce they need. ""Now the UK has left the EU, Defra is working closely with the Home Office to ensure that there is a long term strategy for the food and farming workforce as part of future immigration policy.""

Married PC who killed lover cleared of murder,"Brehmer was dismissed by Dorset Police after admitting manslaughter A police officer who strangled his long-term lover after she exposed their affair to his wife has been cleared of murder. Timothy Brehmer, a constable with Dorset Police, killed nurse Claire Parry, 41, in a pub car park on 9 May. The two had been having a secret relationship for more than 10 years, a trial at Salisbury Crown Court heard. Brehmer, 41, of Hordle, Hampshire, had previously admitted manslaughter and said Mrs Parry's death was an accident. He will be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday. PC who killed mum of two 'the worst kind of thief' The trial heard mum-of-two Mrs Parry, who was married to another Dorset Police officer, had become angry after discovering Brehmer had had an affair with another woman while she was involved with him. The defendant told jurors he agreed to meet her outside the Horns Inn in West Parley, Dorset, after she messaged him ""relentlessly"". Mrs Parry took his phone to look through his social media messages before sending a text to his wife revealing the affair, the court heard. Claire Parry died in hospital after being strangled, a court has heard Brehmer said he strangled her by accident during a ""kerfuffle"" in his car. He said when Mrs Parry refused to leave his car he tried to pull her out before he ""bundled"" into the vehicle in an attempt to push her. The defendant said his arm ""must have slipped up in all the melee"" and that he left the car without realising Mrs Parry was ""poorly"". Mrs Parry, from Bournemouth, died in hospital the following day from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck. Jurors were shown the car in which Mrs Parry suffered fatal injuries Brehmer told his trial the affair with Mrs Parry had been ""a little bubble of niceness"" but he had rarely seen her during the coronavirus lockdown. He said Mrs Parry's husband called him in March after becoming suspicious the two were having an affair and she had sent him messages so they could keep their stories straight. However, in the days before her death Mrs Parry started to believe that both her marriage and her relationship with Brehmer were coming to an end, the court heard. She had carried out research into Brehmer using an alias on Facebook and became convinced he had conducted affairs with at least two other women. Mrs Parry made contact with a police officer called Kate Rhodes, who told her she had an affair with Brehmer in late 2011, and this made her see him ""in a very different light"". This video can not be played Police body-worn video showed Brehmer ""crying hysterically"" after killing his lover Ms Rhodes, a detective constable, told the court Brehmer used ""grooming"" techniques to exert ""coercive and controlling behaviour"" over women. She had been mentored by Brehmer when she joined Dorset Police and was in a brief relationship with him which ended when she found out he was married. She explained to the court how she was contacted on Facebook Messenger by Mrs Parry, who used the name Louisa Morgan, in the days before her death. Ms Rhodes said they discussed ""womaniser"" Brehmer, whom she described as ""Mr Smooth"", and how he had conducted affairs while married. Timothy Brehmer admitted killing his lover Claire Parry but told the court it was an accident Mrs Parry's husband, Andrew, told the court Brehmer was the ""worst kind of thief"" and described the pain of telling their children that their mother was dead. ""It was like a physical weight crushing down on my chest,"" he said. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Richard Dixey said: ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Mrs Parry and I would like to pay tribute to the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves throughout the investigation."" Following Brehmer's guilty plea to manslaughter on 8 July, Dorset Police commenced misconduct proceedings and, on 16 September, Chief Constable James Vaughan ruled the officer would be dismissed with immediate effect and would be placed on the national barred list.

The Countdown: A judge's kiss and when to dance,"With one week left, Amy Coney Barrett changed the Supreme Court. Joe Biden is in Georgia, a changing state he wants to win - what does this mean for a socialite turned senator there? (And some tips on when to dance in an election.) Many views of Amy Coney Barrett were on show last night. At a ceremony at the White House Donald Trump celebrated her as a justice and a mother. ""The Barrett family has captured America's heart..."" he said, and went on to describe her as ""the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice"". Being a ""mother of school-aged children"" is something that both the president and the judge have said before. It is repeated by conservatives who understand that family values are exactly what an evangelical base wants on display. Ivanka Trump then shared an image of a kiss between Judge Barrett and her husband. Reactions to the image veered from rapture at a sweet moment to anger at her appointment. Allow Twitter content?

During her confirmation hearing Republican senators commented a lot on her parenting skills and the apparent feat of raising so many children as a judge. She also talked about her children, their babysitters and carers, and life as a working mother. The interest in Judge Barrett as a mother has been seen as both sexist and missing the point in a world where some can afford more childcare than others - but it is also a political tool. For many Democrats, one concern was that Amy Coney Barrett, who did not practise law for very long before becoming a scholar, just lacks experience. This piece from liberal magazine Mother Jonesargues that she is by a long way the most inexperienced judge to be nominated for,externaldecades. This is our profile of the newest Supreme Court judge. Joe Biden has arrived to campaign in Georgia. Our correspondent Tara McKelvey breaks down this very interesting race.: The state:The southern and reliably Republican state of Georgia is worth 16 electoral college votes and Donald Trump took it in 2016. The stats:Now Mr Trump and Mr Bidenare tied in a New York Times/Siena poll,external. It has seen a political transformation - more immigrants and the growing influence of minority and young voters have made it more progressive. Young voters in Georgia are part of the changing make-up of the state The socialite senator:It's not just about the presidential race in Georgia, because this state also has two races for the US Senate. One of them features the very wealthy Senator Kelly Loeffler who was once seen as a moderate Republican - but has embraced Trumpism, She was appointed last year and is hoping to win in an election also being held on 3 November. Her enthusiastic support for Amy Coney Barrett has sparked anger, with people reminding us she has not won any popular vote. Her ultra-conservative approach may yet alienate some voters in this changing state. So how much should you dance when campaigning?

People can buy non-essential items 'by exception',"Baby clothes have been listed as essential and can now be sold in supermarkets Baby clothes have been listed as essential items that should go on sale in supermarkets during Wales' lockdown. The Welsh Government has also said customers should be able to ask for non-essential items in exceptional circumstances. But ministers say the principle of restricting non-essential goods will stay until lockdown ends on 9 November. Plaid said it showed building public trust was vital while the Conservatives called the rules ""absolute madness"". Wales' supermarket rules 'will not be reversed' Tesco 'wrong' to say period products not essential Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' The new guidance, issued after meetings with businesses and trade unions, follows a backlash after supermarkets closed off sections of their shops selling clothes and other items. Earlier, business groups had appealed for customers to be ""trusted to make their own decisions"" on what was essential to them. In a statement, the Welsh Government said it had ""positive discussions"" and that it had ""clarified that a sensible system should be introduced whereby customers can ask to buy non-essential items by exception under the regulations"". Products deemed non-essential are being covered up in stores ""We are hopeful this provides a workable solution for retailers and customers,"" it said. ""However, we cannot move away from the central principle that retailers must restrict the sale of non-essential goods for the duration of the firebreak. ""We continue to work closely with the sector and would stress that these restrictions are in place to stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""We are asking the public to continue to support the effort by restricting unnecessary journeys and shopping ."" Home electrical items such as irons are not being sold in supermarkets Ministers issued a list that ""we consider that the regulations allow"" to be sold in supermarkets: Food and drink Products linked to the sale of food and drink - mainly disposable items used for the preparation and storage of food like kitchen foil, food bags and cling film but also basic products necessary to prepare and eat food and drink Products for washing clothes and for cleaning and maintaining the home, including batteries, light bulbs and fuel Toiletries and cosmetic products, including toilet rolls and sanitary products Pharmaceutical products Baby products including equipment, clothes and nappies Newspapers and magazines Stationery and greetings cards Initially, the Welsh Government said supermarkets and department stores shouldclose off sections of their stores, including clothing aisles,external. Officials say there will be further discussions with supermarkets over coming days on how to implement the changes. Earlier on Tuesday, retailers made their own proposals to ""resolve confusion"" over sales of non-essential items during Wales' lockdown. Stores said such items could remain on shelves and not be cordoned off, with signs instead advising customers to put off non-essential purchases. ""The final liability ought to rest with the customer,"" retailers said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the fallout should remind the Welsh Government of the importance of ""building public trust"". The Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies has called for the Senedd to be recalled to discuss the rules.

LiveLiveBiden seeks to poach votes in Republican South7 minutes ago,"Joe Biden campaigned in the key state of Georgia, which Democrats hope to wrest from Republicans Meanwhile President Trump was holding rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska on Tuesday Biden leads Trump in most national polls, but the race in key states is close ahead of the 3 November election First Lady Melania Trump made her first campaign appearance since recovering from Covid Edited by Boer Deng We're pausing our US election live coverage as Trump holds his second rally of the day in Wisconsin, a midwestern a state that he won in 2016 but where he is now trailing Biden in the polls. He kicked off the day with a rally in Michigan and will end it with another one in Nebraska later this evening.

In other election related news: Catch up on all the latest here: Biden hits new battleground, Trump blitzes Midwest The Trump campaign has released a clip going after Biden for using a quote that comes from the Pope. The selectively edited clip shows Biden saying: ""Why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?â as if he has suddenly forgotten what has motivated him to run for president. What ""@TrumpWarRoom"" neglected to mention is that Biden was quoting Pope Francis' questions that he says all leaders should ask themselves when they seek office. A Biden spokesman accused the Trump campaign of âattacking Joe Bidenâs faith"". (If elected, Biden would be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy). For those who missed the full speech, Biden's quote was followed by these words: ""Pope Francis asked the questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation. And to heal this nation."" Both candidates in the US presidential election have vowed to be tough on China - but disentangling the worldâs two biggest economies is very complicated.

This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world A Canadian senator who has twice beensuspended from parliament for behaviour deemed racisthas been caught making an illegal contribution to the Republican National Committee,according to Vice,external. Lynn Beyak, listed her home address as Dryden, New York, rather than Dryden, Ontario, (where she actually resides) when she donated $300 (Â£230) to Trump in May. The former real estate agent also listed her occupation as ""retired"" despite being a sitting senator. It is illegal under US election law for non-Americans to give money to any political campaign. Foreign nationals are, however, allowed to volunteer for campaigns. A spokesperson for Beyak told Vice that the ""donation was made in error and is being returned in its entirety, simply because it was erroneous"". But the news outlet reports that the donation has not yet been returned by the Republican National Committee. President Trump has made no secret of his desire to win over women (especially suburban women) this election. He is 15 points behind Biden in support from female voters, according to the latest Economist/YouGov poll and 23 points back by the New York Times' count. Campaigning in Michigan earlier today, he had a surprising pitch to get their vote. This video can not be played President Trump: 'We're getting your husbands back to work' With just seven days to go until the election, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in the national polls. The latest data puts Biden about 10 points ahead of Trump. While national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, itâs important to remember that the election could come down to results in just a few key states. At the moment, polls in the battleground states also look good for Biden. They suggest he has big leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to clinch victory in 2016. You can read more about the latest polls here A judge in Michigan has blocked a ban on the open display of guns near polling locations on election day. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued a directive earlier this month banning people from openly carrying guns within 100 feet of polling sites. The ban was announced days afterthe FBI said it had thwarted a plot to abduct and overthrow Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer,and amid concerns over voter intimidation and violence. Gun-rights groups argued that Benson, a Democrat, had overstepped her authority and had failed to observe the formal rule-making process required by law to pass the ban. Judge Christopher Murray sided with them on Tuesday. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has vowed to appeal against the ruling. ""Everybody in Washington knows that Joe Biden is weak,"" begins Trump's latest video tweet. With seven days left until election day, Trump and Biden have each released political adverts that are sure to play frequently until 3 November. While a pair of Biden hits talk about the candidate as a choice for decency, the Trump direct-to-camera advert warns that Democrats are lawless socialists who are ""bad for our country"". ""We're calling them out and we're calling out the radical left,"" he says. ""Go out and vote. We will not have a socialist nation, or even worse. It could be worse than a socialist nation, and you know what that means,"" he continues. ""Vote early and in person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had."" Our correspondent is traveling with the president as he campaigns in the Midwest Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A cold rain mixed with ice fell as Trump spoke in Lansing, Michigan If Donald Trump loses the White House next week, it wonât be for a lack of effort on the campaign trail down the stretch. He has kicked off a three-day, multi-state swing across the country with a stop in Lansing, Michigan. Despite a temperature hovering just above freezing as light rain mixed with ice pelted the airfield, a crowd of several thousand waited for hours to see the president. âIâm working my ass off,â Trump told the cheering throngs of people. The president went on to speak for more than an hour, mixing in his normal stump-speech attacks on Joe Biden with some more focused riffs on immigration and trade in the automotive industry-dominated state. Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite polls before the election showing him behind, sometimes by large margins. The polls arenât encouraging for the president this time around either, but another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. Biden was speaking to a drive-in rally in Atlanta Biden is speaking at his second Georgia event of the day. ""Hello, Atlanta,"" he says, as he comes to the stage to music by local rap group Outkast. ""My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Kamala Harris' running mate,"" he says as cars beep their horn in approval at this drive-in rally. He thanked the audience for ""helping to create the change that you know is possible"" and thanked rapper Common who introduced him. ""Folks, I think we're gonna surprise the living devil out of everybody this year,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate,"" he continued, calling for the normally Republican southern state to send two Democrats to Washington next year ""to fight for your interest, not for Donald Trump's interests"". Acknowledging that we're now in the final stretch before election day, he tells Atlanta: ""Folks, it's go time."" Roosevelt frequently visited Warm Springs Joe Biden is due to appear in Atlanta, Georgia for his second campaign stop of the day in the state, but earlier, he drew on the memory of former US President Franklin D Roosevelt as he campaigned in Warm Springs. FDR, the Democrat who led the US during the Great Depression and through World War Two, retreated to the town to seek treatment for polio. Biden spoke of the significance of the small town (population 400). ""This place represented a way forward,"" he said. ""A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing"". It ""is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healedâ¦ That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.â Biden also quoted a speech FDR drafted before his death. âTo live together and work together. Thatâs how I see America. Thatâs how I see the presidency, and thatâs how I see the future,â he said. Georgia has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992. But polls suggest a close race this year and Biden says he has a ""fighting chance"". Socially distanced supporters in Warm Springs, GA British pop star Harry Styles might not be eligible to vote in the upcoming election but that hasnât stopped him from endorsing Democrat Joe Biden. Taking to Twitter, the former One Direction singer wrote: âIf I could vote in America, Iâd vote with kindness."" The post was accompanied by a video from Bidenâs campaign.

Millions more Americans have voted or are still expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the ballots is likely. It was previously common for states to restrict voting by post to certain people - such as the elderly, ill, or those away from home. But the practice is now widely permitted in a majority of states. An estimated 80 million postal ballots,externalwill be cast this time round - more than double the number in 2016. Postal votes also take longer to count once they have arrived and different states have different rules over how and when they count them. Find out more about when we're likely to get a result - and if it could be contested - here. Donald Trump has begun a busy day of campaigning with a rally in the battleground state of Michigan. Most polls show Democrat Joe Biden leading in the state, which Trump took narrowly in 2016. But Trump told thousands of supporters gathered for the rally that he had momentum behind him as the election nears. âSeven days from now weâre going to win the great state of Michigan,â he said. ""A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream,"" he later said. It would be hard to argue with Trump's assessment of supporters' enthusiasm.

"Married PC who killed lover cleared of murderTimothy Brehmer, who worked for Dorset Police, strangled Claire Parry but says it was an accident.","Brehmer was dismissed by Dorset Police after admitting manslaughter A police officer who strangled his long-term lover after she exposed their affair to his wife has been cleared of murder. Timothy Brehmer, a constable with Dorset Police, killed nurse Claire Parry, 41, in a pub car park on 9 May. The two had been having a secret relationship for more than 10 years, a trial at Salisbury Crown Court heard. Brehmer, 41, of Hordle, Hampshire, had previously admitted manslaughter and said Mrs Parry's death was an accident. He will be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday. PC who killed mum of two 'the worst kind of thief' The trial heard mum-of-two Mrs Parry, who was married to another Dorset Police officer, had become angry after discovering Brehmer had had an affair with another woman while she was involved with him. The defendant told jurors he agreed to meet her outside the Horns Inn in West Parley, Dorset, after she messaged him ""relentlessly"". Mrs Parry took his phone to look through his social media messages before sending a text to his wife revealing the affair, the court heard. Claire Parry died in hospital after being strangled, a court has heard Brehmer said he strangled her by accident during a ""kerfuffle"" in his car. He said when Mrs Parry refused to leave his car he tried to pull her out before he ""bundled"" into the vehicle in an attempt to push her. The defendant said his arm ""must have slipped up in all the melee"" and that he left the car without realising Mrs Parry was ""poorly"". Mrs Parry, from Bournemouth, died in hospital the following day from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck. Jurors were shown the car in which Mrs Parry suffered fatal injuries Brehmer told his trial the affair with Mrs Parry had been ""a little bubble of niceness"" but he had rarely seen her during the coronavirus lockdown. He said Mrs Parry's husband called him in March after becoming suspicious the two were having an affair and she had sent him messages so they could keep their stories straight. However, in the days before her death Mrs Parry started to believe that both her marriage and her relationship with Brehmer were coming to an end, the court heard. She had carried out research into Brehmer using an alias on Facebook and became convinced he had conducted affairs with at least two other women. Mrs Parry made contact with a police officer called Kate Rhodes, who told her she had an affair with Brehmer in late 2011, and this made her see him ""in a very different light"". This video can not be played Police body-worn video showed Brehmer ""crying hysterically"" after killing his lover Ms Rhodes, a detective constable, told the court Brehmer used ""grooming"" techniques to exert ""coercive and controlling behaviour"" over women. She had been mentored by Brehmer when she joined Dorset Police and was in a brief relationship with him which ended when she found out he was married. She explained to the court how she was contacted on Facebook Messenger by Mrs Parry, who used the name Louisa Morgan, in the days before her death. Ms Rhodes said they discussed ""womaniser"" Brehmer, whom she described as ""Mr Smooth"", and how he had conducted affairs while married. Timothy Brehmer admitted killing his lover Claire Parry but told the court it was an accident Mrs Parry's husband, Andrew, told the court Brehmer was the ""worst kind of thief"" and described the pain of telling their children that their mother was dead. ""It was like a physical weight crushing down on my chest,"" he said. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Richard Dixey said: ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Mrs Parry and I would like to pay tribute to the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves throughout the investigation."" Following Brehmer's guilty plea to manslaughter on 8 July, Dorset Police commenced misconduct proceedings and, on 16 September, Chief Constable James Vaughan ruled the officer would be dismissed with immediate effect and would be placed on the national barred list.

'Urgent clarity' needed on rules after firebreakWales' tourism industry says it is struggling to plan for the future when lockdown is lifted.,"It is views such as this on a route to the top of Snowdon that attracts hundreds of thousands of people to visit north Wales The tourism industry in Wales needs urgent clarity on rules after the national Covid firebreak lockdown ends, say some of its leaders. Emotions in the sector are turning from ""anxiety to anger"" in some parts of the country, warned one industry insider. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said there would be guidance at least a week in advance on what comes next. The Welsh Government said it met a tourism taskforce ""on a weekly basis"" to work with the industry. But Jim Jones, the managing director of North Wales Tourism, said the 1,000 members he represents needed to know ""a month ago"". He said most of north Wales had already been put under hyper-local lockdown, and extending the measures to the national firebreak was ""draconian"". The reason why Wales has gone for a national firebreak lockdown Figuring out the stats on Covid in Wales Are you a rule-breaker? ""The first minister talks about the short, sharp shock - we're talking about the long, sharp shock to our economy,"" Mr Jones said. ""The current lockdown is really unfair for business. ""I've always said right from day one 'yes, absolutely we should be protecting lives' - but at the same time we should be protecting people's livelihoods."" Autumn in the Conwy Valley may be cooler - but its colours are usually a visitor magnet He said the economic impact was being felt across the whole of the hospitality sector in the region, including the supply chain behind the tourism industry. ""We're already hearing of redundancies, or job losses, and questions of whether businesses will open,"" Mr Jones continued. ""It's the uncertainty going forward - and the anxiety which is now turning to anger. ""It's the lack of information, the lack of engagement that we are having at this moment in time with Welsh Government and business. ""We are the last to find out, yet we're the ones dealing with the brunt of it all."" Demonstrators gathered on Llandudno's prom on Sunday over Covid restrictions Concerns about the lockdown measures led to a protest over the weekend in Llandudno, one of the main holiday destinations on the north Wales coast. North Wales Tourism said the sector was worth more than Â£3bn alone to the region every year. Across Wales, the industry was worth an estimated Â£6.3bn in spending by visitors in 2018, according to Welsh Government figures. It also employed more than 132,000 people - nearly one-in-10 of the Welsh workforce. Anglesey glamour-camping entrepreneur Victoria Roberts said she had already bitten the bullet and called it a year for her glamping sites. ""I know it's October, but we keep getting calls about bookings - there's still a market out there,"" she said. But with the firebreak in place, she said she and others in similar businesses across the island were resigned to staying shut until next year. She also runs another holiday accommodation business but said she did not know where she stands after the firebreak ends on 9 November. ""Can I take bookings? Will the travel restrictions still be in place? What about the rule-of-six - will that still be in place?"" she asked. Anglesey was one of the few places in north Wales to avoid local lockdown - but it is now part of the Wales firebreak lockdown As co-chairman of the island's own tourism association, she said other businesses were in the same situation. ""People just need to know - clear direction and back it up with reasons why,"" she added. ""We need to know by the end of the week. We need to know what the plan is and how it will pan out - and what the next step will be. ""Will we be potentially looking at other firebreakers in the new year?"" Mr Gething told Monday's coronavirus briefing that discussions would continue with stakeholders across industries such as tourism and retail over the course of the week. ""There are conversations taking place today, tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and beyond, and we'll then expect the Cabinet to come together and agree a set of rules,"" he said. ""We want to be in a position to give people at least a week or so to understand the new rules that are going to be in place."" A Welsh Government official added that ""engagement with the industry has been vital during the course of the pandemic"" and, in addition to weekly meetings, a news bulletin in Wales was sent to 61,000 tourism businesses. ""Tourism is extremely important to our economy and we know this is an incredibly challenging time for businesses,"" they added. What 'essential' items can I buy in lockdown?

Woolworths High Street 'relaunch' proves a hoax,"Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing Â£385m A tweet announcing the relaunch of UK High Street retailer Woolworths has gone viral, despite being fake. The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which has now been deleted, misspelled the shop's name. And it linked to a website that was not active and had, BBC News has learned, been registered only hours earlier. Metro, which appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news, has now corrected its story. Very, the company that owns the local rights to the Woolworths brand, confirmed it was a hoax. ""We own the Woolworths trademark in the UK,"" a spokesman told BBC News. ""The Twitter account UKWoolworths is not connected to the Very group."" The original tweet read: ""Here to save 2020. ""Woolworths is coming back to your High Street, as a physical store. ""A couple of legal things to get sorted but we're full steam ahead at Woolworths HQ. ""We want to get this right, so we need your help. ""What do you want at your UK #YourWoolworths?"" Metro appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news Ray Walsh, scam expert at virtual private network (VPN) company ProPrivacy, said: ""It's not unsurprising that huge numbers of people around the UK have fallen for fake news surrounding the reopening of Woolworths. ""The brand was a much-loved part of UK shopping history. ""And many have fond memories of the retailer. ""But the Twitter account spreading the hoax was full of typos and spelling mistakes. ""This alone should have been enough to make it obvious that something extremely fishy was going on. ""The important take away from all of this is how social engineering and nostalgia can be used to trick people. ""And it serves as an important reminder of why people need to think carefully when using the internet to avoid falling for scams and phishing attacks."" The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which now has more than 4,000 followers, misspelled the shop's name Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing Â£385m. The shops, famous for their Pic'n'Mix sweets, also sold kitchen and garden equipment and toys. One of the UK's oldest chains it had 815 stores, many of which were taken over by shops such as Wilko and Poundland. The Woolworths name remains in use in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as an unrelated retail brand. This was the fake news story 2020 needed - and it might seem less important than harmful coronavirus conspiracy theories or political disinformation, which have spread on wildfire on social media in recent months. But it does teach us some important lessons about how and why disinformation spreads on social media. We tend to share posts that we want to be true or that confirm our biases - who isn't missing Woolworth's pic'n'mix, especially during a pandemic? That partly explains why the tweet from the fake Woolworth's account - which kept spelling the name of the chain wrong - went so viral. But it also highlights the need for verification - and the role of the media in amplifying disinformation. A quick ring around would have confirmed that Woolworth's is not re-opening - but that did not stop a number of news outlets covering this fake Twitter account. What happened to Woolworths' stores?

The shooting happened on Monday afternoon when two officers responded to a report of a person with a weapon. Police said the officers opened fire when the man, identified as Walter Wallace, ""advanced towards"" them. An investigation has been opened. Hundreds took to the streets to protest against the shooting. The protests, which began late on Monday and continued into the early hours of Tuesday, turned violent at times, the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper reported. Images from the scene showed a police vehicle set on fire. There were also reports of looting. Some 30 officers were injured, most of them from being struck by objects such as bricks and stones, according to preliminary information from police cited by the Associated Press (AP) news agency. One officer was in hospital with a broken leg and other injuries after being struck by a pickup truck, police said. More than a dozen people were arrested, police said. Large protests broke out in Philadelphia earlier this year followingthe police killing of 46-year-old African-American man George Floyd in Minnesota.Footage showed white police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, while he repeatedly said he was unable to breathe. Three facts that help explain anger in the US A city pledged to abolish its police. Then what? Floyd's death sparked protests around the world against racism and police brutality. Police said the shooting happened at about 16:00 (20:00 GMT) on Monday, when two officers responded to a report of a man with a weapon in the neighbourhood of Cobbs Creek in West Philadelphia. Police spokeswoman Tanya Little told AP that a man, later identified as Mr Wallace, was holding a knife when the officers approached, and instead of following orders to drop the weapon ""advanced towards them"". Both officers then fired ""several times"", hitting Mr Wallace in the shoulder and chest. One of the officers drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said. Video footage shared on social media shows two officers pointing their guns at Mr Wallace as he walks towards them. The officers back away from him and shout at him to put the knife down. Shots are then fired and Mr Wallace is seen lying on the street. The identities of the two police officers have not been made public. In a statement, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the ""tragic incident... presents  difficult questions that must be answered"". He said a ""full investigation"" would be conducted. ""I look forward to a speedy and transparent resolution for the sake of Mr Wallace, his family, the officers and for Philadelphia,"" he added. Mr Wallace's father, Walter Wallace Sr,told the Inquirer that his son had mental health issues and was on medication.,external ""Why didn't they use a taser?"" he asked.

Shops call for relaxation of non-essential sales,"Baby clothes have been listed as essential and can now be sold in supermarkets Baby clothes have been listed as essential items that should go on sale in supermarkets during Wales' lockdown. The Welsh Government has also said customers should be able to ask for non-essential items in exceptional circumstances. But ministers say the principle of restricting non-essential goods will stay until lockdown ends on 9 November. Plaid said it showed building public trust was vital while the Conservatives called the rules ""absolute madness"". Wales' supermarket rules 'will not be reversed' Tesco 'wrong' to say period products not essential Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' The new guidance, issued after meetings with businesses and trade unions, follows a backlash after supermarkets closed off sections of their shops selling clothes and other items. Earlier, business groups had appealed for customers to be ""trusted to make their own decisions"" on what was essential to them. In a statement, the Welsh Government said it had ""positive discussions"" and that it had ""clarified that a sensible system should be introduced whereby customers can ask to buy non-essential items by exception under the regulations"". Products deemed non-essential are being covered up in stores ""We are hopeful this provides a workable solution for retailers and customers,"" it said. ""However, we cannot move away from the central principle that retailers must restrict the sale of non-essential goods for the duration of the firebreak. ""We continue to work closely with the sector and would stress that these restrictions are in place to stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""We are asking the public to continue to support the effort by restricting unnecessary journeys and shopping ."" Home electrical items such as irons are not being sold in supermarkets Ministers issued a list that ""we consider that the regulations allow"" to be sold in supermarkets: Food and drink Products linked to the sale of food and drink - mainly disposable items used for the preparation and storage of food like kitchen foil, food bags and cling film but also basic products necessary to prepare and eat food and drink Products for washing clothes and for cleaning and maintaining the home, including batteries, light bulbs and fuel Toiletries and cosmetic products, including toilet rolls and sanitary products Pharmaceutical products Baby products including equipment, clothes and nappies Newspapers and magazines Stationery and greetings cards Initially, the Welsh Government said supermarkets and department stores shouldclose off sections of their stores, including clothing aisles,external. Officials say there will be further discussions with supermarkets over coming days on how to implement the changes. Earlier on Tuesday, retailers made their own proposals to ""resolve confusion"" over sales of non-essential items during Wales' lockdown. Stores said such items could remain on shelves and not be cordoned off, with signs instead advising customers to put off non-essential purchases. ""The final liability ought to rest with the customer,"" retailers said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the fallout should remind the Welsh Government of the importance of ""building public trust"".

'It shouldn't be shop workers' responsibility',"Supermarket staff say they are targets for customers venting their frustration over the rules Firebreak shopping rules are causing ""uncertainty, fear and anxiety"", according to supermarket workers. Filco director Matthew Hunt said he has had no information from the government and ""found out on Facebook"". And one supermarket worker said staff are facing ""abuse and intimidation"". The Welsh Government will publish revised guidance later over its ban on thesale of non-essential items in supermarketsduring the 17-day lockdown. Wales' supermarket rules 'will not be reversed' Tesco 'wrong' to say period products not essential Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' Supermarkets told sell only essentials in lockdown Mr Hunt told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We never had any communication from any of the governmental bodies before this was introduced. ""As yet, we've still yet to have anything concrete that we can work with."" He added he was worried about the pressure staff members may feel about deciding what is essential. ""This is only a two-week period, by the time you try and unravel the confusion that is out there, we'll be out the end of this one,"" he said. A supermarket worker called Jane told Radio Wales she felt anxious going into work. ""You don't know what you're going to face,"" she said. ""It is causing a lot of frustration with customers. A couple have behaved really awfully - we had one gentleman come in with no mask, filming the store, shouting abuse, telling us we were all robots for the government. ""We get general frustration from other customers who wanted to buy something for the home and can't. A lot of people tend to mutter, trying to provoke a reaction."" She added she had been ""personally intimidated by a customer who's really got in my face and invaded my personal space"" and some customers had been removed from the store. ""It certainly isn't right that shop workers should have to put up with that kind of behaviour. ""We've been going to work all the way through the pandemic to keep the country fed and abuse shouldn't be part of our job at all."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Health Minister Vaughan Gething told Monday's coronavirus press briefing that supermarkets should use their discretion over the sale of non-essential items. Jane, from Mold in Flintshire, said her store had needed to use flexibility when a customer was in crisis at the weekend. ""They needed baby clothing - they'd fled from a bad situation and they weren't able to bring everything that they needed for their baby, so we allowed them to purchase what they needed,"" she said. ""There was no way you could have said no to that person."" But she added the decision should not be made by supermarket staff. ""It shouldn't be down to the responsibility of the shop worker to enforce the new arrangements. ""It should be up to the public to follow the rules...we need a clear message of what we should say to them.""

Thanks for joining us. Today's coverage was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Paul Gribben, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. We'll be back again tomorrow with all the latest news. Have a good evening. Today's live page will be closing shortly. Here's a round-up of the key virus-related stories of the day from the UK and around the world: House of LordsParliament Andy Burnham has attacked the government for using a ""crude"" system to calculate how much financial help each area of England under the toughest - tier three - Covid restrictions receives. Appearing before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, the Greater Manchester mayor said Whitehall allocated Â£20 in business support per person in the affected areas. This didn't take into account differences between cities like his own and Liverpool and other less urban areas under tier three, such as Lancashire, Labour's Mr Burnham argued. More firms operated in cities and so they needed more money to keep jobs going. Otherwise, he said, there would be a ""lot of levelling down"" across northern England. ""When we get through this, cities and city regions are going to be in the vanguard of the recovery,"" Mr Burnham added. Announcing more help for businesses last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it would ""be part of the country pulling together in the coming months"". He promised that ""our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs"". With Halloween just days away, many may be wondering if Halloween's time honoured traditions - like trick or treating or apple bobbing - can go ahead in the age of Covid. The answer? It depends on where you live.  You can read morehere.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Another 367 deaths linked to Covid have been reported in the UK on Tuesday - the highest daily figure since May. The news is alarming, but there are some caveats. Figures tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of the delays over the weekend in reporting deaths. These are deaths that have actually happened over the past week or so. If you look at the deaths as they correspond to the date they occurred, the numbers have not topped 200 a day throughout this second wave. That compares to a peak of 1,000 daily deaths in the spring. What we are seeing - with cases, hospitalisations and deaths - is a gradual, but sustained rise since the end of summer. Until this slows, the sad reality is the number of deaths will keep rising. Coronavirus is surging in many parts of the world, with Europe currently seeing the steepest rise in new cases. Spain and France have become the first western European countries to record more than one million cases, and several others have recorded their highest number of new infections since the start of the pandemic. Spain has declared a state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew. Italy has ordered bars, restaurants, gyms and cinemas to close,leading to protests.France has imposed a night-time curfew on major cities and on Tuesday,the Czech Republic introduced a week-long ban on people leaving their homesbetween 21:00 and 04:59 each day. Pubs and restaurants in many areas of Scotland will be able to serve alcohol indoors again from next week,the first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon said the move would allow licensed premises in level two of the country's new five-tier system to serve alcohol with a meal until 8pm. In level three areas - likely to be much of the central belt - they can reopen but must not serve alcohol. The new rules are expected to come into force from Monday. James ShawBBC Scotland reporter First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that two local authorities in Scotland may come under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions from next week. She said level four measures may be necessary in North and South Lanarkshire because of very high transmission rates - no Scottish council is currently under such restrictions. However, she also suggested the rate of infection may be stablising and the strictest controls would only be imposed if absolutely necessary. Under tier four, schools remain open but all non-essential shops, as well as pubs and restaurants, would be closed. Speaking at Holyrood, the first minister said most of the central belt would be at level three - broadly the same as tier three in England. Much of rest of the country would be at level two, but the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and Moray would be at level one. Dundee is expected to be at level three. Ms Sturgeon said final decisions would be announced on Thursday. Read more. People living in Nottingham and surrounding boroughs have been
urged to keep showing ""resilience"" ahead ofnew tier three controls coming into force. Tougher Covid-19 rules for Nottingham city and the Broxtowe,
Gedling and Rushcliffe borough council areas begin on Thursday, with
finer details of the measures expected to be outlined later today. Rushcliffe Borough Council leader Simon Robinson said: ""We've got two months before Christmas.
I am confident, if we get on top of these restrictions, get compliance from
business from our residents, we are going to see the infection rate coming down
and going in the right direction. ""If that is the case, I am sure we'll get the support from
government to actually start to reduce these restrictions and give people that
freedom and get some enjoyment out of Christmas."" However, some Nottingham pub owners have said it is ""heartbreaking"" they will be forced to close their businesses while tier three restrictions are in place. One landlord said he felt pubs had been blamed for the city's infection rate rise. Read more about that here. A further 367 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. This is the highest daily death figure since May. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,365. There have also been a further 22,885 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 0900 on Tuesday. This brings the total number of cases in the UK to 917,575. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been giving a statement to the Scottish Parliament to kick-start a debate about her government's new five-tier system of restrictions for tackling Covid-19. A vote is due to be held around 19:00 So far she has stressed the importance of ""flexibility"" under the five-tier system, which comes into force on 2 November. Ms Sturgeon confirmed the details will be kept under review as the system develops. ""This may be particularly important for the hospitality industry,"" she added. She also announced that pubs and restaurants in many parts of Scotland will be able to service alcohol indoors again from next week. The move would allow licensed premises in level two of the country's new five-tier system to serve alcohol with a meal until mid-evening. Find out more about howthe tier system will work. By George Herd, BBC News Anglesey was one of the few places in north Wales to avoid local lockdown, but has been impacted by the current firebreak lockdown The tourism industry in Wales needs urgent clarity on rules after thenational Covid firebreak lockdownends, say industry insiders. Emotions in the sector are turning from ""anxiety to anger"" in some parts of the country. Jim Jones, managing director of North Wales Tourism, called the decision to introduce the national firebreak ""draconian"". He said the economic impact was being felt across the whole of the hospitality sector in the region, including the supply chain behind the tourism industry. ""We're already hearing of redundancies, or job losses, and questions of whether businesses will open,"" said Mr Jones. ""It's the uncertainty going forward - and the anxiety, which is now turning to anger. ""It's the lack of information, the lack of engagement that we are having at this moment in time with Welsh Government and business. ""We are the last to find out, yet we're the ones dealing with the brunt of it all."" The tourism industry in Wales was worth an estimated Â£6.3bn in spending by visitors in 2018, according to government figures. ""Tourism is extremely important to our economy and we know this is an incredibly challenging time for businesses,"" a Welsh Government official said and stressed engagement with the industry was ongoing.

Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has criticised Tesco for not enforcing
coronavirus rules on masks. He told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee that, during recent talks with the government over tier three restrictions, he had asked for powers to close businesses not deemed to be doing enough to make themselves Covid-safe. Mr Burnham said: ""I'm not just talking
about pubs and restaurants. There are large supermarkets in Greater Manchester who in my view have not properly implemented the requirements around face
coverings. ""I'll name one chain, Tesco. I don't believe they have taken a
responsible attitude to this issue. They've said it's not for them to enforce. Well, I think it is for those organisations to enforce."" The BBC has contacted Tesco for comment.  Talks between the Scottish government and the football authorities aimed at seeing a return of fans to gameswill take place later this week. Scotland moves to a five-tier Covid-19 restrictions system from next Monday. And the Scottish FA and SPFL have asked what that means for football, given the proposed framework says areas in tiers zero and one can open stadiums to a restricted number of fans. Apart from two test games in September, fans have not been allowed since March. The coronavirus lockdown has led many would-be couples to try out new ways of dating as restrictions have made meeting in person more tricky. Now, the dating app Tinder is to roll out one-to-one video calls for its worldwide users after an initial trial among a small number worldwide. Rival Bumble already allows video calling. The free ""Face to Face"" feature will allow potential matches to speak to each other on camera if both people want it and are facing the camera. In May, the firm's chief executive Elie Seidman said that the pandemic had had a ""dramatic"" effect on the way people used the app. Although engagement was up - the app saw a record three billion swipes on one day in March - there was less interest in paid-for premium subscriptions. The vast majority of Tinder's revenues come from its six million subscribers who pay for the ""gold"" service. The rate at which it picked up those precious paying-users declined as lockdown struck.

Unveiling it at a virtual press conference, he said the initiative - called oneGM - was ""the Greater Manchester family coming together on a cross-community basis to see how weâre going
to support people and businesses through what is going to be a really challenging winter"". He says the scheme will have three elements, including:  The Labour mayor said local leaders were ""hopeful"" to get Â£65m in government support -despite No 10 offering Â£60m- ""because of the decision to backdate tier two support"". He said leaders planned to put a business support package in place to help low-paid workers whose workplaces shut as well as the self-employed and industries where freelancers predominate, such as the arts sector. Mr Burnham was joined on the call by speakers  involved with the region, including the former Manchester United player and Salford City football club owner Gary Neville and the Bishop of Manchester, David Walker. It comes as the region became the first in England to be moved intotier three restrictions, against local leaders' wishes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

So the Essex care home where she lives arranged with the family to screen the ceremony live at the Prince Edward Duke of Kent Court Care Home in Stisted. The home also put on canapes, a three-course meal and promised a spot of dancing. Kathryn and Tom even cut the cake outside Dot's window. """"Really they're doing more than we are,"" joked groom Tom.

Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The percentage of pupils in class across England's state primary and secondary schools fell last week from 89% to 86%, government statistics show. The Department for Education said approximately 26% of schools - 55% of secondaries and 20% of primaries - reported having one or more pupils self-isolating due to potential contact with a case of coronavirus inside the school, compared to 21% of schools last week. But ""the vast majority of these schools remain open to most pupils"", The Northern Powerhouse - aimed at redressing North-South economic imbalance - says pupils in the North face the most disruption over Covid-19.

More children missing school over Covid-19,"More children are missing out on their education, as the rate of attendance falls across England's schools. The percentage of pupils attending primary and secondary schools fell to 86% last week down from 89% the previous week, government data shows. The Northern Powerhouse, a group working to redress North-South economic imbalance, says pupils in the North face the most disruption over Covid-19. The government said some pupils were self-isolating ""as we would expect"". The Department for Education said 55% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England reported having one or more pupils self-isolating due to potential contact with a case of coronavirus in the school. This is up from 46% and 16% respectively on the previous week. Overall attendance at primary school fell from 92% in the week ending 15 October to 90% in the week ending 22 October. But the drop on the previous week's attendance was most significant in secondary schools, falling from 87% to 83%.

Geoff Barton, head of the school leaders' union ASCL, said the figures painted a ""grim picture of the increasingly challenging picture facing schools"". As attendance rates fall, there are growing concerns that pupils in the north of England are missing more school than their peers in other parts of the country. Analysis from the North West Association of the Directors of Children's Services, seen exclusively by the BBC, reveals the pressures. In mid-October Bury, Knowsley, Liverpool and Manchester all had more than 40% of schools with confirmed cases - some of these were among teachers. Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools Covid school disruption getting worse in England School figures show 88% back for start of term What happens if someone in school tests positive? According to the report, which is based on a snapshot of 16 October, there were 710 teachers with a positive test for coronavirus in the North West - this was 35% of the total of confirmed cases among teachers across England on that day. The Northern Powerhouse wants next year's exams ditched in favour of coursework, saying pupils in the north of England had been particularly badly affected by disruption to their schooling. But the government says exams are ""the fairest way"" of judging performance and ministers have said exams will go ahead in summer 2021, with a three-week delay. About eight million pupils in England were sent home in March It pointed out that some areas in the North had attendance rates for secondary school as low as 61%, whereas others in the South were close to the usual national figure of 95%. It added: ""We appreciate the government's desire to try and keep things as normal as possible, but this is now unrealistic in many northern communities. ""We urge the government to commit to continuous assessment as it is a fairer alternative to the proposed examination plan."" The government is consulting on contingency measures to manage any disruption to GCSEs, A-levels and BTecs in 2021, and has said it will produce plans before Christmas. A DfE spokesperson said: ""Exams are the fairest way of judging a student's performance, which is why they will go ahead next year, underpinned by contingency measures developed in partnership with the sector. ""Over the coming weeks we will jointly identify any risks to exams and the measures needed to address potential disruption, with fairness for students continuing to be our priority."" The spokesperson added that schools had plans in place to deliver remote education for self-isolating pupils and the government was providing an initial additional allocation of 150,000 devices for eligible children. The CEO of Ormiston Academy Trust, Nick Hudson, urged the government to publish data on attendance broken down by local authority, amid concern that pupils in the worst-affected areas might be falling further behind. ""To be fair to young people the data needs to be transparent, then we can ensure that we put as much equity into the system, especially those sitting exams,"" he said. ""If we experience the same levels of staff absence as we have in the first half-term between now and the end of term, it would be very difficult to ensure consistent education for all of our pupils in all of our schools - that would mean looking at the possibility of rotas.""

Here's a round-up of the key virus-related stories of the day from the UK and around the world: House of LordsParliament Andy Burnham has attacked the government for using a ""crude"" system to calculate how much financial help each area of England under the toughest - tier three - Covid restrictions receives. Appearing before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, the Greater Manchester mayor said Whitehall allocated Â£20 in business support per person in the affected areas. This didn't take into account differences between cities like his own and Liverpool and other less urban areas under tier three, such as Lancashire, Labour's Mr Burnham argued. More firms operated in cities and so they needed more money to keep jobs going. Otherwise, he said, there would be a ""lot of levelling down"" across northern England. ""When we get through this, cities and city regions are going to be in the vanguard of the recovery,"" Mr Burnham added. Announcing more help for businesses last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it would ""be part of the country pulling together in the coming months"". He promised that ""our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs"".

"Don't let north get 'left behind' Tory MPs warn PMMore than 50 Tory MPs call for a ""clear road map"" out of lockdown restrictions for northern England.UKComments","More than 50 Tory MPs have written to the prime minister calling for a ""clear road map"" out of lockdown restrictions in northern England, warning the region risks being ""left behind"". The letter from the Northern Research Group said the pandemic threatened Boris Johnson's pledge to ""level-up"". They also called for an economic recovery plan for the region, arguing it had been hardest hit by the virus. No 10 said it was ""committed to levelling up across the country"". And speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he shared the MPs' ""frustrations at restrictions"" adding that the government wanted to invest in northern areas. All the areas under the strictest restrictions of the government's three-tier system for England are in the North or the Midlands. Warrington has become the latest area to join the Liverpool City Region,Greater Manchester, Lancashire and South Yorkshire in the top tier, whileNottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the highest tier on Thursday. This will mean about eight million people in England will be living under the toughest restrictions, which are reviewed after 28 days, by the end of the week. In areas under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals must close and households are not allowed to mix indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? How do the UK's latest Covid rules affect you? How much money are tier 3 areas getting? Can Johnson's levelling-up mission survive Covid? Russ Bowden, Labour leader of Warrington Council, said he could not see a way out of the top tier of restrictions for his area, adding that he did not know what measurements the government were using for putting places in tier three in the first place. He also told Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are no clear rules about what the success criteria are with the tiers and how you move between the different tiered layers."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously raised the issue in the House of Commons, saying that the top tier was a ""gateway"" to potentially months and months of ""agony"" from which there was no exit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""simplest and most effective way"" for areas to get out of tier three was to get the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - ""down to one or below"". The Department of Health also said other data taken into account includedwhich age groups were being affected and the pressures facing the NHS in those areas. Some 40 Conservative MPs representing areas in the north of England, North Wales and the Scottish borders, have publicly signed the letter, including former cabinet ministers David Davis, David Mundell and Esther McVey, while a further 14 have had their names redacted. The newly-formed Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers is led by former Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry. In their letter, the group called for the prime minister to set out ""a clear road map down the tiering system and out of lockdown"", warning restrictions were ""disproportionately"" affecting people in the north of the country. ""The virus has exposed in sharp relief the deep structural and systemic disadvantage faced by our communities and it threatens to continue to increase the disparity between the North and South still further,"" they said. Mr Berry who represents Rossendale and Darwen said ""We are asking people to give up huge civil liberties, businesses to close, people to live on two thirds of their normal wages. ""I don't think it is unreasonable to say the other side of that coin should be 'show us the way out'."" He also denied that he and other northern MPs were staging a ""revolt"" against the government, saying they were asking the prime minister to ""reaffirm"" his commitment to ""stimulate the North"". December's general election saw the Conservatives demolish the ""red wall"" - winning seats in the north of England from Labour it hadn't held in a generation. The government pledged to repay that support before the pandemic hit, throwing normal politics up in the air. Boris Johnson has continued to talk about that agenda - but the signatories of this letter are worried that Covid will see some of the pledges made fall down the political priority list. In particular, they share concerns with many Labour leaders in the North that there isn't a clear road map out of restrictions. It's been a bruising few weeks for the government's relationship with the North, with very public rows over support for local economies. These MPs support the government - and say their intervention is designed to influence its plans. But it also shows fears for the north of England are shared across the political spectrum The group welcomed the financial support already in place for businesses, such as the furlough scheme and extra funding for local authorities under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. But they added: ""We do however share concerns that the cost of Covid could be paid for by the downgrading of the levelling-up agenda, and northern constituencies like ours will be left behind."" Mr Johnson won a majority of 80 seats in December's election, with many traditionally Labour constituencies in the so-called ""Red Wall"" turning Conservative blue. A key part of his campaign was a pledge to ""level-up"" and reduce regional inequality across the country. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work?

"The Countdown: A judge's kiss and when to danceDonald Trump hails her as a ""mother of school-age children"", but others see her lack of experience.US Election 2020","With one week left, Amy Coney Barrett changed the Supreme Court. Joe Biden is in Georgia, a changing state he wants to win - what does this mean for a socialite turned senator there? (And some tips on when to dance in an election.) Many views of Amy Coney Barrett were on show last night. At a ceremony at the White House Donald Trump celebrated her as a justice and a mother. ""The Barrett family has captured America's heart..."" he said, and went on to describe her as ""the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice"". Being a ""mother of school-aged children"" is something that both the president and the judge have said before. It is repeated by conservatives who understand that family values are exactly what an evangelical base wants on display. Ivanka Trump then shared an image of a kiss between Judge Barrett and her husband. Reactions to the image veered from rapture at a sweet moment to anger at her appointment. Allow Twitter content?

During her confirmation hearing Republican senators commented a lot on her parenting skills and the apparent feat of raising so many children as a judge. She also talked about her children, their babysitters and carers, and life as a working mother. The interest in Judge Barrett as a mother has been seen as both sexist and missing the point in a world where some can afford more childcare than others - but it is also a political tool. For many Democrats, one concern was that Amy Coney Barrett, who did not practise law for very long before becoming a scholar, just lacks experience. This piece from liberal magazine Mother Jonesargues that she is by a long way the most inexperienced judge to be nominated for,externaldecades. This is our profile of the newest Supreme Court judge. Joe Biden has arrived to campaign in Georgia. Our correspondent Tara McKelvey breaks down this very interesting race.: The state:The southern and reliably Republican state of Georgia is worth 16 electoral college votes and Donald Trump took it in 2016. The stats:Now Mr Trump and Mr Bidenare tied in a New York Times/Siena poll,external. It has seen a political transformation - more immigrants and the growing influence of minority and young voters have made it more progressive. Young voters in Georgia are part of the changing make-up of the state The socialite senator:It's not just about the presidential race in Georgia, because this state also has two races for the US Senate. One of them features the very wealthy Senator Kelly Loeffler who was once seen as a moderate Republican - but has embraced Trumpism, She was appointed last year and is hoping to win in an election also being held on 3 November. Her enthusiastic support for Amy Coney Barrett has sparked anger, with people reminding us she has not won any popular vote. Her ultra-conservative approach may yet alienate some voters in this changing state. So how much should you dance when campaigning?

Why are some not recovering?,"For most people, Covid-19 is a brief and mild disease but some are left struggling with symptoms including lasting fatigue, persistent pain and breathlessness for months. The condition known as ""long Covid"" is having a debilitating effect on people's lives, and stories of being left exhausted after even a short walk are now common. So far, the focus has been on saving lives during the pandemic, but there is now a growing recognition that people are facing long-term consequences of a Covid infection. Yet even basic questions - such as why people get long Covid or whether everyone will fully recover - are riddled with uncertainty. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,""said one sufferer Jade Gray-Christie, Long Covid: 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Long Covid: 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' Coronavirus patient unable to work six months on Long Covid is not just people taking time to recover from a stay in intensive care. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. ""We've got no doubt long Covid exists,"" Prof David Strain, from the University of Exeter, who is already seeing long-Covid patients at his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome clinic, told the BBC. A study of 143 people in Rome's biggest hospital,published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,external, followed hospital patients after they were discharged. It showed 87% had at least one symptom nearly two months later and more than half still had fatigue. However, such studies focus only on the minority of people who end up needing hospital treatment. TheCovid Symptom Tracker App,external- used by around four million people in the UK - found 12% of people still had symptoms after 30 days. Its latest, unpublished data, suggests as many as one in 50 (2%) of all people infected have long-Covid symptoms after 90 days. It appears not. Half of peoplein a study in Dublin,externalstill had fatigue 10 weeks after being infected with coronavirus. A third were physically unable to return to work. Crucially, doctors found no link between the severity of the infection and fatigue. However, extreme exhaustion is only one symptom of long Covid. Prof Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester and the chief investigator in the PHOSP-Covid projectwhich is tracking people's recovery,external, believes people who developed pneumonia may have more problems because of damage to the lungs. Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia There are lots of ideas, but no definitive answers. The virus may have been cleared from most of the body, but continues to linger in some small pockets. ""If there's long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there's loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what's causing the problem,"" says Prof Tim Spector, from King's College London. The coronavirus can directly infect a wide variety of cells in the body and trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body. One thought is the immune systemdoes not return to normal,externalafter Covid and this causes ill-health. The infection may also alter how people's organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seenafter infection with Sars or Mers,external, which are both types of coronavirus. But Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels afterdeveloping diabetes as a result of Covid,external, and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fatsfor at least 12 years,external. There are early signs ofchanges to brain structure,external, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body. Inside Health: Sticky Blood and Covid 19 Prof Strain told the BBC: ""The theory I'm working on is a premature ageing of the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues."" But he warned that until we figure out what is causing long Covid ""it is difficult to figure out treatments."" Post-viral fatigue or a post-viral cough are well documented and common - we've probably all had an infection that has taken ages to fully recover from. Around one in 10 people withglandular fever,externalhas fatigue which lasts for months. And there have even been suggestions that flu, particularly after the 1918 pandemic, may be linked toParkinson's-like symptoms,external. ""With Covid there seem to be more far-reaching symptoms and the number of people seems to be much greater,"" says Prof Brightling. The emphasis though is on the word ""seems"" as until we have a true picture of how many people have been infected we won't know exactly how common these symptoms are, he says. He told the BBC: ""The uniqueness of the way the virus attacks the host and the different ways it then alters the way cells behave seem to be both giving people more severe infection than other viruses and persistent symptoms."" SYMPTOMS:85% of patients have one of these three symptoms IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The number of people with long-Covid appears to be falling with time. However, the virus emerged only at the end of 2019 before going global earlier this year so there is a lack of long-term data. ""We've asked, deliberately, to follow people for 25 years, I certainly hope only a very small number will have problems going beyond a year, but I could be wrong,"" said Prof Brightling. However, there are concerns that even if people appear to recover now, they could face lifelong risks. People who have had chronic fatigue syndrome are more likely to have it again and the concern is that future infections may cause more flare-ups. ""If long Covid follows the same pattern I'd expect some recovery, but if it takes just another coronavirus infection to react then this could be every winter,"" said Prof Strain. It is still possible more problems could emerge in the future. The World Health Organization has warned that widespread inflammation caused by coronavirus could lead to people having heart problems at a much younger age. The NHS has a""Your Covid Recovery Plan"",externalwhich has advice, particularly for those who needed hospital treatment. It recommends the ""three Ps"" in order to conserve energy: Pace yourself so you don't push yourself too hard, and make sure you have plenty of rest Plan your days so your most tiring activities are spread out across the week Prioritise - think about what you need to do and what can be put off It advises speaking to either your hospital team or your GP if you are not recovering as quickly as you might expect. Some have raised concerns thatthere is not enough supportfor people with long-Covid.

"Married PC who killed lover cleared of murderTimothy Brehmer, who worked for Dorset Police, strangled Claire Parry but says it was an accident.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","Brehmer was dismissed by Dorset Police after admitting manslaughter A police officer who strangled his long-term lover after she exposed their affair to his wife has been cleared of murder. Timothy Brehmer, a constable with Dorset Police, killed nurse Claire Parry, 41, in a pub car park on 9 May. The two had been having a secret relationship for more than 10 years, a trial at Salisbury Crown Court heard. Brehmer, 41, of Hordle, Hampshire, had previously admitted manslaughter and said Mrs Parry's death was an accident. He will be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday. PC who killed mum of two 'the worst kind of thief' The trial heard mum-of-two Mrs Parry, who was married to another Dorset Police officer, had become angry after discovering Brehmer had had an affair with another woman while she was involved with him. The defendant told jurors he agreed to meet her outside the Horns Inn in West Parley, Dorset, after she messaged him ""relentlessly"". Mrs Parry took his phone to look through his social media messages before sending a text to his wife revealing the affair, the court heard. Claire Parry died in hospital after being strangled, a court has heard Brehmer said he strangled her by accident during a ""kerfuffle"" in his car. He said when Mrs Parry refused to leave his car he tried to pull her out before he ""bundled"" into the vehicle in an attempt to push her. The defendant said his arm ""must have slipped up in all the melee"" and that he left the car without realising Mrs Parry was ""poorly"". Mrs Parry, from Bournemouth, died in hospital the following day from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck. Jurors were shown the car in which Mrs Parry suffered fatal injuries Brehmer told his trial the affair with Mrs Parry had been ""a little bubble of niceness"" but he had rarely seen her during the coronavirus lockdown. He said Mrs Parry's husband called him in March after becoming suspicious the two were having an affair and she had sent him messages so they could keep their stories straight. However, in the days before her death Mrs Parry started to believe that both her marriage and her relationship with Brehmer were coming to an end, the court heard. She had carried out research into Brehmer using an alias on Facebook and became convinced he had conducted affairs with at least two other women. Mrs Parry made contact with a police officer called Kate Rhodes, who told her she had an affair with Brehmer in late 2011, and this made her see him ""in a very different light"". This video can not be played Police body-worn video showed Brehmer ""crying hysterically"" after killing his lover Ms Rhodes, a detective constable, told the court Brehmer used ""grooming"" techniques to exert ""coercive and controlling behaviour"" over women. She had been mentored by Brehmer when she joined Dorset Police and was in a brief relationship with him which ended when she found out he was married. She explained to the court how she was contacted on Facebook Messenger by Mrs Parry, who used the name Louisa Morgan, in the days before her death. Ms Rhodes said they discussed ""womaniser"" Brehmer, whom she described as ""Mr Smooth"", and how he had conducted affairs while married. Timothy Brehmer admitted killing his lover Claire Parry but told the court it was an accident Mrs Parry's husband, Andrew, told the court Brehmer was the ""worst kind of thief"" and described the pain of telling their children that their mother was dead. ""It was like a physical weight crushing down on my chest,"" he said.

Don't let north get 'left behind' Tory MPs warn PM,"More than 50 Tory MPs have written to the prime minister calling for a ""clear road map"" out of lockdown restrictions in northern England, warning the region risks being ""left behind"". The letter from the Northern Research Group said the pandemic threatened Boris Johnson's pledge to ""level-up"". They also called for an economic recovery plan for the region, arguing it had been hardest hit by the virus. No 10 said it was ""committed to levelling up across the country"". And speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he shared the MPs' ""frustrations at restrictions"" adding that the government wanted to invest in northern areas. All the areas under the strictest restrictions of the government's three-tier system for England are in the North or the Midlands. Warrington has become the latest area to join the Liverpool City Region,Greater Manchester, Lancashire and South Yorkshire in the top tier, whileNottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the highest tier on Thursday. This will mean about eight million people in England will be living under the toughest restrictions, which are reviewed after 28 days, by the end of the week. In areas under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals must close and households are not allowed to mix indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? How do the UK's latest Covid rules affect you? How much money are tier 3 areas getting? Can Johnson's levelling-up mission survive Covid? Russ Bowden, Labour leader of Warrington Council, said he could not see a way out of the top tier of restrictions for his area, adding that he did not know what measurements the government were using for putting places in tier three in the first place. He also told Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are no clear rules about what the success criteria are with the tiers and how you move between the different tiered layers."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously raised the issue in the House of Commons, saying that the top tier was a ""gateway"" to potentially months and months of ""agony"" from which there was no exit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""simplest and most effective way"" for areas to get out of tier three was to get the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - ""down to one or below"". The Department of Health also said other data taken into account includedwhich age groups were being affected and the pressures facing the NHS in those areas. Some 40 Conservative MPs representing areas in the north of England, North Wales and the Scottish borders, have publicly signed the letter, including former cabinet ministers David Davis, David Mundell and Esther McVey, while a further 14 have had their names redacted. The newly-formed Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers is led by former Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry. In their letter, the group called for the prime minister to set out ""a clear road map down the tiering system and out of lockdown"", warning restrictions were ""disproportionately"" affecting people in the north of the country. ""The virus has exposed in sharp relief the deep structural and systemic disadvantage faced by our communities and it threatens to continue to increase the disparity between the North and South still further,"" they said. Mr Berry who represents Rossendale and Darwen said ""We are asking people to give up huge civil liberties, businesses to close, people to live on two thirds of their normal wages. ""I don't think it is unreasonable to say the other side of that coin should be 'show us the way out'."" He also denied that he and other northern MPs were staging a ""revolt"" against the government, saying they were asking the prime minister to ""reaffirm"" his commitment to ""stimulate the North"". December's general election saw the Conservatives demolish the ""red wall"" - winning seats in the north of England from Labour it hadn't held in a generation. The government pledged to repay that support before the pandemic hit, throwing normal politics up in the air. Boris Johnson has continued to talk about that agenda - but the signatories of this letter are worried that Covid will see some of the pledges made fall down the political priority list. In particular, they share concerns with many Labour leaders in the North that there isn't a clear road map out of restrictions. It's been a bruising few weeks for the government's relationship with the North, with very public rows over support for local economies. These MPs support the government - and say their intervention is designed to influence its plans. But it also shows fears for the north of England are shared across the political spectrum The group welcomed the financial support already in place for businesses, such as the furlough scheme and extra funding for local authorities under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. But they added: ""We do however share concerns that the cost of Covid could be paid for by the downgrading of the levelling-up agenda, and northern constituencies like ours will be left behind."" Mr Johnson won a majority of 80 seats in December's election, with many traditionally Labour constituencies in the so-called ""Red Wall"" turning Conservative blue. A key part of his campaign was a pledge to ""level-up"" and reduce regional inequality across the country. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? Mr Sunak said he understood the MPs' concerns but added: ""I also share their passion and their ambition for the North"" and promised that the government ""remained committed"" to investing in these areas. Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson said the government had been ""treating local communities with contempt"". She added thatthe decision not to extend free school meals over the half-term holiday""is the clearest sign yet that the Conservatives have the wrong priorities and are not on the side of British families"".

LiveLiveBiden condemns ârushedâ Supreme Court appointment13 minutes ago,"Joe Biden campaigned in the key state of Georgia, which Democrats hope to wrest from Republicans Meanwhile President Trump was holding rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska on Tuesday Biden leads Trump in most national polls, but the race in key states is close ahead of the 3 November election First Lady Melania Trump made her first campaign appearance since recovering from Covid Edited by Boer Deng We're pausing our US election live coverage as Trump holds his second rally of the day in Wisconsin, a midwestern a state that he won in 2016 but where he is now trailing Biden in the polls. He kicked off the day with a rally in Michigan and will end it with another one in Nebraska later this evening. Here's a shot from our correspondent, Anthony Zurcher, who has been traveling with the president for his whirlwind day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In other election related news: Catch up on all the latest here: Biden hits new battleground, Trump blitzes Midwest The Trump campaign has released a clip going after Biden for using a quote that comes from the Pope. The selectively edited clip shows Biden saying: ""Why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?â as if he has suddenly forgotten what has motivated him to run for president. What ""@TrumpWarRoom"" neglected to mention is that Biden was quoting Pope Francis' questions that he says all leaders should ask themselves when they seek office. A Biden spokesman accused the Trump campaign of âattacking Joe Bidenâs faith"". (If elected, Biden would be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy). For those who missed the full speech, Biden's quote was followed by these words: ""Pope Francis asked the questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation. And to heal this nation."" Both candidates in the US presidential election have vowed to be tough on China - but disentangling the worldâs two biggest economies is very complicated. The BBCâs Zhaoyin Feng is from China, but has lived in the US for years. She investigates how rivalry between the two countries is affecting the rest of the world. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world A Canadian senator who has twice beensuspended from parliament for behaviour deemed racisthas been caught making an illegal contribution to the Republican National Committee,according to Vice,external. Lynn Beyak, listed her home address as Dryden, New York, rather than Dryden, Ontario, (where she actually resides) when she donated $300 (Â£230) to Trump in May. The former real estate agent also listed her occupation as ""retired"" despite being a sitting senator. It is illegal under US election law for non-Americans to give money to any political campaign. Foreign nationals are, however, allowed to volunteer for campaigns. A spokesperson for Beyak told Vice that the ""donation was made in error and is being returned in its entirety, simply because it was erroneous"". But the news outlet reports that the donation has not yet been returned by the Republican National Committee. President Trump has made no secret of his desire to win over women (especially suburban women) this election. He is 15 points behind Biden in support from female voters, according to the latest Economist/YouGov poll and 23 points back by the New York Times' count. Campaigning in Michigan earlier today, he had a surprising pitch to get their vote. This video can not be played President Trump: 'We're getting your husbands back to work' With just seven days to go until the election, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in the national polls. The latest data puts Biden about 10 points ahead of Trump. While national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, itâs important to remember that the election could come down to results in just a few key states. At the moment, polls in the battleground states also look good for Biden. They suggest he has big leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to clinch victory in 2016. You can read more about the latest polls here A judge in Michigan has blocked a ban on the open display of guns near polling locations on election day. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued a directive earlier this month banning people from openly carrying guns within 100 feet of polling sites. The ban was announced days afterthe FBI said it had thwarted a plot to abduct and overthrow Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer,and amid concerns over voter intimidation and violence. Gun-rights groups argued that Benson, a Democrat, had overstepped her authority and had failed to observe the formal rule-making process required by law to pass the ban. Judge Christopher Murray sided with them on Tuesday. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has vowed to appeal against the ruling. ""Everybody in Washington knows that Joe Biden is weak,"" begins Trump's latest video tweet. With seven days left until election day, Trump and Biden have each released political adverts that are sure to play frequently until 3 November. While a pair of Biden hits talk about the candidate as a choice for decency, the Trump direct-to-camera advert warns that Democrats are lawless socialists who are ""bad for our country"". ""We're calling them out and we're calling out the radical left,"" he says. ""Go out and vote. We will not have a socialist nation, or even worse. It could be worse than a socialist nation, and you know what that means,"" he continues. ""Vote early and in person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had."" Our correspondent is traveling with the president as he campaigns in the Midwest Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A cold rain mixed with ice fell as Trump spoke in Lansing, Michigan If Donald Trump loses the White House next week, it wonât be for a lack of effort on the campaign trail down the stretch. He has kicked off a three-day, multi-state swing across the country with a stop in Lansing, Michigan. Despite a temperature hovering just above freezing as light rain mixed with ice pelted the airfield, a crowd of several thousand waited for hours to see the president. âIâm working my ass off,â Trump told the cheering throngs of people. The president went on to speak for more than an hour, mixing in his normal stump-speech attacks on Joe Biden with some more focused riffs on immigration and trade in the automotive industry-dominated state. Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite polls before the election showing him behind, sometimes by large margins. The polls arenât encouraging for the president this time around either, but another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. Biden was speaking to a drive-in rally in Atlanta Biden is speaking at his second Georgia event of the day. ""Hello, Atlanta,"" he says, as he comes to the stage to music by local rap group Outkast. ""My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Kamala Harris' running mate,"" he says as cars beep their horn in approval at this drive-in rally. He thanked the audience for ""helping to create the change that you know is possible"" and thanked rapper Common who introduced him. ""Folks, I think we're gonna surprise the living devil out of everybody this year,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate,"" he continued, calling for the normally Republican southern state to send two Democrats to Washington next year ""to fight for your interest, not for Donald Trump's interests"". Acknowledging that we're now in the final stretch before election day, he tells Atlanta: ""Folks, it's go time."" Roosevelt frequently visited Warm Springs Joe Biden is due to appear in Atlanta, Georgia for his second campaign stop of the day in the state, but earlier, he drew on the memory of former US President Franklin D Roosevelt as he campaigned in Warm Springs. FDR, the Democrat who led the US during the Great Depression and through World War Two, retreated to the town to seek treatment for polio. Biden spoke of the significance of the small town (population 400). ""This place represented a way forward,"" he said. ""A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing"". It ""is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healedâ¦ That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.â Biden also quoted a speech FDR drafted before his death. âTo live together and work together. Thatâs how I see America. Thatâs how I see the presidency, and thatâs how I see the future,â he said. Georgia has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992. But polls suggest a close race this year and Biden says he has a ""fighting chance"". Socially distanced supporters in Warm Springs, GA British pop star Harry Styles might not be eligible to vote in the upcoming election but that hasnât stopped him from endorsing Democrat Joe Biden. Taking to Twitter, the former One Direction singer wrote: âIf I could vote in America, Iâd vote with kindness."" The post was accompanied by a video from Bidenâs campaign.

Trump, meanwhile, has the backing of rapper Lil Pump, actress Kirstie Alley and musician Kid Rock. But does A-lister backing actually help win votes? You can find out by reading our analysis here. President Trump's irreverent Twitter use has often earned him criticism. Even his wife acknowledges she doesn't always agree with his tweets - as she revealed in Pennsylvania earlier today at her first campaign outing since recovering from Covid-19 this month. This video can not be played Melania Trump: 'Media created picture of my husband I don't recognise' After polls close in the US presidential election on 3 November, it could take days or even weeks to find out if Joe Biden or Donald Trump has won. Millions more Americans have voted or are still expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the ballots is likely. It was previously common for states to restrict voting by post to certain people - such as the elderly, ill, or those away from home. But the practice is now widely permitted in a majority of states. An estimated 80 million postal ballots,externalwill be cast this time round - more than double the number in 2016. Postal votes also take longer to count once they have arrived and different states have different rules over how and when they count them. Find out more about when we're likely to get a result - and if it could be contested - here. Donald Trump has begun a busy day of campaigning with a rally in the battleground state of Michigan. Most polls show Democrat Joe Biden leading in the state, which Trump took narrowly in 2016. But Trump told thousands of supporters gathered for the rally that he had momentum behind him as the election nears. âSeven days from now weâre going to win the great state of Michigan,â he said. ""A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream,"" he later said. It would be hard to argue with Trump's assessment of supporters' enthusiasm.

Obama puts his mask back on after leaving the stage in Orlando Barack Obama has been campaigning for his former VP Joe Biden, and laid into comments from top Trump aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Orlando, Florida today. Kushner told Fox News on Monday that Trump ""canât want them to be successful more than they want to be successful"", referring to African Americans. That posture is a problem, America's first black president said. ""Who are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to?"" Obama asked. He mocked Trump's claim to be the best president for black people since Abraham Lincoln, the president who ended slavery.

Speaking in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, First Lady Melania Trump has just made her first solo appearance to support her husband's campaign. The Slovenian-born ex-model was introduced by Trump's former aide, Kellyanne Conway, who claimed the first lady had ""amazing political instincts"". Trump referred to her family's recent  brush with the ""silent enemy"" of the coronavirus. âLike many of you, I have experienced the firsthand effects of Covid-19,"" she said. She canceled what would have been her first appearance last week due to a ""lingering cough"" from the virus. Known to be a reluctant campaigner, she delivered the message her husband is ""a fighter"" and that Democrats espouse ""confusion and fear instead of hope and security"". As she called her husband ""tough but fair,"" someone in the crowd yelled out: ""And handsome"". She responded: ""I agree"". A cutout of Trump's face at the July semifinal match between Oxford United and Portsmouth FC A poll from YouGov finds that about 80% of people in the UK say they would vote for Joe Biden if given the chance, while the remaining 20% say they would support Donald Trump. The poll, conducted for online gambling company Betfair, was taken one week before election day. It found that 38% of Brits who voted leave during the 2016 Brexit referendum would vote for Trump if they could. Among Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters, a whopping 99% said they would vote Biden. About 39% of Conservative voters said they support Trump. In Scotland, the birthplace of Trump's mother, only 12% of people say they would re-elect him. In London, 19% of the city said they support Trump.

Kazakhstan embraces Borat catchphrase 'very nice',"The first Borat film, released in 2006, was banned in Kazakhstan Kazakhstan's tourism board has adopted the Borat catchphrase ""very nice"" in its new advertising campaign. The phrase is used by the film character Borat, a fictional journalist from Kazakhstan. The first Borat film caused outrage in the country, and authorities threatened to sue creator Sacha Baron Cohen. But the country's tourism board has now embraced Borat as a perfect marketing tool - particularly as a second Borat film has just been released. It has released a number of short advertisements that highlight the country's scenery and culture. The peoplein the video,externalthen use Borat's catchphrase ""very nice"". ""Kazakhstan's nature is very nice. Its food is very nice. And its people, despite Borat's jokes to the contrary, are some of the nicest in the world,"" Kairat Sadvakassov, deputy chairman of Kazakh Tourism, said in a statement. The tourism board were persuaded to use the catchphrase by American Dennis Keen and his friend Yermek Utemissov. They pitched the ideaand produced the advertisements,external, according to the New York Times. The response from social media users has been positive with many saying the advertisements capitalise on the film and send a positive message. One said: ""Well done. Great way to take the publicity created by a comedian and turn it to a positive message."" Kazakhstan thanks Borat for 'boosting tourism' What Kazakhstan really thought of Borat The second film itself has had a mixed reception. The Kazakh American Association has slammed the film forpromoting ""racism, cultural appropriation and xenophobia"".,external In a letter sent to Amazon, which has distribution rights to the film, the group asked: ""Why is our small nation fair game for public ridicule?"" In Kazakhstan, more than 100,000 people signed an online petition demanding a cancellation of the film after a trailer was released. ""They completely desecrate and humiliate Kazakhstan and the dignity of the Kazakh nation,"" the petition said. Others on social media branded the film as a ""stupid American comedy"". When the first Borat film was released in 2006, authorities banned the film and release of it on DVD and people were blocked from visiting its website. Officials felt the movie portrayed Kazakhstan as a racist, sexist and primitive country. In the film Borat bragged about incest and rape. He also joked that the former Soviet nation had the cleanest prostitutes in the world. The film also caused outrage in Romania where anentire village said they were ""humiliated"" by the film,external. The village was used as the backdrop for Borat's house. Residents said they were told the film was going to be a documentary, but instead were portrayed as backward people and criminals. Years later, however, the Kazakhstan government thanked Sacha Baron Cohen for boosting tourism in the country. In 2012, the foreign minister at the time, Yerzhan Kazykhanov, said he was ""grateful"" to Borat for ""helping attract tourists"" to the country, adding that 10 times more people were applying for visas to go there.

People 'rediscover books' as lockdown sales jump,"Crescent City: House of Earth and Blood was one of Bloomsbury's best selling titles People have ""rediscovered the pleasure of reading"" in lockdown, publisher Bloomsbury has said, after reporting its best half-year profits since 2008. The firm, best known for publishing the Harry Potter books, said profits jumped 60% to Â£4m from February to August. Online book sales and e-book revenues were both ""significantly higher"". It said bestsellers during the period included ""Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People about Race"" and ""Crescent City: House of Earth and Blood"". Other popular consumer books during the period included ""White Rage"", ""Humankind"" and ""Such A Fun Age"". Nigel Newton, founder and chief executive of Bloomsbury, said the firm initially feared lockdown would batter the business after it shut all its shops in March. But he told the BBC: ""As we cycled through the month there became a real uptake in reading, perhaps people tired of watching streamed movies which they binged on to begin with and turned to books."" He said people's book choices had reflected the mood of the people throughout the past six months: ""In June we published 'Humankind' by Rutger Bregman, people wanted hope and a positive view of humanity, which he gave, and in June itself the biggest social issue of our time, with 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People about Race'. ""[That was] unpinned all the while by the desire to make good food, so the Dishoom cookbook and others really sold terrifically well."" During the period total sales across the group rose by 10% to Â£78.3m. Rose Cole outside Daunt Books in London's Marylebone: ""Customers are enjoying browsing more than ever."" Bloomsbury also said its digital resources division had seen a 47% rise in sales as academic institutions had switched to digital products to support remote learning. Philip Jones, editor of the industry publication the Bookseller, said the last six months had thrown up some interesting trends in book buying behaviour. ""Initially when the stores closed at the start of lockdown in March, online sales were largely brand names, things that were easily searchable, celebrity authors or high-profile TV series. 'Normal People' for example went back to the top of the bestseller lists after being dramatised on TV, but when the shops reopened in June we saw the charts go back to normal."" He told the BBC the renewed enthusiasm for books during the pandemic had continued, and bookshops were unseasonably busy. ""We are seeing an early Christmas for bookshops. November's book sales are happening in October. Normally the bookshop market gets up to Â£40m per week in November, but it has already happened."" In Marylebone in central London, Rose Cole, general manager of independent bookseller Daunt Books, said shops such as hers were a long way from normal as visitors continue to stay out of major cities: ""We are acutely feeling the effects of people staying away from central London and there's obviously a  lot to deter customers from shopping on high streets in the way in which they used to. ""But what we are seeing is that those customers coming in are enjoying the experience of browsing and discovering books more than ever.""

Woolworths High-Street 'relaunch' proves a hoax,"Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing Â£385m A tweet announcing the relaunch of UK High Street retailer Woolworths has gone viral, despite being fake. The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which has now been deleted, misspelled the shop's name. And it linked to a website that was not active and had, BBC News has learned, been registered only hours earlier. Metro, which appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news, has now corrected its story. Very, the company that owns the local rights to the Woolworths brand, confirmed it was a hoax. ""We own the Woolworths trademark in the UK,"" a spokesman told BBC News. ""The Twitter account UKWoolworths is not connected to the Very group."" The original tweet read: ""Here to save 2020. ""Woolworths is coming back to your High Street, as a physical store. ""A couple of legal things to get sorted but we're full steam ahead at Woolworths HQ. ""We want to get this right, so we need your help. ""What do you want at your UK #YourWoolworths?"" Metro appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news Ray Walsh, scam expert at virtual private network (VPN) company ProPrivacy, said: ""It's not unsurprising that huge numbers of people around the UK have fallen for fake news surrounding the reopening of Woolworths. ""The brand was a much-loved part of UK shopping history. ""And many have fond memories of the retailer. ""But the Twitter account spreading the hoax was full of typos and spelling mistakes. ""This alone should have been enough to make it obvious that something extremely fishy was going on. ""The important take away from all of this is how social engineering and nostalgia can be used to trick people. ""And it serves as an important reminder of why people need to think carefully when using the internet to avoid falling for scams and phishing attacks."" The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which now has more than 4,000 followers, misspelled the shop's name Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing Â£385m. The shops, famous for their Pic'n'Mix sweets, also sold kitchen and garden equipment and toys. One of the UK's oldest chains it had 815 stores, many of which were taken over by shops such as Wilko and Poundland. The Woolworths name remains in use in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as an unrelated retail brand. This was the fake news story 2020 needed - and it might seem less important than harmful coronavirus conspiracy theories or political disinformation, which have spread on wildfire on social media in recent months. But it does teach us some important lessons about how and why disinformation spreads on social media. We tend to share posts that we want to be true or that confirm our biases - who isn't missing Woolworth's pic'n'mix, especially during a pandemic? That partly explains why the tweet from the fake Woolworth's account - which kept spelling the name of the chain wrong - went so viral. But it also highlights the need for verification - and the role of the media in amplifying disinformation. A quick ring around would have confirmed that Woolworth's is not re-opening - but that did not stop a number of news outlets covering this fake Twitter account. What happened to Woolworths' stores?

She first started treatment in 2017 and completed her treatment in May 2019. However, she relapsed earlier this year and now requires further treatment and chemotherapy. Her mother, Vicky Fletcher, said: ""She's been through a really tough time the last few months, and it's something [the doctors] wanted to do for a while, but she's been so poorly, so it was a nice special treat for her.""

"At least seven dead in Pakistan school attackDozens more were injured in the attack during a Koran class in the city of Peshawar, police say.","At least seven people have been killed and more than 50 injured by a bomb attack on a religious school in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, police say. Hospital officials say those killed were young men, aged between 20 and 30. Dozens of others were injured, including four under the age of 13. The motive for the attack on a Koran study class is unclear. Hundreds of students were present at the seminary. No group has said it carried out the attack, which is being investigated. Earlier reports suggested four of the dead were children, but this has since been retracted. The northern city of Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, has seen some of the worst of the violence during the Taliban insurgency in recent years. Six years ago, gunmen stormed a military school in the city leaving more than 150 dead, most of them children. However, an army crackdown in the years which followed resulted in the number of attacks being greatly reduced inside Pakistan. The blast took place at about 08:30 local time (03:30 GMT), police told the BBC. About 60 people are understood to have been in the class at the religious school, known as a madrassa. An eyewitness told the police he saw a man enter the building with a bag of explosives shortly before the blast. Images from inside the room show extensive damage. Assistant Inspector General of PoliceShafqat Malik told Pakistan's Express Tribune newspaper that 5kg (11lb) of explosives were used,externalin the attack. Hospital officials told Reuters news agency that they had received dozens of injured, many with burns. The AFP news agency quoted police saying that two teachers were among the injured. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has expressed ""regret over the loss of precious lives"", strongly condemning the blast and promising to bring those behind it to justice. This attack, which follows a bombing in a neighbourhood in Quetta city on Sunday, is reminiscent of the era of widespread militant violence that hit Pakistan in the mid-2000s. It is the first ""soft"" target hit by suspected militants in Peshawar since the 2014 attack on the Army Public School, which shocked the world. That attack prompted the Pakistani army to launch an operation to clear militant sanctuaries along the Pakistan-Afghan border. In November 2016, the army claimed the areas had been cleared of militants. The latest incidents come amid reports suggesting the Taliban have been regrouping in areas which had been cleared. Various attacks have been reported, mainly targeting members of the PTM, a Pashtun nationalist movement that has accused the military of protecting militants as well as widespread human rights abuses. Some analysts fear that the current militant regrouping may be part of a plan not only to counter the PTM and a new opposition alliance aimed at unseating Imran Khan, but also to influence the political process in Afghanistan at a time when American forces are set to pull out from the region. Islamist militants have long been seen by analysts as proxies of the Pakistani security establishment, working to further its strategic aims in the region.

Coronavirus: Tuesday morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. Immunity against coronavirus may only last a few months after infection,according to researchers at Imperial College London. They say the number of people testing positive for antibodies fell by around a quarter between June and September, with the biggest drop in those over 65. They're warning everyone to adhere to guidance on hygiene, social distancing and so on, even if they've already had the virus. The researchers say their findings don't scupper hopes of a vaccine, which may prove more effective than a real infection.Read more on the hunt for a vaccine. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? Fifty-four Conservative MPs have written to Boris Johnsonwarning him he cannot leave people under tier three restrictions in northern England ""with no end in sight"". They want to see an exit strategy from the PM, and a Northern Economic Recovery Plan to guarantee investment in job creation and big infrastructure projects. Warrington is the latest area to enter the highest level of restrictions -see what that meansandwhat support it brings.There's also a warning today thatNorthern schools are facing the greatest disruptionduring this time. A report commissioned by Labour and led by social justice campaigner Lady Lawrencehas blamed decades of structural discriminationfor the disproportionate impact coronavirus has had on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Lady Lawrence cites things such as barriers to healthcare and worse employment prospects, which leave non-white people more vulnerable. She's made 19 recommendations for ministers, but a government spokesman said it was important not to automatically assume disparities were ""evidence of discrimination or unfair treatment"". The first quarterly report for the government on Covid disparities recently highlighted several key factors Many public Bonfire Night and Diwali events have been cancelled this year due to Covid, anddoctors are warning people against attempting their own firework displays at home instead.Plastic surgeons fear there will be a big increase in injuries, especially to the eyes and hands. They say the potential risk is too high and could put further pressure on the already stretched NHS. A new mural has been created in east Londoncelebrating the diversity of the NHS. Members of the public across the UK were invited to create more than 200 flowers in honour of the nationalities represented in the workforce.

Traveller families win High Court battle over land,"Six Traveller families have won a High Court appeal against a decision which would stop them living on land they own in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. Charlotte Smith and her five neighbours were told by the local council to move off the land because they didn't have planning permission to live there. The families initially appealed to the Planning Inspectorate - which sided with the local authority. But that decision was quashed by the High Court earlier this month. The families' fight is not over and they still don't have planning permission to live on the land but say they feel they ""can relax a little bit now"". ""My first initial reaction at the result was I did have a little tear,"" mum-of-four Charlotte tells me. ""Even though we've still got a fight, it feels like a weight has been lifted."" Charlotte and the five other families have lived on the land for more than two-and-a-half years now The families say they bought the land to give them ""a place to call home"" after previously living on the roadside. But Newark and Sherwood District Council says the site isn't suitable to live on because it's at risk of flooding. Local authorities in England are expected to have a five-year plan which sets out how they will deliver enough sites in the area for their Gypsy and Traveller communities. Newark and Sherwood council doesn't have one. The families' lawyers argued the Planning Inspectorate's decision was flawed because it failed to treat the lack of a plan as ""a significant material consideration"". The High Court agreed and quashed the original ruling at a hearing on 16 October. Charlotte's daughter wrote a letter to the PM asking to stay on the land Charlotte says the weeks leading up to the High Court hearing have been ""emotional"" for all of the families - as they didn't know which way the decision would go. She tells me how her daughter surprised her with a letter to read in the car as she travelled down to London for the hearing. Addressed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, it read: ""I am a 10-year-old girl in year five and I am a traveller. Can we live at Old Winthorpe Road Stable Yard? The council won't let us live there and I live in Newark."" Read more: 'We just want to live on the land we legally own' She says her kids were ""jumping for joy"" when she returned home to tell them they'd won their appeal. ""I did tell my daughter it was because of her letter,"" Charlotte laughs. ""Obviously she doesn't know the legal side of things and I just thought it would build her spirits. ""Everyone is just ecstatic. I can't put into words how it actually makes me feel."" Charlotte says the children who live on the land have ""their freedom but in a safe environment"" Since I wrote about the families' fightback in SeptemberI've had quite a few emails about it - and there's been a mix of opinions. ""I admire their desire to give the children the stability they now have to enable them to receive full-time education without losing their cultural identity,"" one reader said. ""We would all love to buy a field and build a home for our family on it, but for those of us that actually abide by the law, it's not an option,"" another wrote. ""Are they really integrating into the community? They sound just like our local site here in Kent,"" one email read. ""Reality is they do what they like, don't care about anybody else, steal what they like and generally are horrible people."" I ask Charlotte how she feels about this. Charlotte says the six families ""want to be part of the local community"" ""Just because you've had a bad experience with a couple of families that live locally, that doesn't mean everybody's the same,"" she says. ""I'm happy to welcome anybody down and make them a cup of tea. You'll find we're actually lovely people, we're working class people, we pay our taxes, we're not sponging off the government. ""We didn't break into a local park or anything like that, we bought our land. Yes we put in our planning application retrospectively but we're trying our best, otherwise we'd still be on the roadside now. We want to be part of the community."" The land is separated from the village of Winthorpe by the A1 road and Charlotte says the families have the backing of the Winthorpe Estate Residents' Group - which has been posting messages of support on Twitter.

The Planning Inspectorate now has 28 days from the High Court ruling to appeal against the decision. If it doesn't, the families' original appeal will need to be reheard by the inspectorate again. A spokesman said: ""The quality and accuracy of our decisions is very important to the Planning Inspectorate. We have been informed of the judgement and are awaiting a copy of the court order before deciding whether to seek leave to appeal."" Newark and Sherwood District Councilhas found it needs to deliver 77 sites,externalfor the Gypsy and Traveller community by 2024 - and 118 sites by 2033. It says maintaining a deliverable five-year supply of Gypsy and Traveller sites is ""challenging for many local authorities across England"". ""The council is working proactively to allocate land for future development, so these needs can be met,"" it added. It says local landowners are being asked to put their land forward for consideration as potential sites and it will continue to consider individual planning applications from all sections of the community.

In other election related news: Catch up on all the latest here: Biden hits new battleground, Trump blitzes Midwest The Trump campaign has released a clip going after Biden for using a quote that comes from the Pope. The selectively edited clip shows Biden saying: ""Why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?â as if he has suddenly forgotten what has motivated him to run for president. What ""@TrumpWarRoom"" neglected to mention is that Biden was quoting Pope Francis' questions that he says all leaders should ask themselves when they seek office. A Biden spokesman accused the Trump campaign of âattacking Joe Bidenâs faith"". (If elected, Biden would be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy). For those who missed the full speech, Biden's quote was followed by these words: ""Pope Francis asked the questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation. And to heal this nation."" Both candidates in the US presidential election have vowed to be tough on China - but disentangling the worldâs two biggest economies is very complicated. The BBCâs Zhaoyin Feng is from China, but has lived in the US for years. She investigates how rivalry between the two countries is affecting the rest of the world. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world A Canadian senator who has twice beensuspended from parliament for behaviour deemed racisthas been caught making an illegal contribution to the Republican National Committee,according to Vice,external. Lynn Beyak, listed her home address as Dryden, New York, rather than Dryden, Ontario, (where she actually resides) when she donated $300 (Â£230) to Trump in May. The former real estate agent also listed her occupation as ""retired"" despite being a sitting senator. It is illegal under US election law for non-Americans to give money to any political campaign. Foreign nationals are, however, allowed to volunteer for campaigns. A spokesperson for Beyak told Vice that the ""donation was made in error and is being returned in its entirety, simply because it was erroneous"". But the news outlet reports that the donation has not yet been returned by the Republican National Committee. President Trump has made no secret of his desire to win over women (especially suburban women) this election. He is 15 points behind Biden in support from female voters, according to the latest Economist/YouGov poll and 23 points back by the New York Times' count. Campaigning in Michigan earlier today, he had a surprising pitch to get their vote. This video can not be played President Trump: 'We're getting your husbands back to work' With just seven days to go until the election, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in the national polls. The latest data puts Biden about 10 points ahead of Trump. While national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, itâs important to remember that the election could come down to results in just a few key states. At the moment, polls in the battleground states also look good for Biden. They suggest he has big leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to clinch victory in 2016. You can read more about the latest polls here A judge in Michigan has blocked a ban on the open display of guns near polling locations on election day. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued a directive earlier this month banning people from openly carrying guns within 100 feet of polling sites. The ban was announced days afterthe FBI said it had thwarted a plot to abduct and overthrow Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer,and amid concerns over voter intimidation and violence. Gun-rights groups argued that Benson, a Democrat, had overstepped her authority and had failed to observe the formal rule-making process required by law to pass the ban. Judge Christopher Murray sided with them on Tuesday. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has vowed to appeal against the ruling. ""Everybody in Washington knows that Joe Biden is weak,"" begins Trump's latest video tweet. With seven days left until election day, Trump and Biden have each released political adverts that are sure to play frequently until 3 November. While a pair of Biden hits talk about the candidate as a choice for decency, the Trump direct-to-camera advert warns that Democrats are lawless socialists who are ""bad for our country"". ""We're calling them out and we're calling out the radical left,"" he says. ""Go out and vote. We will not have a socialist nation, or even worse. It could be worse than a socialist nation, and you know what that means,"" he continues. ""Vote early and in person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had."" Our correspondent is traveling with the president as he campaigns in the Midwest Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A cold rain mixed with ice fell as Trump spoke in Lansing, Michigan If Donald Trump loses the White House next week, it wonât be for a lack of effort on the campaign trail down the stretch. He has kicked off a three-day, multi-state swing across the country with a stop in Lansing, Michigan. Despite a temperature hovering just above freezing as light rain mixed with ice pelted the airfield, a crowd of several thousand waited for hours to see the president. âIâm working my ass off,â Trump told the cheering throngs of people. The president went on to speak for more than an hour, mixing in his normal stump-speech attacks on Joe Biden with some more focused riffs on immigration and trade in the automotive industry-dominated state. Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite polls before the election showing him behind, sometimes by large margins. The polls arenât encouraging for the president this time around either, but another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. Biden was speaking to a drive-in rally in Atlanta Biden is speaking at his second Georgia event of the day. ""Hello, Atlanta,"" he says, as he comes to the stage to music by local rap group Outkast. ""My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Kamala Harris' running mate,"" he says as cars beep their horn in approval at this drive-in rally. He thanked the audience for ""helping to create the change that you know is possible"" and thanked rapper Common who introduced him. ""Folks, I think we're gonna surprise the living devil out of everybody this year,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate,"" he continued, calling for the normally Republican southern state to send two Democrats to Washington next year ""to fight for your interest, not for Donald Trump's interests"". Acknowledging that we're now in the final stretch before election day, he tells Atlanta: ""Folks, it's go time."" Roosevelt frequently visited Warm Springs Joe Biden is due to appear in Atlanta, Georgia for his second campaign stop of the day in the state, but earlier, he drew on the memory of former US President Franklin D Roosevelt as he campaigned in Warm Springs. FDR, the Democrat who led the US during the Great Depression and through World War Two, retreated to the town to seek treatment for polio. Biden spoke of the significance of the small town (population 400). ""This place represented a way forward,"" he said. ""A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing"". It ""is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healedâ¦ That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.â Biden also quoted a speech FDR drafted before his death. âTo live together and work together. Thatâs how I see America. Thatâs how I see the presidency, and thatâs how I see the future,â he said. Georgia has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992. But polls suggest a close race this year and Biden says he has a ""fighting chance"". Socially distanced supporters in Warm Springs, GA British pop star Harry Styles might not be eligible to vote in the upcoming election but that hasnât stopped him from endorsing Democrat Joe Biden. Taking to Twitter, the former One Direction singer wrote: âIf I could vote in America, Iâd vote with kindness."" The post was accompanied by a video from Bidenâs campaign.

This video can not be played Melania Trump: 'Media created picture of my husband I don't recognise' After polls close in the US presidential election on 3 November, it could take days or even weeks to find out if Joe Biden or Donald Trump has won. Millions more Americans have voted or are still expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the ballots is likely. It was previously common for states to restrict voting by post to certain people - such as the elderly, ill, or those away from home. But the practice is now widely permitted in a majority of states. An estimated 80 million postal ballots,externalwill be cast this time round - more than double the number in 2016. Postal votes also take longer to count once they have arrived and different states have different rules over how and when they count them. Find out more about when we're likely to get a result - and if it could be contested - here. Donald Trump has begun a busy day of campaigning with a rally in the battleground state of Michigan. Most polls show Democrat Joe Biden leading in the state, which Trump took narrowly in 2016. But Trump told thousands of supporters gathered for the rally that he had momentum behind him as the election nears. âSeven days from now weâre going to win the great state of Michigan,â he said. ""A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream,"" he later said. It would be hard to argue with Trump's assessment of supporters' enthusiasm.

Obama puts his mask back on after leaving the stage in Orlando Barack Obama has been campaigning for his former VP Joe Biden, and laid into comments from top Trump aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Orlando, Florida today. Kushner told Fox News on Monday that Trump ""canât want them to be successful more than they want to be successful"", referring to African Americans. That posture is a problem, America's first black president said. ""Who are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to?"" Obama asked. He mocked Trump's claim to be the best president for black people since Abraham Lincoln, the president who ended slavery.

Speaking in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, First Lady Melania Trump has just made her first solo appearance to support her husband's campaign. The Slovenian-born ex-model was introduced by Trump's former aide, Kellyanne Conway, who claimed the first lady had ""amazing political instincts"". Trump referred to her family's recent  brush with the ""silent enemy"" of the coronavirus. âLike many of you, I have experienced the firsthand effects of Covid-19,"" she said. She canceled what would have been her first appearance last week due to a ""lingering cough"" from the virus. Known to be a reluctant campaigner, she delivered the message her husband is ""a fighter"" and that Democrats espouse ""confusion and fear instead of hope and security"".

It found that 38% of Brits who voted leave during the 2016 Brexit referendum would vote for Trump if they could. Among Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters, a whopping 99% said they would vote Biden. About 39% of Conservative voters said they support Trump. In Scotland, the birthplace of Trump's mother, only 12% of people say they would re-elect him. In London, 19% of the city said they support Trump.

Thanks for joining us. Today's coverage was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Paul Gribben, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. We'll be back again tomorrow with all the latest news. Have a good evening. Today's live page will be closing shortly. Here's a round-up of the key virus-related stories of the day from the UK and around the world: House of LordsParliament Andy Burnham has attacked the government for using a ""crude"" system to calculate how much financial help each area of England under the toughest - tier three - Covid restrictions receives. Appearing before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, the Greater Manchester mayor said Whitehall allocated Â£20 in business support per person in the affected areas. This didn't take into account differences between cities like his own and Liverpool and other less urban areas under tier three, such as Lancashire, Labour's Mr Burnham argued. More firms operated in cities and so they needed more money to keep jobs going. Otherwise, he said, there would be a ""lot of levelling down"" across northern England. ""When we get through this, cities and city regions are going to be in the vanguard of the recovery,"" Mr Burnham added. Announcing more help for businesses last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it would ""be part of the country pulling together in the coming months"". He promised that ""our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs"". With Halloween just days away, many may be wondering if Halloween's time honoured traditions - like trick or treating or apple bobbing - can go ahead in the age of Covid. The answer? It depends on where you live.  You can read morehere.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Another 367 deaths linked to Covid have been reported in the UK on Tuesday - the highest daily figure since May. The news is alarming, but there are some caveats. Figures tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of the delays over the weekend in reporting deaths. These are deaths that have actually happened over the past week or so. If you look at the deaths as they correspond to the date they occurred, the numbers have not topped 200 a day throughout this second wave. That compares to a peak of 1,000 daily deaths in the spring. What we are seeing - with cases, hospitalisations and deaths - is a gradual, but sustained rise since the end of summer. Until this slows, the sad reality is the number of deaths will keep rising. Coronavirus is surging in many parts of the world, with Europe currently seeing the steepest rise in new cases. Spain and France have become the first western European countries to record more than one million cases, and several others have recorded their highest number of new infections since the start of the pandemic. Spain has declared a state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew. Italy has ordered bars, restaurants, gyms and cinemas to close,leading to protests.France has imposed a night-time curfew on major cities and on Tuesday,the Czech Republic introduced a week-long ban on people leaving their homesbetween 21:00 and 04:59 each day. Pubs and restaurants in many areas of Scotland will be able to serve alcohol indoors again from next week,the first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon said the move would allow licensed premises in level two of the country's new five-tier system to serve alcohol with a meal until 8pm. In level three areas - likely to be much of the central belt - they can reopen but must not serve alcohol. The new rules are expected to come into force from Monday. James ShawBBC Scotland reporter First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that two local authorities in Scotland may come under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions from next week. She said level four measures may be necessary in North and South Lanarkshire because of very high transmission rates - no Scottish council is currently under such restrictions. However, she also suggested the rate of infection may be stablising and the strictest controls would only be imposed if absolutely necessary. Under tier four, schools remain open but all non-essential shops, as well as pubs and restaurants, would be closed. Speaking at Holyrood, the first minister said most of the central belt would be at level three - broadly the same as tier three in England. Much of rest of the country would be at level two, but the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and Moray would be at level one. Dundee is expected to be at level three. Ms Sturgeon said final decisions would be announced on Thursday. Read more. People living in Nottingham and surrounding boroughs have been
urged to keep showing ""resilience"" ahead ofnew tier three controls coming into force. Tougher Covid-19 rules for Nottingham city and the Broxtowe,
Gedling and Rushcliffe borough council areas begin on Thursday, with
finer details of the measures expected to be outlined later today. Rushcliffe Borough Council leader Simon Robinson said: ""We've got two months before Christmas.
I am confident, if we get on top of these restrictions, get compliance from
business from our residents, we are going to see the infection rate coming down
and going in the right direction. ""If that is the case, I am sure we'll get the support from
government to actually start to reduce these restrictions and give people that
freedom and get some enjoyment out of Christmas."" However, some Nottingham pub owners have said it is ""heartbreaking"" they will be forced to close their businesses while tier three restrictions are in place. One landlord said he felt pubs had been blamed for the city's infection rate rise. Read more about that here. A further 367 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. This is the highest daily death figure since May. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,365. There have also been a further 22,885 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 0900 on Tuesday. This brings the total number of cases in the UK to 917,575. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been giving a statement to the Scottish Parliament to kick-start a debate about her government's new five-tier system of restrictions for tackling Covid-19. A vote is due to be held around 19:00 So far she has stressed the importance of ""flexibility"" under the five-tier system, which comes into force on 2 November. Ms Sturgeon confirmed the details will be kept under review as the system develops. ""This may be particularly important for the hospitality industry,"" she added. She also announced that pubs and restaurants in many parts of Scotland will be able to service alcohol indoors again from next week. The move would allow licensed premises in level two of the country's new five-tier system to serve alcohol with a meal until mid-evening. Find out more about howthe tier system will work. By George Herd, BBC News Anglesey was one of the few places in north Wales to avoid local lockdown, but has been impacted by the current firebreak lockdown The tourism industry in Wales needs urgent clarity on rules after thenational Covid firebreak lockdownends, say industry insiders. Emotions in the sector are turning from ""anxiety to anger"" in some parts of the country. Jim Jones, managing director of North Wales Tourism, called the decision to introduce the national firebreak ""draconian"". He said the economic impact was being felt across the whole of the hospitality sector in the region, including the supply chain behind the tourism industry. ""We're already hearing of redundancies, or job losses, and questions of whether businesses will open,"" said Mr Jones. ""It's the uncertainty going forward - and the anxiety, which is now turning to anger. ""It's the lack of information, the lack of engagement that we are having at this moment in time with Welsh Government and business. ""We are the last to find out, yet we're the ones dealing with the brunt of it all."" The tourism industry in Wales was worth an estimated Â£6.3bn in spending by visitors in 2018, according to government figures. ""Tourism is extremely important to our economy and we know this is an incredibly challenging time for businesses,"" a Welsh Government official said and stressed engagement with the industry was ongoing.

Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has criticised Tesco for not enforcing
coronavirus rules on masks. He told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee that, during recent talks with the government over tier three restrictions, he had asked for powers to close businesses not deemed to be doing enough to make themselves Covid-safe. Mr Burnham said: ""I'm not just talking
about pubs and restaurants. There are large supermarkets in Greater Manchester who in my view have not properly implemented the requirements around face
coverings. ""I'll name one chain, Tesco. I don't believe they have taken a
responsible attitude to this issue. They've said it's not for them to enforce. Well, I think it is for those organisations to enforce."" The BBC has contacted Tesco for comment.  Talks between the Scottish government and the football authorities aimed at seeing a return of fans to gameswill take place later this week. Scotland moves to a five-tier Covid-19 restrictions system from next Monday. And the Scottish FA and SPFL have asked what that means for football, given the proposed framework says areas in tiers zero and one can open stadiums to a restricted number of fans. Apart from two test games in September, fans have not been allowed since March. The coronavirus lockdown has led many would-be couples to try out new ways of dating as restrictions have made meeting in person more tricky. Now, the dating app Tinder is to roll out one-to-one video calls for its worldwide users after an initial trial among a small number worldwide. Rival Bumble already allows video calling. The free ""Face to Face"" feature will allow potential matches to speak to each other on camera if both people want it and are facing the camera. In May, the firm's chief executive Elie Seidman said that the pandemic had had a ""dramatic"" effect on the way people used the app. Although engagement was up - the app saw a record three billion swipes on one day in March - there was less interest in paid-for premium subscriptions. The vast majority of Tinder's revenues come from its six million subscribers who pay for the ""gold"" service. The rate at which it picked up those precious paying-users declined as lockdown struck.

Unveiling it at a virtual press conference, he said the initiative - called oneGM - was ""the Greater Manchester family coming together on a cross-community basis to see how weâre going
to support people and businesses through what is going to be a really challenging winter"". He says the scheme will have three elements, including:  The Labour mayor said local leaders were ""hopeful"" to get Â£65m in government support -despite No 10 offering Â£60m- ""because of the decision to backdate tier two support"". He said leaders planned to put a business support package in place to help low-paid workers whose workplaces shut as well as the self-employed and industries where freelancers predominate, such as the arts sector. Mr Burnham was joined on the call by speakers  involved with the region, including the former Manchester United player and Salford City football club owner Gary Neville and the Bishop of Manchester, David Walker. It comes as the region became the first in England to be moved intotier three restrictions, against local leaders' wishes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

So the Essex care home where she lives arranged with the family to screen the ceremony live at the Prince Edward Duke of Kent Court Care Home in Stisted. The home also put on canapes, a three-course meal and promised a spot of dancing. Kathryn and Tom even cut the cake outside Dot's window. """"Really they're doing more than we are,"" joked groom Tom.

Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The percentage of pupils in class across England's state primary and secondary schools fell last week from 89% to 86%, government statistics show. The Department for Education said approximately 26% of schools - 55% of secondaries and 20% of primaries - reported having one or more pupils self-isolating due to potential contact with a case of coronavirus inside the school, compared to 21% of schools last week. But ""the vast majority of these schools remain open to most pupils"", The Northern Powerhouse - aimed at redressing North-South economic imbalance - says pupils in the North face the most disruption over Covid-19. As attendance rates fall, there are growing concerns that pupils in the north of England are missing more school than their peers in other parts of the country. Analysis from the North West Association of the Directors of Children's Services, seen exclusively by the BBC, reveals the pressures. Read more about the story here.

"Fifty Tory MPs call for 'road map' out of lockdownNorthern areas hit hardest by Covid restrictions risk being ""left behind"", a letter to the PM warns.","More than 50 Tory MPs have written to the prime minister calling for a ""clear road map"" out of lockdown restrictions in northern England, warning the region risks being ""left behind"". The letter from the Northern Research Group said the pandemic threatened Boris Johnson's pledge to ""level-up"". They also called for an economic recovery plan for the region, arguing it had been hardest hit by the virus. No 10 said it was ""committed to levelling up across the country"". And speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he shared the MPs' ""frustrations at restrictions"" adding that the government wanted to invest in northern areas. All the areas under the strictest restrictions of the government's three-tier system for England are in the North or the Midlands. Warrington has become the latest area to join the Liverpool City Region,Greater Manchester, Lancashire and South Yorkshire in the top tier, whileNottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the highest tier on Thursday. This will mean about eight million people in England will be living under the toughest restrictions, which are reviewed after 28 days, by the end of the week. In areas under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals must close and households are not allowed to mix indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens.

Russ Bowden, Labour leader of Warrington Council, said he could not see a way out of the top tier of restrictions for his area, adding that he did not know what measurements the government were using for putting places in tier three in the first place. He also told Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are no clear rules about what the success criteria are with the tiers and how you move between the different tiered layers."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously raised the issue in the House of Commons, saying that the top tier was a ""gateway"" to potentially months and months of ""agony"" from which there was no exit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""simplest and most effective way"" for areas to get out of tier three was to get the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - ""down to one or below"". The Department of Health also said other data taken into account includedwhich age groups were being affected and the pressures facing the NHS in those areas. Some 40 Conservative MPs representing areas in the north of England, North Wales and the Scottish borders, have publicly signed the letter, including former cabinet ministers David Davis, David Mundell and Esther McVey, while a further 14 have had their names redacted. The newly-formed Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers is led by former Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry. In their letter, the group called for the prime minister to set out ""a clear road map down the tiering system and out of lockdown"", warning restrictions were ""disproportionately"" affecting people in the north of the country. ""The virus has exposed in sharp relief the deep structural and systemic disadvantage faced by our communities and it threatens to continue to increase the disparity between the North and South still further,"" they said. Mr Berry who represents Rossendale and Darwen said ""We are asking people to give up huge civil liberties, businesses to close, people to live on two thirds of their normal wages. ""I don't think it is unreasonable to say the other side of that coin should be 'show us the way out'."" He also denied that he and other northern MPs were staging a ""revolt"" against the government, saying they were asking the prime minister to ""reaffirm"" his commitment to ""stimulate the North"". December's general election saw the Conservatives demolish the ""red wall"" - winning seats in the north of England from Labour it hadn't held in a generation. The government pledged to repay that support before the pandemic hit, throwing normal politics up in the air. Boris Johnson has continued to talk about that agenda - but the signatories of this letter are worried that Covid will see some of the pledges made fall down the political priority list. In particular, they share concerns with many Labour leaders in the North that there isn't a clear road map out of restrictions. It's been a bruising few weeks for the government's relationship with the North, with very public rows over support for local economies. These MPs support the government - and say their intervention is designed to influence its plans. But it also shows fears for the north of England are shared across the political spectrum The group welcomed the financial support already in place for businesses, such as the furlough scheme and extra funding for local authorities under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. But they added: ""We do however share concerns that the cost of Covid could be paid for by the downgrading of the levelling-up agenda, and northern constituencies like ours will be left behind."" Mr Johnson won a majority of 80 seats in December's election, with many traditionally Labour constituencies in the so-called ""Red Wall"" turning Conservative blue.

Fifty Tory MPs call for 'road map' out of lockdown,"More than 50 Tory MPs have written to the prime minister calling for a ""clear road map"" out of lockdown restrictions in northern England, warning the region risks being ""left behind"". The letter from the Northern Research Group said the pandemic threatened Boris Johnson's pledge to ""level-up"". They also called for an economic recovery plan for the region, arguing it had been hardest hit by the virus. No 10 said it was ""committed to levelling up across the country"". And speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he shared the MPs' ""frustrations at restrictions"" adding that the government wanted to invest in northern areas. All the areas under the strictest restrictions of the government's three-tier system for England are in the North or the Midlands. Warrington has become the latest area to join the Liverpool City Region,Greater Manchester, Lancashire and South Yorkshire in the top tier, whileNottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the highest tier on Thursday. This will mean about eight million people in England will be living under the toughest restrictions, which are reviewed after 28 days, by the end of the week.

HSBC to accelerate cost cutting restructure,"Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, has said it could start charging for ""basic banking services"" in some countries after it reported a 35% fall in quarterly profits. It said it was considering charging for products such as current accounts, which are free to UK customers. The bank said it was losing money on a ""large number"" of such accounts. A spokesman later told the BBC it was committed to continuing to provide free ""basic bank accounts"" in the UK . But they added: ""We always keep under review the pricing for our standard current accounts and associated services."" Very few banks charge for standard bank accounts, but experts say this could change if the UK falls into negative interest rates due to the pandemic. That would see the Bank of England take interest rates below zero to help boost consumer spending and revive the economy. HSBC's shares dive to lowest level since 1995 HSBC glitch led to thousands of small business loans in the wrong name HSBC and StanChart back China security laws for HK HSBC reported a 35% fall in pre-tax profit during the third quarter of the year to $3.1bn (Â£2.3bn), while revenues fell 11%. Along with other banks, it has seen earnings hit amid an environment of rock bottom interest rates, and so is now considering other ways of boosting revenues. The lender also said it would accelerate its restructuring plan, cutting costs further than previously suggested. But HSBC, which is in the midst of cutting 35,000 jobs, did not say whether more jobs would now go. It said it would provide details on the plan with its full-year results next February. Despite the tough environment, HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn said there were some bright spots. ""These were promising results against a backdrop of the continuing impacts of Covid-19 on the global economy,"" he said. ""I'm pleased with the significantly lower credit losses in the quarter, and we are moving at pace to adapt our business model to a protracted low interest rate environment."" HSBC had set aside between $8bn and $13bn for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it now says its expenses are likely to be at the lower end of that range. In September, HSBC's share price fell to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations that the bank had allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world, even after learning of the scam. The bank has also faced recent criticism from the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for supporting China's controversial security legislation in Hong Kong. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, HSBC was restructuring with a plan to cut $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) of costs by 2022. At its peak, the bank employed more than 300,000 people, but since the global financial crisis, the bank has trimmed its operations significantly.

Northern England schools 'most disrupted by Covid',"More children are missing out on their education, as the rate of attendance falls across England's schools. The percentage of pupils attending primary and secondary schools fell to 86% last week down from 89% the previous week, government data shows. The Northern Powerhouse, a group working to redress North-South economic imbalance, says pupils in the North face the most disruption over Covid-19. The government said some pupils were self-isolating ""as we would expect"". The Department for Education said 55% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England reported having one or more pupils self-isolating due to potential contact with a case of coronavirus in the school. This is up from 46% and 16% respectively on the previous week. Overall attendance at primary school fell from 92% in the week ending 15 October to 90% in the week ending 22 October. But the drop on the previous week's attendance was most significant in secondary schools, falling from 87% to 83%.

Geoff Barton, head of the school leaders' union ASCL, said the figures painted a ""grim picture of the increasingly challenging picture facing schools"". As attendance rates fall, there are growing concerns that pupils in the north of England are missing more school than their peers in other parts of the country. Analysis from the North West Association of the Directors of Children's Services, seen exclusively by the BBC, reveals the pressures. In mid-October Bury, Knowsley, Liverpool and Manchester all had more than 40% of schools with confirmed cases - some of these were among teachers. Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools Covid school disruption getting worse in England School figures show 88% back for start of term What happens if someone in school tests positive? According to the report, which is based on a snapshot of 16 October, there were 710 teachers with a positive test for coronavirus in the North West - this was 35% of the total of confirmed cases among teachers across England on that day. The Northern Powerhouse wants next year's exams ditched in favour of coursework, saying pupils in the north of England had been particularly badly affected by disruption to their schooling. But the government says exams are ""the fairest way"" of judging performance and ministers have said exams will go ahead in summer 2021, with a three-week delay. About eight million pupils in England were sent home in March It pointed out that some areas in the North had attendance rates for secondary school as low as 61%, whereas others in the South were close to the usual national figure of 95%. It added: ""We appreciate the government's desire to try and keep things as normal as possible, but this is now unrealistic in many northern communities. ""We urge the government to commit to continuous assessment as it is a fairer alternative to the proposed examination plan."" The government is consulting on contingency measures to manage any disruption to GCSEs, A-levels and BTecs in 2021, and has said it will produce plans before Christmas. A DfE spokesperson said: ""Exams are the fairest way of judging a student's performance, which is why they will go ahead next year, underpinned by contingency measures developed in partnership with the sector. ""Over the coming weeks we will jointly identify any risks to exams and the measures needed to address potential disruption, with fairness for students continuing to be our priority."" The spokesperson added that schools had plans in place to deliver remote education for self-isolating pupils and the government was providing an initial additional allocation of 150,000 devices for eligible children. The CEO of Ormiston Academy Trust, Nick Hudson, urged the government to publish data on attendance broken down by local authority, amid concern that pupils in the worst-affected areas might be falling further behind. ""To be fair to young people the data needs to be transparent, then we can ensure that we put as much equity into the system, especially those sitting exams,"" he said. ""If we experience the same levels of staff absence as we have in the first half-term between now and the end of term, it would be very difficult to ensure consistent education for all of our pupils in all of our schools - that would mean looking at the possibility of rotas.""

Children among dead in Pakistan school attack,"At least seven people have been killed and more than 50 injured by a bomb attack on a religious school in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, police say. Hospital officials say those killed were young men, aged between 20 and 30. Dozens of others were injured, including four under the age of 13. The motive for the attack on a Koran study class is unclear. Hundreds of students were present at the seminary. No group has said it carried out the attack, which is being investigated. Earlier reports suggested four of the dead were children, but this has since been retracted. The northern city of Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, has seen some of the worst of the violence during the Taliban insurgency in recent years. Six years ago, gunmen stormed a military school in the city leaving more than 150 dead, most of them children. However, an army crackdown in the years which followed resulted in the number of attacks being greatly reduced inside Pakistan. The blast took place at about 08:30 local time (03:30 GMT), police told the BBC. About 60 people are understood to have been in the class at the religious school, known as a madrassa. An eyewitness told the police he saw a man enter the building with a bag of explosives shortly before the blast. Images from inside the room show extensive damage. Assistant Inspector General of PoliceShafqat Malik told Pakistan's Express Tribune newspaper that 5kg (11lb) of explosives were used,externalin the attack. Hospital officials told Reuters news agency that they had received dozens of injured, many with burns. The AFP news agency quoted police saying that two teachers were among the injured. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has expressed ""regret over the loss of precious lives"", strongly condemning the blast and promising to bring those behind it to justice. This attack, which follows a bombing in a neighbourhood in Quetta city on Sunday, is reminiscent of the era of widespread militant violence that hit Pakistan in the mid-2000s. It is the first ""soft"" target hit by suspected militants in Peshawar since the 2014 attack on the Army Public School, which shocked the world. That attack prompted the Pakistani army to launch an operation to clear militant sanctuaries along the Pakistan-Afghan border. In November 2016, the army claimed the areas had been cleared of militants. The latest incidents come amid reports suggesting the Taliban have been regrouping in areas which had been cleared. Various attacks have been reported, mainly targeting members of the PTM, a Pashtun nationalist movement that has accused the military of protecting militants as well as widespread human rights abuses. Some analysts fear that the current militant regrouping may be part of a plan not only to counter the PTM and a new opposition alliance aimed at unseating Imran Khan, but also to influence the political process in Afghanistan at a time when American forces are set to pull out from the region. Islamist militants have long been seen by analysts as proxies of the Pakistani security establishment, working to further its strategic aims in the region.

Warrington moves into tier 3 restrictions,"Extra restrictions on socialising have come into force in Warrington Warrington is the latest area to move into the top tier of Covid-19 measures as infection rates continue to rise. Tier three restrictions came into force at midnight in the Cheshire town -two days earlier than originally planned. Council leader Russ Bowden said it was the right decision to move Warrington into the ""very high"" Covid alert level. ""This is a public health imperative. What we need to do is protect the lives of our residents,"" he said. ""And - obviously alongside that - [it is about] protecting businesses and jobs here in the town"". He added that one of the main concerns was the ""way the cases have propagated into the older working age population and particularly those people above 60"". Check the restrictions where you live Warrington, which is home to about 210,000 people, joins the Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire in tier three. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshirewill move into the top tierfrom Thursday. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision to move Warrington into tier three was agreed with local leaders as ""it's time to take action"" due to rising infection rates. ""Please remember - now is the time for us all to work together to get this virus under control,"" he said. Warrington is the latest area to move into the most stringent measures The new rules mean: Residents must not socialise with anyone outside their household or support bubble in any indoor setting - including homes and private gardens - or at most outdoor hospitality venues They must not socialise in a group of more than six in an outdoor public space, such as parks Pubs and bars that do not serve substantial meals as a restaurant must close Residents are advised to avoid travelling outside the area, unless for essential journeys, such as work or caring responsibilities Betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos and soft play centres will also close Mr Bowden told Radio 4's Today programme that cases remained ""stubbornly high"" and he was worried about ""Covid fatigue"" with people unable to see a way out of the tougher restrictions. He said: ""There are  no clear rules about what the success criteria are with the tiers and how you move between the different tiered layers."" Mr Bowden added: ""The vast majority of people have applied themselves to the rules and we are asking people again to step up and take responsibility for their actions to protect their loved ones. "" Placed between Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Warrington currently has an infection rate similar to areas on the lower end of tier three, but it is rising. The latest government figures to the 23 October suggest 399 people for every 100,000 had Covid, not far off double the rate seen a month ago and the 36th highest rate of England's 315 local authorities. Geographically, its infection rate is closer to areas like St Helens to the north-west (437 per 100,000) and Trafford to the east (428 per 100,000) rather than other parts of Cheshire, where the rate is around 200 per 100,000. Since the start of the pandemic Warrington has seen 189 deaths due to coronavirus, with 14 of those in the week to the 23 October. As it stands, only 19 other authorities saw more deaths over the same period. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed the tier three measures for Warrington will be reviewed in 28 days' time. ""The restrictions we have agreed together will only be in place for as long as they are absolutely necessary,"" he said. As part of the tier three move, the council has received a Â£5.9m support package from the government, incorporating Â£1.68m for public health and Â£4.2m for business and employment support. The Lower Angel pub in Warrington town centre will be forced to close under the tightened measures. Landlord Andrew Wharfe, who has worked there for 13 years, said he has never seen it so quiet. Landlord Andrew Wharfe said the pub had been quiet in recent weeks ""We're not big enough to serve food so we have to shut,"" he said, adding it had been an upsetting time. Mr Wharfe said he had been planning to step down from the job next year - a decision he made before the pandemic - but this was now uncertain. ""This has put a nail in the coffin - we have had enough,"" he said. Pauline Mellor, 56, who lives in Warrington, said: ""My first grandchild was born in July and it is killing me not being able to see him."" She said she knew the rules but believed ""they won't work"". Pauline Mellor said ""it is killing"" her not being able to see her three-month-old grandchild ""I work in a supermarket, and so many customers, even with a mask, come up close to you. ""I know we can meet outdoors in tier three but it is too cold - especially for a three-month-old baby,"" she added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work?

Fifty Tory MPs call for 'roadmap' out of lockdown,"More than 50 Tory MPs have written to the prime minister calling for a ""clear road map"" out of lockdown restrictions in northern England, warning the region risks being ""left behind"". The letter from the Northern Research Group said the pandemic threatened Boris Johnson's pledge to ""level-up"". They also called for an economic recovery plan for the region, arguing it had been hardest hit by the virus. No 10 said it was ""committed to levelling up across the country"". And speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he shared the MPs' ""frustrations at restrictions"" adding that the government wanted to invest in northern areas. All the areas under the strictest restrictions of the government's three-tier system for England are in the North or the Midlands. Warrington has become the latest area to join the Liverpool City Region,Greater Manchester, Lancashire and South Yorkshire in the top tier, whileNottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the highest tier on Thursday. This will mean about eight million people in England will be living under the toughest restrictions, which are reviewed after 28 days, by the end of the week. In areas under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals must close and households are not allowed to mix indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? How do the UK's latest Covid rules affect you? How much money are tier 3 areas getting? Can Johnson's levelling-up mission survive Covid? Russ Bowden, Labour leader of Warrington Council, said he could not see a way out of the top tier of restrictions for his area, adding that he did not know what measurements the government were using for putting places in tier three in the first place. He also told Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are no clear rules about what the success criteria are with the tiers and how you move between the different tiered layers."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously raised the issue in the House of Commons, saying that the top tier was a ""gateway"" to potentially months and months of ""agony"" from which there was no exit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""simplest and most effective way"" for areas to get out of tier three was to get the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - ""down to one or below"". The Department of Health also said other data taken into account includedwhich age groups were being affected and the pressures facing the NHS in those areas. Some 40 Conservative MPs representing areas in the north of England, North Wales and the Scottish borders, have publicly signed the letter, including former cabinet ministers David Davis, David Mundell and Esther McVey, while a further 14 have had their names redacted. The newly-formed Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers is led by former Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry. In their letter, the group called for the prime minister to set out ""a clear road map down the tiering system and out of lockdown"", warning restrictions were ""disproportionately"" affecting people in the north of the country. ""The virus has exposed in sharp relief the deep structural and systemic disadvantage faced by our communities and it threatens to continue to increase the disparity between the North and South still further,"" they said. Mr Berry who represents Rossendale and Darwen said ""We are asking people to give up huge civil liberties, businesses to close, people to live on two thirds of their normal wages. ""I don't think it is unreasonable to say the other side of that coin should be 'show us the way out'."" He also denied that he and other northern MPs were staging a ""revolt"" against the government, saying they were asking the prime minister to ""reaffirm"" his commitment to ""stimulate the North"". December's general election saw the Conservatives demolish the ""red wall"" - winning seats in the north of England from Labour it hadn't held in a generation. The government pledged to repay that support before the pandemic hit, throwing normal politics up in the air. Boris Johnson has continued to talk about that agenda - but the signatories of this letter are worried that Covid will see some of the pledges made fall down the political priority list. In particular, they share concerns with many Labour leaders in the North that there isn't a clear road map out of restrictions. It's been a bruising few weeks for the government's relationship with the North, with very public rows over support for local economies. These MPs support the government - and say their intervention is designed to influence its plans. But it also shows fears for the north of England are shared across the political spectrum The group welcomed the financial support already in place for businesses, such as the furlough scheme and extra funding for local authorities under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. But they added: ""We do however share concerns that the cost of Covid could be paid for by the downgrading of the levelling-up agenda, and northern constituencies like ours will be left behind."" Mr Johnson won a majority of 80 seats in December's election, with many traditionally Labour constituencies in the so-called ""Red Wall"" turning Conservative blue. A key part of his campaign was a pledge to ""level-up"" and reduce regional inequality across the country. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? Mr Sunak said he understood the MPs' concerns but added: ""I also share their passion and their ambition for the North"" and promised that the government ""remained committed"" to investing in these areas. Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson said the government had been ""treating local communities with contempt"". She added thatthe decision not to extend free school meals over the half-term holiday""is the clearest sign yet that the Conservatives have the wrong priorities and are not on the side of British families"".

HSBC to accelerate restructure plan to slash costs,"Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, has said it could start charging for ""basic banking services"" in some countries after it reported a 35% fall in quarterly profits. It said it was considering charging for products such as current accounts, which are free to UK customers. The bank said it was losing money on a ""large number"" of such accounts. A spokesman later told the BBC it was committed to continuing to provide free ""basic bank accounts"" in the UK . But they added: ""We always keep under review the pricing for our standard current accounts and associated services."" Very few banks charge for standard bank accounts, but experts say this could change if the UK falls into negative interest rates due to the pandemic. That would see the Bank of England take interest rates below zero to help boost consumer spending and revive the economy. HSBC's shares dive to lowest level since 1995 HSBC glitch led to thousands of small business loans in the wrong name HSBC and StanChart back China security laws for HK HSBC reported a 35% fall in pre-tax profit during the third quarter of the year to $3.1bn (Â£2.3bn), while revenues fell 11%. Along with other banks, it has seen earnings hit amid an environment of rock bottom interest rates, and so is now considering other ways of boosting revenues. The lender also said it would accelerate its restructuring plan, cutting costs further than previously suggested. But HSBC, which is in the midst of cutting 35,000 jobs, did not say whether more jobs would now go. It said it would provide details on the plan with its full-year results next February. Despite the tough environment, HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn said there were some bright spots. ""These were promising results against a backdrop of the continuing impacts of Covid-19 on the global economy,"" he said. ""I'm pleased with the significantly lower credit losses in the quarter, and we are moving at pace to adapt our business model to a protracted low interest rate environment."" HSBC had set aside between $8bn and $13bn for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it now says its expenses are likely to be at the lower end of that range. In September, HSBC's share price fell to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations that the bank had allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world, even after learning of the scam. The bank has also faced recent criticism from the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for supporting China's controversial security legislation in Hong Kong. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, HSBC was restructuring with a plan to cut $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) of costs by 2022. At its peak, the bank employed more than 300,000 people, but since the global financial crisis, the bank has trimmed its operations significantly.

Why are some people not recovering?,"For most people, Covid-19 is a brief and mild disease but some are left struggling with symptoms including lasting fatigue, persistent pain and breathlessness for months. The condition known as ""long Covid"" is having a debilitating effect on people's lives, and stories of being left exhausted after even a short walk are now common. So far, the focus has been on saving lives during the pandemic, but there is now a growing recognition that people are facing long-term consequences of a Covid infection. Yet even basic questions - such as why people get long Covid or whether everyone will fully recover - are riddled with uncertainty. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,""said one sufferer Jade Gray-Christie, Long Covid: 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Long Covid: 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' Coronavirus patient unable to work six months on Long Covid is not just people taking time to recover from a stay in intensive care. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. ""We've got no doubt long Covid exists,"" Prof David Strain, from the University of Exeter, who is already seeing long-Covid patients at his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome clinic, told the BBC. A study of 143 people in Rome's biggest hospital,published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,external, followed hospital patients after they were discharged. It showed 87% had at least one symptom nearly two months later and more than half still had fatigue. However, such studies focus only on the minority of people who end up needing hospital treatment. TheCovid Symptom Tracker App,external- used by around four million people in the UK - found 12% of people still had symptoms after 30 days. Its latest, unpublished data, suggests as many as one in 50 (2%) of all people infected have long-Covid symptoms after 90 days. It appears not. Half of peoplein a study in Dublin,externalstill had fatigue 10 weeks after being infected with coronavirus. A third were physically unable to return to work. Crucially, doctors found no link between the severity of the infection and fatigue. However, extreme exhaustion is only one symptom of long Covid. Prof Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester and the chief investigator in the PHOSP-Covid projectwhich is tracking people's recovery,external, believes people who developed pneumonia may have more problems because of damage to the lungs. Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia There are lots of ideas, but no definitive answers. The virus may have been cleared from most of the body, but continues to linger in some small pockets. ""If there's long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there's loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what's causing the problem,"" says Prof Tim Spector, from King's College London. The coronavirus can directly infect a wide variety of cells in the body and trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body. One thought is the immune systemdoes not return to normal,externalafter Covid and this causes ill-health. The infection may also alter how people's organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seenafter infection with Sars or Mers,external, which are both types of coronavirus. But Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels afterdeveloping diabetes as a result of Covid,external, and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fatsfor at least 12 years,external. There are early signs ofchanges to brain structure,external, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body. Inside Health: Sticky Blood and Covid 19 Prof Strain told the BBC: ""The theory I'm working on is a premature ageing of the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues."" But he warned that until we figure out what is causing long Covid ""it is difficult to figure out treatments."" Post-viral fatigue or a post-viral cough are well documented and common - we've probably all had an infection that has taken ages to fully recover from. Around one in 10 people withglandular fever,externalhas fatigue which lasts for months. And there have even been suggestions that flu, particularly after the 1918 pandemic, may be linked toParkinson's-like symptoms,external. ""With Covid there seem to be more far-reaching symptoms and the number of people seems to be much greater,"" says Prof Brightling. The emphasis though is on the word ""seems"" as until we have a true picture of how many people have been infected we won't know exactly how common these symptoms are, he says. He told the BBC: ""The uniqueness of the way the virus attacks the host and the different ways it then alters the way cells behave seem to be both giving people more severe infection than other viruses and persistent symptoms."" SYMPTOMS:85% of patients have one of these three symptoms IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The number of people with long-Covid appears to be falling with time. However, the virus emerged only at the end of 2019 before going global earlier this year so there is a lack of long-term data. ""We've asked, deliberately, to follow people for 25 years, I certainly hope only a very small number will have problems going beyond a year, but I could be wrong,"" said Prof Brightling. However, there are concerns that even if people appear to recover now, they could face lifelong risks. People who have had chronic fatigue syndrome are more likely to have it again and the concern is that future infections may cause more flare-ups. ""If long Covid follows the same pattern I'd expect some recovery, but if it takes just another coronavirus infection to react then this could be every winter,"" said Prof Strain. It is still possible more problems could emerge in the future. The World Health Organization has warned that widespread inflammation caused by coronavirus could lead to people having heart problems at a much younger age. The NHS has a""Your Covid Recovery Plan"",externalwhich has advice, particularly for those who needed hospital treatment. It recommends the ""three Ps"" in order to conserve energy: Pace yourself so you don't push yourself too hard, and make sure you have plenty of rest Plan your days so your most tiring activities are spread out across the week Prioritise - think about what you need to do and what can be put off It advises speaking to either your hospital team or your GP if you are not recovering as quickly as you might expect. Some have raised concerns thatthere is not enough supportfor people with long-Covid.

Disabled workers could 'face Covid jobs crisis',"Emma Dobson, 23, says it is ""soul destroying"" that she hasn't got beyond a first interview yet. She has cerebral palsy and has been job-hunting since completing her Masters degree at Aston University this summer. But despite making about 40 applications since July, she has had little success. ""Because I live by myself and like lots of people, I haven't done much socialising recently... I'm desperate to find something,"" Emma tells the BBC. She and many other disabled people are facing a ""jobs crisis"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Leonard Cheshire disability charity. It says about 7 in 10 disabled people have seen a hit to their income, been furloughed or feared redundancy due to Covid-19. The charity also said some employers were discouraged from hiring disabled people, fearing they would not be able to provide the right support during the crisis. Emma, who has been applying for jobs in everything from academia to retail, urges employers to do whatever they can to support disabled candidates - in the application process and at work. ""Covid has shown us that a lot of the things that disabled employees have been asking for, such as flexible hours, remote working, hosting meetings online - are all very doable,"" she says. ""Lots of bosses managed to bring in these new measures at the drop of a hat - so there's no excuse for not fixing any roadblocks to hiring a disabled person, or maintaining those new ways of working, as we've been asking for them for years."" The Leonard Cheshire charity surveyed 1,170 working age disabled people and 500 employers. It found two in five hiring managers saw ""being able to support"" disabled people properly during the coronavirus pandemic as a barrier. Meanwhile, a fifth of employers said they were less likely to hire a disabled candidate overall. Of the 7.7 million disabled people of working age in the UK, 53.6% are currently in work, in comparison with 81.7% of those who are not disabled,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external More than half (57%) of disabled 18-24 year olds surveyed by the charity said they felt that the pandemic had affected their ability to work. The majority also felt that it had hit their future earnings potential. Disabled people fear losing their job Coronavirus patient unable to work six months on Fears for extra needs pupils entering jobs market Leonard Cheshire described its findings as ""stark"". ""But we should see them not as gloomy forecasts for policymakers but as motivators for immediate, wide-ranging action,"" said its head of policy, Gemma Hope. The charity is calling on the government to extend the furlough scheme for working people who are shielding, and to make statutory sick pay available from the first day of employment. In September, charity Scope also saidthat disabled people had been ""hardest-hit"" by the pandemic. In an open letter,external, addressed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, it pointed to ""a looming recession and disabled people at the sharp end of poverty"". Scope called for the government to prioritise the publication of the National Disability Strategy, ensuring ""it provides a clear plan to mitigate existing inequalities the pandemic has further magnified"". The government committed to publishing the strategy - which aims to improve disabled people's access to opportunities - in the last Queen's Speech. ""We understand this has been a very challenging time for many disabled people and we remain committed to supporting their safe return to work,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We are working to support and protect disabled people with one of the most comprehensive economic responses in the world. ""In addition, we have boosted welfare support by Â£9.3bn to help those who need it most.""

Traveller families win High Court battle over landA judge quashed a decision which would force them to stop living on the land they own.UK,"Six Traveller families have won a High Court appeal against a decision which would stop them living on land they own in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. Charlotte Smith and her five neighbours were told by the local council to move off the land because they didn't have planning permission to live there. The families initially appealed to the Planning Inspectorate - which sided with the local authority. But that decision was quashed by the High Court earlier this month. The families' fight is not over and they still don't have planning permission to live on the land but say they feel they ""can relax a little bit now"". ""My first initial reaction at the result was I did have a little tear,"" mum-of-four Charlotte tells me. ""Even though we've still got a fight, it feels like a weight has been lifted."" Charlotte and the five other families have lived on the land for more than two-and-a-half years now The families say they bought the land to give them ""a place to call home"" after previously living on the roadside. But Newark and Sherwood District Council says the site isn't suitable to live on because it's at risk of flooding. Local authorities in England are expected to have a five-year plan which sets out how they will deliver enough sites in the area for their Gypsy and Traveller communities. Newark and Sherwood council doesn't have one. The families' lawyers argued the Planning Inspectorate's decision was flawed because it failed to treat the lack of a plan as ""a significant material consideration"". The High Court agreed and quashed the original ruling at a hearing on 16 October. Charlotte's daughter wrote a letter to the PM asking to stay on the land Charlotte says the weeks leading up to the High Court hearing have been ""emotional"" for all of the families - as they didn't know which way the decision would go. She tells me how her daughter surprised her with a letter to read in the car as she travelled down to London for the hearing. Addressed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, it read: ""I am a 10-year-old girl in year five and I am a traveller. Can we live at Old Winthorpe Road Stable Yard? The council won't let us live there and I live in Newark."" Read more: 'We just want to live on the land we legally own' She says her kids were ""jumping for joy"" when she returned home to tell them they'd won their appeal. ""I did tell my daughter it was because of her letter,"" Charlotte laughs. ""Obviously she doesn't know the legal side of things and I just thought it would build her spirits. ""Everyone is just ecstatic. I can't put into words how it actually makes me feel."" Charlotte says the children who live on the land have ""their freedom but in a safe environment"" Since I wrote about the families' fightback in SeptemberI've had quite a few emails about it - and there's been a mix of opinions. ""I admire their desire to give the children the stability they now have to enable them to receive full-time education without losing their cultural identity,"" one reader said. ""We would all love to buy a field and build a home for our family on it, but for those of us that actually abide by the law, it's not an option,"" another wrote. ""Are they really integrating into the community? They sound just like our local site here in Kent,"" one email read. ""Reality is they do what they like, don't care about anybody else, steal what they like and generally are horrible people."" I ask Charlotte how she feels about this. Charlotte says the six families ""want to be part of the local community"" ""Just because you've had a bad experience with a couple of families that live locally, that doesn't mean everybody's the same,"" she says. ""I'm happy to welcome anybody down and make them a cup of tea. You'll find we're actually lovely people, we're working class people, we pay our taxes, we're not sponging off the government. ""We didn't break into a local park or anything like that, we bought our land. Yes we put in our planning application retrospectively but we're trying our best, otherwise we'd still be on the roadside now. We want to be part of the community."" The land is separated from the village of Winthorpe by the A1 road and Charlotte says the families have the backing of the Winthorpe Estate Residents' Group - which has been posting messages of support on Twitter.

The Planning Inspectorate now has 28 days from the High Court ruling to appeal against the decision. If it doesn't, the families' original appeal will need to be reheard by the inspectorate again. A spokesman said: ""The quality and accuracy of our decisions is very important to the Planning Inspectorate. We have been informed of the judgement and are awaiting a copy of the court order before deciding whether to seek leave to appeal."" Newark and Sherwood District Councilhas found it needs to deliver 77 sites,externalfor the Gypsy and Traveller community by 2024 - and 118 sites by 2033. It says maintaining a deliverable five-year supply of Gypsy and Traveller sites is ""challenging for many local authorities across England"". ""The council is working proactively to allocate land for future development, so these needs can be met,"" it added. It says local landowners are being asked to put their land forward for consideration as potential sites and it will continue to consider individual planning applications from all sections of the community.

Johnson refuses to move on school meal vouchers,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'We don't want to see children going hungry' Boris Johnson has defended his refusal to extend free school meals for children in England over the half-term holiday, saying he was ""very proud"" of the government's support so far. ""I totally understand the issue of holiday hunger,"" he said. ""The debate is, how do you deal with it."" He said the government will ""do everything in our power to make sure that no kid, no child goes hungry"". Pressure has risen on the PM, including from his own MPs, to rethink the issue. Mr Johnson also said he had not spoken to Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford - who has been leading a high-profile campaign to extend free school meals into the holidays - since the summer. Is there really no money for free school meals? Five charts on free school meals and poverty The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after Rashford's campaigning, did the same for the summer holiday. But it has refused to do so again. A petition created by the England striker calling for provision to continue in the holidays had gained more than 900,000 signatures by Monday evening. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have already introduced food voucher schemes. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Readingto launch a review of hospital food,Mr Johnson said ""I totally salute and understand"" where Rashford was coming from. But he said the government was supporting families with a Universal Credit increase of Â£20 a week, introduced in April. The government also said it gave Â£63m to councils -first announced in June,external- to help people who are struggling to afford food and essentials. However, the Local Government Association said this funding was intended to be spent before the end of September and had been ""outstripped"" by demand. Mr Johnson said: ""We are very proud of the support we have given, I have said repeatedly throughout this crisis that the government will support families and businesses, jobs and livelihoods, across the country. ""We're going to continue to do that. ""We don't want to see children going hungry this winter, this Christmas, certainly not as a result of any inattention by this government - and you are not going to see that."" Downing Street doesn't want to do a U-turn; at least not in too obvious a fashion. So it isn't stumping up the cash to extend holiday food vouchers in England. But listen carefully to Boris Johnson and it's clear that he might stump up cash in other ways, for pretty much the same purpose. So, for example, could councils be given further funds to help struggling families? Then ministers can try and argue that they're simply carrying on with an existing policy that they believe is more effective. The PM was at pains today to show that he both recognises and cares about this issue. But some Tories fear that, because of cack-handed communications, Downing Street lost the PR battle on compassion days ago. One mother, Nicola Palmer from Leicestershire, said the meal vouchers had been an ""absolute lifeline"" for her family during the Easter and summer holidays. She receives Universal Credit but said that, after paying bills, she and her partner and their two children ""would be lucky"" to have Â£40 a month to live on. ""Me and my partner have been disabled. I've been disabled since 2017 with multiple sclerosis. My partner has been disabled for a lot longer than that with Crohn's disease and a few other health issues,"" she said. Ms Palmer said the vouchers helped her and her partner feed their two children when they were struggling with money She said one day last week - which was their half-term - she and her partner had no dinner at all, to make sure the children could eat. ""Yes, we are in receipt of Universal Credit, however due to our low income and having to pay for bills as well as trying to put a meal on the table, the very slight increase on this has not made any difference for us whatsoever."" Lucy Houghton, 36, from Norfolk, also relies on free school meal vouchers and saidthere are times she will not eat so her children can. ""It's going to be tough this week,"" she said. ""It's all very well businesses offering free food, but I'm in a rural location and would need fuel to get there. And it's humiliating. I hate asking for help from anybody and I know I'm not alone in that."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government had been ""incredibly generous"" during the pandemic, with support such as wage subsidies, increases to benefits and business rates relief. He added: ""If there is still need or if this Covid crisis continues to kick in and more lockdowns happen, of course the government will look at other alternatives, or other solutions. We're not going to sit there in a static environment."" Labour said Mr Johnson's ""warm words"" would ""do nothing"" for the children at risk of going hungry this week. ""Labour will not not give up on the children and families let down by this government, and we will hold the prime minister to his word, forcing another vote in Parliament if necessary,"" said shadow education secretary Kate Green. Rashford's campaignhas led to businesses includingfish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafes promising to dish out free food to eligible children over half-term, which began on Monday in many areas. And Manchester Unitedsays it will distribute 5,000 meals,external- cooked at the Old Trafford kitchen facilities - to children eligible for free school meals across Greater Manchester. Some charities have set up websites and maps allowing parents to search for places nearby providing free meals. What's happening to free school meals during holidays? MP urged to quit over 'mocking' free meals post David Pickard, head of community operations at Midland Mencap, said he expected ""hundreds"" of families to access free lunches from its community centre in Birmingham this week. Mother-of-three Aisha, who spoke to a reporter as she collected food donations from a community centre in Birmingham, said: ""I am usually really good with my budget. Their father, who I'm divorced from, usually pays for their uniforms but he got ill and he couldn't work, so I bought them this time. ""But the Â£200 I used came from money I use to pay my bills, because the school said if I brought in the receipts I could get some help from them. ""I did that - but it's been seven or eight weeks now, and I haven't heard anything back from the school, so I'm struggling."" Some councils - including several Tory-run local authorities -have promised to supply meal vouchersor food parcels for children facing hardship. Cafe staff in Liverpool prepare sandwich bags for children, as businesses offer to help Last week, Conservative MPs voted against Labour's attempt to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling and voting for Labour's motion. Stuart Anderson, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, saidhe had received threats and his office had been vandalisedafter he opposed the plan to offer free school meals in the holidays.

FANCY SOME ESCAPISM?:Watch brand new drama Roadkill, a political thriller staring Hugh Laurie Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible for free school meals. In England, about 1.4 million children qualified for free school meals in January 2020 - about 17.3% of state-educated pupils.

Warrington moves into tier 3 restrictionsThe Cheshire town is the latest area to be moved into the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions.Liverpool,"Extra restrictions on socialising have come into force in Warrington Warrington is the latest area to move into the top tier of Covid-19 measures as infection rates continue to rise. Tier three restrictions came into force at midnight in the Cheshire town -two days earlier than originally planned. Council leader Russ Bowden said it was the right decision to move Warrington into the ""very high"" Covid alert level. ""This is a public health imperative. What we need to do is protect the lives of our residents,"" he said. ""And - obviously alongside that - [it is about] protecting businesses and jobs here in the town"". He added that one of the main concerns was the ""way the cases have propagated into the older working age population and particularly those people above 60"". Check the restrictions where you live Warrington, which is home to about 210,000 people, joins the Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire in tier three. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshirewill move into the top tierfrom Thursday. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision to move Warrington into tier three was agreed with local leaders as ""it's time to take action"" due to rising infection rates. ""Please remember - now is the time for us all to work together to get this virus under control,"" he said. Warrington is the latest area to move into the most stringent measures The new rules mean: Residents must not socialise with anyone outside their household or support bubble in any indoor setting - including homes and private gardens - or at most outdoor hospitality venues They must not socialise in a group of more than six in an outdoor public space, such as parks Pubs and bars that do not serve substantial meals as a restaurant must close Residents are advised to avoid travelling outside the area, unless for essential journeys, such as work or caring responsibilities Betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos and soft play centres will also close Mr Bowden told Radio 4's Today programme that cases remained ""stubbornly high"" and he was worried about ""Covid fatigue"" with people unable to see a way out of the tougher restrictions. He said: ""There are  no clear rules about what the success criteria are with the tiers and how you move between the different tiered layers."" Mr Bowden added: ""The vast majority of people have applied themselves to the rules and we are asking people again to step up and take responsibility for their actions to protect their loved ones. "" Placed between Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Warrington currently has an infection rate similar to areas on the lower end of tier three, but it is rising. The latest government figures to the 23 October suggest 399 people for every 100,000 had Covid, not far off double the rate seen a month ago and the 36th highest rate of England's 315 local authorities. Geographically, its infection rate is closer to areas like St Helens to the north-west (437 per 100,000) and Trafford to the east (428 per 100,000) rather than other parts of Cheshire, where the rate is around 200 per 100,000. Since the start of the pandemic Warrington has seen 189 deaths due to coronavirus, with 14 of those in the week to the 23 October. As it stands, only 19 other authorities saw more deaths over the same period. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed the tier three measures for Warrington will be reviewed in 28 days' time. ""The restrictions we have agreed together will only be in place for as long as they are absolutely necessary,"" he said. As part of the tier three move, the council has received a Â£5.9m support package from the government, incorporating Â£1.68m for public health and Â£4.2m for business and employment support. The Lower Angel pub in Warrington town centre will be forced to close under the tightened measures. Landlord Andrew Wharfe, who has worked there for 13 years, said he has never seen it so quiet. Landlord Andrew Wharfe said the pub had been quiet in recent weeks ""We're not big enough to serve food so we have to shut,"" he said, adding it had been an upsetting time. Mr Wharfe said he had been planning to step down from the job next year - a decision he made before the pandemic - but this was now uncertain. ""This has put a nail in the coffin - we have had enough,"" he said. Pauline Mellor, 56, who lives in Warrington, said: ""My first grandchild was born in July and it is killing me not being able to see him."" She said she knew the rules but believed ""they won't work"". Pauline Mellor said ""it is killing"" her not being able to see her three-month-old grandchild ""I work in a supermarket, and so many customers, even with a mask, come up close to you. ""I know we can meet outdoors in tier three but it is too cold - especially for a three-month-old baby,"" she added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work?

Tesco 'wrong' to say period products not essentialTesco has since apologised for saying it was unable to sell them under Welsh lockdown rules.WalesComments,"This video can not be played Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government had ""made a mess of the messaging"" over the essential items issue Tesco was ""simply wrong"" to tell a woman she could not buy period products during lockdown, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. The supermarket apologised after saying it could not sell sanitary towels and tampons from a store in Cardiff. The Welsh Government has banned the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets during a 17-day lockdown. Opposition parties have called that ""absolute madness"" and said better communication was needed with shops. The Welsh Government said revised guidance will be published on Tuesday. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government briefing that supermarkets would now be able to use their ""discretion"". Tesco had blocked off the aisle after a ""break-in"" at the store in St Mellons, Cardiff They have been told toclose parts of their storesthat sell items such as clothes, bedding and toys during Wales' firebreak lockdown. Under Welsh Government guidance, shops which have been allowed to remain open are not allowed to sell goods classed as ""non-essential"" during the 17 days, which would normally be sold by businesses that have been made to close. This includes homeware, electrical goods, telephones, clothes, toys and games, and garden products. The policy has been criticised in a petition signed by more than 60,000 people. Homeware and bedding has been taped off in Tesco in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan One customer wrote on Twitter she was ""raging and in tears"" after not being able to buy period products at Tesco's St Mellons store in Cardiff, after the aisle was blocked off. In a tweet that was later deleted, Tesco responded to the complaint by saying it had been told not to sell the items during the lockdown. ""This is wrong - period products are essential,"" the Welsh Government tweeted in response. The supermarket later issued a statement saying the area had been closed off following a break-in at the store, which the police were investigating. South Wales Police confirmed it was investigating a burglary which happened between 02:30 GMT and 04:30 on Monday when an estimated ""Â£20,000 worth of beauty products were stolen"". Tesco said the reply to the customer, which had implied sanitary towels were non-essential, ""was sent by mistake"". In Tesco's Penarth store, carbon Monoxide and smoke alarms were covered in sheeting In Tesco in Penarth shelves containing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors were covered in plastic sheeting, with the store putting up a sign saying they were ""non essential"". But under the Welsh Government guidelines shops can sell products you can normally buy fromfood and drink stores, newsagents, pharmacies and DIY and hardware stores,external- as they remain open. Wales national lockdown in new year 'likely' 'Think of others during firebreak,' says archbishop On Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said meetings would be held with the supermarkets to make clear they could use ""some discretion"" to sell non-essentials to those in ""genuine need"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing he said he was ""very sorry"" a woman had been incorrectly told she could not buy sanitary products. Mr Gething said shoppers and retailers should use ""common sense"" and there would be a ""very small number"" of cases where there would be a genuine need to buy a non-essential item in a supermarket. ""For the great majority of us though of course, we will be able to manage for the next two weeks - with the hardship, with the interruption that causes, yes -Â  but to avoid the much greater hardship and much greater interruption to people's lives and their ability to still see family and friends in the future,"" he said. Books have been covered in cellophane The Welsh Government has come under pressure to abandon the measure and a petition against the ban is now the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. Secretary of State for WalesSimon Hart has urged,externalMr Drakeford to ""scrap the policy"" while Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies called for Members of the Senedd to be recalled ""virtually"" to debate the matter. ""This is absolute madness by the Welsh Government, preventing people from buying the products which they want to buy,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price called on ministers to admit they had sent out confused messaging about a policy, and the public health message had got ""lost"". ""If they'd had the conversations with the retail sector earlier, so we heard from the minister that they had a meeting on Thursday, I would suggest that was too late,"" he said. ""That has eroded public trust over the weekend and obviously that is concerning because it's the public support, the public health message is ultimately the one thing that keeps us all safe.""

Tim Batcup, who has had to close his Swansea book shop during the lockdown, said the Welsh Government had made the ""right call"". But he said that while some supermarkets had stopped selling books, others were still selling them, and the messaging was a ""bit mixed"". ""I don't really understand the fuss... I don't know why people can't go a couple of weeks without a pair or pants or a candle,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I think it's a sincere attempt at levelling up, how effective it will be I don't know. It might drive people towards the online giants, but they all seem to clean up anyway."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Nicky Small, who has had to close her craft shop in Llandudno, said she believed wool and other craft items were essential as the hobbies were helping many through the pandemic. ""I think there's a balance, what is one person's non-essential could be another person's essential,"" she said. ""The difficulty is anybody trying to dictate what essential is, because that will depend on who you are, what you are needing to get, if you have been waiting for payday."" Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said the rules were confusing, and banning people from buying certain items set a dangerous precedent. ""I think this policy is the wrong way to go about it, because rather than levelling the playing field, it's just creating winners and losers, it's pushing people online,"" she said. She said allowing an element of discretion would go against the purpose of the policy, as people would have to approach staff for items and spend more time in store. ""It's distorting competition, which I think is setting a bit of a dangerous precedent,"" she said.

Stock markets slide as Covid-19 cases riseThe Dow falls as much as 3.3% before ending down 2.3% - its sharpest decline in weeks.Business,"US stock markets suffered their sharpest drop in weeks as concerns about the economic impact of surging coronavirus cases sent shares tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.3%, after dropping more than 3% earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% and the Nasdaq 1.6%. Stocks in Europe, where a rise in virus cases has prompted new restrictions, also declined. Shares in travel and energy firms took some of the heaviest losses. In the United States, cruise lines Royal Caribbean Group, Carnival and Norwegian all dropped more than 8%, while in the UK,British Airways owner IAG closed 7.6% lower. Travel firms have been some of the most sensitive to warnings about the virus, which experts worry will intensify as winter approaches. On Monday, Michael Ryan, an emergencies expert for the World Health Organization, said that Europe would need ""much more comprehensive"" measures to get the virus under control. ""Right now we're well behind this virus in Europe, so getting ahead of it is going to take some serious acceleration in what we do,"" he said. On Monday, France's CAC 40 ended 1.9% lower, while Germany's Dax index dropped 3.7%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 fell nearly 1.2%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to avoid widespread restrictions on activity, similar to the lockdown restrictions seen this spring, saying such limits are not worth the economic cost. But such decisions are typically handled by local leaders in America, some of whom, such as the mayors of El Paso, Texas and Newark, New Jersey, tightened rules on Monday. Over the last week, the number of new virus cases reported daily in the US has repeatedly passed 80,000, sending the seven day average to a new high of nearly 69,000 - roughly double what it was in September. The number of hospitalisations has jumped 40% in the past month and death rates are also rising, though more slowly. On a per capita basis, the number of new cases in the US over the past seven days remains lower than some other countries, including the UK, Spain and France, which have announced new restrictions recently. But analysts say the economy is unlikely to mend until concerns about Covid-19 are resolved. Amid those strains, investors are also worried about the impasse in Washington over the need to fund additional coronavirus economic relief. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been trying to broker a deal for the White House, said the two sides remained far apart. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, who leads Democrats in the House of Representatives made similar comments. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?
