Anger voiced at ex-Peru leader's wake,"This video can not be played Supporters of Alan GarcÃ­a voice their anger at the former Peru president's wake. Thousands have turned out for the funeral of Peru's ex-President Alan GarcÃ­a, who killed himself this week. Mr GarcÃ­a shot himself in the head as police knocked on his door to arrest him on suspicion of taking bribes from the Brazilian company Odebrecht. His daughter read his suicide note at the wake. In the letter, Mr GarcÃ­a stated that he did not have to suffer the ""injustices"" of being arrested for alleged acts of corruption. In what was the most dramatic event in the sprawling Odebrecht scandal - an investigation into how the company bribed officials or electoral candidates across Latin America in exchange for lucrative building contracts - Mr GarcÃ­a ended his life on Wednesday to avoid arrest. Odebrecht corruption scandal explained Huge corruption scandal shows no sign of waning Friends, allies and leaders across the political spectrum paid their respects to Mr GarcÃ­a at the headquarters of his APRA party, one of Latin America's oldest political parties. There was also plenty of anger aimed at President MartÃ­n Vizcarra, with some shouting ""Vizcarra is a murderer"" at the wake, in reference to Mr GarcÃ­a's claim that his prosecution had been politically motivated. At least eight people died on their way to the funeral when the bus they were travelling in crashed into the side of a bridge. During the wake, the former leader's daughter, Luciana GarcÃ­a Nores, read a letter her father had penned before taking his own life. ""I have seen others paraded in handcuffs guarding their miserable existence, but Alan GarcÃ­a does not have to suffer those injustices and circuses,"" he wrote in the letter, Efe news agency reports. ""For that reason, I leave my children the dignity of my decisions; to my colleagues, a sign of pride. And my corpse as a sign of my contempt towards my adversaries because I already fulfilled the mission that I set myself. ""May God, to whom I go with dignity, protect the good-hearted and the most humble."" Investigators say he took bribes from Odebrecht during his second term in office, linked to a metro line building project in the capital. Odebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (Â£23m) in bribes in Peru since 2004. But Mr GarcÃ­a maintained he was the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there was ""no clue or evidence"" against him. In November last year he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in Uruguay.

Targeted checks 'prevent 10% of heart attacks',"Nearly one in 10 heart attacks and strokes in England and Wales could be prevented if routine check-ups were better targeted, say researchers. Currently, people aged 40 and over are eligible to have their heart health assessed every five years. But UCL scientists say people at low risk are being checked too often while those considered at high risk are not checked often enough. They say a personalised approach could save lives without costing any more. Chances of a heart attack or stroke can be worked out by looking at risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood-sugar levels, age, family history and whether the person smokes. High-risk patients are told to change their lifestyle, and if that does not work they are offered statins to reduce ""bad"" cholesterol or drugs to lower blood pressure. The researchers followed 7,000 people to see how long they spent in different risk categories. The study, in the Lancet Public Health, showed: ""Low-risk"" patients took an average of nine years to reach ""intermediate-low-risk"" ""Intermediate-low-risk"" patients spent an average of seven years in this category; 90% went on to become ""intermediate-high-risk"" But within four years, 70% of ""intermediate-high-risk"" patients became ""high-risk"" and needed treatment The researchers then simulated different ways of screening people depending on their heart-risk category. For example, screening low-risk patients every seven years, intermediate-low every four years and intermediate-high every year cost the same as the current system. However, the targeted system would enable high-risk patients to be treated sooner and prevent 8% of heart attacks and strokes, say the researchers. That would prevent 5,000 people a year in England and Wales having a potentially life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Prof Mika Kivimaki, one of the researchers, said: ""The key message is use individualised screening, not one-size-fits-all. ""I believe this will change because there is a tendency towards precision medicine and individualised treatment and prevention. ""I think this will be taken up in future and I hope it will happen sooner rather than later."" The next stage of the research would be to perform a clinical trial to see whether switching screening methods would actually make a difference. Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""While changing the frequency of heart-health check-ups based on a person's individual risk could potentially save lives and costs, it's easier said than done. ""An issue that is even more important to address is why so many people who could benefit from health checks are not getting them in the first place. ""If you know you're at higher risk of developing heart and circulatory disease, it's really important to attend regular health checks to help manage your risk factors to prevent problems later in life.""

"Man, 74, shot with crossbow while fixing TV dish","The man was hit with the crossbow bolt outside his home A 74-year-old man has suffered ""horrendous, life-changing injuries"" after being shot with a crossbow. It happened outside his home in a remote area near South Stack Road in Holyhead, Anglesey, in the early hours.

Teachers 'face weekly violence from pupils',"Many teachers are experiencing violence and abuse from pupils, a survey of teachers suggests. Nearly a quarter (24%) of teachers say they face violence once a week, the poll of nearly 5,000 members of the NASUWT teachers' union finds. Four in 10 (42%) have been threatened verbally. ""Verbal abuse is now part of the daily working landscape for a primary teacher,"" one teacher said. The Department for Education said such violence was ""completely unacceptable"". ""Having taught for almost 40 years I have witnessed a demonstrable and seemingly unstoppable deterioration in pupil behaviour,"" one teacher told NASUWT researchers. ""Moreover, teachers are, it seems, now expected to tolerate verbal abuse and threats as 'par for the course' and, quite literally, 'an occupational hazard'. There appears to be no appetite for tackling the issues that face teachers in the classroom."" Secondary school staff suffer work attacks 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' 'Hundreds spend week in school isolation' Another teacher said: ""Even though I work in a PRU [pupil referral unit] where children exhibit these sort of behaviours I am aware that we are seeing an increasing number of younger children who seem to be physically and verbally abusive to staff."" One said: ""I'm a former rugby player and have been more protected against physical violence and verbal intimidation on the pitch than I feel at work."" And another added: ""My school has become a frightening place over the last few years and I often try to only go on the corridors at times when I expect them to be quiet, as I simply assume I will be stampeded, pushed or sworn at."" Official figures from the Department for Education showed that in the academic year 2016/17, 655 pupils in England were excluded for a verbal assault against an adult, while 59,675 were given a fixed-term exclusion. Thestatistics,externalshow 745 were permanently excluded for a physical assault against an adult and 26,695 were excluded for a fixed period. These figures were higher than the previous year 2015/16. The NASUWT, which represents teachers across the UK, discussed the issue of discipline at its annual conference in Belfast on Saturday. Delegates passed a motion saying the union would ""defend members through all legitimate means, up to and including industrial action"". The union's general secretary, Chris Keates, said: ""No teacher should ever have to go to work with the expectation of being verbally or physically abused, but it is clear from this survey that for too many teachers this is the day-to-day reality. ""It is simply unacceptable that employers are failing in their legal duty of care to provide a safe working environment. ""Why is it that hospitals, job centres, railway stations and many other workplaces are now littered with posters in which employers make clear that abuse of staff will not be tolerated and yet the most teachers get is fault finding and blame. ""The school system is riven with poor and unacceptable employment practices that are putting teachers at risk and ultimately driving them out of the profession."" NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates says teachers deserve better A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""Teachers and school staff have a right to be safe while doing their jobs and any form of misconduct, particularly violence towards them, is completely unacceptable. ""The majority of schools provide a safe environment for pupils and teaching staff, and it's important that they remain as such. ""We are committed to tackling bad behaviour in schools, have made great strides in empowering teachers to tackle this issue and have recently announced a Â£10m investment to support schools to share best practice in behaviour management."" DfE guidelines say teachers in England have the ""statutory authority"" to discipline pupils whose behaviour is unacceptable or who break the school rules. This power also applies to all paid staff (unless the head teacher says otherwise) with responsibility for pupils, such as teaching assistants. The guidance states that: teachers can discipline pupils at any time the pupil is in school or elsewhere under the charge of a teacher, including on school visits they can also discipline pupils in certain circumstances when a pupil's misbehaviour occurs outside of school they have the power to impose detention outside school hours and can confiscate pupils' property.

Two women die in Aberdeen beach tragedy,"Police have been examining the beach Two women have died after getting into difficulties while swimming in the sea at Aberdeen beach in the early hours of the morning. Police said the victims, aged 22 and 36, were foreign nationals who were living in the city. The women have not yet been named. Emergency services were called to the Beach Esplanade at about 00:45 after reports of two people in the water. The women were pulled from the sea and taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. However, Ch Insp Martin Mackay of Police Scotland said that they died in hospital despite ""extensive efforts"" to save their lives. This video can not be played Police give an update after two women die at Aberdeen beach A police cordon remains in place at the beach ""Above all, my thoughts are with all of those who will be affected by this tragic incident,"" said Ch Insp Mackay. ""While officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding why these women came to be in the water so late at night, at this stage there appears to be no suspicious circumstances. ""From our initial inquires, which includes speaking to a witness who was present at the time, we understand that they entered the water for the purposes of swimming - but sadly underestimated the conditions."" He said formal identification had not yet taken place, and efforts were continuing to contact the women's next of kin. The rescue operation included coastguard teams from Aberdeen and Stonehaven, a coastguard helicopter and an RNLI inshore lifeboat. Coastguard area commander Ross Greenhill said the women were located in the ""choppy"" water using searchlights, then recovered by the lifeboat crew. They were taken to Aberdeen lifeboat station and then transferred to hospital by ambulance. It is thought that the women were about 50 metres from the shore when they were found. Davie Orr, of the RNLI, said there had been an easterly breeze in recent weeks, which causes ""a bit of swell coming in towards the shore"". ""It was high tide as well, which also causes problems, particularly here because when the water's in there's not a ready escape to get out of the water,"" he said. ""So, it was high tide, a slight easterly breeze, and also being dark as well caused a bit of problem when you're searching for someone."" Ch Insp Mackay thanked all the rescue personnel who had attempted to save the two women. ""Our seas can be extremely unforgiving, conditions can change rapidly and I can't stress enough the dangers of entering the water at any time of the day or night when you are not suitably prepared,"" he added. ""Public safety is paramount and Police Scotland is committed to working with our partners to ensure people know of the dangers of entering any body of water whether you are swimming, sailing or walking near the water's edge."" A cordon was placed around an area of the beach after the incident, and police officers have spent Friday morning examining the scene.

Wildfires burning on Isle of Bute,"A series of wildfires took hold on the north side of the Isle of Bute. The fire service said a large area of moorland and forestry were affected. Local residents, including SNP minister Michael Russell posted images of the blazes on social media after they broke out during Thursday night and Friday. The Scottish Fire and Rescue service said an appliance had been sent to the scene but returned when darkness fell as it was deemed too dangerous to be on the hills. One crew returned on Saturday morning to ensure the blaze had not reignited. A spokesman added: ""The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service was alerted at 14:36 on Friday, April 19 to reports of an area of grass on fire at Balmakailly Hill in Rothesay, Bute.

Subpoena issued for full Mueller report,"This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds A subpoena demanding the release of the full report into Russian meddling during the 2016 election has been issued, amid claims the current version ""leaves most of Congress in the dark"". Democrat Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House judiciary committee, argued it is entitled to an unredacted version. Mr Trump's legal team argues it completely exonerates the president. The Department of Justice has reacted by calling the subpoena ""premature and unnecessary"". It said it would ""continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognised executive branch interests"". Elizabeth Warren became the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for Mr Trump to be impeached. ""The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,"" said the Massachusetts senator. Pro-Trump Santas and other Mueller oddities What's new in the Mueller report? The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Reaction from both sides on Mueller report The 448-page redacted document,externalis the result of a 22-month investigation by Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. It includes large swathes of redactions, which Mr Nadler says ""appear to be significant"" in revealing how Special Counsel Mueller and his team came to their conclusions Democrats have promised to continue pursuing Donald Trump following the release of the report on Thursday. Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation. ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions ""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" The report also reveals: Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try to get Mr Mueller removed over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned because ""he did not plan"" to follow the directive Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely ""took place in public view"" The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"" However, about 10% of the report is redacted - which means it may include yet more revelations. Mr Nadler issued the subpoena for the full, unredacted version on Friday, giving the US attorney general until 1 May to respond. ""My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice,"" Mr Nadler said. ""The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case.""

Snakes force Liberian leader out of office,"President George Weah will return to his usual office on Monday Snakes have been found in Liberian President George Weah's office, forcing him to work from his private residence, the BBC has learnt. Press secretary Smith Toby told the BBC that on Wednesday two black snakes were found in the foreign affairs ministry building, his official place of work. All staff have been told to stay away until 22 April. ""It's just to make sure that crawling and creeping things get fumigated from the building,"" Mr Toby said. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosts the office of the president, so it did an internal memo asking the staff to stay home while they do the fumigation,"" he said. The office of the president has been based in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since a fire in 2006 gutted the nearby presidential mansion. A FrontPage Africa news website video shows workers trying to attack the snakes,externalwhen they appeared near the building's reception. ""The snakes were never killed,"" Mr Toby said. ""There was a little hole somewhere [through which] they made their way back."" The president who no-one dares to tackle George Weah's Liberia scorecard one year on Learn more about Liberia Police and presidential security were seen guarding Mr Weah's residence in the capital Monrovia. A fleet of vehicles including escorts jeeps were parked outside. Mr Toby said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs started to fumigate on Friday. ""That building's been there for years now, and [because of] the drainage system, the possibility of having things like snakes crawling in that building was high,"" he said. The president is definitely returning to his office on Monday after the fumigation whether or not the snakes are found and killed, Mr Toby said.

Ukraine presidential rivals trade barbs in debate,"Rival candidates: Petro Poroshenko (L) and Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's rival presidential candidates have held a long-awaited head-to-head televised debate at Kiev's giant Olympic stadium. Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky and incumbent president Petro Poroshenko shook hands before launching scathing attacks on one another. Mr Zelensky is the clear favourite for Sunday's second-round vote, polls say. But Mr Poroshenko argues that he is a political novice unfit for such a demanding job. Mr Zelensky has relied on a slick social media campaign to tap into the frustration of many younger Ukrainians with establishment politicians, cronyism and corruption. The debate in the capital's 70,000-seat stadium - where Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber Mr Zelensky's - was the first and only direct clash between the two rivals in the campaign. The TV box set that may predict the future Ukraine rivals trade taunts and media tricks What would a comic president mean for Ukraine? The stadium had been divided into two halves for the debate, with a stage for each candidate to speak from at each end of the pitch - but Mr Poroshenko and Mr Zelensky ended up speaking on the same stage. ""I am not a politician,"" said Mr Zelensky, who spoke first. ""I am just a simple person who has come to break down this system."" The debate was broadcast on Ukrainian TV Mr Poroshenko responded by accusing his rival of avoiding active-duty military service and said he would not be able to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We only have a beautiful and bright sweet wrapper in which everyone can find what he is looking for,"" he said. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev Two days before the final round of the election Mr Zelensky, a comedian, exchanged views with his opponent President Poroshenko for the first time. Despite having no political experience Mr Zelensky is the favourite to win. The polls suggest he is on track to get more than twice as many votes on Sunday. So anything bar a complete humiliation in this debate was really a victory for the comedian. In the event, this head to head encounter - played out on football pitch - was probably a score draw. Both men flung insults at the other - with Mr Zelensky saying his own candidacy was the direct result of the president's mistakes and broken promises. Mr Poroshenko in turn accused the comedian of complete incompetence and said he had often made jokes at Ukraine's expense. The debate was agreed more than a week ago, but they disagreed over the date for it. On 14 April Mr Poroshenko turned up at the stadium and used Mr Zelensky's absence as an opportunity to answer journalists' questions and attack the comedian. Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival Earlier, Mr Zelensky had set a surprise condition for holding such a debate: they must both undergo blood tests to detect any drugs or alcohol. Both were then photographed separately giving blood samples. Mr Zelensky is a dollar millionaire, thanks to his popular comedy series and other acting roles, while Mr Poroshenko is a billionaire who got rich through confectionery and TV businesses. Mr Zelensky's links to billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky - a leading opponent of Mr Poroshenko - have led some to question the comedian's credibility as a true ""outsider"" candidate. Mr Poroshenko took power in a 2014 election following an uprising that overthrew the previous pro-Russian government. His supporters credit him with bolstering the army, making Ukraine's Orthodox Church independent of Russia and securing visa-free travel to Europe. However concerns over corruption remain.

Joshua opponent fails second drug test,"Anthony Joshua and Jarrell Miller (right) were due to fight at Madison Square Garden Jarrell Miller has returned a second ""adverse finding"" from a drugs test and will now be replaced as Anthony Joshua's next opponent, says Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn. Miller was denied a licence for the 1 June bout after a first adverse finding from a sample taken on 20 March. Hearn said,externalMiller had ""failed a second separate test for a further substance"". He says a new opponent for British IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion Joshua will be announced next week. The fight, due to take place in New York, will be Joshua's US debut. Where does Joshua go now? Listen: 5 Live Boxing with Costello & Bunce Hearn had previously stated that Joshua's ""preparations continue"" and that eight boxers were being considered as Miller's replacement. After the American returned the first adverse sample on 20 March, his team requested that a B sample be tested. Before the report of the second adverse finding, the 30-year-old said that he had ""done nothing wrong"". ""The facts will prevail and I shall be vindicated,"" Miller said on Thursday. ""My team and I stand for integrity, decency and honesty and we will fight this with everything we have."" Hearn said he had been informed of Miller's second adverse finding by the the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, which operates within boxing and mixed martial arts. Among those under consideration to replace Miller are Cuba's Luis Ortiz, Poland's Adam Kownacki and American Michael Hunter. ""It feels like we need an American fighter or someone that the American market is also familiar with,"" Hearn previously told BBC Sport. ""Ultimately we want someone from the top 15 that's going to put up a great fight, who is going to come to win. That's the most important thing. I don't want someone who wants to take a payday on 1 June, I want someone who wants to come and rip the world heavyweight title from Joshua.""

'She was committed to truth',"Lyra McKee was a ""hero"" to the LGBT community in Northern Ireland, says a friend ""Kid, it's gonna be okay... it's going to get better. ""You're going to join a scheme that trains people your age to be journalists... for the first time in your life you'll feel like you're good at something. You'll have found your calling."" Those were the words of Lyra McKee, written for the short film Letter to My 14-Year-Old Self. On Thursday night in Londonderry, Ms McKee was shot dead during rioting that police are treating as a ""terrorist incident"". This video can not be played People sign a book of condolence in the Guildhall in Derry On Friday morning, friends, colleagues and many others paid tribute to a ""rising star"" in the world of journalism. Her close friend Ann Travers, whose sister was shot dead by IRA gunmen in 1984, said Ms McKee was a journalist ""who liked to help others, to try to give answers to people and empower people"". Ann Travers said Lyra McKee was a journalist who ""wanted to empower people"" ""I used to call her Sherlock Holmes,"" she said. ""Once she got hold of something she really didn't give up. ""Lyra did not deserve this to happen to her and her family don't deserve any of this."" Ms McKee had written for many publications, including Buzzfeed, Private Eye, the Atlantic and Mosaic Science. Recently, she worked for the California-based news site Mediagazer, a trade publication covering the media industry. She was named Sky News young journalist of the year in 2006 and Forbes Magazine named her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016. The 29-year-old north Belfast woman had signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. Police are blaming dissident republicans for the rioting on Thursday night According to those who knew her best, the gay rights advocate was someone who ""believed passionately in social and religious tolerance"". Eva Grosman of the Centre for Democracy and Peace Building considered Ms McKee ""a good friend"". Ms Grosman told BBC News NI on Friday that she and others who knew her best felt ""numb with grief"". ""Life was just getting good for Lyra,"" she said. ""She had fallen in love, she was so happy up in Derry - things were starting to go really well."" Ms Grosman had invited Lyra to present a TED talk at Stormont in 2017 - she used the opportunity to reflect onthe 2016 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in Florida, in which 49 people were killed. ""It's so poignant when I think back on what she said now,"" said Ms Grosman. ""She was talking about intolerance and hate and violence and how senseless it all is, how destructive.

""And she had the whole audience on their feet at the end of it - it was such a moving speech and it's so sad to remember her words this morning in light of what has happened... sickening."" CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the Belfast secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), who knew Ms McKee well, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". ""Those whom she trusted were privileged to be taken into her confidence,"" he added. ""There is no comfort for us in knowing that her killing, unlike that ofMartin O'Hagan,externalorVeronica Guerin, was not targeted. ""Like them, Lyra was killed because she was a journalist. ""It would be wrong to say that she was fearless - she was too intelligent for that. ""She was, however, brave enough to take calculated risks in pursuit of a story and before the shot was fired she may have felt safest in the lee of an armoured police vehicle."" Ms McKee's most recent story,external, published on Sunday, was an analysis piece on the rising rate of young suicides since the ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement. Lyra McKee gave a TED talk in 2017 about the Orlando gay nightclub shootings the previous year In it, she wrote: ""People are no longer dying at the hands of paramilitaries, but they're still dying, too young and too soon. The culprit now is suicide."" On Valentine's Day,she had paid tribute to the ""love of my life"" Sara (Canning),externalin an article for the Belfast Telegraph. Speaking about the moments leading to her death, Mr Ã MaolÃ¡in said: ""Having heard the rioting, Lyra went out with Sara to cover events and had only just finished discussing the situation with a colleague in Belfast when she was shot. ""Sara was beside her at the time and later when she died in Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry."" Journalist Veronica Guerin was shot dead in 1996 while driving her car John O'Doherty, the director of the Rainbow Project, described her as ""a hero to many in the LGBT community"". ""Lyra was a remarkable person,"" he said. ""We have been reading about the huge impact Lyra had on so many within Northern Ireland's LGBT community, including supporting people in coming out and using her own coming out story to empower others to live as their most authentic selves. ""Lyra has volunteered and fundraised for us, including at a Strictly Come Dancing fundraising event. ""Lyra described herself as someone with two left feet but like everything she did in her life, she gave it everything she had and our lasting memory will be of a smiling and dancing Lyra.""

The writer Ruth Dudley-Edwards described Ms McKee as a ""huge talent"" who cared deeply about her mother, who had a disability. ""You sat with Lyra for an evening and she had to stop every half an hour to check that her mother was OK,"" she said. ""One of the things that was so remarkable about her in Northern Ireland was she was completely non-tribal. ""She came from what was a republican estate but she had no time for any of that. ""She had friends who were republicans, she had friends who were loyalists, she had friends from all over the place. ""The only thing she required of you was that you were decent."" Ms Dudley-Edwards said that Ms McKee was just beginning to feel successful in her career after years of ""struggle"". ""It was tough and she was poor and she was crowdfunding a bookâ¦ and suddenly she was doing brilliantly."" Ms McKee endedher Belfast Telegraph article on suicide last week,externalwith an emotional appeal to those experiencing mental health problems. ""There's a saying within the LGBT community: It gets better,"" she wrote. ""It's what we tell LGBT youths and others who are currently journeying through hell. ""Keep going, we say, because one day you'll wake up and be glad that you lived. ""That piece of advice applies to all of us who are struggling. ""So please, I beg you - live.""

Gunman 'should see heartbreak',"Lyra McKee wanted to write about the effects of violence on young people in Derry, says a priest A priest who anointed Lyra McKee after she was shot has said he wished that the gunman could have gone to the hospital where she was taken and seen ""what they did"" to her and her family. Ms McKee, 29, was killed during violence in Londonderryon Thursday. Father Joseph Gormley said he was called to the hospital shortly after 00:00 BST on Friday. ""[Ms McKee's family] thought it was somebody else, it had to be somebody else. It wasn't Lyra,"" he said. Journalist shot dead in Derry Dissident republican activity on the rise ""I would love if those people who had fired those shots came over and saw what they did in Altnagelvin [Hospital] last night, if they came over and saw that scene of a young woman and her family. Fr Gormley said Ms McKee's partner and family ""are heartbroken"" ""This is their Good Friday and we have to stand beside them...on this terrible cross that has been visited by such an evil act."" Fr Gormley said Derry was not ""a playground"" for political games and the violence in the city was ""beyond anti-social"". ""How dare they set themselves up as some sort of arbitrator for disputes within our community. ""They don't listen but what needs to happen is we all need to get off the fence - we need to be saying face-to-face to people that we know that enough is enough. ""These are not games - these are deadly actions."" He added that Ms McKee ""in her heart of hearts wanted to make a contribution to ending this cycle of violence by writing about the effects of violence on our young people"". This video can not be played Lyra McKee's murder was a horrendous act, says PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton He also called for a march that was organised to mark the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising on Monday to be cancelled in the wake of Ms McKee's death. An illegal dissident republican parade was due to take place in the Creggan estate in Derry, where she was shot. ""If these people are serious about our community, what they will do is... they will call that off,"" he said. ""They will not have men in combat uniform walking past the place where Lyra McKee was murdered a few feet away."" ""It has to be called off. A parade organised by dissident republicans - like this one in 2017 - was due to take place on Monday ""I'm speaking for, I'm sure, everyone in the Creggan but everyone has to make their voices felt. ""It would be so disrespectful to have that march."" Shortly after the priest's comments, dissident republicans posted on social media that the event would be cancelled. A statement issued by political party Saoradh, which represents dissident republicans, sought to justify the use of violence. The organisation extended its sympathy to Ms McKee's family and friends and claimed that she was ""killed accidentally"" and her death was ""heartbreaking"". The Saoradh statement sparked a social media backlash, with hundreds of hostile comments criticising their version of events.

Top climbers believed killed in avalanche,"Banff National Park stands in the Canadian Rockies Three professional climbers are presumed dead after an avalanche in the Canadian Rockies, authorities say. The three mountaineers were attempting to scale Howse Peak and failed to check in on schedule. National park staff flew over the area where they were climbing and saw evidence of ""avalanches and debris containing climbing equipment"". Recovery efforts are on hold because of dangerous conditions and additional avalanches at the scene. Those efforts are likely to be further hampered by bad weather in the coming days. Outdoor clothing company The North Face has identified the men as David Lama and Hansjoerg Auer from Austria, and Jess Roskelley, from the US. The three were sponsored by the firm which said in a statement it was doing everything it could to support their families, friends and the climbing community. The climbers went missing when they were attempting to scale the east side of Howse Peak, which Parks Canada described as a ""remote and an exceptionally difficult objective, with mixed rock and ice routes requiring advanced alpine mountaineering skills"". The route taken by the climbers was rarely traversed, safety specialist Steve Holeczi said during a press conference. Mr Holeczi, who was among those who flew over the avalanche site, estimated the avalanche to be strong enough to destroy a small building. Howse Peak, with a 3,295 metre (10,800 foot) elevation, is in the Canadian province of Alberta, in Banff National Park. Mr Roskelley, 36, from Spokane, Washington state, scaled Mount Everest at age 20. The son of a famous mountaineer, he was the youngest American to reach the summit of the world's highest peak in 2003. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Austrian David Lama photographed at a climbing competition in 2006 Mr Auer, 35, grew up on a family farm in Austria near the Dolomite mountain range.

Journalist shot dead during riot,"This video can not be played Lyra McKee was one of Northern Ireland's most promising journalists, says the NUJ One of Northern Ireland's ""most promising"" journalists has been shot dead during rioting that police are treating as a terrorist incident. Dissident republicans are being blamed for killing 29-year-old Lyra McKee after violence broke out during police searches in Londonderry on Thursday. Police said a group known as the New IRA ""are likely to be the ones"" responsible for her murder. Ms McKee's partner said she had been left without ""the love of my life"". Sara Canning, speaking at a vigil in Derry, saidthe journalist's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"". Profile: Lyra McKee - 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Murdered journalist's 'dreams snuffed out' Gunman who shot journalist should see heartbreak, says priest Reaction: Journalist's killing condemned by politicians This video can not be played It is understood police were attacked after carrying out searches in Londonderry. Footage courtesy of Leona O'Neill Prime Minister Theresa May said the killing was ""shocking and senseless"". Ms McKee was a journalist who ""died doing her job with great courage"", added Mrs May. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that a gunman fired shots towards police officers in Derry's Creggan area at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. Mobile phone footage taken by a bystander during the rioting appears to show a masked gunman crouching down on the street and opening fire with a handgun. Ms McKee, who was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle, was wounded. This video can not be played Lyra McKee's murder was a horrendous act, says PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton ""She was taken away from the scene in a police Land Rover to Altnagelvin Hospital but unfortunately she has died,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton. The leaders of Northern Ireland's six biggest political parties said they were ""united in rejecting those responsible for this heinous crime"". In a joint statement, they said: ""Lyra's murder was also an attack on all the people of this community, an attack on the peace and democratic processes. ""It was a pointless and futile act to destroy the progress made over the last 20 years, which has the overwhelming support of people everywhere."" Detectives have started a murder inquiry and the PSNI's Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said ""evil people"" had been behind the killing. Police were searching for weapons and ammunition in Derry when the violence started Ms McKee's death has caused a ""wave of shock and sympathy"" and was ""met with global condemnation, horror and revulsion"", he added. ""The gunman and those who share his warped ideology should hang their heads in shame today - they represent no-one."" Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said Ms McKee ""changed lives"" as a journalist and an activist and would continue to do so. Irish people stood in ""solidarity with the people of Derry"" after the murder,"" he said. ""We stand with you as strong as your walls and for as long as they stand,"" he added. ""This was an attack not just on one citizen - it was an attack on all of us, our nation and our freedoms."" This video can not be played Derry does not want dissident republican violence, says PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin Ms McKee was a journalist of ""courage, style and integrity"" and a ""woman of great commitment and passion"", according to the NUJ's SÃ©amus Dooley. ""I have no doubt that it was that commitment which led to her presence on the streets of the Creggan last night, observing a riot situation in the city,"" he added. Filmmaker Alison Millar, who was due to have dinner with Ms McKee on Friday night, said her friend had been ""stolen from us"". ""Lyra was the most beautiful human being,"" she said. ""She was compassionate, she was honest, she was funny... she had so many friends and was loved by so many people."" Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. An intelligence-led operation took them into Londonderry's Creggan estate late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing Lyra McKee is known as the New IRA and was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year. Read more:Dissidents had shown violent intentions The violence on Thursday night broke out after police raids on houses in the Mulroy Park and Galliagh areas in Derry. ""Violent dissident republicans are planning attacks in this city and we were carrying out a search operation in Creggan,"" said the PSNI's Mr Hamilton. Rioting began at Fanad Drive - more than 50 petrol bombs were thrown at police and two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire. ""I believe that this was orchestrated - orchestrated to a point that they just want to have violence and attack police,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""Bringing a firearm out is a calculated and callous act."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Attenborough climate show a 'call to arms',"This video can not be played Climate Change - The Facts is available to watch on BBC iPlayer Sir David Attenborough's new BBC documentary on climate change has been praised by TV critics. Climate Change - The Facts, shown on BBC One on Thursday, was a ""rousing call to arms"",said the Guardian,external. In a four-star review,external, the Times said the veteran presenter ""took a sterner tone... as though his patience was nearly spent"". Sir David, 92, has called global warming ""our greatest threat in thousands of years"". In its review, The Arts Desk said,external: ""Devastating footage of last year's climactic upheavals makes surreal viewing. ""While Earth has survived radical climactic changes and regenerated following mass extinctions, it's not the destruction of Earth that we are facing, it's the destruction of our familiar, natural world and our uniquely rich human culture. ""In the 20 years since I first started talking about the impact of climate change on our world, conditions have changed far faster than I ever imagined,"" Sir David said in the film. Climate change protesters have closed off central London since Monday ""It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies."" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Talk to our climate change bot Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? In a glowing review,external, the Telegraph called the title of the documentary ""robust"" and praised the use of Sir David in the central role. ""At a time when public debate seems to be getting ever more hysterical,"" it said, ""it's good to be presented with something you can trust. And we all trust Attenborough."" ""Sir David Attenborough might as well be narrating a horror film,""wrote the FT,external. ""A panoply of profs line up to explain that the science on climate change is now unequivocal, never mind the brief clip of Donald Trump prating: 'It's a hoax, it's a hoax, OK'."" But it added: ""Fortunately for our nerves the last 20 minutes focuses on what needs to be - and can be - done on an international and personal level."" Sir David's concern over the impacts of climate change has become a major focus for the naturalist in recent years and has been a theme of hisOur Planet series on Netflix,external. The new BBC programme has a strong emphasis on hope with Sir David arguing that if dramatic action is taken over the next decade, then the world can keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5C this century, limiting the scale of the damage. The programme -which is now available on the BBC iPlayer- was broadcast as Extinction Rebellion protesters continues to cause disruption in parts of central London.

US children forgive parents for tortureThe Turpin children tell the court they still love their parents despite their years of cruelty.US & Canada,"This video can not be played One of the couple's children reads a statement during the sentencing A couple from the US state of California have been sentenced to life in prison for starving and torturing all but one of their 13 children. David and Louise Turpin were arrested in January 2018 when their 17-year-old daughter escaped their home in the city of Perris and raised the alarm. The children had been abused for at least nine years and some were found chained up in filthy conditions. But several of the children told the court they had forgiven their parents. The couple are expected to serve the rest of their lives behind bars, unless they are granted parole in 25 years. The couple's Facebook page contained numerous family photos The Turpins wept as they heard victim-impact statements from four of their children at Friday's hearing. One child recounted being haunted by the ordeal. I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up,"" said his statement. ""Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten. ""That is the past and this is now. ""I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things they did to us."" David Turpin broke down as he learned his fate Another child, in a statement read by her brother, also forgave her parents for the abuse. ""I love both of my parents so much,"" she said. ""Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today."" How can parents torture their children? 'Happy family' image hid house of horrors But not all the children were so conciliatory. One daughter, who was visibly shaking, said: ""My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back. ""I'm a fighter, I'm strong and I'm shooting through life like a rocket."" She added: ""I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me, but I realised what was happening."" Louise Turpin occasionally smiled during Friday's sentencing David and Louise Turpin cried as they apologised for the treatment of their children. The 57-year-old father's lawyer read a prepared statement on his behalf, saying: ""My home schooling and discipline had good intentions. ""I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I love my children and I believe my children love me."" He was an engineer for major US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. David and Louise Turpin have agreed to lengthy prison terms after pleading guilty to torture, child abuse and false imprisonment Speaking directly to the court, housewife Louise Turpin, 50, said she was ""truly sorry"" for what she had done. ""I love my children so much,"" she said. ""I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry."" The couple sat stony-faced as the judge rebuked them for their ""selfish, cruel and inhuman treatment"". Judge Bernard Schwartz said: ""You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world. The Turpin family with an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas, where the parents renewed their vows ""The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding. ""And you spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors."" The tidy exterior of the middle-class family home 70 miles (112km) south of Los Angeles offered a veneer of respectability that masked the squalor and stench of human waste found by authorities within. The children, between the ages of two to 29 at the time of the police raid, were severely malnourished. A 22-year-old son was discovered chained to a bed. His two sisters had just been released from shackles. The victims were forbidden to shower more than once a year, were unable to use the toilet and none of them had ever seen a dentist. The Turpins on a family trip to Disneyland - it was apparently a favourite destination Some of the adult siblings' growth had been so severely stunted by starvation that authorities at first mistook them for children. Newly released audio of their daughter's call to 911, obtained by ABC,external, provides a hint of the conditions in which the children lived. ""Two of my sisters and one of my brothers... they're chained up to their bed"", the 17-year-old girl, who did not know her own address, told the emergency operator. ""Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because how dirty the house is."" The girl was also unaware of the year or month, or the meaning of the word ""medication"". The children - whose names all begin with the letter J - were kept indoors, but were allowed out for Halloween, or on family trips to Disneyland and Las Vegas. About 20 people from across the country, including nurses and psychologists, have offered to care for the seven adult siblings and six children. What we know about shackled siblings' lives.

"Sore knee? Maybe you have a fabellaA little bone scientists thought was being lost to evolution seems to be making a comeback, say experts.Health","The arrow on the scan shows where the fabella is - behind the knee A little bone in the knee scientists thought was being lost to evolution seems to be making a comeback, say experts from Imperial College London. The fabella is found in some people buried in the tendon just behind their knee. Doctors think it is entirely pointless, and you can happily live without it - many people do. However, people who have arthritis appear more likely to be in possession of a fabella. The Imperial College teamhas published its findings in the Journal of Anatomy.,external In medical terms, the fabella - which means little bean - is a sesamoid bone, meaning it grows in the tendon of a muscle, just like the kneecap or patella. Dr Michael Berthaume and colleagues at Imperial's department of bioengineering have looked back at medical literature on knees over 150 years in 27 countries, including the UK. Most hip and knee replacements 'last longer than thought' The Leicestershire man with a 'brain' in his knee Between 1918 and 2018, reports of the fabella bone's existence in the knee increased to the extent that it is now thought to be three times as common as 100 years ago. The scientists' analysis showed that in 1918, fabellae were present in 11% of the world population, and by 2018, they were present in 39%. The researchers made their estimations using medical scans and medical journals' findings from a growing world population. The fabella is found in the tissues behind the kneecap Dr Berthaume said that no-one really knows the answer to that, because it has never been researched. ""The fabella may behave like other sesamoid bones to help reduce friction within tendons, redirecting muscle forces, or, as in the case of the kneecap, increasing the mechanical force of that muscle,"" he said. ""Or it could be doing nothing at all."" In old world monkeys, the fabella can act as a kneecap, increasing the mechanical advantage of the muscle. But when the ancestors of great apes and humans evolved, it seemed to disappear. Now that it has returned, it is just causing us problems, according to experts. People with osteoarthritis of the knee are twice as likely to have the little bone, but there is no evidence it is actually causing the problem, or how. The fabella can also get in the way of knee replacement surgery and cause pain and discomfort on its own. The theory is that it is all to do with nutrition. The researchers came to the conclusion that better nutrition is making the average human taller and heavier, and this means we have longer shinbones and larger calf muscles. These changes put the knee under more pressure. Because sesamoid bones, like the fabella, are known to grow in response to the movements they make and the forces exerted on them, this could explain why the bone is more common than it used to be. Finding out about this little bone's resurgence could help doctors treat patients with knee issues. It could also give them an insight into human evolution over the past century. But first they want to find out the age, gender and location of people most likely to have a fabella, and if it occurs in one or both knees.

Ukraine comic v oligarch election debate begins,"Rival candidates: Petro Poroshenko (L) and Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's rival presidential candidates have held a long-awaited head-to-head televised debate at Kiev's giant Olympic stadium. Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky and incumbent president Petro Poroshenko shook hands before launching scathing attacks on one another. Mr Zelensky is the clear favourite for Sunday's second-round vote, polls say. But Mr Poroshenko argues that he is a political novice unfit for such a demanding job. Mr Zelensky has relied on a slick social media campaign to tap into the frustration of many younger Ukrainians with establishment politicians, cronyism and corruption. The debate in the capital's 70,000-seat stadium - where Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber Mr Zelensky's - was the first and only direct clash between the two rivals in the campaign. The TV box set that may predict the future Ukraine rivals trade taunts and media tricks What would a comic president mean for Ukraine? The stadium had been divided into two halves for the debate, with a stage for each candidate to speak from at each end of the pitch - but Mr Poroshenko and Mr Zelensky ended up speaking on the same stage. ""I am not a politician,"" said Mr Zelensky, who spoke first. ""I am just a simple person who has come to break down this system."" The debate was broadcast on Ukrainian TV Mr Poroshenko responded by accusing his rival of avoiding active-duty military service and said he would not be able to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We only have a beautiful and bright sweet wrapper in which everyone can find what he is looking for,"" he said. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev Two days before the final round of the election Mr Zelensky, a comedian, exchanged views with his opponent President Poroshenko for the first time. Despite having no political experience Mr Zelensky is the favourite to win. The polls suggest he is on track to get more than twice as many votes on Sunday. So anything bar a complete humiliation in this debate was really a victory for the comedian. In the event, this head to head encounter - played out on football pitch - was probably a score draw. Both men flung insults at the other - with Mr Zelensky saying his own candidacy was the direct result of the president's mistakes and broken promises. Mr Poroshenko in turn accused the comedian of complete incompetence and said he had often made jokes at Ukraine's expense. The debate was agreed more than a week ago, but they disagreed over the date for it. On 14 April Mr Poroshenko turned up at the stadium and used Mr Zelensky's absence as an opportunity to answer journalists' questions and attack the comedian. Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival Earlier, Mr Zelensky had set a surprise condition for holding such a debate: they must both undergo blood tests to detect any drugs or alcohol. Both were then photographed separately giving blood samples. Mr Zelensky is a dollar millionaire, thanks to his popular comedy series and other acting roles, while Mr Poroshenko is a billionaire who got rich through confectionery and TV businesses. Mr Zelensky's links to billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky - a leading opponent of Mr Poroshenko - have led some to question the comedian's credibility as a true ""outsider"" candidate. Mr Poroshenko took power in a 2014 election following an uprising that overthrew the previous pro-Russian government.

Dissident republicans are being blamed for killing 29-year-old Lyra McKee after violence broke out during police searches in Londonderry on Thursday. Police said a group known as the New IRA ""are likely to be the ones"" responsible for her murder. Ms McKee's partner said she had been left without ""the love of my life"". Sara Canning, speaking at a vigil in Derry, saidthe journalist's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"". Profile: Lyra McKee - 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Murdered journalist's 'dreams snuffed out' Gunman who shot journalist should see heartbreak, says priest Reaction: Journalist's killing condemned by politicians This video can not be played It is understood police were attacked after carrying out searches in Londonderry. Footage courtesy of Leona O'Neill Prime Minister Theresa May said the killing was ""shocking and senseless"". Ms McKee was a journalist who ""died doing her job with great courage"", added Mrs May. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that a gunman fired shots towards police officers in Derry's Creggan area at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. Mobile phone footage taken by a bystander during the rioting appears to show a masked gunman crouching down on the street and opening fire with a handgun. Ms McKee, who was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle, was wounded. This video can not be played Lyra McKee's murder was a horrendous act, says PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton ""She was taken away from the scene in a police Land Rover to Altnagelvin Hospital but unfortunately she has died,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton. The leaders of Northern Ireland's six biggest political parties said they were ""united in rejecting those responsible for this heinous crime"". In a joint statement, they said: ""Lyra's murder was also an attack on all the people of this community, an attack on the peace and democratic processes. ""It was a pointless and futile act to destroy the progress made over the last 20 years, which has the overwhelming support of people everywhere."" Detectives have started a murder inquiry and the PSNI's Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said ""evil people"" had been behind the killing. Police were searching for weapons and ammunition in Derry when the violence started Ms McKee's death has caused a ""wave of shock and sympathy"" and was ""met with global condemnation, horror and revulsion"", he added. ""The gunman and those who share his warped ideology should hang their heads in shame today - they represent no-one."" Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said Ms McKee ""changed lives"" as a journalist and an activist and would continue to do so. Irish people stood in ""solidarity with the people of Derry"" after the murder,"" he said. ""We stand with you as strong as your walls and for as long as they stand,"" he added. ""This was an attack not just on one citizen - it was an attack on all of us, our nation and our freedoms."" This video can not be played Derry does not want dissident republican violence, says PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin Ms McKee was a journalist of ""courage, style and integrity"" and a ""woman of great commitment and passion"", according to the NUJ's SÃ©amus Dooley. ""I have no doubt that it was that commitment which led to her presence on the streets of the Creggan last night, observing a riot situation in the city,"" he added. Filmmaker Alison Millar, who was due to have dinner with Ms McKee on Friday night, said her friend had been ""stolen from us"". ""Lyra was the most beautiful human being,"" she said. ""She was compassionate, she was honest, she was funny... she had so many friends and was loved by so many people."" Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. An intelligence-led operation took them into Londonderry's Creggan estate late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing Lyra McKee is known as the New IRA and was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year.

""Violent dissident republicans are planning attacks in this city and we were carrying out a search operation in Creggan,"" said the PSNI's Mr Hamilton. Rioting began at Fanad Drive - more than 50 petrol bombs were thrown at police and two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire. ""I believe that this was orchestrated - orchestrated to a point that they just want to have violence and attack police,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""Bringing a firearm out is a calculated and callous act."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anaylsis: Dissidents threat severe,"Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. Londonderry's Creggan estate is central to their concerns. An intelligence-led operation took them into the area late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing journalist Lyra McKee is known as the New IRAand was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year. There have been other signs of violent intentions elsewhere. Recently, a horizontal mortar tube and command wire were discovered near Castlewellan in County Down. The dissident republican threat remains classed as severe and in recent days the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been assessing what could, in particular, occur over coming days. They had called for calm ahead of illegal parades planned in Londonderry and Lurgan in County Armagh. But that appeal was shattered by gunfire that killed a journalist standing near police lines.

Eight new things in the Mueller report,"This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, that provides ample fodder for either side of the political divide. The 448-page report says it did not establish the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 US presidential election. The inquiry also built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the Republican president, though it stopped short of concluding he committed a crime. While there was no immediate ""smoking gun"" to trigger impeachment proceedings, Democrats said the report had plenty of ammunition to keep up congressional scrutiny of Mr Trump. The report details the president's expletive-filled horror as he learned that a special counsel was being appointed in May 2017. According to the Mueller report, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the president about the coming inquiry, he replied: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency."" He added two expletives to describe his situation. Mr Trump added:  ""Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me."" Analysis and reaction to Mueller report Trump 'tried to get Mueller fired' The Mueller report details how in June 2017, the president called White House counsel Donald McGahn at home from Camp David and ordered him to have the special counsel removed. On a second call, Mr McGahn said the president stepped up the pressure, saying: ""Call Rod [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel"", and ""Mueller has to go"" and ""Call me back when you do it."" Mr McGahn was so upset by the interference that he threatened to quit rather than participate in what he predicted would be a Nixon-style ""Saturday Night Massacre"". After media reports in January 2018 revealed Mr Trump's attempts to have Mr Mueller removed, one of the president's lawyers made contact with Mr McGahn, asking him to publicly deny the reports. But McGahn, through his attorney, refused. The report found there were a number of contacts between members of Trump's circle and Russia, and the campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts"". The Trump team also ""showed interest"" in the Wikileaks release of hacked emails and ""welcomed their potential to damage"" Hillary Clinton. Unpatriotic and immoral, Democrats say. But the Mueller team makes clear it did not amount to a criminal conspiracy. ""The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to meet in person, invitations for campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved US-Russian relations. ""While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" On potential obstruction of justice, the Mueller report is far from the ""total exoneration"" claimed by Mr Trump during a victory lap last month. The report ultimately concludes: ""Unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."" But it also pointedly notes: ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President'sactions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred."" While the report acknowledges a sitting president cannot be indicted, it also mentions Congress' ability to investigate and potentially impeach him. It says: ""Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law."" This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions The report cites 10 instances that were investigated as potential obstruction by Mr Trump. Most have already been well documented, such as Mr Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. But the findings also validate past US media reports that were denied at the time by the White House. When Mr Trump learned the media was asking questions about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer who was said to be promising ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton, the president crafted a misleading response, says the report: ""Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with 'an individual who [Trump Jr] was told might have information helpful to the campaign' and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children."" Mr Trump also asked former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce publicly that the investigation was ""very unfair"" and Mr Trump had done nothing wrong, says the report. After Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, leaving an enraged Mr Trump feeling that he was losing control of the inquiry, the president pressed his attorney general that if he would only ""unrecuse"" himself he would be the ""hero"". The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Eight legal headaches for Donald Trump The Mueller report found that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"", including former FBI Director James Comey, former White House counsel Don McGahn and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowksi. In one unflattering passage, the document says: ""The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President's aides and associates beyond those already filed."" Close followers of the Mueller saga may recall that in January 2018 at the White House, President Trump told reporters that he was ""looking forward"" to sitting down for an interview with Mr Mueller, that he would ""love to do that as soon as possible"", and boasted he would do so under oath. But in the event, the report notes, ""after more than a year of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed"". He agreed to submit written answers to the special counsel's questions to Russia-related matters, but declined to ""provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during his transition"", the report notes. The Mueller report states: ""Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to subpoena for his testimony. We viewed his written answers to be inadequate."" But the Mueller team said they ultimately decided not to subpoena Mr Trump because of the likelihood of litigation would cause a substantial delay at a late stage in the inquiry. The Mueller team did not indict then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for perjury to Congress when he wrongly testified that he had no contact with Russians during the campaign because of the inexact wording of the questions, according to the report. ""The evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions,"" the report says. It also makes clear Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and other campaign staff were on legally thin ice with their June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer.

Charles speaks of knife crime 'horror',"Prince Charles has called for an end to the ""pervasive horror of knife crime"" in an Easter message. The Prince of Wales says offenders must be punished, but forgiveness has an ""extraordinary power"" to change them. It comes as concern grows over youth-related violence, with campaigners calling it a ""national emergency"". Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, the prince also spoke about ""terrible deeds of darkness"" committed against Muslims in theChristchurch mosque shootings. Families demand action to end violence Prince Charles says he and Prince Harry brought together some of those affected by knife crime. Although listening to the victims and bereaved filled them with ""immense sadness"", their determination to find solutions to knife crime was an ""example of the light shining in the darkness"", Prince Charles writes. The prince speaks about Gee Walker, whose son, Anthony Walker, was beaten to death with an ice axe in a racist attack in 2005. Anthony Walker was chased into a park in Huyton and killed with an axe on 30 July 2005 Mrs Walker offered forgiveness to Anthony's murderers that was ""inspired by the Easter story"", says Prince Charles. ""Of course those who commit such brutal deeds need to face up to their crimes through being brought to justice,"" he writes. ""However, very often it is not the punishment that brings them to their senses and changes them, but rather the extraordinary power of the forgiveness from those they have hurt."" Bereaved parents and anti knife-crime campaigners shut down Westminster Bridge on Wednesday in protest at the government's response to violent crime. One of the organisers of the demonstration, Lucy Martindale, whose cousin was fatally stabbed, said the government held a Cobra meeting ""if there is a terrorist attack and one person is killed"". She continued: ""Several people daily are being killed on our streets, why is this not being treated as the national emergency that it is?"" There were 39,818 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending September 2018 -the highest number since comparable data started being compiled. Thirty-six homicide investigations have been launched in London since the start of the year, including 23 stabbings. In March the government pledged an extra Â£100m for police in the areas worst affected by knife violence. It came after Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers, but Prime Minister Theresa May said there was ""no direct correlation"". Motives and circumstances behind killings have varied - as have the age and gender of the victims. Faces of the dead: The UK's first 100 victims 10 charts that help explain the rise in knife crime Home Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that he had implemented ""a number of approaches"" to reduce serious violence.

Father saves toddler from dingo attack,"The dingo entered the campervan and bit the toddler's neck A father has saved his son from a dingo attack after the toddler was dragged from a campervan at an Australian tourist island, say officials. The 14-month-old boy was sleeping inside the vehicle on a remote area of Fraser Island in Queensland when the wild dog entered and bit his neck. His parents were woken by their son's cries which were ""getting further away from the campervan"", said a paramedic. The father immediately ran out and snatched him from the dingo's jaws. The toddler suffered two deep cuts to the top of his neck and minor cuts to his scalp in Thursday's incident. He was airlifted to hospital for treatment. Paramedic Ben Du Toit told local media the father, who has not been named, ""found the dingo dragging the toddler away from the campervan"". Several other dingoes were in the area. ""He immediately ran up and grabbed his son and chased some of the dingoes off,"" said Mr Du Toit. It is the third dingo attack on Fraser Island this year - both previous attacks also involved children. How dangerous are dingoes? The most famous case of a dingo attack involved nine-week-old Azaria Chamberlain, who disappeared from a campsite near Uluru/Ayers Rock in 1980. Her mother was convicted of her murder and spent three years in jail before a court quashed her conviction andruled that her baby had been taken by a dingo. Dingoes are thought to be descended from a domestic dog brought in from Indonesia some 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. How dangerous are dingoes?

Huge increase in 'petty' council fines,"Councils can bring in PSPOs to ban activities such as begging, nuisance drinking and even unauthorised cycling Nearly 10,000 fines for breaches of ""petty"" council orders were issued in England and Wales in 2018, with a quarter of those in Peterborough alone. Campaign group the Manifesto Club has called for the Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) to be scrapped. Councils can bring in PSPOs to ban activities such as begging, nuisance drinking and even unauthorised cycling. The Local Government Association said PSPOs were one way to ""tackle anti-social behaviour"". This video can not be played Hillingdon councillor David Simmonds ""makes no apology"" for the fines About 60% of the 9,930 fines were issued by just four councils - Peterborough (2,430), Bedford (1,489), Hillingdon (1,125) and Waltham Forest (966) - which all use private companies to issue the fines. People who do not comply with the orders can be required to pay a Â£100 fixed penalty. Rosie Brighouse, a lawyer for human rights charity Liberty, said she was concerned some wardens were ""acting with incentives to issue as many fines as possible"". Peterborough, which uses the private firm Kingdom Services Group to collect fines, issued 1,533 for ""unauthorised cycling"" in 2018, 861 for spitting, and 13 for ""failure to disperse"". A Peterborough City Council spokesman said: ""The reason Peterborough has more fines is because the PSPO areas cover a larger number of offences, including cycling, littering and spitting."" Slough has banned possession of a slingshot or catapult The Manifesto Club study found: Slough has banned possession of a slingshot, while Pendle introduced a curfew for under-16s Colchester council fined four people for putting up an A-frame Kirklees in West Yorkshire has outlawed fireworks and sky lanterns Three Rivers council, in Hertfordshire, issued 20 fines for school drop-offs Several councils including Derby, Newcastle, Poole, and Barking and Dagenham, issued fines for begging. The Manifesto Club, which uncovered the figures through a Freedom of Information Request, criticised the 420% increase in fines since 2016, when there were only 1,906 issued in England and Wales. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Tim Clement-Jones said: ""The shocking rise in petty PSPOs and fines means that thousands of people are being punished for entirely innocuous actions."" An LGA spokesman said: ""PSPOs are one of a number of ways councils can tackle anti-social behaviour problem. ""PSPOs will not be suitable or effective in all circumstances, and councils will consider other approaches which may better resolve the anti-social behaviour identified."" A Home Office spokesman added: ""We are clear PSPOs should be used proportionately to tackle anti-social behaviour.""

Democrats to press Trump over 'obstruction',"This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats have vowed to continue pursuing Donald Trump over allegations he obstructed justice, following the release of a report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. They want Robert Mueller, the man who collated the report, to publicly testify before congress about the work he has done. It comes after a redacted version of the document was released on Thursday. Mr Trump's legal team has said it completely exonerates the president. But while the report does say the president did not collude with the Russians, it did not come to a firm conclusion on the issue of obstruction of justice. It also reveals several occasions when Mr Trump tried to hinder the investigation itself - including attempting to have Mr Mueller removed. The 448-page redacted document,externalis the result of a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller, who was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation. ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions ""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" The report also reveals: Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try to get Mr Mueller removed over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned because ""he did not plan"" to follow the directive Mr Trump reportedly used an expletive when the investigation was announced, adding: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency"" Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely ""took place in public view"" The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"" Investigators viewed the president's written responses to their questions as ""inadequate"" but chose not to pursue a potentially lengthy legal battle to interview him Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a televised briefing that ""countless"" FBI officials had lost confidence in their boss, James Comey, but she told investigators that that statement was ""not founded on anything"" Democrat congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a joint statement said the report painted a ""disturbing picture of a president who has been weaving a web of deceit, lies and improper behaviour"". Pro-Trump Santas and other Mueller oddities What's new in the Mueller report? The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words The party has begun moves to try to obtain the full, unredacted document and to have Mr Mueller testify before Congress. Congresswoman Jackie Speier told the BBC that Mr Mueller had ""basically tossed the ball to Congress and said, 'you need to pursue obstruction of justice here'."" Allow Twitter content?

Democrats have also attacked US Attorney-General William Barr, accusing him of ""misleading"" them with an earlier summary of the report's findings regarding whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Barr held a news conference before the report was made public in which he backed the president. The report has long been viewed as a potential tool to impeach the president but the House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said this would not be ""worthwhile at this point"". ""Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgement,"" he told CNN. I think that the wider strategy of the Democrats is that they would like to see a president going into 2020 a bit wounded, a bit weakened. The danger of going down the impeachment route is that all that it results in is uniting the Republican party. For that reason I think the Democratic leadership would much rather knock the president around a bit than go down a route which would almost certainly end in failure and almost certainly be counter-productive. And for all the questions, doubts, contradictions, sleights of hand, Mr Trump emerges with two key headlines: Mueller says there was no collusion; the attorney-general says there was no obstruction of justice. Read more analysis from Jon Speaking at an event for veterans, Mr Trump said he was having a ""good day"" - adding that there was ""no collusion"" and ""no obstruction"". Who's who in the Trump-Russia saga? Mueller: America's most mysterious public figure Trump's other legal headaches Representatives for the president have also reiterated his view that the investigation was a ""hoax"" and called for reprisal inquiries. ""President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again,"" Mr Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. This video can not be played Trump on Mueller report: ""This should never happen to another president again"" ""Now the tables have turned, and it's time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation into President Trump, motivated by political retribution and based on no evidence whatsoever."" His comments followed a stream of social media posts by the president on Thursday regarding the report's release. In one tweet, he said he had the right to ""end the whole witch hunt"" and fire Mr Mueller had he wanted to. On Friday morning, Mr Trump tweeted again, using an expletive to call the report ""fabricated & totally untrue"". Russia has dismissed the findings of the report, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying it contained ""no new information"". ""As a whole the report as before does not present any reasonable proof at all that Russia allegedly meddled in the electoral process in the US,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Friday.

Snakes force Liberian leader from office,"President George Weah will return to his usual office on Monday Snakes have been found in Liberian President George Weah's office, forcing him to work from his private residence, the BBC has learnt. Press secretary Smith Toby told the BBC that on Wednesday two black snakes were found in the foreign affairs ministry building, his official place of work. All staff have been told to stay away until 22 April. ""It's just to make sure that crawling and creeping things get fumigated from the building,"" Mr Toby said. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosts the office of the president, so it did an internal memo asking the staff to stay home while they do the fumigation,"" he said. The office of the president has been based in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since a fire in 2006 gutted the nearby presidential mansion. A FrontPage Africa news website video shows workers trying to attack the snakes,externalwhen they appeared near the building's reception. ""The snakes were never killed,"" Mr Toby said.

A fleet of vehicles including escorts jeeps were parked outside. Mr Toby said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs started to fumigate on Friday.

But this was a bank holiday gathering with a difference, between police and activists converged at the centre of Oxford Circus. Officer numbers increased in the afternoon, with teams armed with tools removing those who had attached themselves to the boat. The atmosphere has been good natured, with protesters chatting to officers, a drum beating, and colourful flags fluttering in the slight breeze. But every now and then, whistles and cheers went up as protesters were carried away to waiting police vans, with shouts of ""climate justice now"". Police removed the last protester from the pink boat on Friday afternoon Protests are also being held at Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. The Met Police said officers had been working 12-hour shifts and have had leave cancelled. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Protesters stood by the tunnel leading to Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3, but all roads remain open. However, Robin Ellis-Cockcroft, 24, said the group had succeeded in creating an ""emotional disruption"" at Heathrow.

Swedish teenage schoolgirl activist Greta Thunberg spoke to activists in Rome Pepper spray was used against the protesters Pepper spray was used by anti-riot police in an attempt to disperse the demonstrators. Activists also gathered outside the Ministry of the Ecological and Inclusive Transition in La Defense, near Paris, and blocked the entrance of the headquarters of French oil giant Total there. Activists outside the Societe Generale declared it a climate crime scene Molasses, representing oil, was smeared outside the Societe Generale Meanwhile, two of the UK's leading thinkers on climate change dismissed the demand of Extinction Rebellion for virtually zero carbon emissions by 2025, arguing the 2050 date was more realistic. Corinne Le Quere, professor of climate change and science and policy at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that 2025 was ""probably quite unrealistic"" as a target to ""move completely away from fossil fuels"". The economist Lord Stern agreed, saying: ""The target of zero net emissions by 2050 makes sense and that looks like the right one.""

"Man 'chops off finger' after vote mistakeThe Indian man says he cut off his finger after voting for the ""wrong"" party by mistake.India","Mr Kumar says he voted for the ""wrong"" political party An Indian voter says he chopped off his index finger after realising he had voted for the ""wrong"" political party. Pawan Kumar says he accidentally ended up voting for the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in a video that has gone viral. He wanted to vote for a regional party - but was confused by the many symbols on the voting machine. Every voter's index finger is marked with indelible ink after they cast their ballot. He cast his vote on Thursday in Bulandshahr in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. This was the second phase of polling in the Indian general election. ""I wanted to vote for the elephant, but I voted for the flower by mistake,"" Mr Kumar can be heard saying in the video. He is referring to the party symbols displayed on the voting machine next to the name of each candidate. Modi: The man who wants 900m votes Paving the way for women to rule India Are India's election guidelines toothless? A really simple guide to India's general election While the BJP's symbol is a lotus, the elephant is the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), a regional heavyweight that has allied with two other regional parties against the BJP. Party symbols play a big role in India's elections because they are easy to identify in a country where literacy is low in many parts. There are also numerous regional parties and alliances, which often confuse voters. Mr Kumar is a Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) - a crucial vote bank for the BSP. Thursday's vote was seen as important for India's powerful regional parties, which dominate politics in their states and are fronted by charismatic local politicians. The election is taking place over seven stages, with votes being counted on 23 May. There are 900 million eligible voters, making this the biggest election the world has ever seen.

Mental health help focuses on social media,"New measures to tackle a reported rise in mental health problems among young girls linked to social media use have been announced. It follows a report for the Scottish government which also highlighted sleep disruption, body image and school pressures as contributory factors. Ministers have now committed Â£90,000 to produce advice on the healthy use of social media. A review on screen use and its effect on mental health has also been ordered. Health minister Clare Haughey said the government was committed to helping all young people ""to grow up in a modern Scotland with good mental wellbeing"". She said: ""We know that many young people in Scotland, particularly girls, are unsatisfied with their physical appearance, and that high levels of social media use may be detrimental to mental wellbeing. ""We also know that adolescent girls in Scotland report higher levels of social media use than boys. ""Social media does have the potential to be used in a hugely positive way, but we want to ensure young people are properly informed on how social media promotes unrealistic expectations."" Scottish Conservative mental health spokeswoman Annie Wells claimed young people were having to wait too long for support. She said: ""There's no doubt that we need to help children deal with the pressures it [social media] brings, yet the SNP have so far failed to provide the support they need. ""Until we see that situation improve, we risk these youngsters having to face a lifetime of chaos and misery if these issues are not addressed.""

Man 'chops off finger' after vote mistake,"Mr Kumar says he voted for the ""wrong"" political party An Indian voter says he chopped off his index finger after realising he had voted for the ""wrong"" political party. Pawan Kumar says he accidentally ended up voting for the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in a video that has gone viral. He wanted to vote for a regional party - but was confused by the many symbols on the voting machine. Every voter's index finger is marked with indelible ink after they cast their ballot. He cast his vote on Thursday in Bulandshahr in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. This was the second phase of polling in the Indian general election. ""I wanted to vote for the elephant, but I voted for the flower by mistake,"" Mr Kumar can be heard saying in the video. He is referring to the party symbols displayed on the voting machine next to the name of each candidate. Modi: The man who wants 900m votes Paving the way for women to rule India Are India's election guidelines toothless? A really simple guide to India's general election While the BJP's symbol is a lotus, the elephant is the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), a regional heavyweight that has allied with two other regional parties against the BJP. Party symbols play a big role in India's elections because they are easy to identify in a country where literacy is low in many parts. There are also numerous regional parties and alliances, which often confuse voters. Mr Kumar is a Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) - a crucial vote bank for the BSP. Thursday's vote was seen as important for India's powerful regional parties, which dominate politics in their states and are fronted by charismatic local politicians. The election is taking place over seven stages, with votes being counted on 23 May. There are 900 million eligible voters, making this the biggest election the world has ever seen.

Pet insurance payouts hit ÃÂ£785m record,"Payouts by pet insurers hit a record Â£785m in 2018, even though the number of claims submitted fell, according to the industry trade body. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said this was down to the higher cost of increasingly sophisticated medical care. The size of the average claim jumped by Â£36, or nearly 5%, to Â£793. The ABI said the ""overwhelming majority"" of pet insurance payouts were to meet veterinary treatment bills. Less common claims included pet owners asking to be reimbursed for the theft of a pet, the cost of advertising to find a lost animal, as well as liability for when a pet damaged property or injured someone. However, the ABI says these claims were ""tiny"" compared with veterinary treatment bills. Senior policy adviser for pet insurance, Joe Ahern, said: ""There is no NHS for animals, so if you've not got a pet policy in place, you risk having to foot veterinary bills out of your own pocket. ""These can often be in the thousands of pounds and vet treatment is only getting more expensive, not less."" The rise of the dog-napper Dog with seizures costs Â£30,000 to treat The size of the average claim on pet insurance jumped by Â£36, or 4.75%, to Â£793 between 2017 and 2018. However, the number of claims submitted fell to 990,000, down from 1.02 million the previous year. Total payouts increased by Â£10m to Â£785m - a rise of 1.3%. Nearly 4.3 million pets were covered by insurance last year, more than ever before, and an increase of 50,00 on 2017 But the ABI said there was still a ""worrying level of under-insurance"" among cat owners. There are thought to be 7.5 million cats in UK homes, but only 1.3 million are insured, whereas 2.8 million dogs are insured out of an estimated 8.5 million pet pooches. Average premiums fell slightly for the first time in eight years - down from Â£281 in 2017 to Â£279 in 2018. This is the first time there has been any decrease in pet premiums for eight years. Over the past ten years, the average claim has increased by 75%, whilst the average premium has only increased by 50%, according to the ABI. 11-month-old Bertie has already been in hospital twice Veterinary treatment bills come quickly and in full, as I found out when I took Bertie, our Portuguese Water Dog, to the vet. I was terrified - he was obviously in pain, whining, tired and lethargic. The vet recommended he stay in for the day, have some X-rays, an intravenous drip and painkillers. She got out her calculator, did a few sums and asked: ""Is Â£1,600 okay?"" I thought for a second she had said Â£160, which I thought was a bit steep. When reality dawned, I nearly needed to be revived myself. Luckily, we have pet insurance, which pays 90% of our vet bills. But Bertie has had at least three treatments for meningitis, including stays in hospital and is still on medication. Even just 10% of the cost of all that is eye-watering, but he is still worth every penny.

Dissidents had shown violent intentions,"Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. Londonderry's Creggan estate is central to their concerns. An intelligence-led operation took them into the area late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing journalist Lyra McKee is known as the New IRAand was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year. There have been other signs of violent intentions elsewhere. Recently, a horizontal mortar tube and command wire were discovered near Castlewellan in County Down. The dissident republican threat remains classed as severe and in recent days the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been assessing what could, in particular, occur over coming days. They had called for calm ahead of illegal parades planned in Londonderry and Lurgan in County Armagh. But that appeal was shattered by gunfire that killed a journalist standing near police lines.

Two woman die in Aberdeen beach tragedy,"Police have been examining the beach Two women have died after getting into difficulties while swimming in the sea at Aberdeen beach in the early hours of the morning. Police said the victims, aged 22 and 36, were foreign nationals who were living in the city. The women have not yet been named. Emergency services were called to the Beach Esplanade at about 00:45 after reports of two people in the water. The women were pulled from the sea and taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. However, Ch Insp Martin Mackay of Police Scotland said that they died in hospital despite ""extensive efforts"" to save their lives. This video can not be played Police give an update after two women die at Aberdeen beach A police cordon remains in place at the beach ""Above all, my thoughts are with all of those who will be affected by this tragic incident,"" said Ch Insp Mackay. ""While officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding why these women came to be in the water so late at night, at this stage there appears to be no suspicious circumstances. ""From our initial inquires, which includes speaking to a witness who was present at the time, we understand that they entered the water for the purposes of swimming - but sadly underestimated the conditions."" He said formal identification had not yet taken place, and efforts were continuing to contact the women's next of kin. The rescue operation included coastguard teams from Aberdeen and Stonehaven, a coastguard helicopter and an RNLI inshore lifeboat. Coastguard area commander Ross Greenhill said the women were located in the ""choppy"" water using searchlights, then recovered by the lifeboat crew. They were taken to Aberdeen lifeboat station and then transferred to hospital by ambulance. It is thought that the women were about 50 metres from the shore when they were found. Davie Orr, of the RNLI, said there had been an easterly breeze in recent weeks, which causes ""a bit of swell coming in towards the shore"". ""It was high tide as well, which also causes problems, particularly here because when the water's in there's not a ready escape to get out of the water,"" he said. ""So, it was high tide, a slight easterly breeze, and also being dark as well caused a bit of problem when you're searching for someone."" Ch Insp Mackay thanked all the rescue personnel who had attempted to save the two women. ""Our seas can be extremely unforgiving, conditions can change rapidly and I can't stress enough the dangers of entering the water at any time of the day or night when you are not suitably prepared,"" he added. ""Public safety is paramount and Police Scotland is committed to working with our partners to ensure people know of the dangers of entering any body of water whether you are swimming, sailing or walking near the water's edge."" A cordon was placed around an area of the beach after the incident, and police officers have spent Friday morning examining the scene.

"Mental health help focuses on social mediaThe Scottish government has committed Â£90,000 to produce advice on the healthy use of social media.Scotland","New measures to tackle a reported rise in mental health problems among young girls linked to social media use have been announced. It follows a report for the Scottish government which also highlighted sleep disruption, body image and school pressures as contributory factors. Ministers have now committed Â£90,000 to produce advice on the healthy use of social media. A review on screen use and its effect on mental health has also been ordered. Health minister Clare Haughey said the government was committed to helping all young people ""to grow up in a modern Scotland with good mental wellbeing"". She said: ""We know that many young people in Scotland, particularly girls, are unsatisfied with their physical appearance, and that high levels of social media use may be detrimental to mental wellbeing. ""We also know that adolescent girls in Scotland report higher levels of social media use than boys. ""Social media does have the potential to be used in a hugely positive way, but we want to ensure young people are properly informed on how social media promotes unrealistic expectations."" Scottish Conservative mental health spokeswoman Annie Wells claimed young people were having to wait too long for support. She said: ""There's no doubt that we need to help children deal with the pressures it [social media] brings, yet the SNP have so far failed to provide the support they need. ""Until we see that situation improve, we risk these youngsters having to face a lifetime of chaos and misery if these issues are not addressed.""

"Police 'stretched' by climate protestsPolice rest days are cancelled as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London.London","About half a dozen activists were arrested in a space of 20 minutes at Oxford Circus Police are being diverted from ""core local duties"" that keep London safe by the Extinction Rebellion protesters, Scotland Yard has said. More than 500 people have been arrested since Monday, including three charged with gluing themselves to a train. Police rest days have been cancelled over the bank holiday, as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London. Sajid Javid said the climate activists had ""no right to cause misery"" and the Met Police ""must take a firm stance"". Officers have also been asked to work 12-hour shifts, while the Violent Crime Task Force has had leave cancelled. ""This will have implications in the weeks and months beyond this protest as officers take back leave and the cost of overtime,"" a Met Police spokesman said. Traffic has been blocked at four sites since Monday British Transport Police said it ""continues to deploy additional officers throughout the London rail network to deter and disrupt further protest activity"". Heathrow Airport said it was ""working with the authorities"" following threats protesters may try to disrupt flights over the Easter weekend. The Met said ""strong plans"" were in place to enable a significant number of officers to be deployed to Heathrow if necessary. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? What is climate change? Police have made further arrests, but activists continue to block traffic at four sites around the capital. Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge have been occupied by protesters since Monday. Transport for London warned delays around those areas were expected ""throughout the day"". Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has said police may need new powers to deal with non-violent protests on this scale, due to the large number of arrestees for police and courts to deal with. Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters at Marble Arch Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters, saying it was the ""first real hopeful movement I've joined"". Speaking from the blockade at Marble Arch, Ms Thompson said: ""Our Planet is in deep danger, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to face problems the likes of which we cannot even begin to imagine. ""Unfortunately our governments haven't listened to us, so now we have to make them listen."" Activists remain glued to a boat in the middle of Oxford Circus On Wednesday, a man glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train carriage in Canary Wharf while a man and woman were removed from the roof. Cathy Eastburn, 51, from Lambeth in south London, Mark Ovland, 35 of Somerton in Somerset and Luke Watson, 29, of Manuden in Essex, appeared before Highbury Magistrates' Court charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway. They all pleaded not guilty to the charge and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 16 May. The Met said a total of 10 people had so far been charged in connection with the protests.

Some protesters have been seen returning to the blockades despite being arrested. Police action to deter activists was having the ""opposite"" effect, according to environmental scientist Dominic Goetz who has returned to Waterloo Bridge following his arrest on Tuesday. ""I don't know whether I will be arrested again or not. If I am, I think the consequences will probably not be particularly severe,"" the 47-year-old said. More than 425 people have been arrested since Monday Met chiefs have also condemned footage of officers dancing with protesters. Thevideos posted on social media,,externalwhich showed police officers joining activists at Oxford Circus on Wednesday evening, have been condemned as ""unacceptable behaviour"". ""We expect our officers to engage with protesters but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation,"" Cdr Jane Connors said. Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge In a letter to the home secretary, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested cuts to police funding were restricting the Met's ability to cope with the demonstrators. A group of demonstrators has been blocking Vauxhall Bridge for short periods of time as part of a ""swarming"" protest. Similar intermittent roadblocks have also been formed by activists at Piccadilly Circus. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Democrats pressure Trump on Russia report,"This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats have vowed to continue pursuing Donald Trump over allegations he obstructed justice, following the release of a report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. They want Robert Mueller, the man who collated the report, to publicly testify before congress about the work he has done. It comes after a redacted version of the document was released on Thursday. Mr Trump's legal team has said it completely exonerates the president. But while the report does say the president did not collude with the Russians, it did not come to a firm conclusion on the issue of obstruction of justice. It also reveals several occasions when Mr Trump tried to hinder the investigation itself - including attempting to have Mr Mueller removed. The 448-page redacted document,externalis the result of a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller, who was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation. ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions ""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" The report also reveals: Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try to get Mr Mueller removed over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned because ""he did not plan"" to follow the directive Mr Trump reportedly used an expletive when the investigation was announced, adding: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency"" Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely ""took place in public view"" The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"" Investigators viewed the president's written responses to their questions as ""inadequate"" but chose not to pursue a potentially lengthy legal battle to interview him Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a televised briefing that ""countless"" FBI officials had lost confidence in their boss, James Comey, but she told investigators that that statement was ""not founded on anything"" Democrat congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a joint statement said the report painted a ""disturbing picture of a president who has been weaving a web of deceit, lies and improper behaviour"". Pro-Trump Santas and other Mueller oddities What's new in the Mueller report? The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words The party has begun moves to try to obtain the full, unredacted document and to have Mr Mueller testify before Congress. Congresswoman Jackie Speier told the BBC that Mr Mueller had ""basically tossed the ball to Congress and said, 'you need to pursue obstruction of justice here'."" Allow Twitter content?

Democrats have also attacked US Attorney-General William Barr, accusing him of ""misleading"" them with an earlier summary of the report's findings regarding whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Barr held a news conference before the report was made public in which he backed the president. The report has long been viewed as a potential tool to impeach the president but the House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said this would not be ""worthwhile at this point"". ""Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgement,"" he told CNN. I think that the wider strategy of the Democrats is that they would like to see a president going into 2020 a bit wounded, a bit weakened. The danger of going down the impeachment route is that all that it results in is uniting the Republican party. For that reason I think the Democratic leadership would much rather knock the president around a bit than go down a route which would almost certainly end in failure and almost certainly be counter-productive. And for all the questions, doubts, contradictions, sleights of hand, Mr Trump emerges with two key headlines: Mueller says there was no collusion; the attorney-general says there was no obstruction of justice.

Journalist shot dead during Derry trouble,"This video can not be played Lyra McKee was one of Northern Ireland's most promising journalists, says the NUJ One of Northern Ireland's ""most promising"" journalists has been shot dead during rioting that police are treating as a terrorist incident. Dissident republicans are being blamed for killing 29-year-old Lyra McKee after violence broke out during police searches in Londonderry on Thursday.

The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that a gunman fired shots towards police officers in Derry's Creggan area at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. Mobile phone footage taken by a bystander during the rioting appears to show a masked gunman crouching down on the street and opening fire with a handgun.

""She was compassionate, she was honest, she was funny... she had so many friends and was loved by so many people."" Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. An intelligence-led operation took them into Londonderry's Creggan estate late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition. They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers. The group blamed for killing Lyra McKee is known as the New IRA and was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year.

""Violent dissident republicans are planning attacks in this city and we were carrying out a search operation in Creggan,"" said the PSNI's Mr Hamilton. Rioting began at Fanad Drive - more than 50 petrol bombs were thrown at police and two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire. ""I believe that this was orchestrated - orchestrated to a point that they just want to have violence and attack police,"" said Mr Hamilton.

"Stunt biker MacAskill to 'keep on going'A decade after becoming a YouTube sensation, a daredevil plans a return to the city where it all took off.","Danny MacAskill doing his famous Spiky Fence Rail Ride He is the Scottish stunt cyclist who landed on the world stage 10 years ago with a breakthrough video showing mind blowing tricks. Danny MacAskill was never off his bike during a whirlwind journey to becoming an internet sensation. And despite breaking more than 30 bones while practising his daredevil bike skills, the 33-year-old says he sees no end to the niche career he has carved out for himself. Originally from the Isle of Skye, MacAskill moved to Edinburgh in 2006. His first video was shot in the capital, his skills on two wheels winning 350,000 hits. Now his collection of YouTube films have amassed some 38 million views. YouTube stunt biker causes a stir,external Danny MacAskill's mum: 'I never worry about my son's stunts' Speaking to the BBC Scotland news website he said he was in a happy place and was glad he had stayed ""credible"" within the bike world rather than following big money offers. He said: ""After Inspired Bicycles came out I got lots of crazy offers from commercial brands but I picked the offers that let me ride my bike for fun. ""I had the chance like Olympic athletes have for mainstream work. ""I was also asked to be on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, but I didn't even know who she was because I had been living in my biking bubble and I was asked to join a circus in Korea. ""But I'm not interested in that stuff. It's always been about being in the mountain biking scene for me. ""It's all about being credible for me. You have to be credible within your scene and I would have been thrown out of the biking world if I had entered into show business."" Danny MacAskill performing at his Drop and Roll Tour Ten years on from travelling the world doing his bike stunts, MacAskill shows no signs of retiring - despite some painful injuries. He said: ""Back when I did Inspired Bicycles I had to take painkillers all the time for my wrists but that was because my body never had time to recover as I was cycling seven days a week, 365 days a year. ""Now because I travel so much my body gets a rest. I would rather be riding than resting though. ""I've had a lot of injuries and broke my knee cap in 2017 but its just part and parcel of progressing and it hasn't made me scared to get back on my bike."" MacAskill is just back from North America where he met up with his hero Hans Rey, a 52-year-old extreme mountain biker, who has inspired him that he has many years of biking ahead of him. He said: ""I absolutely plan to keep going, you have to adapt with the times, its not all about the biggest tricks, although yes there will be big stunts in my show at the Edinburgh Festival."" To mark his 10th anniversary he is to bring his street trials stunt display team to the capital to perform the Drop and Roll Tour at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. He will perform stunts made famous in his videos including the Spiky Fence Rail Ride and Tree Flair (Backflip 180) performed on the Meadows in Edinburgh for his first video, Inspired Bicycles, posted on YouTube in April 2009. Danny MacAskill's Drop and Roll Live will be on at The Lafayette at Underbelly's Circus Hub on The Meadows between 3 and 24 August.

"Teachers 'fund resources from own money'One in five teachers buys lesson materials once a week, a survey by the NASUWT union suggests.Family & Education","One in five teachers is using their own money to buy classroom resources once a week, a survey by the NASUWT suggests. And 45% of the 4,386 members of the teachers' union surveyed said they had bought essentials such as food or clothing for pupils in the last year. The survey comes as about 7,000 head teachers in England wrote to parents before the Easter holidays highlighting what they call a ""funding crisis"". Ministers say school finances are a priority for the next spending review. ""We are told there is no money for anything, all departmental budgets have been frozen and all the stockrooms are empty,"" one teacher responded in the study. ""Basic resources are rationed out at the beginning of each term and once they are gone, there is no more unless you purchase them yourself."" Another said: ""I've had to purchase small tables, CD player, outdoor provision and storage."" Schools facing 'financial cliff edge' 'Worsening child poverty harms learning' One teacher said: ""Small amounts do add up during the year, all departments are feeling the pinch and books/texts (English GCSE included) are now shared for reading in lessons and not allowed home as they used to be. ""We cannot afford for items to be lost - so we deprive students of the chance for self-directed study for those who are motivated."" Another commented: ""Last time my lesson was observed, by a senior leader, I was graded low for lack of relevant resources - despite having spent Â£20 on stuff. ""The expectation is we purchase things ourselves as our job is a vocation! I'm fed up of hearing this over and over again. It's never enough and am ready to leave."" The NASUWT survey, which is published ahead of the union's annual conference in Belfast over the Easter weekend, covers both primary and secondary schools and also found that teachers were paying for basic necessities such as food, clothing and toiletries for pupils. One teacher said: ""The worst thing to experience as a teacher is watching a hungry child who is in receipt of free school meals, having to stand and watch their friends eat breakfast before school or have snacks at morning break when they are hungry. ""Typically, I have used my credit on the prepayment system to give children cheese on toast or a hot drink, or any other hot food."" Another said: ""I have paid for and supplied materials to resole or repair shoes. Pupils regularly come without the basics such as a pencil to write with."" Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said that teachers were ""shouldering financial burdens to support their pupils"". ""Teachers care deeply about the pupils they teach and will go to great lengths to ensure their needs are being met,"" she said. ""Teachers once again are being left to pick up the pieces of failed education, social and economic policies."" But children's minister Nadhim Zahawi said there was ""more money going into our schools than ever before"". ""However, we recognise the budgeting challenges schools face and have introduced a wide range of practical support to help schools and head teachers make the most of every pound on non-staff costs."" Tackling disadvantage was a ""priority for this government"", he added, which was why ""we are making sure that more than a million of the most disadvantaged children are also accessing free school meals throughout their education"". In his budget in October last year, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that schools in England would receive a one-off Â£400m - on average, Â£10,000 per primary school and Â£50,000 per secondary school - to buy ""that extra bit of kit"". However, his words provoked an angry responseamong some teachers and parents on social media, who said he was out of touch. There have been repeated concerns from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing in July last year that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said that almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. The WorthLess? campaign group, which is made up of head teachers across England, has been campaigning for better funding for schools. The group sends letters to parents and carerssetting out their concerns and has protested at Westminster. Their latest letter, sent at the end of term, was circulated by some 7,000 head teachers.

Trump 'tried to get Mueller fired',"This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions US President Donald Trump tried to get the man appointed to investigate his links to Russia fired, a long-awaited report has revealed. The 448-page redacted document,,externalcollated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, was finally released on Thursday. Mr Trump's legal team has described the report as a ""total victory"". But the country's top lawyer, William Barr, is facing heavy criticism of his handling of the report's release. Senior Democrats have accused the attorney general of ""misleading"" them with an earlier summary of the report's findings regarding whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. The mammoth document is the product of a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller - who was appointed to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Reaction to the Mueller report as it happened What's new in the Mueller report? Pro-Trump Santas and other Mueller oddities The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words His team's investigation has led to 35 people being charged, including several who were a part of the president's campaign and administration. Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation. ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. ""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" The report says that in June 2017, Mr Trump called Don McGahn - then a White House lawyer - to try to get Mr Mueller removed over alleged ""conflicts of interest"". This video can not be played US Attorney General William Barr on Mueller report findings Mr McGahn told the special counsel he resigned after feeling ""trapped because he did not plan to follow the President's directive"" and would not have known what to say to Mr Trump had he called again. The report also reveals: Mr Trump reportedly used an expletive when the investigation was announced, adding: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency"" Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely ""took place in public view"" The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration, including former FBI Director James Comey, refused to ""carry out orders"" Investigators viewed the president's written responses to their questions as ""inadequate"" but chose not to pursue a potentially lengthy legal battle to interview him Mr Trump dictated a misleading response as to what the June 2016 meeting between Russian intermediaries and Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower was about - this had earlier been denied by Mr Trump's lawyer and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders The special counsel considered charging the president's son, Donald Trump Jr, and son-in-law Jared Kushner but did not think they could meet the Department of Justice's burden of proof that they wilfully broke the law Read more on the new findings Robert Mueller has said that the written answers provided by Donald Trump were inadequate, but if that's the case, why didn't he use his subpoena powers to demand the president come before his investigating committee and answer questions directly? That was an arm wrestle he chose not to get into with the president for fear that it may lead to the permanent death of his investigation. So he ducked that one. Others may ask: ""Well, if you thought there was a level of obstruction why didn't you say there should be an indictment?"" I'd say what he's done here - to use an American analogy - is he's taken the baseball bat, he's put it on home plate and he's leaving it for other people to pick up and take a swing. He's saying to Congress essentially: ""I've looked at it. I didn't resolve this question. I didn't exonerate him. But if you want to have a go, that's a different thing.""

His comments followed a stream of social media posts by the president on Thursday regarding the report's release. In one tweet, he said had the right to ""end the whole witch hunt"" and fire Mr Mueller had he wanted to. Representative Jerry Nadler confirmed that the House Committee on the Judiciary had already requested the special counsel to appear ""as soon as possible"". Senior Democrats have called on Mr Mueller to testify to them directly in order to ""restore public trust"" after what they described as Mr Barr's ""partisan behaviour"" regarding the report. The attorney general, who was appointed by Mr Trump, held a news conference before the report was made public in which he backed the president. His actions have provoked top Democrats to publicly question his impartiality and independence. This video can not be played Democrat Jerry Nadler accuses the attorney general of ""waging a media campaign"" for Trump ""Attorney General Barr appears to have shown an unsettling willingness to undermine his own department in order to protect President Trump,"" Mr Nadler said on Thursday. He also said he would issue a subpoena for a copy of the full uncensored version of Mr Mueller's findings. A joint statement by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who lead the Democrats in Congress, said it was ""clear"" the report ""appears to undercut"" Mr Barr's characterisation of it.

Sara Canning, speaking at a vigil in Derry, saidthe journalist's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"".

Footage courtesy of Leona O'Neill Prime Minister Theresa May said the killing was ""shocking and senseless"". Ms McKee was a journalist who ""died doing her job with great courage"", added Mrs May. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that a gunman fired shots towards police officers in Derry's Creggan area at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. Mobile phone footage taken by a bystander during the rioting appears to show a masked gunman crouching down on the street and opening fire with a handgun. Ms McKee, who was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle, was wounded.

The leaders of Northern Ireland's six biggest political parties said they were ""united in rejecting those responsible for this heinous crime"". In a joint statement, they said: ""Lyra's murder was also an attack on all the people of this community, an attack on the peace and democratic processes. ""It was a pointless and futile act to destroy the progress made over the last 20 years, which has the overwhelming support of people everywhere.""

Police were searching for weapons and ammunition in Derry when the violence started Ms McKee's death has caused a ""wave of shock and sympathy"" and was ""met with global condemnation, horror and revulsion"", he added.

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said Ms McKee ""changed lives"" as a journalist and an activist and would continue to do so. Irish people stood in ""solidarity with the people of Derry"" after the murder,"" he said. ""We stand with you as strong as your walls and for as long as they stand,"" he added. ""This was an attack not just on one citizen - it was an attack on all of us, our nation and our freedoms.""
