Trump says Brexit 'no problem' for Ireland,"This video can not be played Donald Trump talks Brexit on arrival in Ireland The issue of the Irish border after Brexit will ""not be a problem at all,"" Donald Trump has claimed on his first visit to Ireland as US President. He arrived at Shannon Airport at about 16:45 local time and held a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar. He told Mr Varadkar that Americans ""love the Irish"" and said he believed things would work out well with ""with your wall, your border"" after Brexit. Mr Trump then travelled to Doonbeg to stay at his golf resort. Hebought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in County Clare in 2014. Why does Trump matter to Ireland? Welcome to 'Trump town' Mr Varadkar welcomed Mr Trump to Ireland and said it was the sixth time that a serving American president has visited the state. Mr Trump described Mr Varadkar as his friend and said the relationship between Ireland and the US was ""as good as it's ever been, maybe better"". The Trumps arrived on Air Force One in Ireland at about 16:45 local time The president added that there were ""millions"" of Irish people in the US and said: ""I think I know most of them because they're my friends. ""We love the Irish, so it's an honour to be here."" This video can not be played Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? Mr Trump, who just completed a three-day state visit to the UK, said he would discuss Brexit, the military and trade during his meeting with Mr Varadkar. ""Probably you'll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very much involved with Brexit as you know, and I think it will all work out very well,"" Mr Trump said. ""And also for you, with your wall, your border. We have a border situation in the United States and you have one over here, but I hear it's going to work out very well."" The taoiseach pointed out the Irish government wanted to avoid ""a border or wall"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Donald and Melania Trump signed the visitors book at Shannon Airport Mr Trump replied: ""I think you do, I think you do.  The way it works now is good, you want to try and keep it that way."" The president added that Ireland was in ""great shape"" and that once a new UK prime minister was installed in Downing Street, he hoped a Brexit deal or resolution could be negotiated with the EU. He also said he hoped the US and Irish government would agree on access to E3 working visas for Irish citizens to the US. The two leaders then went to meet in private. In a solo press conference after the meeting, Mr Varadkar was asked about Mr Trump's description of the Irish border as a ""wall"" and whether or not the president understood how much the Irish government wanted to avoid a hard border after Brexit. ""He's the president of America and there are nearly 200 countries in the world, so I don't think it's possible for him to have an in-depth understanding of issues in every single country, which is why this engagement is important,"" Mr Varadkar replied.

The taoiseach also said: ""He is in favour of Brexit as you know, and we're not, but he understands that a major issue is the border between north and south and he shares our objective to keep the border open as it is now, respecting the Good Friday Agreement."" Mr Varadkar also said the pair discussed the Republic of Ireland's low rate of corporation tax and agreed on the need for governments to work together to ensure large companies pay their ""fair share"" of tax. The taoiseach said he pointed out that the economic relationship between Ireland and America has ""changed"" and was now ""very much a two-way relationship"". As in the UK there were people protesting the arrival of the US president ""Ireland is in the top 10 when it comes to investors into the United States and also there are nearly 100,000 Americans working for Irish-owned firms in the United States, so it was another opportunity to point out that the economic relationship is now very much mutually beneficial,"" Mr Varadkar said. President Trump was originally due to visit the Republic of Ireland last year, but the trip was postponed for scheduling reasons. There is likely to be interest in what he has to say about maintaining the US-Ireland relationship. Outside Shannon Airport people gathered, both in support of the President and to protest at his visit. Supporters of Donald Trump outside Shannon Airport on Wednesday A protest took place in Belfast on Tuesday evening against the president's visit. Donald Trump bought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in 2014 President Trump will depart Shannon on Thursday morning to go to France for further commemorations. He will hold a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron before returning to his Doonbeg resort. Senior Irish officials have been invited by the US delegation to Mr Trump's golf club, including the Irish government's special envoy to the US, John Deasy, and Ireland's ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall. Mr Trump is expected to play golf on Friday before flying back to the US. In Pictures: Trump's first day in Ireland Doonbeg's warm welcome for Trump.

Government steps in at crisis council,"The government says the council's children's services is failing to perform ""to an adequate standard"" The government is to oversee a cash-strapped council's children's services department after a report found people in its care were at ""potential risk"". Earlier this month, a letter from Ofsted to the chief executive of Northamptonshire County Councilsaid its social workers were ""overwhelmed"". The government says the council's children's services is failing to perform ""to an adequate standard"". The authority has twice banned itself from spending in 2018 amid cash issues. A children's services commissioner has been appointed with the task of ""securing immediate improvement in the authority's delivery of children's social care services"". Malcolm Newsam, who will take up the role,joins two other government-appointed commissionersat the county council. Mr Newsam's previous appointments include a period as the commissioner for children's social care in Rotherham. The Conservative-run council - which hascommitted to make Â£65m of cuts- will be scrapped in 2020, along with seven other Northamptonshire borough and district councils,to make way for two new unitary authorities. On Thursday, it was announced that nextMay's elections for Northamptonshire have been postponedwhile a consultation on the future of the county's local government structure is taken out.

In a statement, the Northamptonshire Commissioners said the decision ""will enable Northamptonshire to pay off the deficit carried over from last year, and to restore a sensible level of reserves, all from within the Council's own financial resources"". However, the dispensation will not allow for the funds to be used to subsidise next year's budget.

Why Donald Trump matters to Ireland,"Leo Varadkar and Donald Trump met at the White House earlier this year The improbable election of Donald Trump in 2016, coming just months after the Brexit referendum, added another element of uncertainty into the Irish economy. Since taking office, he hasradically overhauled US tax rules, shaken the foundations of global trade byslapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China, and repeatedly expressed support for Brexit. Just this week, he advocated the UK leave the EU without a deal -and said Nigel Farage should be involved in the negotiations. The president lands in the Republic of Ireland later on Wednesday for a two day visit that will include a stop-over at his golf resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar. Given the hugely important economic ties between Ireland and the US, trade, jobs and Brexit are likely to dominate the agenda. The US accounts for nearly three quarters of the foreign investment into Ireland, experts say Big, big, big. The US is the single largest source of foreign direct investment in Ireland, with more than 700 American companies employing an estimated 160,000 people. ""The United States accounts for about 70% of the foreign investment into Ireland and it continues to be a very strong source market across a number of sectors,"" says Kevin Sammon, director of global communications at IDA Ireland, Ireland's state agency responsible for attracting inward investment. ""US businesses have been locating in Ireland for over 100 years and, judging by recent investment numbers, they continue to see Ireland as a reliable partner for them in Europe."" Some of those companies are among the world's largest, including technology giants like Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft, as well as a slew of drug companies such as Pfizer and healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson. Experts say they've been lured to Ireland by a combination of factors, including its well-educated, multi-cultural workforce, easy access to the EU market and, of course, the relatively low 12.5% corporate tax offering. This video can not be played Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? That's attracted the ire of President Trump. He has, on a number of occasions, name-checked Ireland as a destination of choice for US companies seeking a low-tax base. Ireland has also made headlines internationally for the aggressive tax planning of some of the companies that have made the country their home, and their use of tax loopholes. President Trump unveiled a sweeping tax reform plan in 2017 to encourage US companies to bring earnings back to the US. Last St Patrick's Day, he quipped thatthe Irish were ""sharp, they're smart, they're great"",external. ""And they're brutal enemies."" It's not all one-way, though. There are about 800 Irish companies active in the US market, employing 100,000 US citizens across the country, according to the American Chamber of Commerce. ""Ireland is now the ninth largest investor in the United States,"" says Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland. ""It's very much a two-way street. The US administration would have a strong focus in encouraging Irish companies to create more jobs in the States."" Yes and no. The US is alsoa significant location for Irish goods exports, pipped only by the EU as a whole,external. ""You cannot overstate the importance of the US-Irish relationship for the Irish economy,"" says Prof Ron Davies, head of economics at University College Dublin. ""The multinationals are a big part of it, and maybe they don't pay as much tax as some people think they should, but they still pay a significant amount in terms of tax."" The economic links: 700Number of US multinational companies in Republic of Ireland 160,000Number of people employed in those companies 70%US share of total foreign investment into RoI Since Ireland's recovery began following its crippling recession, its corporation tax take has dramatically surged. It increased by 26% last year to â¬10.4bn (Â£9.2bn), driven by higher and increased payments from manufacturing companies and big multinational firms. The share of corporation tax paid by the top 10 corporate taxpayers now accounts for 45% of all the tax paid. ""There is a special relationship there that has massive economic benefits,"" adds Prof Davies. But it also, arguably, leaves Ireland vulnerable to outside economic shocks. Changes in the global trade order for one - something which President Trump has set his eyes on. In March 2018, he saidtrade wars were good, tweeting that the US was ""losing billions of dollars on trade"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". During his election campaign, he spoke aggressively about trade, US agreements and even some of the country's trading partners. Since the late 1940s, the global trend has been towards reducing or eliminating barriers to trade and global commerce. Facebook is one of the US companies which has European headquarters in Ireland But Mr Trump is sceptical about that policy. Economists have warned that, given the open nature of Ireland's economy, that could spell trouble. ""What he's talking about doing to international trade norms, that is going to have a very swift, very direct impact on Ireland,"" says Prof Davies. ""He can't pick a trade war with Ireland because we're part of the EU, but do I think he can pick a trade war with the European Union? Sure, it seems to be his thing."" The Irish economy performed strongly once again in 2018, and the IDA says there has yet to be an impact on US investment flows into Ireland. But its chief executive, Martin Shanahan, has urged caution and says Ireland cannot be complacent. He said there had been a slowdown in decision-making from potential US investors. ""Ireland is a small open trading economy, and increased nationalism and protectionism is likely to have an impact on future FDI figures,""he said last year,external. Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, says there is huge expansion taking place in Ireland Prof Davies says the president's support for Brexit is a negative for Ireland. ""For me the biggest worrying aspect is his sticking his fingers in Brexit, encouraging Boris Johnson, saying Nigel Farage should have a place at the [negotiating] table, because as the UK goes, so does Ireland,"" he says. That could mean a greater risk of a hard Brexit, he says, arguing that would be ""extraordinarily bad news for Ireland"". But Mr Redmond says there are still ""very significant"" job announcements from US firms right across Ireland. ""Seven out of 10 of the leadership of US multinationals in Ireland say that Ireland is a better place to invest than it was three years ago. So there is huge ambition and huge expansion going on,"" he says. ""We've never seen the level of ambition in both directions in terms of business investment."" Is Trump right about Nato?

Ronaldo hat-trick puts Portugal in final,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 86th international goal with a first-half free-kick before going on to add to his tally in the second-half Portugal manager Fernando Santos described Cristiano Ronaldo as ""a genius"" after his superb hat-trick ensured Portugal reached the Nations League final with victory over Switzerland at the Estadio do Dragao. Ronaldo, 34, had given the hosts the lead with a stunning first-half free-kick that flew into the bottom-right corner, wrong-footing Swiss keeper Yann Sommer. Switzerland levelled in the second period when Ricardo Rodriguez tucked away a video assistant referee-awarded penalty - after Felix Brych had initially signalled for a penalty at the other end. But after consulting his pitch-side monitor, referee Brych instead gave a spot-kick for Nelson Semedo's foul on Switzerland's Steven Zuber. Incensed by the decision, the hosts struggled to build any rhythm as the game appeared to drift towards extra-time. However, Ronaldo made the crucial difference late on, sweeping Bernardo Silva's cross into the corner of the net, before firing into the same spot 102 seconds later. ""In terms of adjectives to describe Ronaldo's game - I have used many,"" said Santos, Ronaldo's former manager at Sporting Lisbon. ""I was his coach in 2003 and I could see where he would go. There are genius paintings and sculptures and he is a football genius. ""When someone scores three goals, they are the difference maker."" Portugal play the winners ofThursday's semi-final between England and the Netherlands(19:45 BST), with the final in Porto on Sunday. 'He scored threeâ¦ nothing new for him' - Ronaldo shines again on international stage Re-live Ronaldo's hat-trick as Portugal beat Switzerland Why Portugal are so much more than just Ronaldo Joao Felix - is this the most exciting player since Ronaldo? Prior to this match, Ronaldo had featured just twice in Portugal's past eight international games, playing no part at all in their qualification for the semi-finals of this tournament. After drawing blanks in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Serbia and Ukraine in March, and in Portugal's final two games of the World Cup last summer, he once again demonstrated his enduring quality in the international arena. He may no longer be at the peak of his powers, but 350 days after scoring his last international goal, he added to his tally by winning and scoring from a free-kick. In trademark fashion he dipped the ball over the Switzerland wall and it was past Sommer in a flash with the goalkeeper unable to readjust. And his importance as the scorer of great goals came to the fore with Santos' team struggling to find answers against a resourceful and purposeful Swiss side. A darting run moved him onto Silva's cross and a step-over and shimmy gave him the space to dispatch another clinical strike to make the game safe for the European champions. It brought up his 53rd hat-trick for club and country, and he now sits second on the all-time international top scorers chart with 88 goals in 157 matches, with only Iran's Ali Daei (109) ahead of him. ""Both the Netherlands and England are excellent teams and either will present great opposition,"" said Ronaldo when asked about Sunday's Nations League final. ""I hope that Portugal can win, that the stadium will be full and that the fans can support us like they did today. We are stronger together."" While Portugal had been labelled favourites in this tie by Swiss boss Vladimir Petkovic, his team enjoyed more shots and greater possession than the hosts. Inspired by Liverpool midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri, the Swiss carved out several goalscoring chances before falling behind to Ronaldo's free-kick. Shaqiri and Haris Seferovic both went close, with the Benfica forward smashing a sweetly struck shot against the crossbar. But when their deserved equaliser arrived it came in bizarre fashion, with Silva going down and appearing to win a penalty for Portugal before VAR intervened. Instead of Ronaldo shaping up to take a spot-kick from 12 yards, play was brought back to deal with an earlier incident between Semedo and Zuber in the Portugal penalty area. And the faintest of touches from the Barcelona full-back, on Zuber, who initially appeared to trip over his own legs, convinced the referee to award the unlikeliest of penalties against the hosts. ""Portugal had street smarts, they had the cherry on top of the cake and that made the difference. Four shots, three goals,"" said manager Petkovic. ""On the one hand we were up against a very strong opponent, but over 90 minutes we showed we are a strong team and that we can make life for a top side difficult too."" Ronaldo scored with three of his five shots on goal Portugal have won five of their past eight games against Switzerland (D1 L2), despite conceding in six of those matches. This is the first encounter between Portugal and Switzerland to see both sides score since March 1993 (1-1 in a World Cup qualifier). Switzerland are winless in their past nine games played in Portugal (including Euro 2004), losing seven and drawing twice since a 2-0 victory against Portugal in a World Cup qualifier in April 1969. Portugal have lost just one of their past 16 games across all competitions (W6 D9) and are unbeaten since a 2-1 defeat against Uruguay in the 2018 World Cup (P9 W4 D5 L0 since). Two of Cristiano Ronaldo's past five goals for Portugal have come from direct free-kicks; only two of his previous 52 goals prior to this were scored in the same manner. Ricardo Rodriguez's past three goals for Switzerland - and five of his past six - have been penalties. Only Strahil Popov for Bulgaria (four) and Benjamin Kololli for Kosovo (five) have been directly involved in more goals among defenders in this Nations League campaign than Switzerland's Ricardo RodrÃ­guez (three - two goals, one assist). Portugal play the winners of Thursday's semi-final between England and the Netherlands (19:45 BST) in the Nations League final in Porto on Sunday (also 19:45). Switzerland will take part in Sunday's third-place play-off at 14:00.

'Bodies pulled from Nile' after Sudan crackdown,"Khartoum's barricaded streets are nearly deserted as security forces sweep the city Forty bodies have been pulled from the River Nile in the Sudanese capital Khartoum following a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests, opposition activists said on Wednesday. Doctors linked to the opposition said the bodies were among 100 people believed killed since security forces attacked a protest camp on Monday. Reports said a feared paramilitary group was attacking civilians. Sudan's ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) vowed to investigate. Residents in Khartoum told the BBC they were living in fear as members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) roamed the streets. The paramilitary unit - formerly known as the Janjaweed militia - gained notoriety in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan in 2003. Sudan's crisis: What you need to know Sudan crisis: Return of the feared Janjaweed Africa Live: Updates from Khartoum and other stories ""Forty bodies of our noble martyrs were recovered from the river Nile yesterday,"" the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said in a Facebook post. An official from the group told the BBC that they had witnessed and verified the bodies in hospitals and that the death toll now stood at 100. A former security officerquoted by Channel 4's Sudanese journalist Yousra Elbagir,externalsaid that some of those thrown into the Nile had been beaten or shot to death and others hacked to death with machetes. ""It was a massacre,"" the unnamed source said. Security forces, seen here on Monday, moved against protesters after a long stand-off On Wednesday, the head of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC), General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, apologised for the loss of life and called for resumed negotiations - reversing a statement the previous day in which he said dialogue was over. But a Sudanese alliance of protestors and opposition groups rejected the invitation. One of its leading members said the TMC could not be trusted. The deputy head of the TMC defended the violent suppression, claiming that the protesters had been infiltrated by rogue elements and drug dealers. ""We will not allow chaos, we will not allow chaos and we will not go back on our convictions. There is no way back. We must impose the respect of the country by law,"" said Mohammed Hamadan - also known as Hemedti. Hemeti: The warlord who may control Sudan's future Demonstrators had been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, days before President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown after 30 years in power. Their representatives had been negotiating with the TMC and agreed a three-year transition that would culminate in elections. But on Monday, forces swept in and opened fire on unarmed protesters in the square. On Tuesday, Gen Burhan announced that negotiations with protesters were over, all previous agreements were cancelled, and elections would be held within nine months. Demonstrators had demanded a longer period to guarantee fair elections and to dismantle the political network associated with the former government. This video can not be played Sudan military attacks protesters International condemnation of the crackdown was swift and on Wednesday Gen Burhan made another televised speech in which he said the TMC was willing to resume negotiations. Protesters had called for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Fitr, marked on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, to be celebrated in the streets, as a gesture of defiance against the military. But much of Khartoum is under lockdown. Witnesses said protesters had retreated to residential areas where they were building barricades and burning tyres. Sudan's military has faced international condemnation for its attack, but there were clear signs this was likely to happen. The country has been driven backwards by a military elite intent on holding on to power. The TMC has scrapped agreements reached with the opposition Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), saying this will speed up the transition to democratic elections. That plan is likely a fiction. The military also enjoys another advantage. In an age of international division, the notion of an ""international community"" pressuring the regime is fantasy. Sudan's crisis has exposed the reality of international politics - that force can have its way, without consequence, if the killers and torturers represent a valuable asset to other powers. It is impossible to say whether the FFC can come back as a street-driven force. What will not change - in fact what has been deepened - is the alienation of people from their rulers. Read more from Fergal Protest organisers, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), accused the TMC of carrying out ""a massacre"" and urged its pro-democracy supporters to continue protesting peacefully. ""We have reached the point where we can't even step out of our homes because we are scared to be beaten or to be shot by the security forces,"" one Khartoum resident told the BBC. Another resident, who also asked not to be named, said he was pulled from his car by members of the Janjaweed and beaten on his head and back. Security forces, seen here on Monday, moved against protesters after a long stand-off A pharmacist who spoke to the BBC from Khartoum said RSF troops were shutting down hospitals to prevent civilians receiving treatment. ""They kicked us out from two hospitals that were giving aid to the injured and the victims of the gunshots,"" he said. ""It's an order from the military council to shut down those hospitals because we were giving aid for the citizens."" A woman, identified only as Sulaima, told the BBC that troops from the Rapid Support Forces were ""all over Khartoum"". ""They're surrounding neighbourhoods, they're threatening people. They're also using live ammunition. They're everywhere. We're not feeling safe and we don't have trust in the security forces. It's complete chaos."" Large numbers of heavily armed troops were also reported on the streets of Omdurman, Sudan's second-largest city, just across the River Nile from Khartoum.

Sudan opposition rejects talks as toll mounts,"A Sudanese protester stands on a barricade in Khartoum on Wednesday A Sudanese official has denied that at least 100 people were killed by a paramilitary unit during protests, saying that the number was at most 46. Doctors linked to the opposition on Wednesday said at least 100 people had been killed in the capital, Khartoum, amid pro-democracy protests. They said 40 bodies were pulled from the River Nile in Khartoum on Tuesday. Authorities had initially stayed quiet, but a health ministry official put the number at 46 early on Thursday. Sudanese opposition activists have rejected an offer of talks from the country's military council, saying it cannot be trusted amid a violent crackdown on protesters. Africa Live: Updates from Khartoum and other stories Hemeti: The warlord who may control Sudan's future Sudan's crisis: What you need to know Residents told the BBC they were living in fear in the capital. The deputy head of the military council defended the violent suppression, claiming that the protesters had been infiltrated by rogue elements and drug dealers. ""We will not allow chaos and we will not go back on our convictions. There is no way back. We must impose the respect of the country by law,"" said Mohammed Hamadan - also known as Hemeti - on Wednesday. Numerous reports from Khartoum said the paramilitary unit, the feared Rapid Support Forces (RSF), was roaming the city's nearly deserted streets, targeting civilians. Security forces, seen here on Monday, moved against protesters after a long stand-off Formerly known as the Janjaweed militia, the RSF gained notoriety for brutal atrocities in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan in 2003. Reports continue to come in of these militia going into neighbourhoods and killing people. Their leader claims it is impostors behind the violence. Sudan crisis: Return of the feared Janjaweed By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Khartoum People are still coming to terms with the violence of the last few days. At the former sit-in area - there are torn and charred posters as well as burnt-out tents. The fear is that more of the dead could still be there. Security forces seem to outnumber civilians on the streets of the capital. Reports continue to come in of their brutal crackdown. At Ibrahim Maleek Teaching Hospital - the doctors and nurses have not come to work because they're afraid of being targeted. Instead, it's the medical students who are treating patients. Like 33-year-old Mohanned Mirghani - he says he was shot at close range by the Rapid Support Forces. ""They shot me from close range; the RSF were the distance that you are from me now. Two of my friends were also shot but I don't know what happened to them."" It's hard to get a proper sense of what's happened. One big hindrance is the fact that the military rulers have cut off the internet. Sudan has been controlled by a military council since pro-democracy protests led to the ousting of veteran President Omar al-Bashir in April, after 30 years of authoritarian rule. Demonstrators had been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters, while their representatives had negotiated with the military council and agreed a three-year transition that would culminate in elections. But on Monday, security forces swept in and opened fire on unarmed protesters in the square. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the military council, announced that the agreement was cancelled and an election would take place within nine months. This video can not be played Sudan military attacks protesters On Wednesday, however, after Saudi Arabia publicly called for a resumption of talks, Gen Burhan reversed course and said the military council would ""open our arms to negotiate with no restriction"". The offer was rejected by the opposition. ""The Sudanese people are not open for talks,"" said Amjad Farid, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) which spearheaded the protests against Mr Bashir. ""The Sudanese people are not open to this TMC (Transitional Military Council) that kills people and we need justice and accountability before talks about any political process,"" Mr Farid told the AFP news agency. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors - one of the groups behind the protests - said on Wednesday that 40 bodies had been recovered from the River Nile. An official from the group told the BBC that they had witnessed and verified the bodies in hospitals and that the death toll now stood at at least 100. A former security officerquoted by Yousra Elbagir, a journalist with the UK's Channel 4,,externalsaid that some of those thrown into the Nile had been beaten or shot to death and others hacked to death with machetes. ""It was a massacre,"" the unnamed source said. Many Khartoum streets are deserted Much of Khartoum has been under lockdown in the wake of the killings. Witnesses told the BBC that protesters had retreated to residential areas, where they were building barricades and burning tyres. ""We have reached the point where we can't even step out of our homes because we are scared to be beaten or to be shot by the security forces,"" one Khartoum resident said, asking not to be named. Another resident told the BBC he had been pulled from his car by members of the RSF and beaten on his head and back. How protesters kept going during Ramadan The art fuelling Sudan's revolution 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' A pharmacist who spoke to the BBC from Khartoum said RSF troops were shutting down hospitals to prevent civilians receiving treatment. ""They kicked us out from two hospitals that were giving aid to the injured and the victims of the gunshots,"" he said. ""It's an order from the military council to shut down those hospitals because we were giving aid for the citizens."" A woman, identified only as Sulaima, told the BBC that troops from the Rapid Support Forces were ""all over Khartoum"". ""They're surrounding neighbourhoods, they're threatening people. They're also using live ammunition. They're everywhere. We're not feeling safe and we don't have trust in the security forces. It's complete chaos."" Large numbers of heavily armed troops were also reported on the streets of Omdurman, Sudan's second-largest city, just across the River Nile from Khartoum. Are you in the area?

Flat shoe 'abuse' for amputee mayor,"Councillor Laura Booth said she received abuse on Facebook about the flat lace-up shoes A mayor who has a prosthetic leg has reacted to social media ""hate speak"" about her choice of footwear which she believes could discourage disabled people from entering public life. Stockport mayor Laura Booth, whose left leg was amputated below the knee as a child, said she was mocked on Facebook for wearing flat shoes to an event. She said one comment read: ""Look at the state of her"". Ms Booth said her footwear did not diminish her ability to do her job. The councillor, who also has chronic pain and back problems, wore pink leather lace-up shoes to a ceremony at a bakery in Reddish on Monday. She said she wanted to walk to the event and stand up, rather than use her wheelchair. Ms Booth explained: ""People commented on the bakery's photo; 'A mayor in trainers, disapproving face', 'Look at the state of her'. 'Get back to your caravan'. ""They make these judgements and can get really nasty."" Ms Booth, who lost her leg after a car crash, said: ""I am prone to falling, I have a different gait so I need shoes with support. There is limited choice. ""It's these attitudes which will put people off entering public life if they have a health condition or disability,"" she said. ""Also a woman should be able to wear whatever shoes she wants irrespective of disability or not."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Labour member for Offerton said she wanted to highlight the ""hostile narrative"" which exists around disability and invited people to confront her in person. ""Bring it on.

Other people on Twitter showed their support by telling the councillor to ""wear what is comfortable"" and ""ignore"" any abuse. One commented ""only a woman would have her shoes scrutinised"".

Doctor Who writer axed over tweets,"Roberts' contribution to Doctor Who: The Target Storybook, has been removed Writer Gareth Roberts has been dropped from an upcoming Doctor Who anthology over ""offensive"" transphobic tweets, BBC Books has confirmed. Roberts,announcing his dismissal via Medium,external, said the publisher had ""immediately folded"" to pressure from the show's fandom and co-authors. Parent company Ebury confirmed that Roberts' contribution to Doctor Who: The Target Storybook, will not feature. The author said the tweets, from 2017, were made in ""cheerful vulgarity"". The writer said that, as a gay man, he has ""rejected restrictive cultural gender stereotypes for ""as long as I can remember"", but does not believe in gender identity. ""It is impossible for a person to change their biological sex. I don't believe anybody is born in the wrong body,"" he said. Roberts has previously written for the TV series, including episodes for David Tennant, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi. Gareth Roberts' tweets have stunned the transgender community and their allies. One of his more concerning posts refers to Paris Lees, Munroe Bergdorf, and Chelsea Manning, three of the world's most celebrated names in transgender rights, as ""trannies"". The word is now considered extremely derogatory. An LGBT activist told me that on initially reading about Gareth's dismissal they felt sorry for him, until they then dug through his previous tweets. Ebury's decision to drop Roberts over his tweets, which it says conflicts with its ""values as a publisher"", has sparked debate on social media. Toby Young, author and associate editor of The Spectator, criticised the ""shocking"" decision, calling it an ""affront to free speech"" by a ""publicly-owned company"". Allow Twitter content?

Susie Day, one of the co-authors of the anthology, protested about Roberts' inclusion, saying that ""being involved felt like a tacit endorsement of his views"". ""I raised my concerns, and said if he was in, I was out,"" she wrote. ""BBC Books made their decision. I'm grateful they took the opportunity to demonstrate that transphobic views have no place in the Whoniverse, both in and outside the stories.""

Amazon to deliver by drone 'with months',"Amazon executive Jeff Wilke said the drone had been engineered to minimise noise Amazon has said it will use drones to deliver packages to customers âwithin monthsâ. It unveiled its latest iteration at a conference in Las Vegas, touting the machine's ability to spot obstacles such as people, dogs, and clotheslines. Amazon executive Jeff Wilke said the drone would be able to travel 15 miles to carry packages weighing 5lbs (2.3kg) or less. Mr Wilke did not say where in the world the drone deliveries would initially take place, or precisely when. However, the US Federal Aviation Administration told the BBC it had granted Amazon a permit to operate the drone in the US. ""The FAA issued a Special Airworthiness Certificate to Amazon Prime Air allowing the company to operate its MK27 unmanned aircraft for research and development and crew training in authorized flight areas,"" the regulator said. ""Amazon Prime Air plans to use the aircraft to establish a package delivery operation in the United States. This certificate is valid for one year and is eligible for renewal."" The prototype drone has ""shrouds"" to act as protection from its propellers, which double up as wings In the past, Amazon has been accused of using the promise of drone delivery as a headline-grabber to push its publicity around its Prime membership service. But in December 2016, the company ran an apparently successful trial in Cambridge, UK. A package was delivered, by drone, in 13 minutes. On stage during the firmâs âRe:Marsâ conference - an event highlighting the firm's work in machine learning, robotics, automation and space - Amazon displayed the drone that will be used. It uses six rotors, and âseesâ whatâs around it using a combination of data from visual, thermal and ultrasonic sensors. Allow YouTube content?

The firm insisted that it had built a drone with multiple redundancies for avoiding objects, even if it lost its connectivity. ""Some drones are autonomous but not able to react to the unexpected, relying simply on communications systems for situational awareness,âMr Wilke said,external. ""If our droneâs flight environment changes, or the droneâs mission commands it to come into contact with an object that wasnât there previously - it will refuse to do so - it is independently safe.â The firm shared a video of a test flight, but its sound was covered by music. One aspect that might affect societal acceptance could be noise, said Carolina Milanesi, from Creative Strategies. âI'm sure that it will be a concern, although it might not be that different from the noise from a delivery truck arriving at your home. âThe only difference is that the drone might be closer to a person's home if it's landing in the garden."" Mr Wilke said the droneâs design had ""been optimized to minimize intrusive, high-frequency soundsâ. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

New Brexit deal by October 'misleading',"This video can not be played Rory Stewart: Candidates need to show ""realism"" Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart says his competitors' claims they could negotiate a new Brexit deal before 31 October are ""misleading"". Some candidates say they can agree a plan by the deadline set by the EU, but Mr Stewart said there was ""not a hope"". Boris Johnson has warned the Tories face ""potential extinction"" if the UK doesn't leave by then. Rival Jeremy Hunt said a revised deal could be done by then under a leader with ""the right negotiating skills"". The former foreign secretary told a leadership hustings on Tuesdaythe party would ""not be forgiven"" if it failed, and said he was the candidate best placed to beat Labour and ""put Nigel Farage back in his box"". The comments came as the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) of Tory MPs called on leadership contenders to abandon Mrs May's Brexit deal and step up preparations for a no-deal exit in October. Where do the hopefuls stand on Brexit? Tories agree leadership contest rule changes Second Tory leadership candidate pulls out International Development Secretary Mr Stewart told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett that anyone promising to renegotiate by October was effectively committing to leaving without a deal because it was impossible. Meanwhile, in other Tory leadership developments: In a campaign video,,externalForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says he believes that with him at the helm and ""the right negotiating skills"", the UK can get a revised deal with Brussels ""even before the end of October."" He also pledged to turn the UK economy into the ""greenest in Europe"". Andrea Leadsomtold the Telegraph,externalthat as PM she would host a monthly phone-in with members of the public. In astatement to Bloomberg,external, Rory Stewart pledged to increase spending on schools, the police and research Sam Gyimah said the new PM should get a ""final chance"" to renegotiate the Brexit deal before it is put to a referendum. Esther McVey told LBC radio that only those who ""believe in Brexit"" would serve in her cabinet until the UK leaves the EU. The EU has consistently said it is not willing to re-open the current withdrawal agreement negotiated between the bloc and Mrs May, despite it being voted down by MPs three times. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might? BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Mr Stewart and Mr Johnson are two of 11 candidates running to become the next leader of the Conservative Party, and the next UK prime minister. On Tuesday, two pulled out of the leadership race as the partytightened the rules for the contestamid concerns about the size of the field. Candidates will now need the support of eight MPs to take part in the race, and to secure of 5% of the vote in the first round, and 10% of the vote in the second round, to progress. Charles Walker, the acting joint-chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said it was ""not unreasonable for someone seeking to be leader of the party and prime minister to be able to muster"" that level of support. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he expected the Parliamentary side of the leadership contest - where MPs narrow the field down to two final candidates - to take no more than two weeks. The winner will then be chosen by the wider membership of the Conservative Party. Mr Johnson suggested the solution to the current deadlock would be to replace the Irish backstop - the controversial insurance policy designed to maintain an open border - with ""alternative arrangements"". The EU, though, has said the backstop is a key part of the withdrawal agreement, which it is not willing to reconsider or subject to a time limit. Mr Johnson, who has insisted the UK must leave by the end of October with or without a deal, said a no-deal exit would cause ""some disruption"". But he warned that demands for a further referendum would grow if the country was forced to seek another extension from the EU. Mr Stewart said ""politicians need to stop pretending they are going to get a new deal from Brussels"". ""Anyone who knows anything about Europe can assure you there is not the slightest hope of getting a new deal through Europe by 31 October. Not a hope. ""There is a lack of realism."" Earlier, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt would not be drawn on whether she planned to enter the leadership race, but she claimed that nobody wanted a no-deal Brexit, and the EU ""understand they have to move on some things"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Brexiteer said: ""I stayed in cabinet and fought to try and get a deal and to try and build a consensus, both in my party and but also in Parliament. ""What we have learnt though is if you are trying to get that objective, you can't take no deal off the table."" Fellow Leave-backer and Tory MP Steve Baker told BBC's Politics Live he had not decided whether to run, but said the party needed someone ""very direct [and] with a clear plan"" for Brexit. He has published his own plan for leaving the EU, ""A Clean Managed Brexit,external"", calling for a future partnership ""based not on the close mandatory alignment and single customs territory which the draft agreement was designed to facilitate, but one centred on a mutually-beneficial advanced free trade agreement"". Mr Baker added: ""No one voted to ask permission to leave. We voted to leave with the hope of negotiating mutually-beneficial cooperation as an independent country. We continue to hope to do so.""

What were the D-Day landings?,"D-Day veterans Bernard Morgan (left), 100, and Jack Mortimer, 100, travelled to Normandy for the 2024 commemorations World leaders including King Charles and US President Joe Biden joined D-Day veterans to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June. The King, Queen and Prince of Wales joined veterans in Portsmouth on Wednesday to mark the anniversary. LIVE: Veterans and world leaders commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings Troops from the UK, the US, Canada, and France attacked German forces on the coast of northern France, on 6 June 1944. D-Day was the largest military seaborne operation ever attempted, and marked the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. It involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of troops on five separate beaches in Normandy. More than a year in the planning, D-Day was originally set to start on 5 June, judged to be the most likely date to combine calm seas, a full moon and low water at first light. However, storms meantit was delayed by 24 hours to 6 June. The ""D"" simply stands for ""day"". D-Day is a military term for the first day of an operation D-Day veterans tell their stories In pictures: Events commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day Watch: D-Day 80: We Were There 10 things you might not know about the day Airborne troops were dropped behind enemy lines in the early hours, while thousands of ships gathered off the Normandy coast for the main seaborne attack. Though they were expecting an invasion, German military leaders believed the initial attacks were only a diversionary tactic. A deception plan in the weeks ahead of the attack had led them to expect the main invasion further along the coast. The surprise element helped British troops establish a foothold on a beach codenamed Gold. In addition, Canadian forces established themselves on another beach - Juno - and the British got on to Sword beach. American soldiers also managed to land on the westernmost beach - Utah - without major casualties. But at nearby Omaha beach, the US force suffered serious losses. The naval barrage and bombing raids on the German defences were ineffective and the Americans encountered a crack division of German troops. Shortly after midnight, three US and British airborne divisions, more than 23,000 men, took off to secure the flanks of the beaches. Myriad naval vessels and landing craft gathered at a location in the Channel dubbed ""Piccadilly Circus"". From 06:30, the first five assault divisions were delivered to their beaches under cover of a naval bombardment. Throughout the day troops landed on the beaches. By midnight, the Allies had secured their beachheads and pushed further inland from Gold, Juno, Sword and Utah. The weathermen who helped save D-Day Up to 7,000 ships and landing craft were involved, delivering a total of 156,000 men and 10,000 vehicles to the five beaches along the carefully selected stretch of the Normandy coast. The landings would not have been possible without the support of massive air and naval forces, which were much stronger than those of the Germans. But on D-Day alone, as many as 4,400 troops died from the combined allied forces. Some 9,000 were wounded or missing. Total German casualties on the day are not known, but are estimated as being between 4,000 and 9,000 men. Thousands of French civilians also perished, mainly as a result of bombing raids carried out by allied forces. âI often wonder why I lived while others diedâ 'I survived, then sipped my first champagne' Although they had got a foothold in France by the end of D-Day, allied forces were for a while at risk of being pushed back into the sea. They had to keep building up their forces faster than the Germans could reinforce theirs. Progress through the narrow lanes and staunchly defended towns of Normandy was slow. But now outnumbering their enemy and supported by their air superiority, they were able to overcome the considerable resistance - though at a heavy price. By the time they liberated Paris, in late August 1944, about 10% of the two million allied troops who had by then reached France were dead, wounded or missing. It is not clear how many D-Day veterans are still alive. All are now in their 90s or 100s. It is thought there are just over 100 surviving British veterans. The BBC's Royal Correspondent Sean Coughlan says23 were taking part in the commemorations in Normandy, and a further 21 attended a memorial eventat the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Two dozen US veterans were also expected to make the trip to France, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission, which oversees US cemeteries and monuments abroad.

Trump says 'climate change goes both ways',"Mr Trump said he was moved by Prince Charles' passion, but the conversation did not change his views President Donald Trump has said he believes climate change ""goes both ways"" following a 90-minute discussion with environmentalist Prince Charles. ""I believe that there's a change in weather and I think it changes both ways,"" Mr Trump told Piers Morgan in an interview that aired on Wednesday. Mr Trump said he shared the prince's desire for a ""good climate"" but blamed other nations for increasing pollution. He has rolled back many US climate laws despite warnings from his own agencies. Mr Trump said his meeting with Prince Charles was meant to last only 15 minutes. ""He did most of the talking, and he was really into climate change and I think that's great,"" Mr Trump said of Prince Charles on the ITV programme Good Morning Britain. ""He wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good climate as opposed to a disaster and I agree."" But Mr Trump once again placed the blame on other countries, namely China, India and Russia, for worsening air and water quality while claiming the US has one of ""the cleanest climates there are"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world ""Don't forget, it used to be called global warming, that wasn't working, then it was called climate change, now it's actually called extreme weather because with extreme weather you can't miss,"" the president said. Mr Trump pointed to past examples of weather disasters to refute the idea that ""extreme weather"" is becoming more common due to climate change. ""I don't remember tornados in the United States to this extent but then when you look back 40 years ago we had the worst tornado binge we ever had. In the 1890s we had our worst hurricanes."" The president said he was moved by Prince Charles' ""passion for future generations"" but stopped short of changing any of his views on climate science. The Prince of Wales hasadvocated for environmental issues for decades. Trump's environmental rollback rolls on 'Trump effect' limits action on climate Trump dismisses US climate change report Mr Trump has accused climate scientists of having a ""political agenda"" and called climate change a ""hoax"", though he later retracted that statement. In 2017, he pulled the US out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, saying the international deal to keep global temperatures rises below 2C was disadvantageous to US workers. Mr Trump has continued to ignore warnings from his own government agencies, dismissing a 2018 report warning of devastating economic consequences from climate change, saying he did not believe it. His administration has rolled back dozens of environmental and climate protections and proposed ending rules on oil drilling and coal plants. This video can not be played Climate change explained in 90 seconds The world is now about 1C warmer than it was during ""pre-industrial times"", according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Top scientists and agencies across the world have warned that this rapid, human emissions-induced warming could have serious implications for the stability of the planet's climate. For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts - but that number has changed to below 1.5C in recent years. Meanwhile, former vice-president and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden revealed his own climate plan on Tuesday. Mr Biden's $1.7tn (Â£1.3tn) ""clean energy revolution"" aims to create green jobs nationwide while addressing climate and energy concerns. Under the plan, the US would have a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 - the same goal as the Obama administration - and would strive for a ""100% clean energy economy"" where polluters would ""bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting"". There would be ""aggressive"" limits on pollution from oil and gas, protections for federal lands and biodiversity, and investments of $400bn over 10 years in climate science. Allegations of plagiarism immediately followed the release of Mr Biden's plan, after conservative news site The Daily Caller found several instances where the campaign directly copied language from other groups. His campaign corrected the passages, and said in a statement that several citations ""were inadvertently left out"" and had been added back in. Mr Biden's 2020 Democratic rival Elizabeth Warren also unveiled her climate plans on Tuesday. The Massachusetts senator's plan would invest $2tn in environmental technology, research, jobs and see the creation of a National Institute of Clean Energy.

Sir Philip Green's rescue deal in balance,"Topshop is considered the jewel in Arcadia's crown A crucial meeting to rescue Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group has been adjourned for a week after landlords initially rejected his plan. Landlords of the troubled group's stores, which include Topshop and Miss Selfridge, were due to vote on a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). The deal would have meant the closure of 48 stores and the loss of around 1000 jobs. The vote was postponed ""to conduct further dialogue with a few landlords"". Can Sir Philip Green save his retail empire? Philip Green wins key vote for rescue plan ahead of meeting Philip Green: what's gone wrong at his Topshop empire? Because of the complex structure of Arcadia, creditors had to agree on seven separate CVAs, most of them relating to the company's properties. Some of the seven CVAs are understood by the BBC to have been rejected by landlords. The company says that all seven have to pass for the company to escape administration. Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia, said: ""It is in the interests of all stakeholders that we adjourn today's meetings to continue our discussions with landlords. ""We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support."" One creditor, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), had said it would vote for the scheme after Lady Cristina Green, Sir Philip's wife and Arcadia's largest shareholder, agreed to make a Â£100m contribution to the pension fund. It was always going to be tight - many landlords had privately said they would resist a restructuring which would see them bearing much of the burden of the massive cost-cutting exercise necessary to ensure the group's survival. In the end it turned out that just enough of them rejected the new terms to call the whole overhaul into question. If they can't be talked round, then it is possible, even probable that Sir Philip Green's once-mighty retail empire could collapse into administration. This is a very important call for landlords to make - they are risking having many properties left empty. Other struggling retailers, such as Debenhams and House of Fraser, have managed to convince landlords to take swingeing cuts to their income to keep limping on. But industry insiders warned that property owners were looking for a moment to draw a line in the flood of retail restructurings that have seen property owners become the most heavily punished of a company's creditors. It will come as a big disappointment to Sir Philip, who on Tuesday night was celebrating that he had secured the backing of pension authorities for his plans. It is not over yet. It's possible the holdout landlords could yet agree to improved terms, but right now, the future of the company and its 18,000 employees remains very uncertain. Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green The CVA proposed the loss of about 520 jobs across 23 Arcadia stores -  Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Topshop, Topman, Outfit, Wallis and Evans. Arcadia has more than 560 shops across the UK and Ireland and employs 22,000 staff. However, if the CVA is completed, Arcadia says it will close down two subsidiary property companies, meaning that another 25 stores, most of them branches of Miss Selfridge, will shut. The company estimates around 500 more jobs would be lost, so in total, more than 1,000 jobs would go. Arcadia says it has been paying too much on rent for many of its high-profile stores. Its CVA demanded rent cuts on 194 stores, as well as the 23 closures. The group has already shut 200 of its UK stores over the past three years. Retail analysts say it has been losing out to contemporary ""fast-fashion"" retailers, ranging from High Street chains, such as Zara and H&M, to pure online players such as Asos. Chloe Collins, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Most of its brands such as Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge have lost relevance in today's retail landscape due to their uninspiring fashion ranges and weak multichannel offer. ""Even Topshop, which used to be Arcadia's star player, has lost appeal.""

Closure fears for Bridgend Ford plant,"This video can not be played ""South Wales is going to be like a ghost town"" Ford's engine plant in Bridgend is set to close in autumn 2020, with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Union officials were told of the plans at a meeting with Ford bosses which include the offer of redeployment. Workers were sent home after receiving a letter which said they will lose their jobs in phases by 25 September next year. Ford blamed ""changing customer demand and cost"" for the closure plans and denied Brexit was a factor. In a statement, Ford of Europe president Stuart Rowley said creating a sustainable business required the company to make ""difficult decisions"", including the need to make its engine manufacturing base suitable for the vehicles it produces in the future. ""We are committed to the UK. However, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead."" Later, he said the decision was nothing to do with Brexit although he realised the company's plans would be ""very significant for the employees, their families and the community in south Wales"". As it happened: Bridgend reacts to Ford closure plans Political reaction: 'Workers deserve better' Bridgend 'hanging on by its fingernails' Mr Rowley has confirmed the company will repay Â£11m in incentives offered by the Welsh Government. Economy minister Ken Skates said he was ""absolutely livid"" at Ford's decision to ""turn their back on Bridgend"". ""We pumped a huge amount of money into this facility and we expected more from Ford."" He toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Walesthat he was working with the chemicals company Ineos and others ""who would like to come to this area"". He added the site is ""a priority"" for any inward investment. This video can not be played The story of Ford in Bridgend Workers at the plant said they were devastated. ""I'm expecting to lose my job,"" said Tony Phillips, who has been at the plant for 31 years, adding that they were ""good, well-paid jobs"". Fellow worker Mark Lendrum said: ""South Wales is going to be like a ghost town."" Leader of Bridgend council Huw David, said there is ""not a family in Bridgend that won't be affected by this"" and it is a ""fabulous workforce"" from Newport to Llanelli. ""We don't know how we are going to recover from this. ""Both governments want to keep the jobs here. We as the council will help people to find other work,"" he said. Graham Rees is one of the 1,700 workers at the Bridgend plant Graham Rees has worked at Ford in Bridgend for 35 years. ""You see work come and go, when an engine dies off, there's a replacement, but this time, what do you do? ""It doesn't matter what you're building, if people don't want to buy it, it's at the end at its life, full stop,"" he said. ""You get a feeling that yes, the end is nigh, but nobody wants to admit that, so you prepare yourself and get on with it. ""There is no light at the end of the tunnel, you've just got to face the truth."" The closure news comes just months after Ford said it wascutting its Welsh workforce by 1,000, with 370 going in a first phase. Investment in a new petrol engine, called Dragon, was scaled back, while production of an engine for Jaguar Land Rover is due to end this year. Ford Bridgend loses out in global race Electric cars hope for Bridgend Just days ago, it was revealed thatcar sales in the UK had fallen again. GMB regional organiser Jeff Beck said: ""We're hugely shocked by today's announcement. It's a real hammer blow for the Welsh economy and the community in Bridgend."" He said the union would continue to work with Ford, other unions and the Welsh Government ""to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news"". Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said Ford had treated its UK workers ""abysmally"". ""The fact remains that it is cheaper, easier and quicker to sack our workers than those in our competitor countries,"" he said, vowing to ""resist this closure with all our might"". Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which became the next generation Ford Escort. It was to be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The promise had been for 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. There were 22,000 people applying for the roles. Concerns about the plant's long term futurewere raised more than a decade ago when the decision was taken to no longer have Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. The mark III Ford Escort - which was nearly called the Ford Erika after its development name Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he knew it was an ""extremely worrying and uncertain time for Ford workers, their families in Bridgend and the surrounding communities"". ""The UK government will work closely with Ford, the trade unions and the Welsh Government, to make sure this highly-valued workforce can move into new skilled employment."" Earlier, Mr Cairns told BBC Wales he had been in touch with Ken Skates about exploring the production of electric vehicles as a means of protecting jobs in the Bridgend area. Mr Cairns said the UK government and Welsh Government ""have already been working on potential investors"" but ""clearly there is a lot more work"". He added that ""the Brexit issue doesn't stand up"" in being a part of Ford's decision. But Bridgend Labour MP Madeleine Moon said she believed it was ""very clearly about Brexit"". ""The knock-on effect to the south Wales economy is huge - there are 12,000 associated jobs. ""The map has just been rubbed out,"" she said. This video can not be played Bridgend MP Madeleine Moon said she was ""very emotional"" over the closure plan Mr Skates said the Welsh Government would provide a ""rapid response taskforce to support workers"". Since 1978 about Â£140m in taxpayers' money has been invested in the plant, Mr Skates said. That had been ""money well spent"" since the plant had ""pumped back"" Â£3bn into the Bridgend economy over the last 10 years alone, Mr Skates said. ""What we have repeatedly said to Ford over recent months and years is that Wales stands ready, it is perfectly situated and positioned to help businesses."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the news was ""incredibly sad"", and pledged the Welsh Government would do ""everything in its power"" to support those affected and to ""work with all partners to explore options for the future of the plant"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said closure would be ""one of the most bitter blows"" to the Welsh economy for more than 30 years.

This is down to acombination of different reasons. The car industry troubles have been blamed in part, ""because the trade future is uncertain with Brexit,"" according to consultant Anna-Marie Baisden. But the head of autos research for Fitch Solutions added there had also been a ""shift away from what is being made at the moment, in terms of diesel cars"". What's behind the car industry crisis? BMW and JLR  join forces on electric cars Fiat Chrysler withdraws bid for Renault Karel Williams, an automotive expert from Manchester Business School said the plant closure is ""collateral damage"" from other ""larger developments"" such as the push towards electric engines. He also said it highlighted the limits of the Welsh Government's ""inward investment strategy"". It's the Brexit equivalent of a Rorschach test - you can interpret the inkblot or decision in different ways. Those who want to see us stay in the EU see Brexit as a factor in Ford Bridgend's closure, whilst Brexiteers point the finger of blame at the wider pressures bearing down on the automotive industry - from a shift to electric cars to falling demand from China. Ford announced back in December that it was restructuring its operations right across Europe. As part of that change, a plant in Bordeaux in France is to be closed and thousands of jobs cut in Germany. Brexit, obviously, was not a factor in those decisions. Given that context, here in Wales and the UK, the additional issue of Brexit and the ongoing uncertainty over what kind of economic relationship we'll have with EU's single market doesn't help matters. Nissan, when it announced its decision to move production from Sunderland to Japan, said Brexit uncertainty is not helping them ""plan for the future"" whilst Honda said that its plant closure in Swindon wasn't related to our departure from the EU. As it happened: Ford Bridgend to close Ford workers 'deserve better' than closure BMW and JLR join forces on electric cars Brexit shutdown cuts car output by 45% New 4x4 contract 'won't secure Ford jobs' 1,000 Bridgend Ford job cuts outlined Ford Bridgend loses out in global race Ford UK 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Sports Direct makes Game takeover bid,"Mike Ashley's retail empire Sports Direct is making its latest High Street expansion move with a Â£51.9m bid for Game Digital. Sports Direct said it will offer 30p a share for Game Digital under the cash bid, which was triggered after it upped its stake in the chain to 38.5%. But Sports Direct warned there may be job losses if the bid succeeds. It would potentially close some sites, or merge them with other Sports Direct-owned stores, after a review. This is the latest expansion attempt by Sports Direct,after it failed to take over Debenhams. Sports Direct has already snapped up a number of struggling companies, including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles. He also recently bought online furniture firm Sofa. Mr Ashley's empire was already Game's largest investor and has been a shareholder in the specialist games retailer since July 2017. Sports Direct said it did not believe that, as a standalone business, Game was ""able to weather the pressures that it is facing"". ""Sports Direct believes that the offer, in providing Game with the wider benefit of Sports Direct's operating and other experience and increased support, will secure Game's future and allow it to navigate these pressures,"" it said. It added the 30p-a-share bid was final and represents a 27% premium to Game's closing price on Tuesday of 23.55p. Sports Direct was required to make a mandatory offer for Game under UK takeover rules after taking its stake above 30%. Game has been battling tough High Street conditions, while sales of hardware and consoles have been hit by competition. It saw sales drop 4.7% to Â£492.9m in its first half, despite a boost to some categories from popular games like Fortnite. But cost-cutting and higher margin sales helped interim pre-tax profits jump 20.3% to Â£14.8m.

YouTube says anti-gay slurs don't break its rules,"Journalist Carlos Maza regularly faces abuse online YouTube is one of many companies that has given its logo a rainbow-themed makeover to show support for LGBT rights - but, underneath the colourful veneer, a row has erupted over how the video-sharing site enforces its own hate-speech policies. At the centre of the dispute is journalist Carlos Maza, who presents a popular series called Strikethrough for the news site Vox. He says he has faced persistent abuse from rival video-maker Steven Crowder, who has more than 3.8 million subscribers on YouTube. Whenever Maza publishes a video for Vox, Crowder will post his own ""debunking"" video, peppered with insulting language attacking Maza's sexual orientation and ethnicity. So, last week, Maza posted a video compilation of the abuse. In the clips, Crowder imitates Maza's accent and calls him, among other things, a ""lispy queer"", a ""gay Vox sprite"" and  a ""gay Mexican"". Maza asked YouTube to step in. Video-maker Steven Crowder hosts a popular show on YouTube ""These videos get millions of views on YouTube. Every time one gets posted, I wake up to a wall of homophobic/racist abuse on Instagram and Twitter,"" he said in a tweet. ""These videos make me a target of ridiculous harassment."" YouTube said it would investigate. It conducted an ""in-depth review"" and on Tuesday it came back with an answer. ""While we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don't violate our policies,"" it said in a statement. However, after receiving further criticism, YouTube announced on Wednesday that it would demonetise Crowder's channel due to ""continued egregious actions."" This means he will no longer make money from advertising  revenues on his videos. But Maza said this was still not enough, pointing out that most political content is already demonetised and that Crowder would still be able to sell merchandise via his channel. YouTube attempted to clarify its decision stating that Crowder would need to remove links to his t-shirts in order to reinstate monetisation of his channel. It then reaffirmed that Crowder ""would need to address all the issues with his channel"" for monetisation to be reinstated, adding it was ""sorry for the confusion."" YouTube's response has been met with a mixed reaction. Many people want to frame the dispute as a battle over free speech. Crowder himself claimed the row was not about abuse but ""an example of a giant corporate media entity [Vox] trying to silence voices they do not like"". He said the language he used to mock Maza was ""friendly ribbing"". ""It's funny and this is a comedy show. 'Lispy queer' is harmless and I enjoy saying it,"" he said in a video. But others have said if YouTube itself accepted the videos were ""hurtful"", it was failing to enforce its own policies. Its rules prohibit content that: is deliberately posted in order to humiliate someone makes hurtful and negative personal comments about another person But YouTube said Crowder's comments did not violate the policies because they were sandwiched between ""debate"". In notes provided by Google andpublished by news site Gizmodo,external, the company said: ""We take into consideration whether criticism is focused primarily on debating the opinions expressed or is solely malicious."" YouTube's social media pages are currently decorated with rainbow-themed graphics, in support of LGBT rights. But Maza said the video-sharing site was ""exploiting"" LGBT people. ""It's going to get so much worse now. YouTube has publicly stated that racist and homophobic abuse doesn't violate their anti-bullying policies,"" he said. by Ben Hunte, LGBT correspondent Many professional LGBT video-makers will be familiar with uploading material online and instantly being tormented by certain audiences, solely because of their sexuality. YouTube's take on this will disappoint the LGBT community. It will surprise them that hurtful things considered hate speech and punishable by law in real life can simply be labelled ""debate"" online, and not require any repercussions. With LGBT Pride Month just kicking off, it will be interesting to see how many other organisations will adopt rainbows across their brands, without necessarily backing the queer communities they are desperately marketing themselves to. Unrelated to Mr Maza's dispute with Mr Crowder,YouTube published a blog,externalon Wednesday saying it had updated its hate speech policy. The changes include: explicitly banning videos alleging that one group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities such as age, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation an explicit ban on videos that ""glorify Nazi ideology"" removing content that ""denies well-documented events"" such as the Holocaust and Sandy Hook school shooting stopping channels that ""repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies"" from earning advertising revenue 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Trump rows back on NHS trade remarks,"Donald Trump has rowed back on his remarks that the NHS should form part of a future trade deal between the UK and US. The comment, made during his state visit to the UK, prompted a backlash from Conservative leadership candidates, Labour and trade unions. But on Wednesday, the US president told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""I don't see it being on the table."" He added that the NHS was something he would ""not consider part of trade"". Current rules allow foreign firms to bid for NHS contracts and a subsidiary of the US company United Health is among private groups which have already successfully done so. Some, though, fear the health service is vulnerable to creeping privatisation or a weakening of the tight control the NHS currently keeps on drug prices if US firms get greater access. Trump praises 'extraordinary' US-UK alliance Donald Trump and what comes next At a press conference in London on Tuesday, Mr Trump was asked whether he believed the NHS should be part of a trade deal between the UK and US after Brexit. He told reporters: ""When you're dealing with trade everything is on the table, so the NHS or anything else, or a lot more than that. ""But everything will be on the table, absolutely."" This video can not be played ""Everything is on the table"" in future UK-US trade negotiations, President Trump says The comments led to fierce criticism from a number of MPs, including from Health Secretary and leadership hopeful Matt Hancock. He had already condemned similar comments from the US Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson, and tweeted: ""Dear Mr President. The NHS isn't on the table in trade talks - and never will be. Not on my watch."" Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""The NHS is not for sale to any country and never would be if I was prime minister."" And International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said he would not be ""offering up"" the NHS in any trade deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who spoke at a protest rally against President Trump moments before the president's press conference, also tweeted: ""Our NHS is not up for sale"". In his GMB interview, the president appeared to backtrack But standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the NHS ""is not and will not be up for sale"". This video can not be played Rebecca Long Bailey and David Lidington on any NHS role in a future US trade deal David Henig, former trade negotiator for the UK government - and now UK director of the European Centre For International Political Economy - said Mr Trump was ""right the first time"" and ""everything is potentially up for grabs in a trade agreement"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be up to the government to decide which NHS services could be provided by private suppliers and which would be served by the public sector. But, if an element was opened up to private tenders, ""the US and other countries would want access"". Mr Henig said the biggest issue between the countries over healthcare was the price of drugs, as the NHS pays significantly less to pharmaceutical companies than the US. He said: ""We should be specific on what we are prepared to give and what we want to seek in trade agreements. So far, we have been pretty vague. ""We should be publishing, as soon as possible, a consultation document saying, 'this is what we are prepared to talk about in regards to the NHS, this is what we are not prepared to talk about in terms of trade', so everybody is entirely clear."" About 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym says the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But, he adds, if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the demands of a trade deal in the future.

Trump in first Irish trip as US president,"This video can not be played Donald Trump talks Brexit on arrival in Ireland The issue of the Irish border after Brexit will ""not be a problem at all,"" Donald Trump has claimed on his first visit to Ireland as US President. He arrived at Shannon Airport at about 16:45 local time and held a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar. He told Mr Varadkar that Americans ""love the Irish"" and said he believed things would work out well with ""with your wall, your border"" after Brexit. Mr Trump then travelled to Doonbeg to stay at his golf resort. Hebought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in County Clare in 2014. Why does Trump matter to Ireland? Welcome to 'Trump town' Mr Varadkar welcomed Mr Trump to Ireland and said it was the sixth time that a serving American president has visited the state. Mr Trump described Mr Varadkar as his friend and said the relationship between Ireland and the US was ""as good as it's ever been, maybe better"". The Trumps arrived on Air Force One in Ireland at about 16:45 local time The president added that there were ""millions"" of Irish people in the US and said: ""I think I know most of them because they're my friends. ""We love the Irish, so it's an honour to be here."" This video can not be played Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? Mr Trump, who just completed a three-day state visit to the UK, said he would discuss Brexit, the military and trade during his meeting with Mr Varadkar. ""Probably you'll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very much involved with Brexit as you know, and I think it will all work out very well,"" Mr Trump said. ""And also for you, with your wall, your border. We have a border situation in the United States and you have one over here, but I hear it's going to work out very well."" The taoiseach pointed out the Irish government wanted to avoid ""a border or wall"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Donald and Melania Trump signed the visitors book at Shannon Airport Mr Trump replied: ""I think you do, I think you do.  The way it works now is good, you want to try and keep it that way."" The president added that Ireland was in ""great shape"" and that once a new UK prime minister was installed in Downing Street, he hoped a Brexit deal or resolution could be negotiated with the EU. He also said he hoped the US and Irish government would agree on access to E3 working visas for Irish citizens to the US. The two leaders then went to meet in private. In a solo press conference after the meeting, Mr Varadkar was asked about Mr Trump's description of the Irish border as a ""wall"" and whether or not the president understood how much the Irish government wanted to avoid a hard border after Brexit. ""He's the president of America and there are nearly 200 countries in the world, so I don't think it's possible for him to have an in-depth understanding of issues in every single country, which is why this engagement is important,"" Mr Varadkar replied.

The taoiseach also said: ""He is in favour of Brexit as you know, and we're not, but he understands that a major issue is the border between north and south and he shares our objective to keep the border open as it is now, respecting the Good Friday Agreement."" Mr Varadkar also said the pair discussed the Republic of Ireland's low rate of corporation tax and agreed on the need for governments to work together to ensure large companies pay their ""fair share"" of tax. The taoiseach said he pointed out that the economic relationship between Ireland and America has ""changed"" and was now ""very much a two-way relationship"". As in the UK there were people protesting the arrival of the US president ""Ireland is in the top 10 when it comes to investors into the United States and also there are nearly 100,000 Americans working for Irish-owned firms in the United States, so it was another opportunity to point out that the economic relationship is now very much mutually beneficial,"" Mr Varadkar said. President Trump was originally due to visit the Republic of Ireland last year, but the trip was postponed for scheduling reasons. There is likely to be interest in what he has to say about maintaining the US-Ireland relationship. Outside Shannon Airport people gathered, both in support of the President and to protest at his visit. Supporters of Donald Trump outside Shannon Airport on Wednesday A protest took place in Belfast on Tuesday evening against the president's visit. Donald Trump bought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in 2014 President Trump will depart Shannon on Thursday morning to go to France for further commemorations. He will hold a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron before returning to his Doonbeg resort. Senior Irish officials have been invited by the US delegation to Mr Trump's golf club, including the Irish government's special envoy to the US, John Deasy, and Ireland's ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall. Mr Trump is expected to play golf on Friday before flying back to the US. In Pictures: Trump's first day in Ireland Doonbeg's warm welcome for Trump.

Stockpicker: 'I'm extremely sorry',"One of the UK's best known stockpickers has said he is ""extremely sorry"" after suspending trading in his largest fund. Neil Woodford stopped money going in or out of his Woodford Equity Income Fund on Monday after increasing numbers of investors asked for their money back. The move was ""necessary to protect investors' interests"", he said. A stockpicker - or fund manager - analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. Investors had withdrawn about Â£560m from the fund over the past four weeks. Kent County Council had wanted to withdraw its Â£263m investment, but was unable to do so before trading halted. Paul Carter, leader of Kent County Council, told the BBC: ""The money invested in Woodford represents about 4% of our total pot of Â£6.5bn of money invested. Hopefully we will get our money out with no reduction. But that remains to be seen."" What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Mr Woodford said: ""As difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt this was necessary to protect your interests,"" he said. He said that due to the rising number of investors withdrawing funds, the stock market was ""in a way anticipating the fact that we would have to be sellers of stocks to meet those redemptions."" Therefore, the prices the firm could get for those stocks ""would be disadvantageous for our investors"". ""I'm extremely sorry that we've had to take this decision, we will keep our investors informed. We will use this time to reposition the fund."" He said the fund needed time to reduce its exposure to illiquid and unquoted shares ""to zero"". Illiquid stocks can't be easily sold quickly, and investors may make a loss on them, while unquoted shares are those in private, non-listed, companies. The decision to suspend the fund was agreed with the fund's administrator, Link, a spokesman said. The suspension of Mr Woodford's Equity Income fund continued to hit shares in fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown, which included the fund in its flagship list of share recommendations, Wealth 50. Hargreaves removed the fund from its recommendation list on Monday, but investors have not responded positively. Shares in the company have slumped 5.5%, leaving it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 for the second day running. Stephen Clapham of analysts Behind the Balance Sheet said Mr Woodford had ""had a very poor performance in the fund"" and so people had been asking for their money back. ""This has been an accelerating thing, it's like a snowball going downhill, and I guess he's just got to the point where his fund has shrunk in size, and the illiquid - and particularly the unquoted part of the fund - has increased as a percentage of the total asset, so he's just had to do something."" Mr Clapham added he would be ""very surprised"" if most people who had invested in the fund knew there was a risk that at some point they would not have been able to take their money out. ""It's actually not that uncommon,"" he said, adding that after the Brexit referendum some property funds had taken similar action. Mr Woodfordmade the apology in a video published on Youtube,external. He added he would be ""doing more to answer any further questions over the coming days and weeks."" Mr Woodford started his own fund five years ago, with its headquarters in Oxford. In its first year, it gave investors a return of 18% on their money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, after the figures were released he warned: ""It's far too early to conclude that the fund's strategy has worked."" Before that, the 59-year-old had worked as part of the UK equities team at investment managers Invesco Perpetual for more than 26 years. He was appointed a CBE for services to the economy in 2013.

Trump joins Queen to commemorate D-Day,"World leaders, including US President Donald Trump, have joined the Queen in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Theresa May is hosting 15 world leaders to honour the largest combined land, air and naval operation in history. Figures from every country that fought alongside the UK are attending. Coming to the end of a three-day state visit to the UK, Mr Trump said he was looking forward to marking what ""may have been the greatest battle ever"". The countries represented at the event have agreed to make a joint statement pledging to ensure the ""unimaginable horror"" of World War Two is not repeated. Latest updates: Trump and Queen at D-Day event What were the D-Day landings? 10 things you might not know about D-Day Called ""the D-Day proclamation"", the 16 signatories - including the UK and the US - will commit to working together to ""resolve international tensions peacefully"". The UK prime minister will use the occasion to call for continued Western unity in tackling what she will call ""new and evolving security threats"". On Thursday, memorial services are planned to mark the 75 years since the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 - the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe.

She added: ""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. ""But the wartime generation, my generation, is resilient."" Members of the armed forces and more than 300 veterans, who are all over 90 years old, also attended the event in Portsmouth - one of the key embarkation points on D-Day. Hundreds of other veterans are in northern France to mark the occasion. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attended the D-Day event after boycotting a state banquet held for the Trumps on Monday Tory leadership rivals Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt share a joke Thousands of members of the public watched the event on big screens on Southsea Common, separated from the VIPs and veterans by a large security fence. A designated protest area was set up in Guildhall Square, more than a mile (1.6km) from the Southsea Common events. Civic leaders were worried protests near the main event could upset veterans. Members of the public sat on Southsea Common to watch the event On D-Day, Jim Booth, now 97, climbed into a fold-up canoe and shone a beacon out to sea to guide allied craft safely to shore D-Day veteran: 'I looked at the wounded and I cried' 'I survived D-Day - then had my first champagne' The event included a flypast of the Red Arrows. A reception with veterans will be followed by world leaders meeting to discuss the western alliance and security. Later in the afternoon veterans Harry Read, 95, and John Hutton, 94, will parachute into Normandy in honour of their lost comrades. The last time the UK hosted this many world leaders outside a formal summit was the 2012 Olympics.  156,000allied troops landed in Normandy, across 5beaches 7,000ships and landing craft involved and 10,000 vehicles 4,400from the combined allied forces died on the day 4,000 - 9,000German casualties Thousandsof French civilians also died The commemorations to mark the Allied invasion of northern France come a day after Mr Trump had aseries of political meetings as part of his three-day state visitto the UK. The president used a TV interview to play downhis earlier suggestion that the NHS would be included in post-Brexit trade talks between the US and the UK. French President Emmanuel Macron met veterans after taking to the stage to read a letter from an executed French Resistance fighter The memories of a Royal Navy electrician R G Watts, as he left Southampton to Normandy in June 1944, were read to the crowd During a joint news conference with the UK prime minister, Mr Trump had said ""everything is on the table"" in future discussions between the countries. But Mr Trump told Piers Morgan in an interview for ITV's Good Morning Britain that he did not ""see it being on the table"". ""I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Some 60,000 members of the public are expected to turn out Other things Mr Trump said in the ITV interview were: People who fought on D-Day paid the ""ultimate debt"". ""That may have been the greatest battle ever in history,"" he said. ""Being at that site [Portsmouth] will be very interesting"" He would have ""no problem"" with meeting Jeremy Corbyn another time after earlier revealing he had turned down a request to meet the Labour leader He had a long conversation with Prince Charles about climate change - referred to as ""extreme weather"" by Mr Trump - and was impressed with the prince's ""passion"" for future generations He clarified that he had called the Duchess of Sussex's comments about him ""nasty"",rather than calling her nasty His mother ""would have been very proud"" to see him meet the Queen ""There's always a chance"" he might take military action in Iran, but he does not want to. ""I'd much rather talk [to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani]"" On having the nuclear codes - ""I think it's a terrible responsibility but it's a responsibility I'm prepared to handle"" On his ban on transgender people serving in the army - ""It is what it is,"" he said. ""They take massive amounts of drugs, they have to... You would have to break rules and regulations in order to have that"" Mr Trump was given a Winston Churchill-style hat as a present. He said he hoped he had ""similarities"" with the wartime prime minister, pictured right Tuesday sawprotesters gathered in central Londonand other cities - including Glasgow, Edinburgh and Sheffield - to voice their opposition to President Trump's visit. Mr Corbyn - who boycotted Monday evening's state dinner - was joined at the London rally by members of other political parties, including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. For any prime minister, handling a president like Donald Trump is like trying to hold on to a Ming vase walking across a recently polished, slippery parquet floor. He's a leader who glories in the unpredictable, who seems to wake up every morning wondering what controversy he can provoke, what headlines he can create. His reason for being is therefore from the start in contrast with the stiff choreography of a state visit. But No 10 will be relieved that the formalities with the PM were free of mishap. And, as Theresa May readies herself for the exit, Donald Trump, who has definitely embarrassed her in the past, didn't repeat that habit. Read more from Laura's blog In a Tweet posted on Wednesday,external, Mr Trump said the ""massive"" rallies he had been told to expect were ""flops"". ""The big crowds, which the Corrupt Media hates to show, were those that gathered in support of the USA and me,"" he added. A protest against the state visit started in Trafalgar Square He also said he ""could not have been treated more warmly"" by people in the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Queen praises D-Day 'courage and sacrifice',"This video can not be played The Queen recalls words from her father, King George VI The Queen has paid tribute to the ""heroism, courage and sacrifice"" of those who died in the D-Day landings. She was joined by 16 world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of history's largest combined land, air and naval operation. Mr Trump, who was on the last day of his UK state visit, said D-Day ""may have been the greatest battle ever"". Veterans of the landings in Normandy to liberate western Europe also attended. The commemorations included: A flypast by the Red Arrows RAF aerobatic team and historic aircraft Parachute jumps by D-Day veterans Readings by world leaders from the diaries and letters of people who fought and died in the war An hour-long production telling the story of the invasion A joint statement by 16 countries pledging to avoid a repeat of the ""unimaginable horrors"" of the conflict The Queen said the veterans of D-Day demonstrated ""more than courage and endurance"", showing ""unconquerable resolve"". The quotes came from a broadcast by her father, King George VI, made at the time of the massive operation that signalled the end of Nazi power in Western Europe. What were the D-Day landings? 10 things you might not know about D-Day D-Day veteran: 'I looked at the wounded and I cried' Watch: D-Day landings commemorated ""The fate of the world depended on their success,"" she said. ""Many of them would never return, and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten."" She thanked them ""with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country, indeed the whole free world"". This video can not be played D-Day veteran: 'I didn't want to let my friends down'. Later in the afternoon, veterans Harry Read, 95, and John Hutton, 94, parachuted back into Normandy, 75 years after their first landing. However this time, they jumped in tandem with members of the Army's Parachute Regiment display team, the Red Devils. They were greeted with cheers and applause as they landed in the French fields. Mr Hutton told the BBC before the jump: ""My main objective is to pay my respects to people on the ground who never came back."" Mr Read added: ""[On D-Day] there was an almighty fireworks display taking place just ahead of us - and we were going straight into it. ""It was an horrendous inferno to go in to."" At 18:40BST around 300 veterans on board the cruise ship MV Boudicca waved and cheered as she left harbour in Portsmouth bound for Normandy. They were followed by a flotilla of Royal Navy vessels. Other ships in the harbour sounded their horns as a mark of respect as the Boudicca left. The countries represented at the event have agreed to make a joint statement pledging to ensure the ""unimaginable horror"" of the war is not repeated. Called ""the D-Day proclamation"", the 16 signatories - including the UK and the US - will commit to working together to ""resolve international tensions peacefully"". On Thursday, further memorial services are planned to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 - the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. Veterans went on stage to be honoured by the audience Mrs May, Prince Charles, the Queen and Mr Trump stood for the UK national anthem The Queen told the crowd she was ""delighted"" to be able to thank veterans for their service. She added: ""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. In pictures: Day three of Trump's UK state visit 'I survived D-Day - then had my first champagne' The weathermen who helped save D-Day ""But the wartime generation, my generation, is resilient."" Members of the armed forces and more than 300 veterans, who are all over 90 years old, attended the event in Portsmouth - one of the key embarkation points on D-Day. It was when the Queen rose to her feet, not once but twice, that it became clear just who were the honoured guests at this commemoration. Not the presidents or the prime ministers, not the military brass nor the servicemen and women who made the ceremony snap and sing. The Queen said that when she attended the 60th anniversary of D-Day some thought it might be the last such event. But, she said, the wartime generation - my generation, she emphasised - is resilient. All true. But the men who stepped forward to bathe in the applause of the audience today are looking ever more frail. And one by one they are leaving us. And so the Queen stood, twice - to honour them for the nation, and to thank them, from her heart. Sgt John Jenkins, who is 99 and served with the Pioneer Corps in the Normandy landings, said: ""I was terrified, I think everyone was. ""You never forget your comrades because we were all in it together. It is right that the courage and sacrifice of so many is being honoured 75 years on. We must never forget."" Hundreds of other veterans are in northern France to mark the occasion there. The event marks Mrs May's last official engagement as prime minister The RAF's Red Arrows were part of a flypast, which also included historical aircraft Leaders from every country that fought alongside the UK on D-Day joined the Queen and the Prince of Wales for the commemorations on Southsea Common. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Also attending were German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as leaders from Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland and Slovakia.  156,000allied troops landed in Normandy, across 5beaches 7,000ships and landing craft involved and 10,000 vehicles 4,400from the combined allied forces died on the day 4,000 - 9,000German casualties Thousandsof French civilians also died The commemoration featured an hour-long production telling the story of the invasion, with testimony from veterans, theatrical performances and music. Veterans saluted the crowd, and actress Sheridan Smith performed a Dame Vera Lynn song. Mr Trump read the same prayer given by President Roosevelt in a radio message ahead of the D-Day landings, while the last letter of a young resistance fighter, executed aged 16, was read out by President Macron. Mrs May read a letter from Captain Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, to his wife Gladys on June 3 1944. It was in his pocket as he landed on Sword Beach, but he was killed the following day. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attended the D-Day event after boycotting a state banquet held for the Trumps on Monday Tory leadership rivals Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt share a joke Thousands of members of the public, separated from the VIPs and veterans by a large security fence, watched the events live on big screens on Southsea Common.

Trump heads to Ireland next,"This video can not be played Donald Trump talks Brexit on arrival in Ireland The issue of the Irish border after Brexit will ""not be a problem at all,"" Donald Trump has claimed on his first visit to Ireland as US President. He arrived at Shannon Airport at about 16:45 local time and held a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar. He told Mr Varadkar that Americans ""love the Irish"" and said he believed things would work out well with ""with your wall, your border"" after Brexit. Mr Trump then travelled to Doonbeg to stay at his golf resort. Hebought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in County Clare in 2014. Why does Trump matter to Ireland? Welcome to 'Trump town' Mr Varadkar welcomed Mr Trump to Ireland and said it was the sixth time that a serving American president has visited the state. Mr Trump described Mr Varadkar as his friend and said the relationship between Ireland and the US was ""as good as it's ever been, maybe better"". The Trumps arrived on Air Force One in Ireland at about 16:45 local time The president added that there were ""millions"" of Irish people in the US and said: ""I think I know most of them because they're my friends. ""We love the Irish, so it's an honour to be here."" This video can not be played Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? Mr Trump, who just completed a three-day state visit to the UK, said he would discuss Brexit, the military and trade during his meeting with Mr Varadkar. ""Probably you'll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very much involved with Brexit as you know, and I think it will all work out very well,"" Mr Trump said. ""And also for you, with your wall, your border. We have a border situation in the United States and you have one over here, but I hear it's going to work out very well."" The taoiseach pointed out the Irish government wanted to avoid ""a border or wall"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Donald and Melania Trump signed the visitors book at Shannon Airport Mr Trump replied: ""I think you do, I think you do.  The way it works now is good, you want to try and keep it that way."" The president added that Ireland was in ""great shape"" and that once a new UK prime minister was installed in Downing Street, he hoped a Brexit deal or resolution could be negotiated with the EU. He also said he hoped the US and Irish government would agree on access to E3 working visas for Irish citizens to the US. The two leaders then went to meet in private. In a solo press conference after the meeting, Mr Varadkar was asked about Mr Trump's description of the Irish border as a ""wall"" and whether or not the president understood how much the Irish government wanted to avoid a hard border after Brexit. ""He's the president of America and there are nearly 200 countries in the world, so I don't think it's possible for him to have an in-depth understanding of issues in every single country, which is why this engagement is important,"" Mr Varadkar replied.

The taoiseach also said: ""He is in favour of Brexit as you know, and we're not, but he understands that a major issue is the border between north and south and he shares our objective to keep the border open as it is now, respecting the Good Friday Agreement."" Mr Varadkar also said the pair discussed the Republic of Ireland's low rate of corporation tax and agreed on the need for governments to work together to ensure large companies pay their ""fair share"" of tax. The taoiseach said he pointed out that the economic relationship between Ireland and America has ""changed"" and was now ""very much a two-way relationship"". As in the UK there were people protesting the arrival of the US president ""Ireland is in the top 10 when it comes to investors into the United States and also there are nearly 100,000 Americans working for Irish-owned firms in the United States, so it was another opportunity to point out that the economic relationship is now very much mutually beneficial,"" Mr Varadkar said. President Trump was originally due to visit the Republic of Ireland last year, but the trip was postponed for scheduling reasons. There is likely to be interest in what he has to say about maintaining the US-Ireland relationship. Outside Shannon Airport people gathered, both in support of the President and to protest at his visit. Supporters of Donald Trump outside Shannon Airport on Wednesday A protest took place in Belfast on Tuesday evening against the president's visit. Donald Trump bought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in 2014 President Trump will depart Shannon on Thursday morning to go to France for further commemorations. He will hold a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron before returning to his Doonbeg resort. Senior Irish officials have been invited by the US delegation to Mr Trump's golf club, including the Irish government's special envoy to the US, John Deasy, and Ireland's ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall.

Top stockpicker: 'I'm extremely sorry',"One of the UK's best known stockpickers has said he is ""extremely sorry"" after suspending trading in his largest fund. Neil Woodford stopped money going in or out of his Woodford Equity Income Fund on Monday after increasing numbers of investors asked for their money back. The move was ""necessary to protect investors' interests"", he said. A stockpicker - or fund manager - analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. Investors had withdrawn about Â£560m from the fund over the past four weeks. Kent County Council had wanted to withdraw its Â£263m investment, but was unable to do so before trading halted. Paul Carter, leader of Kent County Council, told the BBC: ""The money invested in Woodford represents about 4% of our total pot of Â£6.5bn of money invested. Hopefully we will get our money out with no reduction. But that remains to be seen."" What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Mr Woodford said: ""As difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt this was necessary to protect your interests,"" he said. He said that due to the rising number of investors withdrawing funds, the stock market was ""in a way anticipating the fact that we would have to be sellers of stocks to meet those redemptions."" Therefore, the prices the firm could get for those stocks ""would be disadvantageous for our investors"". ""I'm extremely sorry that we've had to take this decision, we will keep our investors informed. We will use this time to reposition the fund."" He said the fund needed time to reduce its exposure to illiquid and unquoted shares ""to zero"". Illiquid stocks can't be easily sold quickly, and investors may make a loss on them, while unquoted shares are those in private, non-listed, companies. The decision to suspend the fund was agreed with the fund's administrator, Link, a spokesman said. The suspension of Mr Woodford's Equity Income fund continued to hit shares in fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown, which included the fund in its flagship list of share recommendations, Wealth 50. Hargreaves removed the fund from its recommendation list on Monday, but investors have not responded positively. Shares in the company have slumped 5.5%, leaving it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 for the second day running. Stephen Clapham of analysts Behind the Balance Sheet said Mr Woodford had ""had a very poor performance in the fund"" and so people had been asking for their money back. ""This has been an accelerating thing, it's like a snowball going downhill, and I guess he's just got to the point where his fund has shrunk in size, and the illiquid - and particularly the unquoted part of the fund - has increased as a percentage of the total asset, so he's just had to do something."" Mr Clapham added he would be ""very surprised"" if most people who had invested in the fund knew there was a risk that at some point they would not have been able to take their money out. ""It's actually not that uncommon,"" he said, adding that after the Brexit referendum some property funds had taken similar action. Mr Woodfordmade the apology in a video published on Youtube,external. He added he would be ""doing more to answer any further questions over the coming days and weeks."" Mr Woodford started his own fund five years ago, with its headquarters in Oxford. In its first year, it gave investors a return of 18% on their money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, after the figures were released he warned: ""It's far too early to conclude that the fund's strategy has worked."" Before that, the 59-year-old had worked as part of the UK equities team at investment managers Invesco Perpetual for more than 26 years. He was appointed a CBE for services to the economy in 2013.

Johnson warns Tories of Brexit 'extinction',"The Conservatives face ""potential extinction"" if they do not get Brexit done, Boris Johnson has warned. The former foreign secretary told a leadership hustings the party will ""not be forgiven"" if it does not take the UK out of the EU by 31 October as planned. He said he was best placed to beat Labour and ""put Nigel Farage back in his box"" but reportedly ruled out a snap general election if he becomes PM. Mr Johnson is one of 11 candidates vying to succeed Theresa May as leader. His comments came as the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) called on leadership contenders to abandon Mrs May's Brexit deal. A paper published by the influential ERG said the next prime minister should sign up to the 31 October deadline and step up preparations for a no-deal exit on World Trade Organisation terms. On Tuesday, two candidates pulled out of the leadership race as the partytightened the rules for the contestamid concerns about the size of the field. Candidates will now need the support of eight MPs to take part in the race, and secure of 5% of the vote in the first round, and 10% of the vote in the second round, to progress. Charles Walker, the acting joint-chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said it was ""not unreasonable for someone seeking to be leader of the party and prime minister to be able to muster"" that level of support. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he expected the Parliamentary side of the leadership contest - where MPs narrow the field down to two final candidates - to take no more than two weeks. The winner will then be chosen by the wider membership of the Conservative Party. Tories agree leadership contest rule changes Second Tory leadership candidate pulls out Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn Mr Johnson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and ex-Commons leader Andrea Leadsom addressed the One Nation Conservative Caucus of Tory MPs in Parliament at the first hustings of the campaign. The group, which opposes a no-deal Brexit, has invited all the candidates to appear before them to make their case for the top job. Mr Johnson, regarded as the frontrunner in the contest, said the party was facing an ""existential crisis"" following its drubbing in last month's European elections. ""We will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on October 31,"" he said. ""We need to realise the depth of the problems we face. Unless we get on and do this thing, we will be punished for a very long time. There is a very real choice between getting Brexit done and the potential extinction of this great party."" His warning was echoed by fellow leadership hopeful Ms Leadsom, who said a delay to the UK's exit from the EU could ""spell the end"" for the party. Mr Johnson suggested the solution to the current deadlock would be to replace the Irish backstop - the controversial insurance policy designed to maintain an open border - with ""alternative arrangements"" so as to facilitate a ""managed exit"" from the EU. The EU has said the backstop must remain in the withdrawal agreement and has resisted calls from Tories and the DUP for a time limit, or exit date, to be put on it. The Tory leadership hustings hosted by the One Nation Caucus of Conservative MPs began with reporters, me included, starting to loiter outside. Between us and the action inside, there were two heavy wooden doors and a pretty thick wall - and some parliamentary security staff not particularly keen on us leaning too obviously against either the doors or the wall. A rather forthright conversation then began between us lot in the press pack and Conservative Party officials about why we weren't allowed in - given those in the room were discussing who should be our prime minister by the end of next month. Read more from Chris here Mr Johnson, who has insisted the UK must leave by the end of October with or without a deal, said a no-deal exit would cause ""some disruption"". But he warned that demands for another referendum on the UK's future in Europe would grow if the UK was forced to seek another extension from the EU.

Trump declines to meet Corbyn,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted ""a dialogue"" with the president about building ""a better and more peaceful"" world Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn,who boycotted Monday's banquetheld in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan,whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"". But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world. Latest on Trump state visit UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"". Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove. He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK. Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"".

Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition. ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said. ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. This video can not be played President Trump gives his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements. ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change. ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"". But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else."" This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. Allow Twitter content?

And Dominic Raab, who is also standing,tweeted that,externalthe NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"". The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations. Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?"" Nigel Farage met Donald Trump after the president's press conference with Theresa May Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family. ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say.""

Johnson warns Tories of Brexit 'extinction'Leadership contender Boris Johnson says his party won't be forgiven if Brexit is delayed again.UK Politics,"The Conservatives face ""potential extinction"" if they do not get Brexit done, Boris Johnson has warned. The former foreign secretary told a leadership hustings the party will ""not be forgiven"" if it does not take the UK out of the EU by 31 October as planned. He said he was best placed to beat Labour and ""put Nigel Farage back in his box"" but reportedly ruled out a snap general election if he becomes PM. Mr Johnson is one of 11 candidates vying to succeed Theresa May as leader. His comments came as the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) called on leadership contenders to abandon Mrs May's Brexit deal. A paper published by the influential ERG said the next prime minister should sign up to the 31 October deadline and step up preparations for a no-deal exit on World Trade Organisation terms. On Tuesday, two candidates pulled out of the leadership race as the partytightened the rules for the contestamid concerns about the size of the field. Candidates will now need the support of eight MPs to take part in the race, and secure of 5% of the vote in the first round, and 10% of the vote in the second round, to progress. Charles Walker, the acting joint-chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said it was ""not unreasonable for someone seeking to be leader of the party and prime minister to be able to muster"" that level of support. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he expected the Parliamentary side of the leadership contest - where MPs narrow the field down to two final candidates - to take no more than two weeks. The winner will then be chosen by the wider membership of the Conservative Party. Tories agree leadership contest rule changes Second Tory leadership candidate pulls out Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn Mr Johnson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and ex-Commons leader Andrea Leadsom addressed the One Nation Conservative Caucus of Tory MPs in Parliament at the first hustings of the campaign. The group, which opposes a no-deal Brexit, has invited all the candidates to appear before them to make their case for the top job. Mr Johnson, regarded as the frontrunner in the contest, said the party was facing an ""existential crisis"" following its drubbing in last month's European elections. ""We will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on October 31,"" he said. ""We need to realise the depth of the problems we face. Unless we get on and do this thing, we will be punished for a very long time. There is a very real choice between getting Brexit done and the potential extinction of this great party."" His warning was echoed by fellow leadership hopeful Ms Leadsom, who said a delay to the UK's exit from the EU could ""spell the end"" for the party. Mr Johnson suggested the solution to the current deadlock would be to replace the Irish backstop - the controversial insurance policy designed to maintain an open border - with ""alternative arrangements"" so as to facilitate a ""managed exit"" from the EU. The EU has said the backstop must remain in the withdrawal agreement and has resisted calls from Tories and the DUP for a time limit, or exit date, to be put on it. The Tory leadership hustings hosted by the One Nation Caucus of Conservative MPs began with reporters, me included, starting to loiter outside. Between us and the action inside, there were two heavy wooden doors and a pretty thick wall - and some parliamentary security staff not particularly keen on us leaning too obviously against either the doors or the wall. A rather forthright conversation then began between us lot in the press pack and Conservative Party officials about why we weren't allowed in - given those in the room were discussing who should be our prime minister by the end of next month. Read more from Chris here Mr Johnson, who has insisted the UK must leave by the end of October with or without a deal, said a no-deal exit would cause ""some disruption"". But he warned that demands for another referendum on the UK's future in Europe would grow if the UK was forced to seek another extension from the EU. He insisted: ""I believe I am best placed to lift this party, beat Jeremy Corbyn and excite people about conservatism and conservative values."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid told the meeting that if his party ""don't look like change, voters will go for change in the form of (Jeremy) Corbyn"". He stressed that the party should not seek to emulate Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, insisting ""we will not beat the Brexit Party by becoming the Brexit Party"". In a reference to Benjamin Disraeli's ""one nation"" political philosophy, he added: ""One nation is a term that was coined by a prime minister who was a bit of an outsider.

Sudan crackdown death toll 'rises to 60'Members of a feared paramilitary group are reportedly involved in quelling pro-democracy protests.Africa,"Khartoum's barricaded streets are nearly deserted as security forces sweep the city Forty bodies have been pulled from the River Nile in the Sudanese capital Khartoum following a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests, opposition activists said on Wednesday. Doctors linked to the opposition said the bodies were among 100 people believed killed since security forces attacked a protest camp on Monday. Reports said a feared paramilitary group was attacking civilians. Sudan's ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) vowed to investigate. Residents in Khartoum told the BBC they were living in fear as members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) roamed the streets.

But a Sudanese alliance of protestors and opposition groups rejected the invitation. One of its leading members said the TMC could not be trusted. The deputy head of the TMC defended the violent suppression, claiming that the protesters had been infiltrated by rogue elements and drug dealers. ""We will not allow chaos, we will not allow chaos and we will not go back on our convictions. There is no way back.

Their representatives had been negotiating with the TMC and agreed a three-year transition that would culminate in elections. But on Monday, forces swept in and opened fire on unarmed protesters in the square. On Tuesday, Gen Burhan announced that negotiations with protesters were over, all previous agreements were cancelled, and elections would be held within nine months. Demonstrators had demanded a longer period to guarantee fair elections and to dismantle the political network associated with the former government.

But much of Khartoum is under lockdown. Witnesses said protesters had retreated to residential areas where they were building barricades and burning tyres. Sudan's military has faced international condemnation for its attack, but there were clear signs this was likely to happen. The country has been driven backwards by a military elite intent on holding on to power.

The military also enjoys another advantage. In an age of international division, the notion of an ""international community"" pressuring the regime is fantasy. Sudan's crisis has exposed the reality of international politics - that force can have its way, without consequence, if the killers and torturers represent a valuable asset to other powers.

US-Irish relations 'can't be overstated',"Leo Varadkar and Donald Trump met at the White House earlier this year The improbable election of Donald Trump in 2016, coming just months after the Brexit referendum, added another element of uncertainty into the Irish economy. Since taking office, he hasradically overhauled US tax rules, shaken the foundations of global trade byslapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China, and repeatedly expressed support for Brexit. Just this week, he advocated the UK leave the EU without a deal -and said Nigel Farage should be involved in the negotiations. The president lands in the Republic of Ireland later on Wednesday for a two day visit that will include a stop-over at his golf resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar. Given the hugely important economic ties between Ireland and the US, trade, jobs and Brexit are likely to dominate the agenda. The US accounts for nearly three quarters of the foreign investment into Ireland, experts say Big, big, big. The US is the single largest source of foreign direct investment in Ireland, with more than 700 American companies employing an estimated 160,000 people. ""The United States accounts for about 70% of the foreign investment into Ireland and it continues to be a very strong source market across a number of sectors,"" says Kevin Sammon, director of global communications at IDA Ireland, Ireland's state agency responsible for attracting inward investment. ""US businesses have been locating in Ireland for over 100 years and, judging by recent investment numbers, they continue to see Ireland as a reliable partner for them in Europe."" Some of those companies are among the world's largest, including technology giants like Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft, as well as a slew of drug companies such as Pfizer and healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson. Experts say they've been lured to Ireland by a combination of factors, including its well-educated, multi-cultural workforce, easy access to the EU market and, of course, the relatively low 12.5% corporate tax offering. This video can not be played Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? That's attracted the ire of President Trump. He has, on a number of occasions, name-checked Ireland as a destination of choice for US companies seeking a low-tax base. Ireland has also made headlines internationally for the aggressive tax planning of some of the companies that have made the country their home, and their use of tax loopholes. President Trump unveiled a sweeping tax reform plan in 2017 to encourage US companies to bring earnings back to the US. Last St Patrick's Day, he quipped thatthe Irish were ""sharp, they're smart, they're great"",external. ""And they're brutal enemies."" It's not all one-way, though. There are about 800 Irish companies active in the US market, employing 100,000 US citizens across the country, according to the American Chamber of Commerce. ""Ireland is now the ninth largest investor in the United States,"" says Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland. ""It's very much a two-way street. The US administration would have a strong focus in encouraging Irish companies to create more jobs in the States."" Yes and no. The US is alsoa significant location for Irish goods exports, pipped only by the EU as a whole,external. ""You cannot overstate the importance of the US-Irish relationship for the Irish economy,"" says Prof Ron Davies, head of economics at University College Dublin. ""The multinationals are a big part of it, and maybe they don't pay as much tax as some people think they should, but they still pay a significant amount in terms of tax."" The economic links: 700Number of US multinational companies in Republic of Ireland 160,000Number of people employed in those companies 70%US share of total foreign investment into RoI Since Ireland's recovery began following its crippling recession, its corporation tax take has dramatically surged. It increased by 26% last year to â¬10.4bn (Â£9.2bn), driven by higher and increased payments from manufacturing companies and big multinational firms. The share of corporation tax paid by the top 10 corporate taxpayers now accounts for 45% of all the tax paid. ""There is a special relationship there that has massive economic benefits,"" adds Prof Davies. But it also, arguably, leaves Ireland vulnerable to outside economic shocks. Changes in the global trade order for one - something which President Trump has set his eyes on. In March 2018, he saidtrade wars were good, tweeting that the US was ""losing billions of dollars on trade"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". During his election campaign, he spoke aggressively about trade, US agreements and even some of the country's trading partners. Since the late 1940s, the global trend has been towards reducing or eliminating barriers to trade and global commerce. Facebook is one of the US companies which has European headquarters in Ireland But Mr Trump is sceptical about that policy. Economists have warned that, given the open nature of Ireland's economy, that could spell trouble. ""What he's talking about doing to international trade norms, that is going to have a very swift, very direct impact on Ireland,"" says Prof Davies. ""He can't pick a trade war with Ireland because we're part of the EU, but do I think he can pick a trade war with the European Union? Sure, it seems to be his thing."" The Irish economy performed strongly once again in 2018, and the IDA says there has yet to be an impact on US investment flows into Ireland. But its chief executive, Martin Shanahan, has urged caution and says Ireland cannot be complacent. He said there had been a slowdown in decision-making from potential US investors. ""Ireland is a small open trading economy, and increased nationalism and protectionism is likely to have an impact on future FDI figures,""he said last year,external. Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, says there is huge expansion taking place in Ireland Prof Davies says the president's support for Brexit is a negative for Ireland. ""For me the biggest worrying aspect is his sticking his fingers in Brexit, encouraging Boris Johnson, saying Nigel Farage should have a place at the [negotiating] table, because as the UK goes, so does Ireland,"" he says. That could mean a greater risk of a hard Brexit, he says, arguing that would be ""extraordinarily bad news for Ireland"". But Mr Redmond says there are still ""very significant"" job announcements from US firms right across Ireland. ""Seven out of 10 of the leadership of US multinationals in Ireland say that Ireland is a better place to invest than it was three years ago. So there is huge ambition and huge expansion going on,"" he says. ""We've never seen the level of ambition in both directions in terms of business investment."" Is Trump right about Nato?

Topshop boss wins key vote for rescue plan,"Sir Philip Green has won the backing of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) for his plan to rescue Arcadia ahead of a crucial vote on Wednesday. The owner of Topshop has struck a Â£385m deal to secure its pension schemes, including a Â£100m contribution from Lady Cristina Green, Sir Philip's wife and Arcadia's largest shareholder. The PPF said it would now ""vote in support"" of Arcadia's restructure. But the plan, which includes closing 50 stores, needs the backing of landlords. They would have to agree to a rent cut on Arcadia's stores, which also include Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia facing crucial week Can Sir Philip Green save his retail empire? Sir Philip Green told to fund Arcadia's pension deficit The restructuring would be done through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In a deal with The Pensions Regulator, trustees of Arcadia's pension schemes will be granted security over Â£210m worth of assets by the company, up from a previous offer of Â£185m. Lady Green will inject Â£100m into the schemes over three years. And Arcadia will make Â£75m worth of contributions to the company's pension schemes. Oliver Morley, chief executive of the PPF, said: ""We are pleased that the company and shareholder have agreed a funding and security package for the scheme. Based on this commitment, we will now vote in support of the Arcadia Group Limited CVA tomorrow."" But he added: ""While we are the largest creditor in this CVA, other creditors will also need to agree the terms for it to be successful."" Lady Cristina Green is Arcadia's largest shareholder and Sir Philip's wife Arcadia's chief executive Ian Grabiner, said: ""We hope that the landlords and other creditors will follow suit and we can get the company back on a strong footing in all the markets where we trade."" Consumer expert Kate Hardcastle said the pension deficit has been ""one of the biggest pressures""on Arcadia. ""It might change a few minds absolutely,"" she said. ""But I'd still say the result of the CVA vote is not certain. This will alleviate a lot of concerns, however."" Arcadia currently has more than 560 shops across the UK and Ireland, and employs 22,000 staff. It has already shut 200 of its UK stores over the past three years amid intensifying competition from a crop of more contemporary ""fast fashion"" retailers ranging from High Street chains such as Zara and H&M to pure online players like Asos. Arcadia has also faced the same problems as other bricks and mortar retailers, including rising business rates and labour costs, too many unprofitable stores and inflexible leases that make it hard to close failing shops. By Colletta Smith, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Philip Green's retail empire dressed a generation. In my teenage years almost every Saturday was spent moving from one Arcadia store to another - from crowding into Miss Selfridge photo booths for pictures with friends to fawning over the Kate Moss collection in Topshop. But times have changed. The good old days? Kate Moss unveils her fashion collection for Topshop in 2007 Today's teenagers have grown up expecting to order clothes to their home and buy them on their phone. Boohoo, Misguided, and PrettyLittleThing have so many cheaper items available that they've hooked a younger generation who expect to wear an item once, post a picture on Instagram and then buy something else for the next Friday night. But Arcadia hasn't held onto those in their 30s who were loyal for years. The fact that Topshop haven't stocked above size 18 in their stores is alienating for women with changing body shapes. The campaign to boycott TopShop afterthe removal of a pop-up stand promoting a book on feminismdid the company no favours.Negative publicity about Sir Philip Greenhas done nothing to help a business so closely associated with him personally. For many in an age group increasingly conscious about the impact of their spending, the teenage crush on Topshop is over. Ms Hardcastle said even if the rescue deal is passed, Arcadia will still have a lot more work to do. ""There is a lot of fat within the Arcadia group and it faces a lot of challenges. It is hard to look at the business and say that anything will be the saviour of the organisation. ""It is a pretty wobbly table and people will look at how many legs it needs to prop it up.""

Neil Woodford: 'I'm extremely sorry',"One of the UK's best known stockpickers has said he is ""extremely sorry"" after suspending trading in his largest fund. Neil Woodford stopped money going in or out of his Woodford Equity Income Fund on Monday after increasing numbers of investors asked for their money back. The move was ""necessary to protect investors' interests"", he said. A stockpicker - or fund manager - analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. Investors had withdrawn about Â£560m from the fund over the past four weeks. Kent County Council had wanted to withdraw its Â£263m investment, but was unable to do so before trading halted. Paul Carter, leader of Kent County Council, told the BBC: ""The money invested in Woodford represents about 4% of our total pot of Â£6.5bn of money invested. Hopefully we will get our money out with no reduction. But that remains to be seen."" What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Mr Woodford said: ""As difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt this was necessary to protect your interests,"" he said. He said that due to the rising number of investors withdrawing funds, the stock market was ""in a way anticipating the fact that we would have to be sellers of stocks to meet those redemptions."" Therefore, the prices the firm could get for those stocks ""would be disadvantageous for our investors"". ""I'm extremely sorry that we've had to take this decision, we will keep our investors informed. We will use this time to reposition the fund."" He said the fund needed time to reduce its exposure to illiquid and unquoted shares ""to zero"". Illiquid stocks can't be easily sold quickly, and investors may make a loss on them, while unquoted shares are those in private, non-listed, companies. The decision to suspend the fund was agreed with the fund's administrator, Link, a spokesman said. The suspension of Mr Woodford's Equity Income fund continued to hit shares in fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown, which included the fund in its flagship list of share recommendations, Wealth 50. Hargreaves removed the fund from its recommendation list on Monday, but investors have not responded positively. Shares in the company have slumped 5.5%, leaving it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 for the second day running. Stephen Clapham of analysts Behind the Balance Sheet said Mr Woodford had ""had a very poor performance in the fund"" and so people had been asking for their money back. ""This has been an accelerating thing, it's like a snowball going downhill, and I guess he's just got to the point where his fund has shrunk in size, and the illiquid - and particularly the unquoted part of the fund - has increased as a percentage of the total asset, so he's just had to do something."" Mr Clapham added he would be ""very surprised"" if most people who had invested in the fund knew there was a risk that at some point they would not have been able to take their money out. ""It's actually not that uncommon,"" he said, adding that after the Brexit referendum some property funds had taken similar action. Mr Woodfordmade the apology in a video published on Youtube,external. He added he would be ""doing more to answer any further questions over the coming days and weeks."" Mr Woodford started his own fund five years ago, with its headquarters in Oxford. In its first year, it gave investors a return of 18% on their money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, after the figures were released he warned: ""It's far too early to conclude that the fund's strategy has worked."" Before that, the 59-year-old had worked as part of the UK equities team at investment managers Invesco Perpetual for more than 26 years. He was appointed a CBE for services to the economy in 2013.

"Sudan death toll 'rises to 60', opposition says","Khartoum's barricaded streets are nearly deserted as security forces sweep the city Forty bodies have been pulled from the River Nile in the Sudanese capital Khartoum following a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests, opposition activists said on Wednesday. Doctors linked to the opposition said the bodies were among 100 people believed killed since security forces attacked a protest camp on Monday. Reports said a feared paramilitary group was attacking civilians. Sudan's ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) vowed to investigate. Residents in Khartoum told the BBC they were living in fear as members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) roamed the streets. The paramilitary unit - formerly known as the Janjaweed militia - gained notoriety in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan in 2003. Sudan's crisis: What you need to know Sudan crisis: Return of the feared Janjaweed Africa Live: Updates from Khartoum and other stories ""Forty bodies of our noble martyrs were recovered from the river Nile yesterday,"" the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said in a Facebook post. An official from the group told the BBC that they had witnessed and verified the bodies in hospitals and that the death toll now stood at 100. A former security officerquoted by Channel 4's Sudanese journalist Yousra Elbagir,externalsaid that some of those thrown into the Nile had been beaten or shot to death and others hacked to death with machetes. ""It was a massacre,"" the unnamed source said. Security forces, seen here on Monday, moved against protesters after a long stand-off On Wednesday, the head of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC), General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, apologised for the loss of life and called for resumed negotiations - reversing a statement the previous day in which he said dialogue was over. But a Sudanese alliance of protestors and opposition groups rejected the invitation. One of its leading members said the TMC could not be trusted. The deputy head of the TMC defended the violent suppression, claiming that the protesters had been infiltrated by rogue elements and drug dealers. ""We will not allow chaos, we will not allow chaos and we will not go back on our convictions. There is no way back. We must impose the respect of the country by law,"" said Mohammed Hamadan - also known as Hemedti. Hemeti: The warlord who may control Sudan's future Demonstrators had been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, days before President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown after 30 years in power. Their representatives had been negotiating with the TMC and agreed a three-year transition that would culminate in elections. But on Monday, forces swept in and opened fire on unarmed protesters in the square. On Tuesday, Gen Burhan announced that negotiations with protesters were over, all previous agreements were cancelled, and elections would be held within nine months. Demonstrators had demanded a longer period to guarantee fair elections and to dismantle the political network associated with the former government. This video can not be played Sudan military attacks protesters International condemnation of the crackdown was swift and on Wednesday Gen Burhan made another televised speech in which he said the TMC was willing to resume negotiations. Protesters had called for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Fitr, marked on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, to be celebrated in the streets, as a gesture of defiance against the military. But much of Khartoum is under lockdown. Witnesses said protesters had retreated to residential areas where they were building barricades and burning tyres. Sudan's military has faced international condemnation for its attack, but there were clear signs this was likely to happen. The country has been driven backwards by a military elite intent on holding on to power. The TMC has scrapped agreements reached with the opposition Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), saying this will speed up the transition to democratic elections. That plan is likely a fiction. The military also enjoys another advantage. In an age of international division, the notion of an ""international community"" pressuring the regime is fantasy. Sudan's crisis has exposed the reality of international politics - that force can have its way, without consequence, if the killers and torturers represent a valuable asset to other powers. It is impossible to say whether the FFC can come back as a street-driven force. What will not change - in fact what has been deepened - is the alienation of people from their rulers.

""We have reached the point where we can't even step out of our homes because we are scared to be beaten or to be shot by the security forces,"" one Khartoum resident told the BBC. Another resident, who also asked not to be named, said he was pulled from his car by members of the Janjaweed and beaten on his head and back. Security forces, seen here on Monday, moved against protesters after a long stand-off A pharmacist who spoke to the BBC from Khartoum said RSF troops were shutting down hospitals to prevent civilians receiving treatment. ""They kicked us out from two hospitals that were giving aid to the injured and the victims of the gunshots,"" he said. ""It's an order from the military council to shut down those hospitals because we were giving aid for the citizens."" A woman, identified only as Sulaima, told the BBC that troops from the Rapid Support Forces were ""all over Khartoum"". ""They're surrounding neighbourhoods, they're threatening people. They're also using live ammunition. They're everywhere. We're not feeling safe and we don't have trust in the security forces. It's complete chaos."" Large numbers of heavily armed troops were also reported on the streets of Omdurman, Sudan's second-largest city, just across the River Nile from Khartoum.

'Cut child poverty in five easy steps',"Some 700,000 children in the UK could be lifted out of poverty in five easy steps costing Â£8.3bn, a charity says. TheChild Poverty Action Group,externalanalysed the impact of continuing benefit cuts to children in the UK, projecting the impact of these forward to 2023. Its report proposes a series of re-investments in universal credit and details their impact on child poverty and what it would cost to put in place. Chancellor Philip Hammond has dismissed claims vast numbers live in poverty. But in recent months, official figures have shown that nearly three million children are living in poverty. According to the CPAG analysis, the biggest impact on numbers of children freed from poverty - 300,000 - would be to: scrap the two-child limit for benefit payments axe the benefit cap The other three measures involve reversing the impact of the benefit freeze by: raising two separate child-related benefits to their real-terms value in 2015-16 increasing child benefit by Â£5 per child per week And a combination of these three would lift 400,000 further youngsters out of poverty, the charity's analysis says. The charity says the five changes would leave families with children better off by about Â£1,000 a year and cost the Treasury Â£8.3bn. Chief executive Alison Garnham said it was time for ""compassionate politicians"" to recommit to taking action to reduce the poverty of society's youngest. ""Children have borne the greatest burden of cuts to government spending with the four-year benefits freeze and punitive policies such as the two-child limit and benefit cuts - this is just not right,"" she said. ""If the government is serious that austerity is now over, it needs to demonstrate this is in a way that is felt immediately in families' pockets,"" she added. A government spokesman said tackling child poverty was a ""top priority"". ""There are 667,000 fewer children living in workless households than in 2010 and we're spending Â£95bn a year to support those families who need it most,"" he said. ""Low earning parents have benefited from the introduction of the National Living Wage, which gave the lowest earners their fastest pay rise in 20 years. ""We've also cut taxes for 32 million people - to help families meet the everyday cost of living.""

World Bank warns of weaker global growth,"Trade tensions between the US and China are weighing on global economic growth The global economy is weakening, according to a new assessment from the World Bank. The bank said it now expects growth of 2.6% for 2019 edging up to 2.7% the following year. The slowdown is widespread, according to the Bank's economists, affecting many countries. And there are risks to even this subdued outlook, including the uncertainty for business created by international trade tensions. One of the lead authors of the report, Franziska Ohnsorge, said the World Bank had warned in its previous forecasts six months ago of darkening skies. ""Then it was a forecast"" she told the BBC. ""But now we see it in the data."" US-China trade war in 300 words Why Californian wine will soon cost more in Beijing Is Vietnam the winner in US-China trade war? In January, the World Bank changed its outlook for 2019 from 3% growth to 2.9%. There has been a ""broad based disappointment"" affecting trade, investment and manufacturing and developed as well as emerging economies, Ms Ohnsorge said. Trade conflict has been an important factor behind the weaker growth, in particular the tension between the US and China. Between them, the two countries account for a third of global economic activity. Ms Ohnsorge said the uncertainty has an impact on investment by business It has been recurrent theme in the World Bank's analysis. China's growth is expected to continue to slow. In the three decades up to 2010 the annual average was 10%. The forecast for this year is 6.2% That partly reflects a deliberately encouraged slowdown which the Chinese government has sought to achieve, believing as most economists also do, that the earlier growth rate could not be sustained much longer. So far, it has been reasonably orderly and the ""hard landing"" that many feared has not materialised. But there is also an element of trade tension in the slower growth that China is expected to record this year. Global economic weakness has a key impact on the Bank's principal role: to promote economic development and the reduction of poverty. Africa's economy is growing but not enough to reduce poverty on the continent, said the World Bank David Malpass, who wasrecently named as president of the World Bank by Donald Trump, said ""Stronger economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards."" Figures for Africa are particularly troublesome in his respect. Although the bank is forecasting somewhat stronger growth there this year than last - at 2.9% - it is still not enough to significantly reduce poverty on the continent.

Trump praises 'extraordinary' US-UK alliance,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Unity of purpose will preserve deep-rooted ties"" with US US President Donald Trump has said the US and UK have the ""greatest alliance the world has ever known"". In a news conference with Theresa May, he promised a ""phenomenal"" trade deal after the UK leaves the European Union, but added that ""everything is on the table"" - including the NHS. Mrs May said the scope of trade talks had to be agreed by both countries. Mr Trump also said he turned down a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn, who addressed protesters in Westminster. The US president met Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage at the US ambassador's residence, Winfield House, on the second day of his three-day state visit to the UK.

Only days before shestands down as the Conservatives' leader, the prime minister set out clear positions she hoped may survive her premiership. On Iran, the UK and US agree on the threat but disagree on the solution, and the US must ""do everything to avoid escalation which is in no-one's interest"". On China, she said both sides cannot ignore the threat to their interests, but they must also recognise the country's ""economic significance"" - a clear warning against a lasting US trade war with Beijing. On the transatlantic relationship, she emphasised she and the president were only ""the latest guardians of this precious and profound friendship"". In other words, she is going and so one day will he, and the relationship will endure. Read more from our diplomatic correspondent Protesters gathered in central London and other cities - including Glasgow, Edinburgh and Sheffield - to voice their opposition to President Trump's visit. Mr Corbyn - who boycotted Monday evening's state dinner - was joined at the rally by members of other political parties, including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. Protesters against the presidential visit launched a Trump baby blimp on Parliament Square The Labour leader had proposed talks with Mr Trump, with a spokesman saying he was ready to engage with the US president on issues such as climate change, threats to peace and the refugee crisis - but these were refused. ""I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about the better and more peaceful world that we all want to live in,"" Mr Corbyn told the crowd of protesters.

Describing Mr Corbyn as a ""negative force"", Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that he would have ""no problem"" with meeting Mr Corbyn another time. By Marie Jackson, BBC News The whistling and whooping ramps up as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn takes to the stage in Whitehall. The rainy streets are now packed with cagoule-clad protesters holding aloft umbrellas and placards saying ""Dump Trump"". Some have their faces covered with #trumpstinks masks, others wear badges saying ""another nasty woman against Trump"". There are mums with small children in buggies who have given up a day in the park to make their young voices heard, alongside seasoned protesters and US expats. A little further up the street, police officers are dealing with a disturbance by the English Defence League. The rain's holding off for the moment but Mr Corbyn has a message for the visiting president. ""Think on, please, about a world that is aiming for peace and disarmament, that defeats racism and misogyny."" The crowd roars cheers of support. Read more. Mr Trump also suggested the NHS would be included in post-Brexit trade talks between the US and the UK. The US president said ""everything is on the table"" in future discussions between the countries, adding that a ""phenomenal"" trade deal would be reached. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock was among several Conservative leadership candidates who said they would not allow the NHS to become part of any trade talks. ""Not on my watch,""he tweeted,external. And later Mr Trump told GMB's Mr Morgan that he does not ""see it being on the table"". ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Mrs May said any trade agreement would follow talks about ""what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future"". After speaking of the US and UK's ""special relationship"", she also said the leaders had ""openly"" discussed their differences, such as on climate change, Iran and China. This video can not be played The US President promises a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK ""two or three times as big as now"" By Hugh Pym, BBC health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules, as long as they have a subsidiary in the EU. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender. A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal with the US mentioned today by Mr Trump. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. At the end of a day of meetings with the prime minister and a visit to the Churchill War Rooms, Mr Trump welcomed guests for a banquet at the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended on behalf of the Queen, along with the prime minister and some members of her cabinet. During his visit, the US president is expected to meet Tory leadership hopefuls Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. He had a phone conversation with Boris Johnson, another candidate. He also met former Cabinet ministers and Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson.

Trump to join Queen for D-Day anniversary,"World leaders, including US President Donald Trump, have joined the Queen in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Theresa May is hosting 15 world leaders to honour the largest combined land, air and naval operation in history. Figures from every country that fought alongside the UK are attending. Coming to the end of a three-day state visit to the UK, Mr Trump said he was looking forward to marking what ""may have been the greatest battle ever"". The countries represented at the event have agreed to make a joint statement pledging to ensure the ""unimaginable horror"" of World War Two is not repeated. Latest updates: Trump and Queen at D-Day event What were the D-Day landings? 10 things you might not know about D-Day Called ""the D-Day proclamation"", the 16 signatories - including the UK and the US - will commit to working together to ""resolve international tensions peacefully"". The UK prime minister will use the occasion to call for continued Western unity in tackling what she will call ""new and evolving security threats"". On Thursday, memorial services are planned to mark the 75 years since the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 - the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. Veterans went on stage to be honoured by the audience Mrs May, Prince Charles, the Queen and Mr Trump stood for the UK national anthem The Queen and the Prince of Wales attended the commemorations on Southsea Common, along with representatives from the countries that fought alongside the UK in the Battle of Normandy including French President Emmanuel Macron, US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Also attending were German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as leaders from Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland and Slovakia. In pictures: Day three of Trump's UK state visit The weathermen who helped save D-Day VIDEO: A Wren remembers Veterans saluted the crowd, actor Sheridan Smith performed a Dame Vera Lynn song, and Mr Trump read the same prayer read by President Roosevelt during a radio message ahead of the D-Day landings. The event marks Mrs May's last official engagement as prime minister The Queen told the crowd she was ""delighted"" to be at the event to thank veterans for their service. She added: ""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. ""But the wartime generation, my generation, is resilient."" Members of the armed forces and more than 300 veterans, who are all over 90 years old, also attended the event in Portsmouth - one of the key embarkation points on D-Day. Hundreds of other veterans are in northern France to mark the occasion. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attended the D-Day event after boycotting a state banquet held for the Trumps on Monday Tory leadership rivals Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt share a joke Thousands of members of the public watched the event on big screens on Southsea Common, separated from the VIPs and veterans by a large security fence. A designated protest area was set up in Guildhall Square, more than a mile (1.6km) from the Southsea Common events. Civic leaders were worried protests near the main event could upset veterans. Members of the public sat on Southsea Common to watch the event On D-Day, Jim Booth, now 97, climbed into a fold-up canoe and shone a beacon out to sea to guide allied craft safely to shore D-Day veteran: 'I looked at the wounded and I cried' 'I survived D-Day - then had my first champagne' The event included a flypast of the Red Arrows. A reception with veterans will be followed by world leaders meeting to discuss the western alliance and security. Later in the afternoon veterans Harry Read, 95, and John Hutton, 94, will parachute into Normandy in honour of their lost comrades. The last time the UK hosted this many world leaders outside a formal summit was the 2012 Olympics.  156,000allied troops landed in Normandy, across 5beaches 7,000ships and landing craft involved and 10,000 vehicles 4,400from the combined allied forces died on the day 4,000 - 9,000German casualties Thousandsof French civilians also died The commemorations to mark the Allied invasion of northern France come a day after Mr Trump had aseries of political meetings as part of his three-day state visitto the UK. The president used a TV interview to play downhis earlier suggestion that the NHS would be included in post-Brexit trade talks between the US and the UK. French President Emmanuel Macron met veterans after taking to the stage to read a letter from an executed French Resistance fighter The memories of a Royal Navy electrician R G Watts, as he left Southampton to Normandy in June 1944, were read to the crowd During a joint news conference with the UK prime minister, Mr Trump had said ""everything is on the table"" in future discussions between the countries. But Mr Trump told Piers Morgan in an interview for ITV's Good Morning Britain that he did not ""see it being on the table"". ""I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Some 60,000 members of the public are expected to turn out Other things Mr Trump said in the ITV interview were: People who fought on D-Day paid the ""ultimate debt"". ""That may have been the greatest battle ever in history,"" he said. ""Being at that site [Portsmouth] will be very interesting"" He would have ""no problem"" with meeting Jeremy Corbyn another time after earlier revealing he had turned down a request to meet the Labour leader He had a long conversation with Prince Charles about climate change - referred to as ""extreme weather"" by Mr Trump - and was impressed with the prince's ""passion"" for future generations He clarified that he had called the Duchess of Sussex's comments about him ""nasty"",rather than calling her nasty His mother ""would have been very proud"" to see him meet the Queen ""There's always a chance"" he might take military action in Iran, but he does not want to. ""I'd much rather talk [to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani]"" On having the nuclear codes - ""I think it's a terrible responsibility but it's a responsibility I'm prepared to handle"" On his ban on transgender people serving in the army - ""It is what it is,"" he said. ""They take massive amounts of drugs, they have to... You would have to break rules and regulations in order to have that"" Mr Trump was given a Winston Churchill-style hat as a present. He said he hoped he had ""similarities"" with the wartime prime minister, pictured right Tuesday sawprotesters gathered in central Londonand other cities - including Glasgow, Edinburgh and Sheffield - to voice their opposition to President Trump's visit. Mr Corbyn - who boycotted Monday evening's state dinner - was joined at the London rally by members of other political parties, including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. For any prime minister, handling a president like Donald Trump is like trying to hold on to a Ming vase walking across a recently polished, slippery parquet floor. He's a leader who glories in the unpredictable, who seems to wake up every morning wondering what controversy he can provoke, what headlines he can create. His reason for being is therefore from the start in contrast with the stiff choreography of a state visit. But No 10 will be relieved that the formalities with the PM were free of mishap. And, as Theresa May readies herself for the exit, Donald Trump, who has definitely embarrassed her in the past, didn't repeat that habit. Read more from Laura's blog In a Tweet posted on Wednesday,external, Mr Trump said the ""massive"" rallies he had been told to expect were ""flops"". ""The big crowds, which the Corrupt Media hates to show, were those that gathered in support of the USA and me,"" he added. A protest against the state visit started in Trafalgar Square He also said he ""could not have been treated more warmly"" by people in the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Trump's first Irish trip as presidentTrump declines to meet Corbyn,"This video can not be played Donald Trump talks Brexit on arrival in Ireland The issue of the Irish border after Brexit will ""not be a problem at all,"" Donald Trump has claimed on his first visit to Ireland as US President. He arrived at Shannon Airport at about 16:45 local time and held a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar. He told Mr Varadkar that Americans ""love the Irish"" and said he believed things would work out well with ""with your wall, your border"" after Brexit. Mr Trump then travelled to Doonbeg to stay at his golf resort. Hebought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in County Clare in 2014. Why does Trump matter to Ireland? Welcome to 'Trump town' Mr Varadkar welcomed Mr Trump to Ireland and said it was the sixth time that a serving American president has visited the state. Mr Trump described Mr Varadkar as his friend and said the relationship between Ireland and the US was ""as good as it's ever been, maybe better"". The Trumps arrived on Air Force One in Ireland at about 16:45 local time The president added that there were ""millions"" of Irish people in the US and said: ""I think I know most of them because they're my friends. ""We love the Irish, so it's an honour to be here."" This video can not be played Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? Mr Trump, who just completed a three-day state visit to the UK, said he would discuss Brexit, the military and trade during his meeting with Mr Varadkar. ""Probably you'll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very much involved with Brexit as you know, and I think it will all work out very well,"" Mr Trump said. ""And also for you, with your wall, your border. We have a border situation in the United States and you have one over here, but I hear it's going to work out very well."" The taoiseach pointed out the Irish government wanted to avoid ""a border or wall"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Donald and Melania Trump signed the visitors book at Shannon Airport Mr Trump replied: ""I think you do, I think you do.  The way it works now is good, you want to try and keep it that way."" The president added that Ireland was in ""great shape"" and that once a new UK prime minister was installed in Downing Street, he hoped a Brexit deal or resolution could be negotiated with the EU. He also said he hoped the US and Irish government would agree on access to E3 working visas for Irish citizens to the US. The two leaders then went to meet in private. In a solo press conference after the meeting, Mr Varadkar was asked about Mr Trump's description of the Irish border as a ""wall"" and whether or not the president understood how much the Irish government wanted to avoid a hard border after Brexit. ""He's the president of America and there are nearly 200 countries in the world, so I don't think it's possible for him to have an in-depth understanding of issues in every single country, which is why this engagement is important,"" Mr Varadkar replied.

The taoiseach also said: ""He is in favour of Brexit as you know, and we're not, but he understands that a major issue is the border between north and south and he shares our objective to keep the border open as it is now, respecting the Good Friday Agreement."" Mr Varadkar also said the pair discussed the Republic of Ireland's low rate of corporation tax and agreed on the need for governments to work together to ensure large companies pay their ""fair share"" of tax. The taoiseach said he pointed out that the economic relationship between Ireland and America has ""changed"" and was now ""very much a two-way relationship"". As in the UK there were people protesting the arrival of the US president ""Ireland is in the top 10 when it comes to investors into the United States and also there are nearly 100,000 Americans working for Irish-owned firms in the United States, so it was another opportunity to point out that the economic relationship is now very much mutually beneficial,"" Mr Varadkar said. President Trump was originally due to visit the Republic of Ireland last year, but the trip was postponed for scheduling reasons. There is likely to be interest in what he has to say about maintaining the US-Ireland relationship. Outside Shannon Airport people gathered, both in support of the President and to protest at his visit.

"Police 'unaware' London Bridge attacker reportedA relative reported Khuram Butt to an anti-terror hotline some 18 months before the attack, an inquest hears.","Khuram Butt was being investigated by MI5 from 2015 The team investigating one of the 2017 London Bridge attackers was not told he had been reported to an anti-terror hotline, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt's brother-in-law had reported his increasing radicalisation in September 2015. In the same month MI5 assessed Butt as wanting to stage a terror attack but lacking the ability to do so. Eight people were killed in the attack he carried out with two other men. They mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Chances 'galore' to stop London Bridge attack A senior counter-terrorism officer - identified only as Witness M - told an inquest at the Old Bailey in London that it was ""very unsatisfactory"" his team was not informed about the call. Usman Darr had contacted the hotline because he was concerned that his brother-in-law had been distributing anti-Western texts and links to jihadi sites and had become increasingly extreme in his views. The information was processed but never passed on to the joint MI5 and police investigation of Butt that had been under way since mid-2015. In the same month that he was reported by his brother-in-law, Butt was assessed by the security service as having a ""strong risk"" of staging a terror attack on his own, but there was no evidence he was planning one. In May 2017 MI5 lowered the assessed risk of Butt carrying out a lone terror attack to moderate, but increased his ability to do so to moderate. Police decided not to charge him with possession of extremist material because there was not a strong enough chance of disrupting any potential terror plot, Witness M said. The inquest also heard Butt had associated with members of the banned terrorist group Al-Muhajiroun, including Siddhartha Dhar - who went on to fight for so-called Islamic State - andthe group's leader Anjem Choudary. The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Witness M also told the inquest he had not personally been made aware that Butt had appeared in a Channel 4 programme called The Jihadi Next Door in January 2016, saying the programme was reviewed by another team. The court previously heard how Butt appeared in the programme - where he condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria - for roughly two minutes but was not identified by name. Later that year, Butt was employed by London Underground, including working at Westminster station, but Witness M said he did not have grounds to intervene. In October 2016, Butt was arrested with three others on suspicion of falsely reporting fraudulent activity on three bank accounts, and bailed until January 2017. However, prosecutors advised there was not enough evidence to charge him. Witness M said police were also unaware of a number of pieces of information that indicated Butt was associated with the two other attackers. These included the fact they all met at Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford, east London, that was itself run by a suspected senior member of Al-Muhajiroun, and that they went on regular trips together to take their children swimming. Last week, the lawyer representing several of the victims' familiestold the court there were ""opportunities galore"" to identify that the three men were plotting an attack. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack.

Electric Fields festival cancelledThe festival is cancelled less than two months after being moved from southern Scotland to Glasgow.,"Thousands of people attended the 2018 event at Drumlanrig Castle in 2018 The Electric Fields music festival has been cancelled less than two months after it was moved from southern Scotland to a new venue in Glasgow. Metronomy, The Vaccines and Frank Turnerwere among the acts due to perform at the event between 4-6 July. Organisers announced in April that they weremoving the festival from Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfries and Galloway to SWG3 in Finnieston. However, on Tuesday they confirmed the event would not now go ahead. The announcement followed fans' complaints on social media, after attempts to buy tickets via the Electric Fields website were greeted with the message: ""This show has been cancelled"". Fans trying to buy tickets via the Electric Fields website were told the show was cancelled It included a Manchester-based number for the festival's ticketing company, Ticketline, for fans wishing to claim a refund. On Tuesday afternoon,Electric Fields posted a statement on their Facebook page,externalsaying it was ""with a heavy heart"" the festival had now been cancelled. It said: ""This decision has not come lightly and we have put in our all to try avoid this outcome, however we have been faced with challenges that we simply cannot overcome. ""As of today, Electric Fields ceases trading. For information on ticket refunds, please contact your location of purchase. ""We cannot thank you enough for your support over the years and we are truly sorry that we have not been able to make this work."" It continued: ""Never did we think the party we threw in a field in Thornhill for 100 of our friends would turn into a party for 7,000 in the grounds of a castle. Especially not in five short years. ""But it did, and that is thanks to all of you who came along and made it what it was."" One fan who had previously attended the festival but was given a refund last month after the switch to Glasgow explained why he had asked for his money back. Iain Kyle said: ""It was a great family weekend and it introduced the kids to some fantastic music they may otherwise not have experienced. ""The move to SWG3 just killed the whole vibe for me as it was no longer going to be time away and highly unlikely to be a similar atmosphere. ""It is a fairly congested market in Glasgow with TRNSMT and Summer Sessions already and they lost that family-friendly feature which made it so different."" Anger over Electric Fields move to Glasgow Electric Fields organisers in refund u-turn Electric Fields could return home In April, Electric Fields blamed ""ongoing logistical and transport challenges"" for the decision to leave Drumlanrig. SWG3 said that fans who had bought tickets for the event once it had been moved to Glasgow via the venue's ticket provider, Ticketweb, would receive refunds within 14-28 days. A spokeswoman for SWG3 added that this would apply to about 80 customers.
