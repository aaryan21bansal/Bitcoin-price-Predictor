"I will help with costs where I can, says chancellor","The chancellor has pledged to help ""where we can make a difference"", as he faces pressure to help households with soaring living costs. Ahead of next week's Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak told the BBC he would ""stand by"" people, but warned sanctions against Russia were not ""cost-free"". He is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut fuel duty to help ease rising costs at the pumps. His Labour counterpart Rachel Reeves said her party would back such a move. But the shadow chancellor said the government should also be taxing oil and gas companies to fund more generous energy discounts for poorer families. And she repeated Labour's call for ministers to scrap the 1.25 percentage point hike in National Insurance, which is due to begin in April. Why is the cost of living going up? People 'facing choice between food and energy' What Tory MPs want from Sunak The Spring Statement is not usually an occasion to announce big tax and spending decisions. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Personal finance expert Martin Lewis said the squeeze facing households was worse than during the Covid pandemic or after the 2008 financial crash. He told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he was ""virtually out of tools to help people now"" - and said more ""political intervention"" was required. Speaking to the same programme, Mr Sunak said he would not be able to ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. But asked whether he was prepared to step in and offer support, he added: ""Of course I am, and people can judge me by my actions over the past two years."" He added: ""I want to be honest with people that it's not going to be easy. ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. ""I can't do that, but what I would say is I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" This video can not be played Financial journalist Martin Lewis says fuel and energy price rises are ""catastrophic"" Millions of household are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel is also on the rise, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rising inflation, which the Bank of England has warned could hit about 7% this year, is also pushing up costs of food, clothing and transport. EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high? PRICES:Cost of petrol hits fresh record WARNING:UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades APPEAL:Campaigner says families need urgent help Mr Sunak is facing calls from more than 50 MPs to cut fuel duty, which has been frozen for over a decade, to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. Others within his party have been calling for the government to scrap VAT on energy bills - while some want green levies removed to reduce costs. The chancellor said he could not ""speculate"" on tax decisions, but added that the government was already ""taking action"" over energy bills. He pointed to supportannounced in April- including a Â£150 rebate on council tax for people living in properties in bands A-D, about 80% of households. A Â£200 energy bill discount is also due to apply in October - although Labour has criticised it as a ""buy now, pay later scheme"" as people will have to pay the discount back over five years from 2023. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said Labour would support a cut to fuel duty - currently 57.95p per litre of petrol or diesel - but told Sky News the move did not ""rise to the scale of the challenge we face"". She told the BBC her ""priority"" would be reversing next month's National Insurance rise, and increasing corporation tax on oil and gas firms to fund more generous support for energy bills through theWarm Home Discount,externalscheme.

Saudi oil giant to ramp up energy production,"The state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to sharply increase the amount it invests in energy production, after it reported a doubling of profits in 2021. The firm aims to boost output significantly over the next five years. Energy prices have soared in recent months as demand has outstripped supplies of oil and gas. The war in Ukraine and a reluctance to rely on Russia for energy has added to the pressure to find additional sources of energy. Saudi Aramco's move is likely to be welcomed by political leaders worried about the impact of high energy prices, although the boost to investment is aimed at increasing output over the course of the next five to eight years. Last week prime minister Boris Johnson visited Saudi Arabia to try to persuade the country to release more oil into world markets in the short term. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and by raising production it could help to reduce energy prices which are currently at 14-year highs. However, the country has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents and for widespread use of capital punishment. The Labour Party accused the government of going ""cap in hand"" from one dictator to another to tackle the energy crisis. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the prime minister was ""absolutely right"" to engage with Saudi Arabia over increasing energy supplies. ""It would be wrong if we weren't exploring all the avenues we could to bring cheaper energy and more secure energy to people in this country,"" Rishi Sunak told the BBC. The prime minister had ""constructive dialogue"" about human rights abuses during the visit, he said. PM: I raised human rights with Saudi Arabia Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil controversial? Shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK should be focusing on boosting domestic production of energy through new nuclear and on and off-shore wind generation, to reduce reliance on states like Russia and Saudi Arabia. ""Getting to net zero is the mission of our generation,"" she said. ""We've got to do more to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which is why investment in homegrown electricity is so important."" Energy markets have been volatile during the pandemic, as sudden changes in economic activity have influenced both supply and demand. In 2020 Saudi Aramco's profits dropped sharply as the world economy slowed. But a reopening in many countries led to a sharp rise in energy prices in 2021. That boosted revenues at all the large energy generating companies. Saudi Aramco said it planned to increase its capital expenditure to $45-$50bn this year with further increases until the middle of the decade. Last year capital expenditure was $31.9bn. It would raise its crude oil ""maximum sustainable capacity"" to 13 million barrels a day by 2027, the company said. It also aims to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030. Saudi Arabia produced just over 10 million barrels of oil per day in February. The oil company more-than doubled its net profit to $110bn in 2021, up from $49bn in 2020. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil increased by around 50% in 2021 and, with energy prices remaining high, analysts expect profit to increase further in 2022. Saudi Aramco said it planned to develop a significant hydrogen export capability and become a global leader in carbon capture and storage technology.

We dig in, we're not scared to play quick attacking football or be hones, we've got good honest players, we're an honest bunch. And we've got the league as well to focus on, it's not all doom and gloom.""

Saudi oil giant to ramp up energy productionThe state energy firm Saudi Aramco said it would increase investment after profits more than doubled in 2021.,"The state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to sharply increase the amount it invests in energy production, after it reported a doubling of profits in 2021. The firm aims to boost output significantly over the next five years. Energy prices have soared in recent months as demand has outstripped supplies of oil and gas. The war in Ukraine and a reluctance to rely on Russia for energy has added to the pressure to find additional sources of energy. Saudi Aramco's move is likely to be welcomed by political leaders worried about the impact of high energy prices, although the boost to investment is aimed at increasing output over the course of the next five to eight years. Last week prime minister Boris Johnson visited Saudi Arabia to try to persuade the country to release more oil into world markets in the short term. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and by raising production it could help to reduce energy prices which are currently at 14-year highs. However, the country has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents and for widespread use of capital punishment. The Labour Party accused the government of going ""cap in hand"" from one dictator to another to tackle the energy crisis. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the prime minister was ""absolutely right"" to engage with Saudi Arabia over increasing energy supplies. ""It would be wrong if we weren't exploring all the avenues we could to bring cheaper energy and more secure energy to people in this country,"" Rishi Sunak told the BBC. The prime minister had ""constructive dialogue"" about human rights abuses during the visit, he said. PM: I raised human rights with Saudi Arabia Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil controversial? Shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK should be focusing on boosting domestic production of energy through new nuclear and on and off-shore wind generation, to reduce reliance on states like Russia and Saudi Arabia. ""Getting to net zero is the mission of our generation,"" she said. ""We've got to do more to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which is why investment in homegrown electricity is so important."" Energy markets have been volatile during the pandemic, as sudden changes in economic activity have influenced both supply and demand. In 2020 Saudi Aramco's profits dropped sharply as the world economy slowed. But a reopening in many countries led to a sharp rise in energy prices in 2021. That boosted revenues at all the large energy generating companies. Saudi Aramco said it planned to increase its capital expenditure to $45-$50bn this year with further increases until the middle of the decade. Last year capital expenditure was $31.9bn. It would raise its crude oil ""maximum sustainable capacity"" to 13 million barrels a day by 2027, the company said. It also aims to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030. Saudi Arabia produced just over 10 million barrels of oil per day in February. The oil company more-than doubled its net profit to $110bn in 2021, up from $49bn in 2020. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil increased by around 50% in 2021 and, with energy prices remaining high, analysts expect profit to increase further in 2022. Saudi Aramco said it planned to develop a significant hydrogen export capability and become a global leader in carbon capture and storage technology.

"P&O sackings were appalling, says Sunak","P&O Ferries' sacking of 800 staff without warning last week was ""awful"" and ""wrong"", Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told the BBC. The government is examining the legality of the firm's actions, the chancellor confirmed. However,the Sunday Times reports,externalthat ministers knew of the plan to sack crew beforehand, but failed to challenge it. The Department for Transport said ""full details"" were not available at that stage. A memo sent to ministers by a senior Whitehall official - and seen by the Sunday Times - outlined P&O Ferries' strategy before the sackings took place, the newspaper said. According to the Sunday Times, the note said the sackings were designed to ensure P&O remained ""a key player in the UK market for years to come through restructuring"". The memo, as reported in the newspaper, said: ""We understand that P&O Ferries have an intention to try and re-employ many staff on new terms and conditions or use agency staff to restart routes; they estimate disruption to services lasting 10 days."" It was circulated before Thursday's announcement, made over Zoom, telling 800 P&O staff that they were losing their jobs with immediate effect. The news was met with outrage from trades unions representing crew and ministers responded with strong criticism, announcing they would review all government contracts with the firm. Mr Sunak, speaking to Sophie Raworth on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, said P&O's approach was ""appalling in the way that they've treated their workers"". P&O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say experts P&O jobs agency says it did not know of sackings Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? The government does not appear to have voiced concerns directly to P&O before the sackings. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was standard practice for officials to outline what they had been told by a private firm in an internal memo. ""This was sent before ministers were advised of the full details and as soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which P&O staff had been dismissed,"" a DfT spokesperson said. The DfT said the memo made clear that the department's priority was to ""work with unions to ensure workers' rights continue to be protected"". The transport secretary had urged the company to ""sit down with workers and reconsider this action"", the DfT added. Grant Shapps has said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the move. Protests have taken place outside the P&O head office near Dover Louise Haigh MP, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""This bombshell letter proves that the government was not only aware of P&O ferries' scandalous action - but complicit in it. ""They knew people's livelihoods were on the line and they knew P&O was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing."" In a statement, P&O Ferries said: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" Chris Parker, a director at DFDS, one of P&O's competitors, told the BBC that his company is prepared to hire some of those sacked by P&O Ferries. ""We reduced the capacity of vessels quite sharply during the pandemic because of social distancing. We're increasing that back up again now and we're looking for some staff to come in and help us with that,"" he said. P&O Ferries is owned by Dubai logistics giant DP World which is, in turn, controlled by the Dubai sovereign wealth fund. Last year, DP World's revenue soared by more than a fifth to over Â£3.7bn ($4.9bn) as the global economy began to pick up after coronavirus lockdowns. The company received support of around Â£10m during the pandemic to furlough 1,100 workers. P&O Ferries services remain suspended. P&O jobs agency says it did not know of sackings P&O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say experts Ministers review P&O Ferries contracts Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?

"P&O sackings were appalling, says SunakThe government is examining the legality of the ferry firm's actions, the chancellor confirms.Business","P&O Ferries' sacking of 800 staff without warning last week was ""awful"" and ""wrong"", Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told the BBC. The government is examining the legality of the firm's actions, the chancellor confirmed. However,the Sunday Times reports,externalthat ministers knew of the plan to sack crew beforehand, but failed to challenge it. The Department for Transport said ""full details"" were not available at that stage. A memo sent to ministers by a senior Whitehall official - and seen by the Sunday Times - outlined P&O Ferries' strategy before the sackings took place, the newspaper said. According to the Sunday Times, the note said the sackings were designed to ensure P&O remained ""a key player in the UK market for years to come through restructuring"". The memo, as reported in the newspaper, said: ""We understand that P&O Ferries have an intention to try and re-employ many staff on new terms and conditions or use agency staff to restart routes; they estimate disruption to services lasting 10 days."" It was circulated before Thursday's announcement, made over Zoom, telling 800 P&O staff that they were losing their jobs with immediate effect. The news was met with outrage from trades unions representing crew and ministers responded with strong criticism, announcing they would review all government contracts with the firm. Mr Sunak, speaking to Sophie Raworth on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, said P&O's approach was ""appalling in the way that they've treated their workers"". P&O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say experts P&O jobs agency says it did not know of sackings Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? The government does not appear to have voiced concerns directly to P&O before the sackings. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was standard practice for officials to outline what they had been told by a private firm in an internal memo. ""This was sent before ministers were advised of the full details and as soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which P&O staff had been dismissed,"" a DfT spokesperson said. The DfT said the memo made clear that the department's priority was to ""work with unions to ensure workers' rights continue to be protected"". The transport secretary had urged the company to ""sit down with workers and reconsider this action"", the DfT added. Grant Shapps has said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the move. Protests have taken place outside the P&O head office near Dover Louise Haigh MP, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""This bombshell letter proves that the government was not only aware of P&O ferries' scandalous action - but complicit in it. ""They knew people's livelihoods were on the line and they knew P&O was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing."" In a statement, P&O Ferries said: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" Chris Parker, a director at DFDS, one of P&O's competitors, told the BBC that his company is prepared to hire some of those sacked by P&O Ferries. ""We reduced the capacity of vessels quite sharply during the pandemic because of social distancing. We're increasing that back up again now and we're looking for some staff to come in and help us with that,"" he said. P&O Ferries is owned by Dubai logistics giant DP World which is, in turn, controlled by the Dubai sovereign wealth fund. Last year, DP World's revenue soared by more than a fifth to over Â£3.7bn ($4.9bn) as the global economy began to pick up after coronavirus lockdowns. The company received support of around Â£10m during the pandemic to furlough 1,100 workers. P&O Ferries services remain suspended.

Anonymous: How hackers are trying to undermine Putin,"A member of the Squad 303/Anonymous hacker group The Anonymous hacktivist collective has been bombarding Russia with cyber-attacks since declaring ""cyber war"" on President Vladimir Putin in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. Several people operating under its banner spoke to the BBC about their motives, tactics and plans. Of all the cyber-attacks carried out since the Ukraine conflict started, an Anonymous hack on Russian TV networks stands out. The hack was captured in a short video clip which shows normal programming interrupted with images of bombs exploding in Ukraine and soldiers talking about the horrors of the conflict. The video began circulating on the 26 February and was shared by Anonymous social media accounts with millions of followers. ""JUST IN: #Russian state TV channels have been hacked by #Anonymous to broadcast the truth about what happens in #Ukraine,""one post read.,external It quickly racked up millions of views. The video was sent to a woman in the US, Eliza, by her father in Russia The stunt has all the hallmarks of an Anonymous hack - dramatic, impactful and easy to share online. Like many of the group's other cyber-attacks it was also extremely hard to verify. But one of the smaller groups of Anonymous hackers said that they were responsible, and that they took over TV services for 12 minutes. The first person to post the video was also able to verify it was real. Eliza lives in the US but her father is Russian and called her when his TV shows were interrupted. ""My father called me when it happened and said, 'Oh my God, they're showing the truth!' So I got him to record it and I posted the clip online. He says one of his friends saw it happen too."" Rostelecom, the Russian company that runs the hacked services did not respond to requests for comment. The hackers justified their actions saying innocent Ukrainians were being massacred. ""We will intensify the attacks on the Kremlin, if nothing is done to restore peace in Ukraine,"" they added. Anonymous says it has also taken down Russian websites and stolen government data, but Lisa Forte, a partner at cyber-security company Red Goat says most of these attacks have so far been ""quite basic"". Hackers have mostly been using DDoS attacks, where a server is overwhelmed by a flood of requests, she said. These are relatively simple to carry out and only take websites offline temporarily. ""But the TV hack is incredibly creative,"" she said, ""and I would think quite difficult to pull off."" The hacktivist collective first emerged in 2003 from the website 4chan The group has no leadership, its tagline is ""We are legion"" Anyone can claim to be a part of the group and hack for any cause they want, but they generally they attack organisations accused of misusing power Their symbol is a Guy Fawkes mask, made famous by Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta in which an anarchist revolutionary topples a corrupt fascist government The group has many social media accounts, with 15.5 million followers on its Twitter pages alone Anonymous hackers have also defaced Russian websites. Forte says this involves gaining control of a website to change the content displayed. So far, the attacks have caused disruption and embarrassment, but cyber-experts have become increasingly concerned by the explosion of hacktivism since the invasion. They are worried that a hacker might accidentally knock out a hospital's computer network or interrupt critical communication links. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" says Emily Taylor from the Cyber Policy Journal. ""These attacks do carry risks. [They] could lead to escalation, or someone could accidentally cause real damage to a critical part of civilian life."" You can hear more about this story and hear from some of the hackers themselves in the '5 Minutes On' podcastavailable on BBC Sounds. Anonymous has not been this active in years. Roman, a Ukrainian tech entrepreneur who heads a group of hackers called Stand for Ukraine, had no links with the organisation until Russia invaded his country. But he told me that when he and his team briefly defaced the website of the Russian state news agency, Tass, with an anti-Putin poster, they included an Anonymous logo. Roman works from his apartment in Kyiv, co-ordinating his team as they create websites, Android apps and Telegram bots to help Ukraine's war effort, and hack Russian targets. ""I am ready to go and pick up a rifle for Ukraine, but at the moment my skills are better used at the computer. So I'm here in my home with my two laptops, co-ordinating this IT resistance."" Roman at work: ""Sometimes I see rockets in my sky"" He says his group took a Russian regional train ticket service offline for a number of hours, although the BBC has not been able to verify this. He defends his actions saying: ""These things are illegal and wrong until there is a threat to you or your relative."" Another group that has merged with Anonymous is a Polish hacking team called Squad 303, named after a famous Polish fighter squadron in World War Two. ""We work together with Anonymous all the time and I now consider myself a member of the Anonymous movement,"" says one of the group, who uses the name of WW2 pilot Jan Zumbach as his moniker. He didn't want his photograph published but another member of his team, a Ukrainian, sent a picture of himself in a helmet and mask. He described his situation as ""on the barricade with a rifle during the day and hacking with the Squad/Anonymous at night"". Squad 303 has built a website allowing members of the public to send text messages to random Russian phone numbers, telling them the truth about the war. They claim to have facilitated more than 20 million SMS and WhatsApp messages. Two Anonymous groups I spoke to cited this as the most impactful thing the collective has done so far for Ukraine. Asked how he justified the Squad's illegal activity, Jan Zumbach said they did not steal or share any private information and were only trying to speak to Russians, with the aim of winning the information war. However he also said they were planning a more impactful hack in the coming days. Vigilante groups in Russia arealso carrying out attackson Ukraine, but seemingly on a smaller scale. There have been three major waves of co-ordinated DDoS attacks against Ukraine since January, plus three incidents of more serious ""wiper"" attacks that deleted data on a small number of Ukrainian computer systems. Ukraine says it is fighting first 'hybrid war' Russia's vigilante hackers join the attack on Ukraine Cyber-attacks escalate against Ukrainian websites On Wednesday amanipulated video of President Zelenskyappeared on the Ukraine 24 TV channel website after an apparent hack. In the current environment, though, it's hard to know exactly who is behind any given cyber-attack. ""The Achilles heel of Anonymous is that anyone can claim to be Anonymous, including state actors operating against what we're fighting for,"" says long-standing Anonymous hacker Anon2World. ""With our current rise in popularity, it's (almost) a given that there will be obvious repercussions from a government entity. As for adding to the chaos, we're used to chaos, especially online.""

"I will help with costs where I can, says SunakThe chancellor says he will ""stand by"" people, as he faces pressure to act on rising living costs.","The chancellor has pledged to help ""where we can make a difference"", as he faces pressure to help households with soaring living costs. Ahead of next week's Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak told the BBC he would ""stand by"" people, but warned sanctions against Russia were not ""cost-free"". He is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut fuel duty to help ease rising costs at the pumps. His Labour counterpart Rachel Reeves said her party would back such a move. But the shadow chancellor said the government should also be taxing oil and gas companies to fund more generous energy discounts for poorer families. And she repeated Labour's call for ministers to scrap the 1.25 percentage point hike in National Insurance, which is due to begin in April. Why is the cost of living going up? People 'facing choice between food and energy' What Tory MPs want from Sunak The Spring Statement is not usually an occasion to announce big tax and spending decisions. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Personal finance expert Martin Lewis said the squeeze facing households was worse than during the Covid pandemic or after the 2008 financial crash. He told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he was ""virtually out of tools to help people now"" - and said more ""political intervention"" was required. Speaking to the same programme, Mr Sunak said he would not be able to ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. But asked whether he was prepared to step in and offer support, he added: ""Of course I am, and people can judge me by my actions over the past two years."" He added: ""I want to be honest with people that it's not going to be easy. ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. ""I can't do that, but what I would say is I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" This video can not be played Financial journalist Martin Lewis says fuel and energy price rises are ""catastrophic"" Millions of household are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel is also on the rise, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rising inflation, which the Bank of England has warned could hit about 7% this year, is also pushing up costs of food, clothing and transport. EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high? PRICES:Cost of petrol hits fresh record WARNING:UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades APPEAL:Campaigner says families need urgent help Mr Sunak is facing calls from more than 50 MPs to cut fuel duty, which has been frozen for over a decade, to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. Others within his party have been calling for the government to scrap VAT on energy bills - while some want green levies removed to reduce costs. The chancellor said he could not ""speculate"" on tax decisions, but added that the government was already ""taking action"" over energy bills. He pointed to supportannounced in April- including a Â£150 rebate on council tax for people living in properties in bands A-D, about 80% of households. A Â£200 energy bill discount is also due to apply in October - although Labour has criticised it as a ""buy now, pay later scheme"" as people will have to pay the discount back over five years from 2023. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said Labour would support a cut to fuel duty - currently 57.95p per litre of petrol or diesel - but told Sky News the move did not ""rise to the scale of the challenge we face"". She told the BBC her ""priority"" would be reversing next month's National Insurance rise, and increasing corporation tax on oil and gas firms to fund more generous support for energy bills through theWarm Home Discount,externalscheme.

Ahead of next week's Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak told the BBC he would ""stand by"" people, but warned sanctions against Russia were not ""cost-free"". He is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut fuel duty to help ease rising costs at the pumps. His Labour counterpart Rachel Reeves said her party would back such a move. But the shadow chancellor said the government should also be taxing oil and gas companies to fund more generous energy discounts for poorer families. And she repeated Labour's call for ministers to scrap the 1.25 percentage point hike in National Insurance, which is due to begin in April. Why is the cost of living going up? People 'facing choice between food and energy' What Tory MPs want from Sunak The Spring Statement is not usually an occasion to announce big tax and spending decisions. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Personal finance expert Martin Lewis said the squeeze facing households was worse than during the Covid pandemic or after the 2008 financial crash. He told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he was ""virtually out of tools to help people now"" - and said more ""political intervention"" was required. Speaking to the same programme, Mr Sunak said he would not be able to ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. But asked whether he was prepared to step in and offer support, he added: ""Of course I am, and people can judge me by my actions over the past two years."" He added: ""I want to be honest with people that it's not going to be easy. ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. ""I can't do that, but what I would say is I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" This video can not be played Financial journalist Martin Lewis says fuel and energy price rises are ""catastrophic"" Millions of household are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel is also on the rise, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rising inflation, which the Bank of England has warned could hit about 7% this year, is also pushing up costs of food, clothing and transport. EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high? PRICES:Cost of petrol hits fresh record WARNING:UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades APPEAL:Campaigner says families need urgent help Mr Sunak is facing calls from more than 50 MPs to cut fuel duty, which has been frozen for over a decade, to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. Others within his party have been calling for the government to scrap VAT on energy bills - while some want green levies removed to reduce costs. The chancellor said he could not ""speculate"" on tax decisions, but added that the government was already ""taking action"" over energy bills. He pointed to supportannounced in April- including a Â£150 rebate on council tax for people living in properties in bands A-D, about 80% of households. A Â£200 energy bill discount is also due to apply in October - although Labour has criticised it as a ""buy now, pay later scheme"" as people will have to pay the discount back over five years from 2023. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said Labour would support a cut to fuel duty - currently 57.95p per litre of petrol or diesel - but told Sky News the move did not ""rise to the scale of the challenge we face"". She told the BBC her ""priority"" would be reversing next month's National Insurance rise, and increasing corporation tax on oil and gas firms to fund more generous support for energy bills through theWarm Home Discount,externalscheme.

How Poland's businesses are helping Ukrainians,"Refugees crossing over the border from Ukraine in to Korczowa in Poland on foot Mariana Zlahodniuk spent days trying to persuade her mother, Olena, to get out of Ukraine. ""She wouldn't come, was adamant in fact,"" says Mariana, a 27-year-old marketing and business adviser from Ukraine, based in the Polish capital since 2012. The pair's hometown of Zhmerinka, in central-southern Ukraine, is a strategic railway point and the frontline of the Russian invasion is edging closer. Mariana's phone calls became more desperate, until, finally, Olena decided to make the hazardous journey to cross the border to safety in Poland. Olena's mother, Mariana's 73-year-old grandmother, meanwhile, is left in their house in the small town. ""She calls me every day and tells me to come home and tend to the garden,"" Olena adds. Mariana eventually picked up her mum on the Polish side of the border on 26 February after a complicated journey - half of it on a slow train to Lviv with the lights turned off - to avoid attracting attention from the Russian military forces. ""I will go home as soon as I can and will do what I can to help, for example cooking for the soldiers,"" Olena says, when we meet in a cafe in Warsaw. ""I will have to hide her passport,"" Mariana laughs. Mariana and Olena Zlahodniuk When she arrived to collect her mother, Mariana says she was immediately struck by the lack of food and help available for the stream of refugees crossing at the border town of Korczowa and decided to act. After phoning round her friends in the marketing and business community, she was quickly overwhelmed by offers of help. She joined forces with an Afghan refugee-turned-restaurant owner, Harry Parwani, a friend from Krakow. His catering company, Vegan Ramen AF, has stepped in with its portable kitchen to help provide free food for up to 8,000 people a day at the border. A Swiss investor then also funded more than â¬10,000 ($11,000; Â£8,398) of food shopping, and Mariana spent about 10,000 zlotys ($2,357; Â£1,765) of her own money supporting the work before charity organisations stepped in. Mariana now employs 20 people as cooks and helpers, providing transportation and running a hotel. Shifts rotate every three to four days as the work is gruelling and some refuse to be paid, she says. ""Bakers sell me bread below market prices, firms bring in the food for free, companies offer free transportation and drivers. It's an extraordinary effort."" A new Ukrainian population could end up filling some of Poland's labour market gaps 'We want to provide support at all stages' Polish businesses have mobilised quickly to help refugees. Two million have already arrived here. ""We will help as long as it will be required,"" says Krzysztof Inglot, founder of Poland's largest recruitment firm, Personnel Service. ""We know that refugees at different stages of their stay in Poland will need different support. At the beginning, it is mostly transport, accommodation, and psychological support. The next stage is settling down, finding work and integration with Polish society. We want to provide support at all these stages,"" he says. National railway company PKP Intercity is offering free travel for refugees, while Maciej Panek, chief executive of vehicle hire firm Panek has donated 1,000 rental cars to transport people away from the border. Many Ukrainian refugees arrive carrying just a couple of bags Transport firm FlixBus, meanwhile, has provided refugees with free buses on routes from the border. The company also joined UA Talents - a jobs platform launched by two Berlin-based Ukrainian entrepreneurs that will help refugees find jobs. Meanwhile, Poland's largest private healthcare company, Lux Med, has offered urgent free medical assistance to refugees. And mobile phone operators Play, Orange, Plus and T-Mobile are reducing the costs of telephone calls to the main Ukrainian operators, Kyivstar, Vodafone and Lifecell. Helping the refugees sort out their finances will also become an important part of support - banks in Poland have already removed fees for money transfers to Ukraine and commissions for cash deposits and ATM withdrawals. Mr Inglot is optimistic, he says his recruitment company data suggests the labour market in Poland could absorb 500,000 employees within the next six months and another 200,000 after that, due to an acute shortage of workers in many sectors. ""We estimate that about 30% have travelled to other countries, so can say about half a million people may want to join the labour market. That is good news for employers who need employees,"" he says. A labour market study from Poland's Central Statistics Office shows firmsneed 93,000 industrial workers, 85,000 IT specialists, and 61,000 operators and assemblers of machines and devices, and a further 52,000 service sector employees,external. Michael Dembinski, chief adviser to the British Polish Chamber of Commerce (BPCC), agrees. ""Our members have been held back by a lack of workers in Poland."" He describes an outflow of men from sectors such as construction, logistics and IT, but is hopeful hospitality, retail, the care sector, agriculture and horticulture will now gain more staff. Daniel Di Giusto and Jacek Siadkowski are both working on the Tech To The Rescue project Smaller firms This rapid response has not been limited to the biggest companies: smaller firms are also pitching in. HerImpact, a recruitment agency in Warsaw, is working for free to help women arriving from Ukraine create new CVs, apply for jobs and translate documents into Polish and English, says chief brand officer Dionizy Wincenty Placzkowski. ""Many Poles have opened their hearts and houses to provide support to people in need,"" says Agata Zeman, managing director of the 24/7 media agency in Warsaw. The agency has donated part of its office to Flying Bag Foundation which is helping refugees, especially teenagers, organise their lives in Warsaw. ""I am proud of our people, who from the first minute, were united in solidarity and support for Ukraine. Like many other firms, we have given our team time to volunteer."" Agata Zeman, managing director of the 24/7 media agency in Warsaw says staff are volunteering their time to support new arrivals A Polish foundation that connects IT companies with non-governmental organisations - TechForUkraine - was launched the day before Russia's invasion and within two weeks had 450 firms signed up and 30 projects launched. ""IT companies have these 'superpowers' and want to use them for good,"" says Jacek Siadkowski, director of TechForUkraine. ""Young people coming into the sector in Poland often work on strategies for selling sausages or something, and this campaign really galvanised them."" Mr Siadkowski says TechForUkraine is working on an ""Airbnb-style"" web platform, to help Ukrainians find accommodation. He says the platform called, uaSOS.org, is being developed by BCG, ID Advisory, Clevsoft and several dozens volunteers pro bono. Polish British Social Integration Club, Wawel, a charity based in West London is sending out donations from the UK. Ties between UK and Poland Mr Dembicki says many of the BPCC's members - one third are large UK-based businesses investing in Poland - have pledged some kind of support, some financial. He says many of the UK's 52 chambers of commerce also want to help, offering English language lessons online. ""As soon as we heard about the war in Ukraine, I asked friends to start a collection of humanitarian aid, so together with Katarzyna Mazurkiewicz and volunteers we organised it,"" says Irina Nowosielska from the Polish British Social Integration Club, Wawel, a charity based in West London. ""There are a lot of good people around. It's just unbelievable how many people help us to help Ukraine,"" Ms Nowosielska says. Back in Warsaw however, Olena Zlahodniuk, is already itching to go home. ""I am extremely grateful to the Polish people for helping, but this is our fight and we will win,"" she says.

UK holds plane with possible Russian tiesThe jet is being held at London Biggin Hill airport while it is investigated if it falls under UK sanctions.,"Aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. A private jet has been grounded while ""possible Russian links"" are probed, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shappssaid,externalministers were taking decisive action against Vladimir Putin and his ""illegal war"" in Ukraine. All aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. The jet has been held at London Biggin Hill airport while officials investigate if it falls foul of UK sanctions. The official notice grounding the flight on Saturday morning relates to a Cessna plane owned by a company named as Brooker Holdings. The Department for Transport said it would not comment on any links to individuals while it investigated the issue further. The latest plane seizure comes 10 days after it emerged that theUK had impounded a private jet linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch. The Luxembourg-registered aircraft had flown from the US into Farnborough airport, Hampshire, on 3 March.  UK officials believe the oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler was on board when it arrived. The plane had been due to fly from the UK to Dubai, but UK authorities prevented this while they investigated whether it was permanently leased to Mr Shvidler and fell under UK sanctions. Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions? Mr Shvidler himself has not been personally sanctioned by the UK at any stage. The UK and other western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. New trade sanctions have also been introduced banning UK exports of aviation or space-related technology to Russia. Other measures introduced by the UK include: Excluding major Russian banks from the UK financial system and freezing the assets of all Russian banks Putting a 35% tax on certain imports from Russia, including vodka Imposing sanctions - including travel bans and asset freezes - against oligarchs considered close to the Kremlin Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

What's driving Putin? Agents seek to get inside his head,"Russia's leader Vladimir Putin is trapped in a closed world of his own making, Western spies believe. And that worries them. For years they have sought to get inside Mr Putin's mind, to better understand his intentions. With Russian troops seemingly bogged down in Ukraine, the need to do so has become all the more necessary as they try to work out how he will react under pressure. Understanding his state of mind will be vital to avoid escalating the crisis into even more dangerous territory. There has been speculation that Russia's leader was ill, but many analysts believe he has actually become isolated and closed off to any alternative views. His isolation has been evident in pictures of his meetings, such as when he met President Emmanuel Macron, the pair at far ends of a long table. It was also evident in Mr Putin's meeting with his own national security team on the eve of war. Mr Putin's initial military plan looked like something devised by a KGB officer, one Western intelligence official explains. It had been created, they say, by a tight ""conspiratorial cabal"" with an emphasis on secrecy. But the result was chaos. Russian military commanders were not ready and some soldiers went over the border without knowing what they were doing. Western spies, through sources they will not discuss, knew more about those plans than many inside Russia's leadership. But now they face a new challenge - understanding what Russia's leader will do next. And that is not easy. ""The challenge of understanding the Kremlin's moves is that Putin is the single decision-maker in Moscow,"" explains John Sipher, who formerly ran the CIA's Russia operations. And even though his views are often made clear through public statements, knowing how he will act on them is difficult intelligence challenge. ""It is extremely hard in a system as well protected as Russia to have good intelligence on what's happening inside the head of the leader especially when so many of his own people do not know what is going on,"" Sir John Sawers, a former head of Britain's MI6, told the BBC. Isolated - President Putin chairs a meeting in February 2022 Mr Putin, intelligence officials say, is isolated in a bubble of his own making, which very little outside information penetrates, particularly any which might challenge what he thinks. ""He is a victim of his own propaganda in the sense that he only listens to a certain number of people and blocks out everything else. This gives him a strange view of the world,"" says Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology and co-author of a forthcoming book The Psychology of Spies and Spying. The risk is what is called ""group think"" in which everyone reinforces his view. ""If he's a victim of group think we need to know who the group is,"" says Prof Furnham. The circle of those Mr Putin talks to has never been large but when it came to the decision to invade Ukraine, it had narrowed to just a handful of people, Western intelligence officials believe, all of those ""true believers"" who share Mr Putin's mindset and obsessions. Who are the advisors in Vladimir Putin's tight inner circle? The sense of how small his inner circle has become was emphasised when hepublicly dressed down the head of his own Foreign Intelligence Serviceat the national security meeting just before the invasion - a move which seemed to humiliate the official. His speech hours later alsorevealed a man angry and obsessed with Ukraineand the West. Those who have observed him say the Russian leader is driven by a desire toovercome the perceived humiliation of Russia in the 1990salong with a conviction that the West is determined to keep Russia down and drive him from power. One person who met Mr Putin remembers his obsession with watching videos of Libya's Col Gaddafi being killed after he was driven from power in 2011. When the director of the CIA, William Burns, was asked to assess Mr Putin's mental state, he said he had ""been stewing in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition for many years"" and described his views as having ""hardened"" and that he was ""far more insulated"" from other points of view. Is the Russian president crazy? That is a question many in the West have asked. But few experts consider it helpful. One psychologist with expertise in the area said a mistake was to assume because we cannot understand a decision like invading Ukraine we frame the person who made it as ""mad"". The CIA has a team which carries out ""leadership analysis"" on foreign decision makers, drawing on a tradition dating back to attempts to understand Hitler. They study background, relationships and health, drawing on secret intelligence. Another source are read-outs from the those who have had direct contact, such as other leaders. In 2014, Angela Merkel reportedly told President Obama that Mr Putin was living ""in another world"". President Macron meanwhile when he sat down with Mr Putin recently, was reported to have found the Russian leader ""more rigid, more isolated"" compared with previous encounters. Presidents Putin and Macron in Moscow recently Did something change? Some speculate, without much evidence, about possible ill-health or the impact of medication. Others point to psychological factors such as a sense of his own time running out for him to fulfil what he sees as his destiny in protecting Russia or restoring its greatness. The Russian leader has visibly isolated himself from others during the Covid pandemic and this also may have had a psychological impact. ""Putin is likely not mentally ill, nor he has changed, although he is in more of a hurry, and likely more isolated in recent years,"" says Ken Dekleva, a former US government physician and diplomat, and currently a senior fellow at the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China Relations. But a concern now is that reliable information is still not finding its way into Mr Putin's closed loop. His intelligence services may have been reluctant before the invasion to tell him anything he did not want to hear, offering rosy estimates of how an invasion would go and how Russian troops would be received before the war. And this week one Western official said Mr Putin may still not have the insight into how badly things are going for his own troops that Western intelligence has. That leads to concern about how he might react when confronted with a worsening situation for Russia. Mr Putin himself tells the story of chasing a rat when he was a boy. When he had driven it into a corner, the rat reacted by attacking him, forcing a young Vladimir to become the one who fled. The question Western policymakers are asking is what if Mr Putin feels cornered now? ""The question really is whether or not he doubles down with greater brutality and escalates in terms of the weapon systems that he's prepared to use,"" said one western official. There have been concerns he could use chemical weapons or even a tactical nuclear weapon. ""The worry is that he does something unbelievably rash in a vicious press-the button way,"" says Adrian Furnham. Mr Putin himself may play up the sense that he is dangerous or even irrational - this is a well-known tactic (often called the ""madman"" theory) in which someone with access to nuclear weapons tries to get his adversary to back down by convincing them that he may well be crazy enough to use them despite the potential for everyone to perish. For Western spies and policymakers understanding Mr Putin's intentions and mindset today could not be more important. Predicting his response is pivotal in working out how far they can push him without triggering a dangerous reaction. ""Putin's self concept does not allow for failure or weakness. He despises such things"" says Ken Dekleva. ""A cornered, weakened Putin is a more dangerous Putin. It's sometimes better to let the bear run out of the cage and back to the forest.""

Katty Kay: America is learning the art of humility,"Ukraine's President Zelensky addresses the US Congress America is learning the art of humility. That's a good thing for the rest of the world. The country that began this century by invading not one but two countries, has become more modest in the face of the nightmare that is Ukraine. Forget shock and awe, this is the era of caution and apprehension. That's what having no good options will do for you. Friday's two-hour phone call with China's President Xi, superpower to superpower, was a sign of how hard it will be for America to stop this war. The US's leverage over China is limited, and readouts from both sides suggest the call didn't achieve much. But it was part of an orchestrated diplomatic strategy that contrasts with much of the first year of Joe Biden's presidency. After the fiasco of the Afghan withdrawal last summer, America lost credibility with its European allies. US intelligence looked unprepared, and the operation of leaving was staggeringly incompetent. What's more, European diplomats complained, America didn't really consult with allies. America pulled out on its own precipitous timetable, leaving countries that still had forces and personnel in the country scrambling. When some Europeans said it would be smart to leave a residual Nato force, the White House ignored the pleas. That heavy-handed mission was followed by another. In September, the White House announced a nuclear submarine security pact between Australia, Britain and the US. The pact left the French, who had been negotiating their own sub sale to the Australians, out in the cold. Worse, the Elysee Palace said it learned of the new deal from the press. It was a masterclass in how not to handle your oldest ally. The French were so furious that President Biden apologised and admitted the US had been clumsy. But the damage was done. By the autumn of 2021 Europeans were disappointed in the Biden administration and felt their hopes that a post-Trump America would be more collegial were ill-founded. When Washington started ringing the alarm bell about Russia and Ukraine, Europeans weren't in much mood to listen. ""War-mongering"" was how one EU diplomat described it to me. US Marines in Kandahar, Afghanistan Whether it was the lesson of Afghanistan or the nature of this particularly difficult catastrophe, we don't know, but the White House handled this crisis very differently. From the start it has consulted with its allies, many of whom were sceptical. There are reports that US diplomats approached Europeans as equals not subordinates. The administration shared highly secret intelligence in a manner that was unprecedented. In the months that led up to the invasion senior White House officials made multiple trips to meet their European counterparts. President Biden made regular phone calls to European leaders. This wasn't Iraq in 2002, it wasn't Trump's America First, it wasn't Afghanistan in 2021. This was genuine alliance building. On 27 January there was an indication that the shuttle diplomacy was bearing fruit. A full month before the invasion, during an otherwise ordinary press briefing, the White House spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, announced that German Chancellor Olaf Sholz would visit the White House on 7 February. Securing that visit of the brand new German leader was an indication that the administration both anticipated what was coming, and knew what was needed: German co-operation. A visit to the White House is a coup for any foreign leader, it's a useful weapon of soft power. Yes, President Zelensky's articulate appeals also played a big part in shifting German policy, but US diplomacy helped win German support. Ukraine war: Zelensky invokes 9/11 in plea to US Congress Why Biden won't send US troops to Ukraine Biden defends 'messy' US pull-out from Afghanistan Beyond diplomacy, there is a new recognition here of Washington's military limits, a realisation that force won't get America everything it wants, however strong its army. That's an unusual position for the world's biggest military. When Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait in 1990, the US rallied the world to put boots on the ground to get him out. In 1999 President Clinton ordered Nato jets to conduct airstrikes in Kosovo. After 9/11, the US strong-armed a coalition of the unwilling to invade Iraq. In 2011, the US military was part of the operation that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Today Washington is holding back, resisting the emotional pleas of Zelensky to use that military clout. It's sending weapons, intelligence and cyber-support. But for the moment it won't do more. America knows it could impose, and most probably enforce, a no-fly zone. It has the jets and missiles and pilots to do so. But, as the White House says repeatedly, mobilising the might of the Pentagon won't necessarily end this war, it might make it worse. The more America leads, the greater the risk that Putin can sell this to his own people as a fight between Russia and the US. Which is why you won't hear this White House talk about regime change, or democracy, or even freedom in Russia. George W Bush delivers his 2005 inaugural adress I reread President Bush's second inaugural address, delivered in 2005, at the height of the Iraq war, when neo-conservatives ran US foreign policy. ""It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nature and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world,"" the newly re-elected president declared. Talk about hubris. Yet the White House also understands the risks of not being more assertive. It knows that not intervening could lead to the deaths of countless more Ukrainian civilians, and President Putin may strike a Nato country anyway. So it walks a tightrope with potentially horrifying consequences, recognising that there are no good answers. The US is left to help Ukrainians from the sidelines. And maybe that is all they can do. It is enough to make anyone more humble. What weapons has the US given Ukraine?

What's driving Putin? Agents seek to get inside his headVladimir Putin's war in Ukraine shook the West. Now its leaders are trying to predict his next move.Europe,"Russia's leader Vladimir Putin is trapped in a closed world of his own making, Western spies believe. And that worries them. For years they have sought to get inside Mr Putin's mind, to better understand his intentions. With Russian troops seemingly bogged down in Ukraine, the need to do so has become all the more necessary as they try to work out how he will react under pressure. Understanding his state of mind will be vital to avoid escalating the crisis into even more dangerous territory. There has been speculation that Russia's leader was ill, but many analysts believe he has actually become isolated and closed off to any alternative views. His isolation has been evident in pictures of his meetings, such as when he met President Emmanuel Macron, the pair at far ends of a long table. It was also evident in Mr Putin's meeting with his own national security team on the eve of war. Mr Putin's initial military plan looked like something devised by a KGB officer, one Western intelligence official explains. It had been created, they say, by a tight ""conspiratorial cabal"" with an emphasis on secrecy. But the result was chaos. Russian military commanders were not ready and some soldiers went over the border without knowing what they were doing. Western spies, through sources they will not discuss, knew more about those plans than many inside Russia's leadership. But now they face a new challenge - understanding what Russia's leader will do next. And that is not easy. ""The challenge of understanding the Kremlin's moves is that Putin is the single decision-maker in Moscow,"" explains John Sipher, who formerly ran the CIA's Russia operations. And even though his views are often made clear through public statements, knowing how he will act on them is difficult intelligence challenge. ""It is extremely hard in a system as well protected as Russia to have good intelligence on what's happening inside the head of the leader especially when so many of his own people do not know what is going on,"" Sir John Sawers, a former head of Britain's MI6, told the BBC. Isolated - President Putin chairs a meeting in February 2022 Mr Putin, intelligence officials say, is isolated in a bubble of his own making, which very little outside information penetrates, particularly any which might challenge what he thinks. ""He is a victim of his own propaganda in the sense that he only listens to a certain number of people and blocks out everything else. This gives him a strange view of the world,"" says Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology and co-author of a forthcoming book The Psychology of Spies and Spying. The risk is what is called ""group think"" in which everyone reinforces his view. ""If he's a victim of group think we need to know who the group is,"" says Prof Furnham. The circle of those Mr Putin talks to has never been large but when it came to the decision to invade Ukraine, it had narrowed to just a handful of people, Western intelligence officials believe, all of those ""true believers"" who share Mr Putin's mindset and obsessions. Who are the advisors in Vladimir Putin's tight inner circle? The sense of how small his inner circle has become was emphasised when hepublicly dressed down the head of his own Foreign Intelligence Serviceat the national security meeting just before the invasion - a move which seemed to humiliate the official. His speech hours later alsorevealed a man angry and obsessed with Ukraineand the West. Those who have observed him say the Russian leader is driven by a desire toovercome the perceived humiliation of Russia in the 1990salong with a conviction that the West is determined to keep Russia down and drive him from power. One person who met Mr Putin remembers his obsession with watching videos of Libya's Col Gaddafi being killed after he was driven from power in 2011. When the director of the CIA, William Burns, was asked to assess Mr Putin's mental state, he said he had ""been stewing in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition for many years"" and described his views as having ""hardened"" and that he was ""far more insulated"" from other points of view. Is the Russian president crazy? That is a question many in the West have asked. But few experts consider it helpful. One psychologist with expertise in the area said a mistake was to assume because we cannot understand a decision like invading Ukraine we frame the person who made it as ""mad"". The CIA has a team which carries out ""leadership analysis"" on foreign decision makers, drawing on a tradition dating back to attempts to understand Hitler. They study background, relationships and health, drawing on secret intelligence. Another source are read-outs from the those who have had direct contact, such as other leaders. In 2014, Angela Merkel reportedly told President Obama that Mr Putin was living ""in another world"". President Macron meanwhile when he sat down with Mr Putin recently, was reported to have found the Russian leader ""more rigid, more isolated"" compared with previous encounters. Presidents Putin and Macron in Moscow recently Did something change? Some speculate, without much evidence, about possible ill-health or the impact of medication. Others point to psychological factors such as a sense of his own time running out for him to fulfil what he sees as his destiny in protecting Russia or restoring its greatness. The Russian leader has visibly isolated himself from others during the Covid pandemic and this also may have had a psychological impact. ""Putin is likely not mentally ill, nor he has changed, although he is in more of a hurry, and likely more isolated in recent years,"" says Ken Dekleva, a former US government physician and diplomat, and currently a senior fellow at the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China Relations. But a concern now is that reliable information is still not finding its way into Mr Putin's closed loop. His intelligence services may have been reluctant before the invasion to tell him anything he did not want to hear, offering rosy estimates of how an invasion would go and how Russian troops would be received before the war. And this week one Western official said Mr Putin may still not have the insight into how badly things are going for his own troops that Western intelligence has. That leads to concern about how he might react when confronted with a worsening situation for Russia. Mr Putin himself tells the story of chasing a rat when he was a boy. When he had driven it into a corner, the rat reacted by attacking him, forcing a young Vladimir to become the one who fled. The question Western policymakers are asking is what if Mr Putin feels cornered now? ""The question really is whether or not he doubles down with greater brutality and escalates in terms of the weapon systems that he's prepared to use,"" said one western official. There have been concerns he could use chemical weapons or even a tactical nuclear weapon. ""The worry is that he does something unbelievably rash in a vicious press-the button way,"" says Adrian Furnham. Mr Putin himself may play up the sense that he is dangerous or even irrational - this is a well-known tactic (often called the ""madman"" theory) in which someone with access to nuclear weapons tries to get his adversary to back down by convincing them that he may well be crazy enough to use them despite the potential for everyone to perish. For Western spies and policymakers understanding Mr Putin's intentions and mindset today could not be more important. Predicting his response is pivotal in working out how far they can push him without triggering a dangerous reaction. ""Putin's self concept does not allow for failure or weakness. He despises such things"" says Ken Dekleva. ""A cornered, weakened Putin is a more dangerous Putin. It's sometimes better to let the bear run out of the cage and back to the forest.""

UK holds plane with possible Russian tiesThe jet is being held at London Biggin Hill airport while it is investigated if it falls under UK sanctions.UK,"Aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. A private jet has been grounded while ""possible Russian links"" are probed, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shappssaid,externalministers were taking decisive action against Vladimir Putin and his ""illegal war"" in Ukraine. All aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. The jet has been held at London Biggin Hill airport while officials investigate if it falls foul of UK sanctions. The official notice grounding the flight on Saturday morning relates to a Cessna plane owned by a company named as Brooker Holdings. The Department for Transport said it would not comment on any links to individuals while it investigated the issue further. The latest plane seizure comes 10 days after it emerged that theUK had impounded a private jet linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch. The Luxembourg-registered aircraft had flown from the US into Farnborough airport, Hampshire, on 3 March.  UK officials believe the oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler was on board when it arrived. The plane had been due to fly from the UK to Dubai, but UK authorities prevented this while they investigated whether it was permanently leased to Mr Shvidler and fell under UK sanctions. Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions? Mr Shvidler himself has not been personally sanctioned by the UK at any stage. The UK and other western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. New trade sanctions have also been introduced banning UK exports of aviation or space-related technology to Russia. Other measures introduced by the UK include: Excluding major Russian banks from the UK financial system and freezing the assets of all Russian banks Putting a 35% tax on certain imports from Russia, including vodka Imposing sanctions - including travel bans and asset freezes - against oligarchs considered close to the Kremlin Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?
