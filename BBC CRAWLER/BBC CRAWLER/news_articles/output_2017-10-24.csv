Second Republican senator blasts Trump,"This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake announces his retirement A US Republican senator says he will not seek re-election, delivering a fierce attack on President Donald Trump. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said ""reckless, outrageous and undignified behaviour"" at the top of the US government was dangerous to democracy. Mr Trump has previously called Mr Flake ""toxic"". The US president is already embroiled in a row with another Republican Senator, Bob Corker. Before confirming his decision in a speech to the Senate, Mr Flake told the Arizona Republic newspaper ""there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party"". Taking to the floor, he said he did not enjoy criticising the president but felt it was ""a matter of duty and conscience"". This video can not be played A protester threw Russian flags at Donald Trump as he headed for a meeting with Republicans ""We must never regard as 'normal' the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals,"" he said. He lamented the ""flagrant disregard for truth or decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons"". Battle rages for soul of Republicanism Four ways Bob Corker skewered Donald Trump Soldier's family picks up Trump cheque ""I have children and grandchildren to answer to, and so, Mr President, I will not be complicit,"" he added. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said it was ""probably a good move"" Mr Flake was standing down, suggesting he would not win re-election. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Jeff Flake was facing an uphill battle in his re-election campaign next year. It wasn't because the incumbent senator was matched up against a particularly tough Democrat, but rather because the Republican Party had shifted under his feet. He found himself at odds with Donald Trump and the populist, nationalist movement that swept the president to power - and facing a right-wing challenger backed by Mr Trump's former adviser and campaign guru, Steve Bannon. So with poll numbers indicating he very well might be unceremoniously dumped from office, Mr Flake decided to go out on his own terms. It's become almost a clichÃ© at this point that a Republican Trump critic only finds his voice once his political career is at or near an end. Mr Flake's situation is different. His career is at an end not by his choice, but by forces outside his control. He's been an outspoken Trump critic, and soon he will be out of a job. Another prominent party critic of Mr Trump, John McCain, was quick to pay tribute to Mr Flake. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said he had ""witnessed a speech from a very fine man"". Mr Flake has long been a vocal opponent of Mr Trump, refusing to endorse him during the presidential campaign. Although he largely voted in line with the party, his comparatively moderate views and critiques of the direction of the Republicans under Mr Trump have left him out of kilter with voters who made Mr Trump president. For his part, Donald Trump has long wanted to oust Mr Flake, even offering to spend millions of his own money to see him unseated in primaries. This video can not be played Lashing out: What Bob Corker really thinks of President Trump In a series of television interviews earlier in the day, Mr Corker accused the president of lying, adding that he had debased the US and weakened its global standing. Mr Trump fired back on Twitter, calling the Tennessee senator a ""lightweight"" who ""couldn't get re-elected"". Mr Corker is also not seeking another term in elections next year. The feud overshadowed efforts by Mr Trump to build support for his proposed tax cuts. He met Republican senators for a lunch time meeting. Russian flags thrown at Trump.

How to 'deep clean' your online activity,"Jared O'Mara made degrading jokes about pop stars Jared O'Mara is not the first person to have old comments he posted online come back to haunt him. The Labour MP resigned from the Women and Equalities Committeeafter misogynistic remarks and degrading jokes he posted more than 10 years ago resurfaced. The scandal raises the question: what steps can you take to avoid old online posts - that may no longer reflect your point of view - coming back to haunt you? But first a warning!Trying to hide your online history could draw more attention to it, than just leaving it alone - and an attempted cover-up could be a bigger scandal than the original posts. A good place to start is typing your name into a search engine and seeing what comes back. You may need to do a deep dive, several pages into the results to find old material you had forgotten was online. The easiest way to remove embarrassing posts from the past is to log in to the website you posted them on, and delete them at the source if possible. Check old message boards you used to frequent to make sure you did not leave any regrettable posts online. Your username may not have been your real name, but people may still associate it with you. Message boards often let you search for all the posts made by your account, allowing you to remove or edit anything you no longer want online. You could also run a web search on your old message board usernames to check you have not missed anything. Remember Myspace? Former Faceparty fan? Gone from Gaydar? What lurks on your Myspace account? The three networks - and several others - suffered a great exodus when newer social websites arrived. But did you deactivate your old account, or leave it to fester unattended? Old social network profiles can be a treasure trove of embarrassing photos and regrettable stories. It might be time to log in and erase any profiles you no longer use. Many comments sections on news websites are powered by bigger social networks such as Facebook and Disqus. If you had used your real name on these sites, you could change your name and photo on the associated accounts so that old embarrassing posts are instead attributed to a pseudonym. However, this does breach the terms and conditions of some social networks. EU citizens can ask search engines to remove results connected to their name, if they are judged to be irrelevant or outdated. This means news stories, old social media posts and blogs can be hidden from search results, making them less likely to resurface. Controversially, the right to be forgotten has been used by criminals and people involved in public scandals to hide news reports featuring their name, on the grounds that they are ""outdated"".  Critics say people are able to censor search results in this way. But the EU ruling stands, and soGoogle,external,Bing,externaland other search engines let citizens request the removal of certain results. As the ruling only applies to the EU, the ""hidden"" results may still appear for people using the search engine outside the EU. The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will give people more control over the data they have shared online. Under the new rules, people will have the right to order websites and social networks to delete embarrassing old posts. New laws will give greater control to citizens However, in some cases the websites will be allowed to reject the requests - for example, if a post was of scientific or historical importance. Despite Brexit, the UK is adopting the GDPR in its own Data Protection Bill.  It will come into force in May 2018. Some social networks make it difficult for you to permanently delete your account, encouraging you to temporarily deactivate it instead. Facebook,externaldoes provide a page where you can request a permanent account deletion, whileTwitter,external's standard deactivation procedure deletes an account after 30 days. Deleting an account on Facebook and Twitter makes public posts disappear - but copies may still appear in search engine results. Often the material shared in private messages is more sensitive than what we post publicly. It is always a good idea to protect online accounts with a strong, unique password. If a website offers it, enable two-factor or two-step verification, which makes it harder for anybody to get into your account without permission, because they need both your password and your mobile phone. Nothing you share on the internet is truly private, and once something is out there on the worldwide web, it can be very difficult to cover it up again. Several sites scrape social networks such as Twitter and Facebook and archive the posts they find - while the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine does a similar thing for websites including message boards and blogs. So to be safe, try not to post embarrassing content online in the first place.

Geordie Shore star broke Snapchat ad rules,"Two images uploaded in June should have been identified as ads Two Snapchat posts by the reality TV star Marnie Simpson have fallen foul of the UK's advertising rules. The Geordie Shore and Celebrity Big Brother cast member uploaded images of products from two firms that she has business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts. This was judged to be a breach of the rules against ""hidden"" advertising on social media. It is the first case of its kind to have involved Snapchat. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) normally deals with such matters by ordering offending posts to be deleted or amended. But since Snapchat Story posts automatically self-delete 24 hours after being added, Ms Simpson has not been ordered to take any action. The two companies involved, however, have agreed to ensure the hashtag #ad appears alongside adverts they produce in the future. This video can not be played ASA chief Guy Parker: 'Rules apply equally to Snapchat' Ms Simpson could not be reached for comment. The 25-year-old has been a ""brand ambassador"" for tooth polish-maker Diamond Whites for nearly two years, while her management agency, Unleashed PR, began selling a range of coloured cosmetic contact lenses marketed as being ""iSpyEyes by Marnie Simpson"" earlier this year. On 20 June, Ms Simpson uploaded two images. The first showed her posing with a Diamond Whites case with the text ""50% of [sic] everything"" superimposed, and a link to the company's site. The second featured the celebrity wearing a grey lens on one of her eyes, with the words ""mrs grey coming soon"" placed alongside her. In both cases an unidentified individual contacted the ASA to complain the images had not been identified as ads. Marnie Simpson was a Miss Newcastle finalist before joining MTV's Geordie Shore Diamond Whites tried to defend the promotion featuring its product on the grounds that Ms Simpson's followers would already be aware of her commercial relationship with the firm. But the watchdog did not accept that this would be known by everyone who saw the image. Unleashed PR suggested that in its case the wording featured was so vague that consumers would not know what product was being advertised or where to buy it. But the ASA said its code still required marketing promotions to be flagged as such. ""These might be our first Snapchat rulings, but the principle behind them is as old as the hills - ads, wherever they appear, must be obviously identifiable as ads,"" the authority's chief executive Guy Parker told the BBC. ""It's just not fair to expect people to play the detective, to work out the status of a tweet, post or story."" Other recent cases where the advertising watchdog has intervened: a post by the make-up blogger Sheikhbeauty on Instagrampromoting Flat Tummy Tea,externalthat did not make clear she was being paid by the drinks company a tweet by the TV presenter AJ Odudu that featured aphoto of an Alpro dessert,externalwith text describing it as one of her favourite snacks, but without any acknowledgement that she was being paid to promote it on social media a video uploaded by Made In Chelsea TV star Millie Mackintoshadvertising a Britvic drink,externalthat used #sp - referring to ""sponsored post"" - to identify its nature. The ASA said it did not think consumers would realise what the hashtag referred to The ASA does not have the power to impose fines itself, but can refer repeat offenders - whether they are brands or the celebrities endorsing them - to Trading Standards to take further action. However, it hopes that the negative publicity that arises from its interventions acts as deterrent enough. Even so,the ASA acknowledged earlier this month,externalthat an increasing amount of its time was being taken up policing ""influencer marketing"". And it urged marketers to put monitoring systems in place so that they themselves could spot and fix instances where celebrities had failed to use the #ad label. Marketers tend to be secretive about how much they pay specific influencers to promote their clients. But PMYB - a Nottingham-based agency that works with more than 10,000 influencers - told the BBC that campaigns could range from Â£5,000 to hundreds of thousands of pounds. It said that personalities that could deliver a YouTube audience had traditionally been able to charge the most - in part because people are likely to spend longer watching a video than reading a tweet - but Instagram fashionistas were also among the top earners. Managing director Rohan Midha added that the agency had been involved in a ""surprisingly low number"" of campaigns on Snapchat to date, and that when it was used it was typically in addition to other social networks. Although TV stars might seem an obvious pick, they can often be very expensive to employ because their agents inflate their prices. San Francisco-based Captiv8 - which has developed software to match brands with relevant ambassadors - suggests ""micro-influencers"" often have more impact. In other words, a financial tech specialist with tens of thousands of followers might be more valuable to a bank than a generalist with hundreds of thousands. Even so, reach still plays a role in calculating an influencer's worth. Last year, Captiv8 estimated that personalities with more than seven million followerscould charge on average,external: $300,000 (Â£227,000) for a YouTube video $187,500 for a Facebook post $150,000 for an Instagram photo $150,000 for a Snapchat story $60,000 for a Twitter post 'Remove gambling ads appealing to children' Jaguar ad 'encouraged unsafe driving' Broadband ads 'mislead and must change' ASA PMYB Captiv8 At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Man in 100-balloons camping chair flight,"This video can not be played Tom Morgan described the flight as ""magical"" A British adventurer has flown 25km (15.5 miles) across South Africa suspended from 100 helium balloons. Tom Morgan, from Bristol, reached heights of 8,000ft (2,438m) while strapped to a camping chair, in scenes reminiscent of the Pixar smash Up. The 38-year-old spent two days inflating balloons ahead of the flight, which he described as ""magical"". The challenge moved to South Africa on Friday after several failed attempts in Botswana. ""The problem was finding a good weather window and it was difficult to protect the balloons as they kept bursting,"" Mr Morgan said. With just enough helium left for one more attempt, the adventurer and his team moved their base to just north of Johannesburg. Mr Morgan took two days to blow up the balloons Describing the experience as ""unbelievably cool"", Mr Morgan also admitted feeling ""somewhere between terrified and elated"" as he rose in the air. As the balloons drifted towards the inversion layer of the atmosphere - where the temperature rises - he said the flight started to accelerate very quickly. ""I had to keep my cool and start gradually cutting the balloons."" The flight had originally been due to take place in Botswana Mr Morgan, who has lived in Bristol for 15 years and runs an adventure company, wants to eventually set up a competitive helium balloon race in Africa. ""We will have to avoid areas with lots of spiky bushes though,"" Mr Morgan said.

'Half of women' sexually harassed at work,"This video can not be played Emily Warburton-Adams (r) tells of being harassed and Zoe Strimpel on #MeToo Half of British women and a fifth of men have been sexually harassed at work or a place of study, a BBC survey says. Of the women who said they had been harassed, 63% said they didn't report it to anyone, and 79% of the male victims kept it to themselves. The ComRes poll for BBC Radio 5 live spoke to more than 2,000 people. The survey was commissioned aftersexual assault claims against Harvey Weinsteinresulted in widespread sharing of sexual harassment stories. Women and men who have been sexually harassed have beenrevealing their experiences on social media using the hashtag ""me too""to show the magnitude of the problem worldwide. That followed allegations, including rape and sexual assault, against Mr Weinstein from more than two dozen women - among them actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan. The Hollywood producer insists sexual relations he had were consensual. Are you being sexually harassed at work? When does flirting become sexual harassment? Why I chose #MeToo for my sexism experiment The Radio 5 live survey, of 2,031 British adults, found that 37% of all those asked - 53% of women and 20% of men - said they had experienced sexual harassment, ranging from inappropriate comments to actual sexual assaults, at work or a place of study. More than a quarter of people surveyed had suffered harassment in the form of inappropriate jokes or ""banter"" and nearly one in seven had suffered inappropriate touching. Of those who had been harassed, 5 live's survey suggests one in 10 women had been sexually assaulted. More women than men were targeted by a boss or senior manager - 30% compared with 12% - and one in 10 women who had experienced harassment said it led to them leaving their job or place of study. Sarah was assaulted by a teacher and a professor during her education Sarah Killcoyne, from Cambridge, told BBC News she was sexually assaulted when she was still in education by two different men - a school teacher when she was a teenager and later by a college professor. She said: ""I would very much like to see the people around the predators - we know there's only a few of them - to stop enabling them."" One man, who did not want to be identified, said he had been harassed by his female boss. He said: âShe made constant comments about my appearance and how I dressed - comments asking about my hairy chest and what I liked in a woman. ""[It was] all laughed off by other mainly female office staff, but it left me feeling dirty and uncomfortable. ""I ended up with depression and confidence issues and had time off with anxiety as a result.â Since the allegations about Mr Weinstein surfaced, many high profile names have used social media to highlight the problem of sexual assault, some also detailing the harassment they have endured. Jess Phillips and Mary Creagh were among the MPs to reveal their accounts as they wanted to encourage victims of abuse to speak out. Labour's Ms Phillips told the London Evening Standard,externalhow she had been left ""paralysed by fear"" when she woke up at a party to find her boss undoing her belt and trying to get into her trousers. Fellow Labour MP Ms Creagh said she was just seven when she was sexually assaulted by about 12 boys during a school playground game of kiss-chase. The results of the BBC survey followresearch published last year by the TUCwhich also suggested more than half of women say they have been sexually harassed at work - and most had not reported it. People often fail to report sexual harassment for a range of reasons, Manuela Barreto , the University of Exeter's professor of social and organisational psychology, told the BBC. They might feel the harassment took place in a ""subtle"" way, or was couched in humour. When one case is exposed in the media, however, those effects change. ""It facilitates understanding, and therefore detection, of what qualifies as sexual harassment,"" she says. ""It gives the message that it's a serious matter and that there are many out there who support the perception that this is a problem."" Activist Tarana Burke is the founder of the original Me Too campaign - launched 10 years ago in the United States to provide ""empowerment through empathy"" to survivors of sexual abuse, assault, exploitation, and harassment in underprivileged communities. She told 5 Live she feels there is now momentum behind a genuine change in the way sexual harassment is handled. ""From what I'm seeing and hearing, and from the groundswell of support for this, it doesn't feel like it's stopping,"" she said. ""My ultimate goal is to make sure this is not just a moment, that this is a movement, and we will continue to raise our voices, we will continue to disrupt, we will continue to tell our stories until we are heard and until we move the needle.""

Einstein theory of happiness sold for $1.5m,"The two notes sold for $1.56m and $240,000 - way higher than their estimates A note written by Albert Einstein containing advice on happy living has sold at an auction house in Jerusalem for $1.56m (Â£1.19m). Einstein gave the note to a courier in Tokyo in 1922 instead of a tip. He had just heard that he had won the coveted Nobel prize for physics and told the messenger that, if he was lucky, the notes would become valuable. Einstein suggested in the note that achieving a long-dreamt goal did not necessarily guarantee happiness. The German-born physicist had won the Nobel and was in Japan on a lecture tour. When the courier came to his room to make a delivery, he did not have any money to reward him. Einstein (seen here in 1950) wrote the hotel notes shortly after winning the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics Instead, he handed the messenger a signed note - using stationery of the Imperial Hotel Tokyo - with one sentence, written in German: ""A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it."" Einstein's quirky habits The strange afterlife of Einstein's brain Albert Einstein: the man who predicted gravitational waves A second note written at the same time simply reads: ""Where there's a will, there's a way."" It sold for $240,000, Winner's auction house said. The winning bids for both notes were far higher than the pre-auction estimated price, the auctioneers said. It said the buyer of one of the notes was a European who wished to remain anonymous. The seller is reported to be the nephew of the messenger.

Current account switching at new low,"The number of people switching their current account to another provider has fallen to a new low, according to industry figures. Just 57,779 used the seven day switching service to move accounts in September, the lowest number since the scheme was launched four years ago. The drop came in spite of an advertising campaign during the month, designed to raise awareness. Adverts were placed on TV, radio, in national newspapers and online. The reluctance to move also comes in spite of the potential savings on offer, and financial incentives being offered by the banks. The Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks are currently offering account holders Â£250, for example, while HSBC is offering Â£200 if people move and stay loyal for a year. The number of people switching in September was half the number it was in March last year, when 120,774 moved account. Advertising campaigns have consistently failed to persuade people to switch BACS - which runs the Current Account Switching Service - already promised to improve the scheme in January this year. It told the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that it would extend the period in which money is redirected from a customer's old account to the new one. The idea was to give consumers extra confidence that their money would not go astray. But account holders do not appear to have been convinced that switching is worthwhile. Reality Check: Can you really save Â£92 a year by switching account? That is despite the fact that, after a two-year inquiry, the CMA said consumers could save up to Â£92 a year if they moved their account. The news will also be a blow to the Treasury, which originally said it would rely on the scheme to improve competition in the banking sector. BACS said that over four million customers had moved their accounts since 2013. The banks that are gaining the most account-holders are Nationwide, TSB and HSBC. The ones losing the most are Barclays, Clydesdale and NatWest. In all, 40 UK banks and building societies offer the seven-day guarantee Apply to a new bank: it will do the rest Choose a date to switch All direct debits, standing orders and payments in and out will be transferred Further payments to the old account will be forwarded to the new one Joint account holders need permission of both parties Overdrafts can be transferred only if the new bank agrees Further detailscan be found here,external The Current Account Switch Service - your guarantee to a successful switch Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

'Superpipe' broken by Storm Brian,"Storm Ophelia and then Storm Brian broke the super pipe during the bad weather A two-mile ""superpipe"" being installed to improve Blackpool's bathing waters has been broken by Storm Brian. United Utilities confirmed that a 250-metre section of the pipe had been ""bent at a 90-degree angle"" after gale-force winds hit the UK coast on Monday. The water company said a new section has been ordered from a factory in Norway. The 20,000-tonne pipe is part of the firm's Â£200m plan to improve water quality in the Lancashire resort. The pipe was first damaged byex-Hurricane Ophelialast week that hit Ireland and the west coast. A United Utilities spokesman said the pipe ""almost snapped"" as a result of the storm damage. ""We wanted to send out boats to repair the damage but we were advised it was not safe enough."" The super pipe being installed Adding: ""It's been bent at a 90-degree angle and will need replacing. ""We have ordered a new section but the Norway factory is the only place in the world that makes a pipe this big."" The massive outfall pipe arrived at Anchorsholme near Blackpool on 9 August after being towed in six sections from Norway to Lough Foyle in Northern Ireland. It was then assembled into one long pipe ready to be installed in a huge trench under the sea. It will be used during periods of heavy rain to pump storm water away from the sewer network. Storm Brian nearly snapped the last portion of the pipe miles out at sea The aim is to prevent flooding and ensure the water mixes far out into the sea helping to protect bathing waters. Work on the pipe is expected to finish in 2019.

Labour investigates MP Jared O'Mara,"Labour says it is investigating allegations about the ""comments and behaviour"" of its MP Jared O'Mara. Mr O'Mara has already apologised for homophobic and misogynistic remarks he made online in 2002 and 2004 and quit the Commons equalities committee. But he denies subsequent allegations of offensive language to a constituent in March this year. Labour said it was investigating the more recent claims, which were made on BBC Two's Daily Politics. ""The party is investigating Jared O'Mara MP in relation to comments and behaviour which have been reported from earlier this year,"" it said. Sophie Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics she had met Mr O'Mara on a dating app and there had been ""no hard feelings"" when things didn't work out between them. But in an incident in March 2017 Mr O'Mara, who was DJing in a nightclub, made comments to her that ""aren't broadcastable"" and called her an ""ugly bitch"", she said. Mr O'Mara, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, said this was ""categorically untrue"". Rival parties have attempted to put pressure on the Labour leadership over Mr O'Mara, who unseated ex-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in June's general election. In a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Justine Greening, the Education Secretary and Equalities Minister, asked how Mr O'Mara had been selected as a candidate. ""Violent, sexist and homophobic language must have no place in our society, and parliamentarians of all parties have a duty to stamp out this sort of behaviour wherever we encounter it, and condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" she wrote. ""It is time you step forward, as leader of the Labour Party, and send a message that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called for Mr O'Mara to have the whip removed and urged Labour to review its general election selection process. Mr O'Mara's apology came after online posts from 2004 were published by the Guido Fawkes website. In them, he claimed singer Michelle McManus only won Pop Idol ""because she was fat"" and said it would be funny if jazz star Jamie Cullum was ""sodomised with his own piano"". More comments, involving homophobic language, then emerged dating back to 2002. This video can not be played Sophie Evans on Jared O'Mara comments: ""I just thought wow, he is not a very nice man"" Mr O'Mara apologised to Labour MPs for these remarks at a meeting at Westminster on Monday evening. His speech, which was described by sources as ""emotional"" and ""heartfelt,"" was met with applause by Labour MPs. He then told online magazine Huck he had been ""through a journey of education"". He added: ""I've stood down from the Women and Equalities select committee too - I think it's the right thing to do. I don't think I can continue on that committee when I feel so deeply ashamed of the man I was 15 years ago."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""He has apologised for what we knew yesterday. He issued a profuse apology. ""Any language like that we know is unacceptable and I'm hoping he will apologise for that.""

'HIV hairdresser told victim 'I'm riddled'',"Daryll Rowe met his partners on dating app Grindr, jurors at Lewes Crown Court were told A hairdresser accused of deliberately infecting other men with HIV told one victim he was ""riddled"" with the virus after they had sex, a court heard. Daryll Rowe, 26, denies infecting five Brighton-based men, and attempting to infect a further five. Giving evidence at Lewes Crown Court, a 22-year-old student said he met Mr Rowe via a dating app in January 2016. He said he started ""freaking out"" when he found a broken condom in the bathroom after they had sex. In a video recording of a police interview shown to the jury, the man said he was in pain after having sex with Mr Rowe and was later given anti-viral drugs to prevent him contracting HIV as well as treatment for genital herpes. During the interview, the man said: ""I remember not really enjoying it. There were moments when I was like, I want to get up and go. ""Afterwards I went to the toilet and the condom was on the sink and I noticed that it... was completely broken. Like the whole top of it was off."" A series of text messages read to the court, the university student repeatedly asked Mr Rowe whether he had HIV. In response Mr Rowe is alleged to have said: ""Yes, I'm riddled by the way"". Later, Mr Rowe branded the man a ""paranoid, overdramatic fool"", before saying he would be blocking the number, the court heard. The student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, contacted police after seeing a witness appeal for information about a man he thought was Mr Rowe.

Ex-UKIP donor in by-election expenses row,"Nigel Farage (right), then leader of UKIP, at a press conference with Arron Banks in October 2014 Ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks paid for 20 of his employees to ferry party voters to the polls at the Rochester 2014 by-election, BBC Newsnight understands. The expenditure was not registered by UKIP, which could breach electoral law. UKIP's victory in Rochester ensured the party received more coverage by the BBC and other broadcasters the following year, at the 2015 general election. Mr Banks denies any wrongdoing and said all expenditure at the by-election was expensed in full and notified to UKIP. Mr Banks is the bad boy of Brexit, a car insurance mogul and a failed sexual potency pill entrepreneur - but far from hiding his naughtiness, he flaunts it. Hollywood is thinking about making a TV drama series about him. One thing he hasn't flaunted though is paying for around 20 of his car insurance salespeople to help bring out the vote for UKIP in the Rochester by-election in 2014. Conservative defector Mark Reckless won the by-election for UKIP, meaning that at the 2015 general election, broadcasters - including the BBC - gave UKIP a bigger platform than before. Newsnight's evidence suggests that at least some of the political energy running up to Brexit appears to have been paid for unlawfully. Mark Reckless campaigning in Rochester ahead of the 2014 by-election poll In his ghost-written book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks tells how when the polls closed in Rochester ""I put Â£7,000 behind the bar and soon the place was heaving"". But his book did not mention that about 20 car insurance salespeople employed by Mr Banks at Catbrain Lane, Bristol - the hub of his Eldon vehicle insurance empire - were paid to travel to Rochester, in Kent. They then drove elderly UKIP voters to the polls, before staying the night at a Premier Inn and making the return journey the following day. One ex-employee of Mr Banks' brokerage, Eldon, whose brands include Go Skippy car insurance and Footprint van insurance, told Newsnight: ""I was paid to do my job."" He said: ""I wasn't specifically paid for doing that [ferrying voters to the polls], but I wasn't deducted any pay for being out of the office. ""I got there early in the morning, whole day there, went out in the evening."" One estimate for taxi services by 15 drivers for a day in Rochester is Â£9,000 - a figure which would have put UKIP above the legal spending limit. Any election expense should be registered by the candidate and his or her agent to the returning officer, but not a penny of these expenses was. Mr Reckless told Newsnight: ""Neither I nor my agent authorised spending except as was appropriately declared."" Mr Banks told us all expenditure incurred during the by-election was properly expensed in full and notified to UKIP at the time. But the party's ""record-keeping"", he said, left something to be desired. Newsnight asked Gavin Millar QC, an expert in election law, whether this was lawful. He said: ""It's only lawful if you stay within the regulated procedures for spending money for the purposes of the election of a candidate. ""If you go outside of them, it's unlawful."" But if Mr Banks did not have the authority to spend what he did - what does that mean for him? Mr Millar said: ""It was unlawful on the part of the third party who organised the concerted assistance; Mr Banks in this case. ""If they did it and incurred those costs without the authority of the agent, as it appears they may have done, that's called an illegal practice and it's a criminal offence."" What happened in Rochester appears to be similar to bigger troubles the Conservative Party has had with unregistered election expenses. It is very unlikely that any action will be taken against UKIP, Mr Reckless, his agent or Mr Banks because a criminal investigation must start within a year of any possible offence. And the story may yet have political ramifications. A few months before the Rochester by-election in 2014, Mr Banks made one of the biggest political donations in British political history. He donated Â£1m to UKIP in a press conference outside his Old Down mansion, near Bristol. Handsome backdrop though it is, he does not live there - but in a smaller farmhouse down the lane, bought for Â£890,000 in 2013 and with Â£500,000 outstanding on the mortgage. He hopes to float the Eldon group for Â£250m - a valuation that got him on the Sunday Times Rich List. Mr Banks claims his Eldon group will make Â£24m profit this year, up from only Â£300,000 last year. He says new AI - artificial intelligence - technology is giving Eldon a boost. Arif Khurshed, professor of finance at Manchester Business School, said: ""With a group turnover of Â£47m and an operating profit of Â£300,000, an IPO of this size looks highly ambitious."" There's been trouble with Eldon's numbers in the past. In 2013, its auditors, Baker Tilly, resigned, stating ""a breakdown in the relationship has occurred because, by failing to supply accurate information, management is imposing a limitation of scope on our work."" Mr Banks says the auditors resigned because of a conflict of interest. Some of his other businesses have hit choppy waters. Mr Banks was, until this month, managing director of African Compass Trading, which sold the Star 150 sexual enhancement pill, a kind of herbal Viagra. Its slogan was ""naturally, every man wants to be a superman in the bedroom."" The MHRA, the medicines regulator, said that in 2014, as part of a criminal investigation, it seized Star 150 pills worth around Â£50,000 from an address in Bristol. They told us their investigation is closed and, to the best of Newsnight's knowledge, it has not resulted in any criminal charges. Mr Banks told us he did invest Â£100,000 in the business but that operations were discontinued within a year due to ""stiff competition"". Entirely in keeping with his image, Mr Banks provided a fiery response to Newsnight: ""Since the referendum result and my support for Donald Trump, I have been the subject of politically-motivated attacks by the 'mainstream media' and Remain-supporting institutions. ""It comes as no surprise that Newsnight would join the party at this late stage with their own particular type of trashy 'News of the World' journalism."" He concluded that after allegations by some of him being a ""Russian spyâ¦ part of a worldwide conspiracy to subvert democracyâ¦ the only surprise is how long it's taken Newsnight to have a pop at me! ""BBC Fake news is alive and well!"" The Bad Boy of Brexit airs on Newsnight at 22.30 on BBC Two.

Parachute trial accused 'caused gas leak',"The prosecution claims Emile Cilliers wanted to kill his wife and start a new life with his lover An Army fitness instructor accused of attempting to murder his wife caused a gas leak at their home by loosening a nut on a valve, a court heard. Emile Cilliers, 37, is accused of trying to kill Victoria Cilliers, 40, by sabotaging her parachute. He also faces a second attempted murder charge and a third charge of tampering with a gas fitting at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 30 March 2015. Mr Cilliers has denied the charges at his trial at Winchester Crown Court. Victoria Cilliers suffered multiple injuries in a 4,000ft fall at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, in April 2015. Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, a sergeant with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of her main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before she jumped. Police evidence showed the kitchen cupboard where the gas leak occurred (large arrow) He is also accused of damaging a gas valve at their home a few days earlier. The court heard Mrs Cilliers reported smelling gas after her husband had spent the previous night at his barracks because he said he wanted to avoid Monday morning traffic. Jurors were told an engineer called to check the leak found a loose nut on a gas isolation valve in a cupboard next to the oven. Dried blood was also found on the pipe, which the court has heard matched that of Mr Cilliers. They were shown a set of pliers which prosecutors claim were used to loosen the nut. Emile Cillers said he used the pliers to tighten it but had been unable to do so because it was too tight. The jury was shown the pliers found in Mr Cilliers' home, allegedly used to tamper with the gas valve Forensic scientist Mark Kearsley said the markings from the pliers had been used in a ""loosening and not tightening motion"". He said: ""The nut must have been in a tightened position to lead to the impression we had, if the nut was loose it would just have turned with the tool."" Gas engineer Michael Osborne said he was called to the Cilliers' home on 30 March to make the gas leak safe. He said it was not unusual to find such a leak and explained that as well as a tool, the nut could have become loosened or ""relaxed"" by repeated changes in temperature or by being knocked by food tins being placed in the cupboard. Mr Cilliers denies all three charges and the trial continues.

New ransomware strikes Ukraine and Russia,"Two other ransomware outbreaks have made headlines this year - WannaCry and Petya A new strain ofransomwarenicknamed ""Bad Rabbit"" has been found spreading in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere. The malware has affected systems at three Russian websites, an airport in Ukraine and an underground railway in the capital city, Kiev. The cyber-police chief in Ukraine confirmed to the Reuters news agency that Bad Rabbit was the ransomware in question. It bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks earlier this year. However, it is not yet known how far this new malware will be able to spread. ""In some of the companies, the work has been completely paralysed - servers and workstations are encrypted,"" head of Russian cyber-security firm Group-IB, Ilya Sachkov, told the TASS news agency. Two of the affected sites are Interfax and Fontanka.ru. Meanwhile, US officials said they had ""received multiple reports of Bad Rabbit ransomware infections in many countries around the world"". The US computer emergency readiness team said it ""discourages individuals and organisations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored"". Who was affected? By Ksenia Idrisova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina, BBC Monitoring Initial news reports mentioned Russian media websites, such as St Petersburg-based Fontanka.ru, as well as an airport in Ukraine's Odessa and a subway system in Kiev. Privately-owned Russian news agency Interfax was hit particularly hard, to the extent that 24 hours later its website still displayed a message reading ""our service is temporary unavailable"". On the morning of 25 October, it transpired that Russian banks had also been targeted but, luckily, were not compromised. The Russian Central Bank said in a statement that it had recorded a BadRabbit attack on Russian financial institutions, but that none of them had been compromised, as reported by RNS news agency on 25 October. Otkrytiye, formerly Russia's biggest privately-owned bank, was one of the Russian financial institutions that repelled the attack, according to RNS. Prominent Russian IT security firm Group-IB reported that BadRabbit had targeted several of the top 20 Russian banks but failed to penetrate their networks. ""According to our data, most of the victims targeted by these attacks are located in Russia,"" said Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky at Kaspersky Lab. ""We have also seen similar but fewer attacks in Ukraine, Turkey and Germany."" Bad Rabbit encrypts the contents of a computer and asks for a payment - in this case 0.05 bitcoins, or about $280 (Â£213). Cyber-security firms, including Russia-based Kaspersky, have said they are monitoring the attack. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The malware is still undetected by the majority of anti-virus programs,according to analysis by virus checking site Virus Total,external. One security firm, Eset, has said that the malware wasdistributed via a bogus,externalAdobe Flash update. Researcher Kevin Beaumont hasposted a screenshot,externalthat shows Bad Rabbit creating tasks in Windows named after the dragons Drogon and Rhaegal in TV series Game of Thrones.

UK's most influential black person named,"This video can not be played Why has Gina Miller been named as the countryâs most influential black person? Businesswoman Gina Miller has been named as Britain's most influential black person. The 52-year-old led the successful Brexit legal challenge which ruled parliament had to vote on whether Theresa May could trigger Article 50. Ms Miller topped the 2018 Powerlist of 100 people, which recognises those of African and African Caribbean heritage. British Vogue editor Edward Enninful and grime artist Stormzy have also been included in this year's list. Those named were decided by an independent panel - including former High Court judge Dame Linda Dobbs and former Apprentice winner Tim Campbell. They rated nominees on their ""ability to change lives and alter events"". Previous number ones in the Powerlist include former children's laureate Malorie Blackman, philanthropist Mo Ibrahim, architect David Adjaye and Baronesses Scotland and Amos. Nearly half of the list for 2018 were women - headed by Ms Miller, the founder of wealth management company SCM. She came to prominence in the past year when she argued that starting talks to leave the EU without a parliamentary vote was ""undemocratic"" because it involved a change in law. Boxer Anthony Joshua, film director Amma Asante, TV presenter Ade Adepitan, and lawyer Grace Ononiwu (pictured clockwise from top left) are recognised in the list In January, the Supreme Court upheld her challengeruling Prime Minister Theresa May could not start the process of leaving the EU until MPs and peers gave their backing. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019. After the ruling, Ms Miller said she had received death threats and ""offensive, racist and hateful"" abuse. On receiving her title, she said: ""It's amazing to get an accolade when what I've done has solicited a huge amount of abuse. ""To have somebody acknowledge me is extraordinarily kind and counters a lot of what I still get on a daily basis.""

He added: ""Gina was a shoo-in this year for number one, Brexit is the most important political event to happen this century.

Republican quits with attack on Trump,"This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake announces his retirement A US Republican senator says he will not seek re-election, delivering a fierce attack on President Donald Trump. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said ""reckless, outrageous and undignified behaviour"" at the top of the US government was dangerous to democracy. Mr Trump has previously called Mr Flake ""toxic"". The US president is already embroiled in a row with another Republican Senator, Bob Corker. Before confirming his decision in a speech to the Senate, Mr Flake told the Arizona Republic newspaper ""there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party"". Taking to the floor, he said he did not enjoy criticising the president but felt it was ""a matter of duty and conscience"". This video can not be played A protester threw Russian flags at Donald Trump as he headed for a meeting with Republicans ""We must never regard as 'normal' the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals,"" he said. He lamented the ""flagrant disregard for truth or decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons"". Battle rages for soul of Republicanism Four ways Bob Corker skewered Donald Trump Soldier's family picks up Trump cheque ""I have children and grandchildren to answer to, and so, Mr President, I will not be complicit,"" he added. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said it was ""probably a good move"" Mr Flake was standing down, suggesting he would not win re-election. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Jeff Flake was facing an uphill battle in his re-election campaign next year. It wasn't because the incumbent senator was matched up against a particularly tough Democrat, but rather because the Republican Party had shifted under his feet. He found himself at odds with Donald Trump and the populist, nationalist movement that swept the president to power - and facing a right-wing challenger backed by Mr Trump's former adviser and campaign guru, Steve Bannon. So with poll numbers indicating he very well might be unceremoniously dumped from office, Mr Flake decided to go out on his own terms. It's become almost a clichÃ© at this point that a Republican Trump critic only finds his voice once his political career is at or near an end. Mr Flake's situation is different. His career is at an end not by his choice, but by forces outside his control. He's been an outspoken Trump critic, and soon he will be out of a job. Another prominent party critic of Mr Trump, John McCain, was quick to pay tribute to Mr Flake. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said he had ""witnessed a speech from a very fine man"". Mr Flake has long been a vocal opponent of Mr Trump, refusing to endorse him during the presidential campaign. Although he largely voted in line with the party, his comparatively moderate views and critiques of the direction of the Republicans under Mr Trump have left him out of kilter with voters who made Mr Trump president. For his part, Donald Trump has long wanted to oust Mr Flake, even offering to spend millions of his own money to see him unseated in primaries. This video can not be played Lashing out: What Bob Corker really thinks of President Trump In a series of television interviews earlier in the day, Mr Corker accused the president of lying, adding that he had debased the US and weakened its global standing. Mr Trump fired back on Twitter, calling the Tennessee senator a ""lightweight"" who ""couldn't get re-elected"". Mr Corker is also not seeking another term in elections next year.

Anger over Tory MP's Brexit 'hit list',"Chris Heaton-Harris is facing calls to explain why he wanted the information A Eurosceptic Tory MP has been accused of compiling a ""hit list"" of university professors who teach Brexit courses. Downing Street has distanced itself from government whip Chris Heaton-Harris, who wrote to universities asking for the names of professors. Lecturers reacted with fury to the letter, calling it a ""sinister"" attempt to censor them and accusing him of conducting a ""McCarthyite"" witch hunt. Mr Heaton-Harris said he believed in ""open"" debate on Brexit. The government whip tweeted: ""To be absolutely clear, I believe in free speech in our universities and in having an open and vigorous debate on Brexit."" Mr Heaton-Harris is a member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Conservative MPs. Labour accused the MP of seeking to draw up ""what looks like a register of Brexit heretics"" and branded the government response to it a ""shambles"". The Liberal Democrats said the letter was ""chilling"" and that Mr Heaton-Harris should stand down from the government, adding that ministers should reassure universities that they were not expected to comply with his demands. The letter has been sent to universities across the UK Downing Street said Mr Heaton-Harris had written to universities in his capacity as an MP and not as a representative of government. The prime minister's official spokesman said Theresa May respected the freedom and independence of universities and the role they played in providing open and stimulating debate. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted Mr Heaton-Harris had not sent a ""threatening letter"" to universities, although she could not say why he had sought the information. She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""It does seem to me to be a bit odd that universities should react in such a negative way to a fairly courteous request."" Sally Hunt, chairwoman of lecturers' union the University and College Union, said: ""Our society will suffer if politicians seek to police what universities can and cannot teach. ""This attempt by Chris Heaton-Harris to compile a hit list of professors has the acrid whiff of McCarthyism about it and (universities minister) Jo Johnson must disown it in the strongest terms."" University lecturers took to twitter to mock Mr Heaton-Harris and the government over the letter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Professor David Green, vice-chancellor at the University of Worcester, said: ""When I read this extraordinary letter on Parliamentary paper from a serving MP, I felt a chill down my spine. Was this the beginnings of a very British McCarthyism?"" He said he feared he would be denounced in Parliament by Mr Heaton-Harris as an ""enemy of the people"" if he did not supply the list - something he said he had no intention of doing. He added: ""I realised that his letter just asking for information appears so innocent but is really so, so dangerous. ""Here is the first step to the thought police, the political censor and Newspeak, naturally justified as 'the will of the British people'."" The Guardian revealed,externalthat Mr Heaton-Harris wrote to university vice-chancellors at the start of this month asking for the names of professors ""involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit"". The MP's letter also asks for a ""copy of the syllabus"" and online links to lectures on Brexit. Lord Patten, the chancellor of Oxford University, and former chairman of the BBC Trust, described Mr Heaton-Harris's letter as an ""extraordinary example of outrageous and foolish behaviour - offensive and idiotic Leninism"". Lord Patten is sworn in as Oxford University chancellor The peer, a longstanding supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: ""I couldn't believe that it had come from a Conservative MP. ""I think he must be an agent of Mr Corbyn intent on further increasing the number of young people who want to vote Labour."" He said he was sure most university vice-chancellors would drop the letter ""in the waste-paper basket"" and he accused Mr Heaton-Harris of an affront to free speech and of treating UK universities like ""Chinese re-education camps"". McCarthyism refers to US Senator Joseph McCarthy who led attempts to purge alleged Communists in public life the 1950s.

"Trump debasing US, says top Republican","This video can not be played Lashing out: What Bob Corker really thinks of President Trump Influential Republican Senator Bob Corker has unleashed a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump, calling him ""utterly untruthful"". In a series of television interviews, Mr Corker accused the president of lying, adding that he debased the US and weakened its global standing. Mr Trump fired back on Twitter, calling the Tennessee senator a ""lightweight"" who ""couldn't get re-elected"". The pair met at a Senate lunch on Tuesday to discuss tax reform. ""He is purposely breaking down relationships we have around the world that had been useful to our nation,"" Mr Corker said on CNN after the Republican president criticised him on Twitter. This video can not be played ""Trump is treason!"" shouted a protester who threw Russian flags at the president as he arrived at Capitol Hill ""I think the debasement of our nation is what he'll be remembered most for,"" he said. The Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who was an early supporter of Mr Trump, added that the president has ""great difficulty with truth"". Raising the voltage -Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The good news for Donald Trump ishe's managed to push his feud with a grieving war widow out of the headlines.The bad news is he's done it by pushing a stake through Republican unity at a time when the party needs to come together to pass big-ticket tax reform through Congress. The latest blistering exchange between Republican Senator Bob Corker and the president has all the hallmarks of one of Mr Trump's classic intra-party campaign spats. There's the quick Twitter trigger finger, the derogatory nicknames (""liddle"" Bob Corker), the over-the-top hyperbole (""he couldn't get elected dog catcher""). Republicans - including those who bore the brunt of Mr Trump's vitriolic attacks - largely shrugged off those earlier rows as primary-season posturing and unified behind their unlikely standard-bearer in the autumn general election. Mr Corker, on the verge of Senate retirement, isn't backing down, however. And the president is once again raising the voltage. The party is learning the hard way that there's only one Donald Trump - whether he's a real-estate mogul, a reality TV star, a candidate or a president. If you question his leadership, his views or his attitude, he'll unleash the whirlwind, no matter the consequences. When asked if he regretted supporting Mr Trump during the 2016 election, the senator said: ""Let's just put it this way, I would not do that again."" His comments came after Mr Trump lashed out at the Republican in a series of tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last month Mr Corker announced that he would not seek re-election at next year's mid-term elections. Mr Corker had voted against the 2015 agreement to curb Iran's development of nuclear weapons, calling it ""flawed"", but later said Mr Trump should not ""tear up"" the pact. Mr Trump's tweets on Tuesday appeared to be in response to Mr Corker's comments on ABC News' Good Morning America, in which he suggested the president should stop interfering in the debate on tax legislation. Four ways Bob Corker skewered Donald Trump What's in the Iran nuclear deal? How does the US tax plan compare to other countries?

BrightHouse to repay customers Â£14.8m,"Rent-to-own customers typically buy household appliances over a three-year period Rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse has been told to pay Â£14.8m to 249,000 customers by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). BrightHouse will compensate customers who had cancelled agreements after one downpayment but had not been refunded. It will also make payments to those who signed up to lending agreements that ""may not have been affordable"". The FCA said BrightHouse had not acted as a ""responsible lender"". The firm, which lets customers pay for household items such as washing machines and televisions on a weekly basis, has been criticised for its business model. In 2016 a BBC investigation conducted by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, highlighted the example of a Â£358 washing machine that ended up costing more than Â£1,000. Rent-to-own firms selling to vulnerable people Price cap on rent-to-own goods possible says FCA BrightHouse has apologised to customers about failing to refund them. There is no need for customers affected to contact BrightHouse. It will write to 213,000 current and former customers by the end of the year, explaining what they are due. Sasha Rhodes of Sheffield bought a king-size bed from BrightHouse on a two-year contract. ""I don't think they ran enough checks to ensure I was able to make the payments - all they were interested in was my money,"" she says. ""I did not realise how high interest payments were. I stopped payments after 16 months. I think I paid them around Â£800 in total for what must have been a Â£400 bed."" Customers whose deposits BrightHouse failed to refund signed up between April 2010 and April 2017. These customers will receive an average payment of Â£27. The second group includes those who took out an agreement between April 2014 and September 2016. They will get an average of Â£147. This video can not be played Former Labour leader Ed Miliband investigates rent-to-own companies In the case of customers who were not assessed properly at the start of the loan who may have had difficulty making payments, BrightHouse will pay back interest and fees along with compensatory interest of 8% - if they return the goods. Those who kept the goods will have their balances written off. FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey told Radio 5 Live the move set a ""very important precedent... BrightHouse did not behave as responsible lenders and they failed to meet our expectations"". Lois Grant, from York, worked for BrightHouse from 2012 to 2016 as a branch manager in Yorkshire and London but left because of ""unacceptable"" high-pressure sales techniques. ""In the early days, we did not ask people about their expenditure at all. We just checked what their income was. They changed that policy because the FCA came to investigate, asking for more stringent checks. ""I can't remember ever giving any money back to any customer. This is despite one of their policies that said if you cancel within 14 days you would get a refund. I know from several experiences that rarely happened, if ever."" Citizens Advice said it had helped more than 13,000 people with rent-to-own issues over the past 12 months, many of whom were struggling to make payments on essential goods such as fridges and washing machines. ""We're pleased to see that the FCA are taking action against BrightHouse whose loose lending practices have pushed the very people who can least afford it further into financial difficulty,"" said its chief executive, Gillian Guy. Charities and MPs said some people have struggled to keep up with BrightHouse repayments The charity said it had found one in five rent-to-own customers spent 20% or more of their income on payments, and more than half had to take on other debts to cover the costs. It is asking that the same conditions apply to all forms of high-cost credit as the payday loans cap - meaning that no one would pay more than what they borrowed in interest and charges. Separate criticism came from the Financial Inclusion Centre, a think tank that compiled a report into the company last year. Gareth Evans, a co-director of the think tank, said BrightHouse had made profits at a personal cost for some customers, with some having to prioritise repayments over food or heating. BrightHouse chief executive Hamish Paton sincerely apologised to those affected: ""We're absolutely determined that this doesn't happen again and have made significant improvements over the last 18 months."" The firm said it had overhauled its application process to ensure future loans were affordable and that customers were treated fairly during the collections process. BrightHouse was founded in 1994 as Crazy George and rebranded as BrightHouse in 2002. It is owned by private equity firm Vision Capital and has about 280 stores.

First Challenger shuttle commander dies,"US astronaut Paul Weitz, who helped save a Nasa space station after it was damaged during launch, has died aged 85. Mr Weitz, who died at a retirement home in Flagstaff, Arizona, also served as the first commander of the space shuttle Challenger. He was a naval aviator before joining Nasa in 1966. He was the pilot on the first mission to Skylab, the US space station which orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979. The orbiting laboratory had been launched without crew on 14 May 1973. But a shield to protect the station from collisions with small meteorites had torn loose during lift-off. Skylab was America's first and only space station A replacement sunshield for Skylab is sewn together in Houston Weitz mans the control and display console of the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) on Skylab in 1973 The shield also protected Skylab against extremes of temperature, and without it, the station began to overheat. Mr Weitz and his fellow crew members Pete Conrad and Joseph Kerwin were supposed to launch on 15 May. But Nasa delayed the flight so that the crew could practice repairs on the ground. The astronauts eventually launched on 25 May and approached Skylab in their Apollo command module. Positioning their spacecraft near a jammed solar panel on Skylab, Weitz opened the Apollo module's airlock and extended a 3m (10ft)-long pole designed to free the component. He tugged hard at the solar panel, while Joe Kerwin held him by the ankles. ""We thought maybe we'd just break it loose. So we got down near the end of the solar array and I got a hold of it with the shepherd's crook,"" Mr Weitz said in an interview with Nasa in 2000. ""But what we really hadn't thought about was, in heaving on it, trying to break the thing free, what I was doing, in effect, I was pulling the command module... in toward [Skylab]."" ""Also, surprising in a totally weightless environment, I was moving [Skylab] some, too, because we could see its thrusters firing to maintain its attitude... So it made for some dicey times."" It was clear that the array wasn't going to budge, so the astronauts went back inside the command module. The crew of STS-6, the first Challenger shuttle flight, pose for a photo. Commander Paul Weitz is seated second from the left The astronauts deployed a satellite from Challenger and carried out a spacewalk during the five-day mission After several failed attempts to dock with the command module, the astronauts finally entered Skylab and successfully deployed a replacement sunshade to lower temperatures inside the lab. Weitz's second flight was in April 1983 as the first commander of the space shuttle Challenger. He was then at the relatively advanced age (in those days) of 51. During their five-day mission, the four crew members successfully deployed a satellite from Challenger and carried out a spacewalk. Just three years later, the shuttle was destroyed in an accident on lift-off which killed all seven astronauts on board. If the Apollo programme had not been cancelled in the early seventies, Mr Weitz might have flown to the Moon - possibly on Apollo 20. Paul J Weitz was born on 25 July 1932 in Erie, Pennsylvania.

"Visit cheap Britain, says Lonely Planet","The weak pound has made the UK one of the world's best-value travel destinations, according to publisher Lonely Planet. Sterling has fallen sharply against the dollar and the euro since last year after ongoing Brexit uncertainty. Lonely Planet, which is owned by US firm NC2 Media, is urging tourists to ""reap the benefits"" of a weak pound. It also ranked Belfast and the Giant's Causeway coast as the world's number one region to visit in 2018. Lonely Planet says the UK is seventh on its list of best value destinations, with Estonian capital Tallinn at the top, followed by Lanzarote in the Canary Islands and the US state of Arizona. Prices in the UK have become relatively cheaper for overseas visitors due to the pound's 11% fall against the dollar and 14% slide compared with the euro since June last year. James Smart, Lonely Planet's Britain and Ireland destination editor, said the decline ""has been a great boost for people looking to visit the UK, and we expect this to continue next year"". International visitors can ""make the exchange rate work even harder by aiming for Devon, Cornwall, and big-ticket cities such as Bath, York and Edinburgh"", he added. In July the number of overseas visitors to the UK topped four million for the first time,the Office for National Statistics said,external. The ONS does not have data about people's motivation to visit the UK, but speculates that the boost in visitor numbers could be linked to the exchange rate. Tourism promotion agency VisitBritain has previously said that an increase in airline capacity, particularly for visitors from China and the US, has also boosted tourism numbers. The agency's chief executive, Sally Balcombe, said: ""The UK is offering great value for visitors right now ... on every budget."" In the first seven months of the year, the number of overseas visits to the UK rose 8% to 23.1 million compared with the same period last year, VisitBritain said. It forecasts that the total will hit 39.7 million by the end of 2017, with visitors spending about Â£25.7bn. Figures from ForwardKeys, which tracks flight booking data, indicates that international arrivals to the UK for October to December are 7% higher than last year. Olivier Jager, its chief executive, said long-haul bookings to the UK for the first three months of 2018 are 15% ahead of their level this time last year. Bookings from Australia are 29% higher, 16% up from Brazil and 13% higher from the US. Meanwhile, Belfast and the coast around the Giant's Causeway was ranked by Lonely Planet the world's top region to visit in 2018. ""Dynamic Belfast has put its troubled past behind it and is a city transformed, its streets packed with buzzing bars and great stories, while the coastline beyond boasts spectacular scenery and plenty of great diversions,"" Mr Smart said. ""The region may be famous for Game of Thrones but its many scenic filming locations are just the start.""

France struggles with a boy named Jihad,"France used to have an official list of approved names for babies Is it acceptable to name your baby ""Jihad"" in France, which has suffered Europe's worst Islamist terror attacks in recent years? France's chief prosecutor now has to wrestle with that question after a couple's chosen name for their son was referred by authorities in Toulouse. In turn, the French judge for family issues may have to rule on the case. ""Jihad"" in Arabic means ""effort"" or ""struggle"", not specifically ""holy war"". BBC Religions - meaning of Jihad Row over 'patriotic' French names Why do some countries regulate baby names? French law does not restrict parents' name choices for their children, provided a name does not harm the child's interests and is not opposed by other family members on reputational grounds. The Toulouse boy called ""Jihad"" was born in August. Previously, other boys have been allowed to keep that name in France. The term ""jihadists"" is commonly used to describe Islamist militants, such as those who carry out terror attacks in the name of so-called Islamic State (IS). Since the start of 2015, Islamist militants have killed more than 230 people in France, where a state of emergency remains in force. In 2013 a mother in the French city of Nimes was given a one-month suspended jail term and a â¬2,000 (Â£1,783; $2,353) fine after sending her three-year-old boy called Jihad to school in a T-shirt bearing the words ""I am a bomb"" and ""Jihad, born on 11 September"". The sentence was for the ""provocative"" T-shirt, which referenced the 9/11 terror attacks in the US, but not for the name ""Jihad"". In 2015 a French court prevented a couple from naming their baby girl Nutella after the hazelnut spread, ruling that it would make her a laughing stock. The judge ordered that the child be called Ella instead. Row over 'patriotic' French names Court bans child being named Nutella Why do some countries regulate baby names?

Republican senator: Trump 'debasing US',"This video can not be played Lashing out: What Bob Corker really thinks of President Trump Influential Republican Senator Bob Corker has unleashed a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump, calling him ""utterly untruthful"". In a series of television interviews, Mr Corker accused the president of lying, adding that he debased the US and weakened its global standing. Mr Trump fired back on Twitter, calling the Tennessee senator a ""lightweight"" who ""couldn't get re-elected"". The pair met at a Senate lunch on Tuesday to discuss tax reform. ""He is purposely breaking down relationships we have around the world that had been useful to our nation,"" Mr Corker said on CNN after the Republican president criticised him on Twitter. This video can not be played ""Trump is treason!"" shouted a protester who threw Russian flags at the president as he arrived at Capitol Hill ""I think the debasement of our nation is what he'll be remembered most for,"" he said. The Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who was an early supporter of Mr Trump, added that the president has ""great difficulty with truth"". Raising the voltage -Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The good news for Donald Trump ishe's managed to push his feud with a grieving war widow out of the headlines.The bad news is he's done it by pushing a stake through Republican unity at a time when the party needs to come together to pass big-ticket tax reform through Congress. The latest blistering exchange between Republican Senator Bob Corker and the president has all the hallmarks of one of Mr Trump's classic intra-party campaign spats. There's the quick Twitter trigger finger, the derogatory nicknames (""liddle"" Bob Corker), the over-the-top hyperbole (""he couldn't get elected dog catcher""). Republicans - including those who bore the brunt of Mr Trump's vitriolic attacks - largely shrugged off those earlier rows as primary-season posturing and unified behind their unlikely standard-bearer in the autumn general election. Mr Corker, on the verge of Senate retirement, isn't backing down, however. And the president is once again raising the voltage. The party is learning the hard way that there's only one Donald Trump - whether he's a real-estate mogul, a reality TV star, a candidate or a president. If you question his leadership, his views or his attitude, he'll unleash the whirlwind, no matter the consequences. When asked if he regretted supporting Mr Trump during the 2016 election, the senator said: ""Let's just put it this way, I would not do that again."" His comments came after Mr Trump lashed out at the Republican in a series of tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many social media users across the region responded with calls to boycott the company. However, the restaurant chain is not alone among corporations with advertising troubles of late.

A screenshot from part of the advert was widely shared by social media users amid accusations of racism and white washing. In contrast, both KFC, on Twitter, andPolish auction website Allegro, on Facebook, have been praised for their advertising on social media.

Hackers breach top plastic surgery clinic,"The London clinic says it is still determining what data was stolen A high-profile plastic surgery clinic has said it is ""horrified"" after hackers allegedly stole data during a cyber-attack. London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS) said,externalits IT experts and police found evidence of the breach. A group claiming to be behind the breach said it had ""terabytes"" of data, theDaily Beast news site reported,external. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the attack. The alleged hackers, using the pseudonym The Dark Overlord, said they had obtained photos showing various body parts of clients, including genitals. Some of these images have been sent to the Daily Beast. The hackers also claimed that the data contained information on ""royal families"" and added that they planned to distribute the patient list and corresponding photos online. ""We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised,"" LBPS said in a statement. ""We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients."" One of the clinic's recent clients is model and TV presenter Katie Price A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said it was notified of a suspected breach on 17 October. She added that there had been no arrests and that enquiries by the Organised Crime Command were continuing. LBPS is known to have high-profile clients, including model and TV presenter Katie Price, who recentlyused her Instagram account,externalto thank the clinic for her facelift.

Tusk talks of risks of Brexit 'defeat',"This video can not be played Stay united or face Brexit defeat, EU told The EU will be ""defeated"" in Brexit negotiations unless it maintains absolute unity, European Council president Donald Tusk has said. The ex-Polish prime minister told the European Parliament the UK's departure was the EU's ""toughest stress test"" and it must not be divided at any costs. ""If we fail it then the negotiations will end in our defeat,"" he told MEPs. But one German MEP said the EU's stance was ""illogical, dangerous and unfair"" and UKIP accused the EU of ""extortion"". European Parliament Live: Rolling updates Reality Check: Where are we really with Brexit? The UK is due to leave the European Union at the end of March 2019 and until Mr Tusk's comments both sides have sought to avoid talking about victory, defeat and winners and losers in the negotiations. In an update following last week's Brussels summit where the Brexit process was discussed, Mr Tusk said he was ""obsessed"" with preserving the unity of the other 27 members. BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty allows the UK and the EU to negotiate an orderly withdrawal, a transition period and the shape of the future relationship within a two-year window. Mr Barnier plans to complete the withdrawal agreement by the autumn of 2018 so it can be ratified by the European Council and the European Parliament. So we could know the outlines of the future relationship by then. But under EU law, a trade deal would have to be signed when the UK became a so-called ""third country"" and it is this that would likely have to be ratified by Parliaments in the member states. ""We must keep our unity regardless of the direction of the talks,"" Mr Tusk said. ""The EU will be able to rise to every scenario as long as we are not divided."" ""If we fail it then the negotiations will end in our defeat,"" he told MEPs. He added: ""It is in fact up to London how this will end: with a good deal, no deal or no Brexit. But in each of these scenarios we will protect our common interest only by being together."" Responding to suggestions that the UK might choose to stop its withdrawal, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""Brexit is not going to be reversed."" So far, the Brexit negotiations have focused on the three ""separation"" issues of how much the UK has to pay to ""settle its accounts"" when it leaves, what happens to EU citizens in the UK and Britons elsewhere in the EU after Brexit, plus what happens with the Northern Ireland border. This video can not be played EU's Brexit stance 'unfair' says German MEP The EU says it will only move on to discuss the UK's future relations with the EU after ""sufficient progress"" has been made on these three issues. At last week's summit EU leaders decided more work was needed on these items before trade talks could begin with the UK - although the remaining 27 EU members have agreed to talk about the future options among themselves. The UK wants the second phase to start as soon as possible. On Monday, Theresa May told MPs she had a ""degree of confidence"" of making enough progress by December to begin trade talks. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested negotiations on a UK-EU trade deal could take three years if they begin in December. He told the Belgian newspaper L'Echo,externalthat the process would not be ""without risks"" because national parliaments in all the 27 remaining states would ""have to give their approval"" to any deal. A spokesman for Mr Barnier confirmed the remarks but stressed anything was possible and it was not a definitive statement that a deal would be done by December 2020. Speaking in Tuesday's debate, Conservative MEP Syed Kamall, who heads the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, called for more pragmatism and less idealism from the EU in their approach to the talks. ""There needs to be an understanding from the EU 27 where the British people are coming from,"" he said. And Hans-Olaf Henkel, a German MEP from the Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament, urged Mr Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to demonstrate more of the ""British values of fairness"" asking ""whether you would agree a price on something you don't know or what you buy for"". For UKIP, MEP Ray Finch warned that the UK would ""remain subservient to the EU legally and financially"" if talks continued on their current trajectory. Referring to demands for the UK to pay a so-called divorce settlement, he said: ""This extortion will poison UK and EU relations for years to come,"" adding that the two sides should ""shake hands and walk away"" now.

Paddington 2 aims to cut Weinstein ties,"The producer behind Paddington 2 says he wants to cut all ties with the Weinstein name. David Heyman toldDeadline,externalthat The Weinstein Company had distribution rights but had nothing to do with the financing or making of the film. Heyman said his hopes are that, ultimately, ""The Weinstein Company name is nowhere near Paddington 2"". It followsfresh allegationsagainst Harvey Weinstein and claimshis assistant was paid for her silence. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" allegations of non-consensual sex. David Heyman at the premiere of Paddington in 2014 Heyman, who is also behind the Harry Potter movies, spoke about his unease at being involved with The Weinstein Company. ""It's very sad and deeply frustrating that Paddington, who's been around for more than 50 years, and is always looking for the good in people... could have any association"" with the ongoing scandal, he said. After Weinstein was sacked by his production company, younger brother Bob had said The Weinstein Company's involvement in Paddington 2 would continue. But Heyman said he had received many calls from distributors offering to replace The Weinstein Company, saying: ""I'm sure all options will be explored."" Paddington 2, which stars Hugh Bonneville, Peter Capaldi and Ben Whishaw, will be released in the UK on 10 November.

"Facebook explores, publishers panic","Facebook is experimenting with making its main news feed focus on posts from its users' friends and families It used to be a tweak in the Google search algorithm that sent a shudder through newsrooms trying to adapt to the online era.  Now it is any change in the design of Facebook. So, an experiment under way in a few countries, where the social media giant appears to be making it harder for users to see news stories, has caused something akin to panic. The new feature Facebook is trying out is called Explore. It offers all sorts of stories it thinks might interest you, a separate news feed encouraging you to look further afield than just at what your friends are sharing. Meanwhile, for most people, the standard News Feed remains the usual mixture of baby photos and posts from companies or media organisations whose pages you have liked. Sounds fine, doesn't it? Except that in six countries - Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia, Serbia, Guatemala, and Cambodia - the experiment went further. For users there, the main News Feed was cleared of everything but the usual stuff from your friends and sponsored posts - in other words, if you wanted to have your material seen in the place most users spend their time you had to pay for the privilege. In a Medium post entitled,external""Biggest drop in organic reach we've ever seen"", a Slovakian journalist Filip Struharik documented the impact. Publishers in his country were seeing just a quarter of the interactions they used to get before the change, he said. What had become a vital and vibrant platform for them was emptying out fast. Other journalists around the world have looked into the future and hate what they see. Their organisations have become addicted to Facebook as the one true way of reaching audiences and going cold turkey would be very painful. Facebook is of course a business - and a hugely successful one - that makes its money from advertising. So, why would it not want publishers to pay to reach its gigantic audience? In six countries, publishers and businesses have had their posts restricted to the Explore Feed unless they pay a fee But Peter Kafka, a journalist from Recode,tweeted an even more depressing thought,external: ""Conspiracy angle: fb wants more $ from publishers! More accurate, and dispiriting angle (for publishers): fb doesn't care about publishers."" Facebook responded as it often does by saying calm down, dears, it was just a bit of fun. As the wave of panic rolled around the news media world, the social network's head of newsfeed Adam Mosseri putup a post with the title,externalClarifying Recent Tests. It explained that the experiment is aimed at understanding whether people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content. ""We currently have no plans to roll this test out further,"" he added. This has not helped much - that word ""currently"" seems to stick out ominously. But at least Facebook has done publishers big and small a service. They knew the risks involved in innovations such as Instant Articles - where their works live on the social network - or Facebook Live - where a broadcaster's brand might be less visible to many users. Now they know that Facebook is at least thinking about a future where news plays a smaller role in the social media experience. Given Facebook's role in last year's US elections, some may think that's a good thing. But for thousands of struggling media organisations that thought they had found a route forward, it is a chilling prospect.

When I realised a homeless addict was my childhood friend,"A chance meeting between two childhood friends helped one begin a journey back from drug addiction after many years living on the street. It was early October and Wanja Mwaura, 32, was on her way to the market in Lower Kabaete, not far from Nairobi, when she heard someone shout out her name. She looked up and was surprised to see a tall man with bulging eyes, an emaciated frame, dirtied black overalls and an equally stained thick woollen hat, sitting on the side of the road. She did not recognise him. But when Patrick ""Hinga"" Wanjiru, 34, introduced himself, Wanja says she found herself in shock. Standing before her was a  friend she had known since she was seven years old. ""Patrick, or Hinga as we called him, and I had met at primary school in 1992,"" says Wanja, who is a nurse from Kiambu County, just outside the Kenyan capital. ""Hinga used to be a great soccer player all throughout school. We nicknamed him 'Pele'."" Hinga was estranged from his parents and lived with his grandmother in a squat. When she couldn't afford to pay his school fees, he was forced to skip classes. Eventually they were evicted even from the squat. But against all the odds, Hinga did well in his exams, until his grandmother died - then he dropped out of school and his life began to take a downward trajectory. Hinga started abusing drugs, first marijuana and then heroin. He spent hours sifting through garbage to find things he could sell on the streets. Hinga and Wanja lost touch. When they met again, more than 15 years later, Hinga had been homeless for more than a decade. He looked nothing like the childhood friend who had once been known as ""Pele"". Sensing Wanja's dismay, Hinga reassured her that he had only wanted to say hello. She asked him if she could buy him lunch. At a local cafe, she ordered the dish she remembered had been his favourite years earlier - pork ribs and mashed potatoes. She said he appeared distracted, unable to finish sentences. ""I gave him my mobile telephone number and told him to call me if he needed anything,"" Wanja says. Over the next couple of days, Hinga borrowed phones and would regularly call his childhood friend, often just to hear her voice for a chat. He told her that he was committed to getting clean from drugs. ""I decided then, that something needed to be done to help him,"" Wanja says. Taking to social media, Wanja appealed to her friends to see if she could raise funds for drug rehabilitation. ""Rehab here is very expensive and I had no ways of raising funds on my own,"" she says. ""We set up a crowdfunding page, but we only managed to raise around 41,000 Kenyan shillings (Â£300) initially. However the cost of nine days rehabilitation at Chiromo Lane Medical Center in Nairobi was more than 100,000 KES. ""I wasn't sure how we would be able to cover this."" But Wanja had promised to help Hinga, so she took him to the centre anyway, unsure how they would cover the cost. A spokesperson for the rehab programme says Hinga was a dedicated patient, who committed fully to the nine-day detox. Within days Hinga had gained weight and his concentration improved.Wanja took to Facebook,externalto speak about her pride at her friend's transformation in such a short period of time. ""A week ago Hinga and I couldn't hold a normal conversation without me trying to hold his head up with my hand in order for him to concentrate. Today we can have a normal conversation with him confidently looking at me,"" she wrote. Mombasa businessman Fauz Khalid spotted Wanja's public post on Facebook and said he wanted to share the story on a wider platform. He posted the photos on Twitter and his post has now been shared more than 50,000 times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After that, the Kenyan media began to cover the story and Chiromo Lane Medical Center agreed to waive the entire fee for Hinga's treatment. Wanja says this was ""a blessing"", but she was keen for her friend to undergo a more sustained recovery, and is now raising funds for him to follow a 90-day programme at The Retreat Rehabilitation Centre, where he is currently staying. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 55,000 Kenyans inject heroin but Kenya does not have a government-funded rehabilitation facility According to theInternational Drugs Policy Consortium,external, heroin was used first in cities which were transit points (such as Mombasa) before spreading to Nairobi and other parts of the country The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse,external, a Kenyan government research body, says it is monitoring 25,000 intravenous drug users around the country - the number of people who snort heroin could be even higher, according to the Anti-Narcotics Unit officials Most of the world's heroin is produced in Afghanistan, and reaches markets in Europe and North America via Central Asia and the Balkans - but the quantity of heroin seized off the coast of Kenya and neighbouring Tanzaniahas increased exponentially in the last eight years,external, leading the UN to conclude that the ""Southern Route"" is growing in importance ""Unfortunately, there is still great stigma around drug abuse in Kenya,"" Wanja says. This may be one reason why the government doesn't provide free drug rehab treatment. ""Rehabs are expensive and out of reach for many people, not only in Kenya but also the greater part of Africa. I am committed to crowdsourcing so I can support my friend at this time,"" says Wanja. ""Wanja is an angel sent from God. I owe her my life. She has stuck with me more closely than a brother or a sister,"" Hinga tells the BBC. On Twitter several users echoed this sentiment. Abraham Wilbourneâ, a financial analyst from Nairobi, told Wanja ""You have a seat in heaven!"" Many called her a ""mashujaa"", which means ""hero"" in Swahili. ""People say I changed Hinga's life, but he changed mine too."" says Wanja. ""I realise now that a small act can change a person's life.""

Profile: China's President Xi Jinping,"Xi Jinping is set to start a historic third term as China's president Xi Jinping is set to embark on a historic third term at the 20th Communist Party congress later this month. It paves the way for the party to reappoint him as president at the National People's Congress next year. China's leaders voted in 2018 to remove the two-term presidential limit that has been in place since the 1990s. Under Mr Xi's rule since 2012, China has become more authoritarian at home, cracking down on dissent, critics and even influential billionaires and businesses.Some have described him,externalas ""the most authoritarian leader since Chairman Mao"". Under his rule, China has established ""re-education"" camps in Xinjiang that have been accused of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups. It has tightened its grip on Hong Kong andvowed to ""reunite"" with Taiwan, by force if necessary. In a clear sign of his influence, theCommunist Party votedin 2017 to write his philosophy - called ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era"" - into its constitution. Only party founder Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, the leader who introduced economic reforms in the 1980s, have made it into the all-important fundamental law of the land. Born in Beijing in 1953, Xi Jinping is the son of revolutionary veteran Xi Zhongxun, one of the Communist Party's founding fathers and a former vice-premier. Because of his illustrious roots, Mr Xi is considered a ""princeling"" - a child of elite senior officials who has risen up the ranks. But his family's fortunes took a dramatic turn when his father was imprisoned in 1962. A deeply suspicious Mao, fearing a rebellion in party ranks, ordered a purge of potential rivals. Then in 1966 came the so-called Cultural Revolution when millions were branded as enemies of Chinese culture, sparking violent attacks across the country. Mr Xi's family suffered too. His half-sister - his father's first daughter through an earlier marriage - was persecuted to death, according to official accounts, though a historian familiar with the party elite said she had probably taken her own life under duress, according to a New York Times report. A young Xi was pulled out of a school attended by children of the political elite. Eventually, at 15, he left Beijing and was sent to the countryside for ""re-education"" and hard labour in the remote and poor north-eastern village of Liangjiahe for seven years. The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie analyses Xi Jinping's rise LISTEN: Meet China's all-powerful leader But far from turning against the Communist Party, Mr Xi embraced it. He tried to join several times, but was rebuffed because of his father's standing. He was finally accepted in 1974, starting out in Hebei province, then occupying ever more senior roles as he slowly made his way to the top. In 1989, at the age of 35, he was party chief in the city of Ningde in southern Fujian province whenprotests demanding greater political freedom began in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The province was far from the capital but Mr Xi, along with other party officials, reportedly scrambled to contain local offshoots of the massive demonstrations under way in Beijing. The protests - an echo of a rift within Communist Party ranks - and the bloody crackdown that ended them have effectively now been scrubbed from the country's history books and public record. China even lost the bid to host the 2000 Olympics because of the abuses in Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the number killed range from hundreds to many thousands. Almost two decades later, however, Mr Xi was put in charge of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. China was keen to show it had moved on and was a worthy host - and it appeared to be working, with the Games symbolising China's rise as a growing power. As for Mr Xi, his increasing profile in the party propelled him to its top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, and in 2012 he was picked as China's president. Mr Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan (right), is a famous folk singer in China Mr Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, a famous singer, have been heavily featured in state media as China's First Couple. This is a contrast from previous presidential couples, where the first lady has traditionally kept a lower profile. The couple have a daughter, Xi Mingze, but not much is known about her apart from the fact that she studied at Harvard University. Other family members andtheir overseas business dealings,externalhave been a subject of scrutiny in the international press. Mr Xi has vigorously pursued what he has called a ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" with hisChina Dreamvision. Under him, the world's second largest economy has enacted reform to combat slowing growth, such as cutting down bloated state-owned industries and reducing pollution, as well as the multi-billion dollar One Belt One Road infrastructure project aimed at expanding China's global trade links. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means The country has become more assertive on the global stage, from its growing forcefulness inthe South China Sea, to its exercise of soft power by pumping billions of dollars into Asian and African investments. Some of this economic growth however, which in past decades has increased meteorically - has now slowed substantially, worsened by the Chinese leader's uncompromising ""zero-Covid"" strategy that has locked out the rest of the world since the pandemic. The country's once-booming property market is in a deep slump and the outlook for the global economy has weakened sharply in recent months. A bitter and damaging trade war with the US shows no sign of ending. Since reaching top office, Mr Xi has overseen a wide-reaching corruption crackdown extending to the highest echelons of the party. Critics have portrayed it as a political purge. Under his rule, China has also seen increasing clampdowns on freedoms. In Xinjiang province, human rights groups believe the government hasdetained more than a million Muslim Uyghursover the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education"" camps.China denies accusations from the US and other that it is committing genocidethere. Beijing's grip over Hong Kong, too, has grown under Mr Xi. Thousands turned out in Hong Kong to take part in protests against a planned extradition law Mr Xi put an end to pro-democracy protests in 2020 by signing the National Security Law, a sweeping edict that gives Beijing powers to reshape life in the former British colony, criminalising what it calls secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, with the maximum sentence of life in prison. The law has led tomass arrestsof prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians, as well as the closure of prominent news outlets includingApple DailyandStand News. Under Mr Xi's leadership, China has also intensified its focus on the self-ruled island of Taiwan, vowing ""reunification"" and threatening to use military force to prevent any move towards formal independence there. Given China's power and influence, the world will be watching Mr Xi as he embarks on his third term as president. With no heir apparent, the 69-year-old is arguably the most powerful leader China has had since the death of Mao Zedong in the 1970s.

The man keeping the world's lighthouses shining,"Tim Nguyen's team restores lighthouses all over the world For more than 150 years, glassmakers in one of England's landlocked regions gave light to the seafarers all over the world. It has fallen to one man on the other side of the planet to preserve their legacy. Shining a fresh light on the forgotten past of the Midlands-based Chance Brothers is Tim Nguyen, who has dedicated himself to restoring their work in 2,000 lighthouses across the globe. The Australian's quest to restore their optics using original parts and methods is unmatched by anyone. He has spent 20 years honing his craft and hopes he will soon find a skilled glassblower to complete the team in Melbourne and recreate the traditional techniques used by the original Black Country firm. Chance Glass produced 300,000 panes to glaze the Crystal Palace Chance Brothers Glassworks in Smethwick manufactured glass used in everything from glazing the Houses of Parliament and Crystal Palace to the production of novelty ashtrays. ""If it was made in glass then Chance Brothers made it,"" said Ray Drury, the firm's final chief engineer, on its 150th anniversary. When the company was founded in 1824, the world was changing rapidly. The booming shipping industry meant wrecks became a regular occurrence as more ships had to navigate treacherous coastlines, according to historian Malcolm Dick. In response to this, Chance Brothers created optic lenses for lighthouses that were sent around the world, illuminating coasts and saving thousands of lives. But since shutting its doors in 1981, the number of their lighthouses has dwindled and with it, the traditional skills needed to produce their hallmark glass. Workers at the glass firm made prisms for the lighthouses The Chance Brothers factory in Smethwick closed its doors in 1981 Mr Nguyen has no attachment to the original company, which employed 3,500 people at its height. But his team, which adopted the name Chance Brothers Lighthouse Engineers, has dedicated itself to restoring and repairing lighthouses using traditional methods and original parts and has done so at more than 100 sites. Travelling the world, they gather broken parts and repair them and now have enough to be able to fix any lighthouse without replacing anything with modern technology. Tim Nguyen says his team are the only people taking on the preservation work of lighthouses Although he repairs lighthouses around the world, including this one in the US, Mr Nguyen said the work made him feel closer to the West Midlands Mr Nguyen said: ""We travel the world to assist in restoration and salvage parts. ""Basically, we're like a car-wrecker. That's how we work until one day when we team up with a glassblower who can make crown glass - then we can make anything."" Crown glass is the original type of glass used in Chance Brothers' optics. But new production methods mean that the colour and composition of modern glass would not match the original glass if it was added now. Lighthouses made in the Midlands saved thousands from shipwrecks as the shipping industry boomed Mr Nguyen has so far not been able to find anyone with the glassblowing skills in Australia to replicate the Chance Brothers' methods. ""We've looked everywhere and can't find anyone that can cast crown glass,"" he said. ""I believe some people in England can probably do it. If we have a chance of finding someone who can do it, it'll be there."" This lighthouse in south Wales also has an original foghorn made in Smethwick Mr Nguyen said with a crown glassblower on the team, they would be able to recreate the Chance Brothers' original workshop and even return it to Smethwick. ""One day, when we have this operational workshop we would like to move it back to the Black Country,"" he said. ""We're trying to do this project on our own, which isn't easy - but I believe it will be done in my lifetime. ""The community over there, their jaws would drop if we brought it back."" There are about 2,300 lighthouses around the world with lenses that were made in the Black Country Regional heritage projects and plans to redevelop the factory site go some way to ensuring the past is not forgotten, but Mr Nguyen wants to go further. ""Archives preserve the documents, the restoration will preserve the buildings, but nobody is trying to preserve the techniques,"" he said. ""We are here to preserve and carry on the engineering side, because if we don't it'll be lost. After doing this work for 20 years, that knowledge is too valuable to be lost. ""Basically, we're the only ones doing this work."" But is Mr Nguyen vainly fighting the tide of modernisation? Nash Point lighthouse switched to a more modern bulb in 1998 Like many others, Nash Point lighthouse, near Marcross in south Wales, made the change to a new automated lens several years ago. Attendant Chris Williams said the new 150 watt lens has a ""much smaller bulb"" but is ""more reliable and stays brighter for longer"". The original Chance Glass optic, which typically contained a 1,500 watt bulb, was left on display but out of use. The original optics at Nash Point are no longer in use, but remain on display ""Generally speaking, traditional optics are being phased out because new technology is so much more efficient,"" according to David Taylor from the Association of Lighthouse Keepers. ""Restoring a glass optic is hugely expensive. Within 15-20 years there probably won't be any left."" Regardless, Mr Nguyen persists, so keen is he to preserve this slice of history. But he's not the only one with an interest in keeping the tradition alive. The small team based in Melbourne travel the world preserving lighthouse optics Mark Davies founded Chance Glass Works Heritage Trust after stumbling across a Chance Brothers lighthouse, purely by happenstance, in Australia. The group plans to regenerate the original factory site in Smethwick and build a 30m tall lighthouse to teach people about the area's industrial legacy, which Mr Davies says is ""our best-kept secret"". ""The story started at the top of a lighthouse in Australia. I saw the manufacturer's plate and it said 'Made in Smethwick' and it stunned me. ""I was born four miles away and I didn't know about it myself. Outside Sandwell, there aren't many people that know about Chance Brothers."" The Black Country's history of light, it seems, needs a spotlight itself.

Is Grenfell council outspending government?,"The Claim:Kensington and Chelsea Council says it will spend more on the rehousing and recovery operation for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire than the government has promised to spend on housing in one quarter (three months) in the whole of the UK. Reality Check Verdict:The Â£235m that the council has set aside so far for Grenfell is less than the additional Â£250m allocated for affordable housing in England and Wales a quarter, so on these figures the council is wrong. The council predicts it will ultimately end up spending more on Grenfell but hasn't provided the figures. However the government is due to spend a total of Â£455m a quarter on affordable housing up to 2021. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea says it has set aside Â£235m so far on what it calls the Grenfell ""recovery"" operation. This money includes: Rehousing all 202 households who have been left homeless Mental health support to any of the survivors who need it. Many of those who escaped the inferno will have complex long-term needs because of conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Educational psychologists for schools to help students whose lives have been thrown into chaos just as they were approaching critical exams Transport to make sure that children dispersed to hotels around the capital can get to school on time There's no doubt that all of this is going to cost a fortune - not least because the borough is one of the most expensive areas of the UK. But even taking into account the sky-high prices of west London land, the council's claim doesn't stack up. So why did it get it wrong? It's not hard to understand why the council got into a muddle. It all comes down to one of the biggest problems faced by anyone trying to get their head around government spending: knowing for sure when the cash is going to be spent. The council told BBC Reality Check that it was comparing its spending with the government's Affordable Homes Programme. This is the key scheme overseen by the Department for Communities and Local Government to funds new homes in the social sector. The AHP was set up in 2010 and it runs until 2021. Up until the end of the summer, the Treasury had approved Â£7bn for the second five-year phase which we are now in. That works out at Â£350m a quarter. But that's not the figure to which the council is referring. Grenfell Tower is situated amongst some of the most expensive housing in London. Instead, it is referencing a new part of the affordable homes spending: an additional Â£2bn that the prime minister announced at October's Conservative Party Conference. If that Â£2bn was spread over the five years to 2021, it would work out as Â£100m per quarter. That's lower than Kensington and Chelsea's Grenfell spending - so the council looks like it's right. But in fact, that new money is an additional investment for only the final two years of the Affordable Homes Programme. That works out at Â£250m per quarter. And that's more than the council has set aside so far for the Grenfell recovery bill.  The council predicts it will ultimately end up spending more on Grenfell but hasn't provided the figures. BBC Reality Check likes to challenge itself by discovering new and complicated ways to push figures further. We lumped all Â£9bn of the government's current affordable homes spending together, without worrying too much about which particular year it applied to. When you spread that total over the five years of the programme, the projected quarterly average was Â£455m - still more than the council has set aside so far. This article was amended on 24 October to reflect new information from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The children forced to sell drugs,"Money and drugs found by police in a property which had been taken over by a dangerous drug network About 4,000 teenagers from London are being exploited and trafficked every year to sell drugs in rural towns and cities, a leading youth charity says. Known as ""county lines"", gangs use children as young as 12 to traffic drugs, using dedicated mobile phones or ""lines"". Anti-Slavery Commissioner Kevin Hyland said the figures were ""shocking"" and the exploitation was only slowly being recognised. It comes as the Home Office announced it was putting Â£300,000 into a new pilot project to help young victims. File on 4 spoke to one teenager about what it is like to be involved in a county lines gang. Michael* was 13 years old when a friend at his school approached him about selling drugs. Lured in by the prospect of making money, he began selling in his local area, but things escalated quickly. The gang was soon sending him on jobs out of London with the promise he could make around Â£500 a week. He was sent to the house of a vulnerable drug user that the gang had taken over in the Midlands, a practice known as cuckooing. Using this as his base, he was out on the street selling heroin and crack cocaine, day and night. ""I was a bit shaky, I was actually scared,"" he says. ""But from the time you see the money, you're just thinking, 'OK, I can just bear a bit more.'"" Michael describes having a normal upbringing and a close relationship with his family. Frantic about his long absences, he says, they would try to stop him by taking away his mobile phone -  but as soon as he left his house, the gang would start hassling him again. They would take him to a house where they ran a kind of breakfast club. ""Before you go to school you have breakfast there. I'd probably have a quick ride to school and then after school they come and pick you up as well,"" he says. Despite living with a group of drug users, Michael says he ""didn't really recognise the risks"" or see how easily he could be attacked. He describes how he once ended up staying in a graveyard after being left stranded hundreds of miles from home with nowhere to stay. ""They [drug users] could have found another drug dealer and told him 'listen, this guy is in a graveyard and he's got drugs'... anything could have happened, that experience was crazy."" After being arrested for possession of drugs, Michael decided to stop selling, but says it was not easy to leave the gang behind. ""They were trying to get at me but I moved away from the area, so I think that helped me a lot. ""I started to gain different knowledge and actually make my life something else and not just be another number."" The charity Safer London has dealt with many teenagers like Michael, who are exploited to sell drugs for older gang members. The charity's chief executive, Claire Hubberstey, said a frightening number of young people were at risk of being involved in county lines dealing. ""We have started recording when we've got concerns,"" she says. Based on the number of young people they see, they estimate at least 4,000 young people are at risk every year. She compares it to the way children are lured in to sexual grooming, saying initial promises soon turn into threats. ""Young people often talk about being physically locked in premises so they're not able to actually get out. ""Threats of coercion or violence mean they can be too scared to try to make their own way back - even if they have the means to do so."" She wants all of these young people placed on the National Referral Mechanism - meaning they would be treated as victims of trafficking and modern slavery, rather than being treated as criminals. ""They are exploited children, and they are being manipulated and exploited. Even if they don't see it, that doesn't mean that it's not happening"", she says. Anti-Slavery Commissioner Kevin Hyland said the extent of county lines exploitation was only slowly being recognised. ""We're waking up to it. Are we fully awake to it yet? Probably not, but we are starting to."" He says tackling it will require a change in the psyche of the police and other authorities to see young drugs traffickers as victims not criminals. ""It makes an enormous difference. You get it right, the whole process changes because you don't have that person in the dock, you start looking for someone else to put in the dock."" Sarah Newton, minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, said as well as new funding, the government had also taken measures including passing legislation to allow police to shut down the phone lines used to market drugs. ""It sends a very clear message that we will not tolerate this criminal activity."" *Michael's name has been changed to protect his identity.

Culture and concerts where IS once reigned,"A Peace Festival was held in Mosul weeks after IS was ousted For almost three years, while her home city of Mosul was under occupation by so-called Islamic State (IS), Tahani Salih kept a daily diary documenting their crimes. Tahani, now 27, filled almost 500 pages with her experiences and those of her family and friends, as well as her hopes and dreams for the time when IS would be defeated. ""Just before our neighbourhood was liberated, IS began to harass people and force their way into their homes to carry out searches. One day I took out those hand-written pages and started to reread them, and I was shocked,"" she said. ""I realised that the content could put my life and my family at risk, as well as people I had mentioned in my diary. So I had no choice but to destroy those papers. ""I sat down, and started to burn one page at a time. Later, I blamed myself for not hiding my diary or burying it in our garden."" The joy and sadness of returning to Mosul What's left of Mosul War against IS: In maps and charts IS: The full story Although the diary is gone, Tahani remembers every word of the plans she made. Now IS has been defeated, Tahani is throwing herself into putting them in place. The young woman - who has been trained and supported by the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) - is one of a new group of Mosulite activists who are determined to not only rebuild the city but also help rehabilitate fellow residents traumatised by the events of the last three years. ""There are about 40 of us - we're ambitious, educated, respectable young people who love their city and fellow human beings, and want to have a decent future,"" she said. Tahani's own priority is to ensure that young women like herself can get involved. ""We live in a culture in which women think it's improper to speak up, or to work outside the home or lead a campaign, which is not true. I know girls who are very strong and motivated, but are scared of harassment or are being forced to stay at home by their families. ""People need to know that being a girl is not shameful,"" she continued, arguing that a culture of fear and repression was ""the very condition that helped IS come in"". Tahani Salih (R) with Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai in Irbil in July So when Tahani got involved with an ambitious scheme torestore Mosul university's library, which was destroyed by IS during the occupation, she delighted in encouraging other young women to defy gender stereotypes. Herself one of the first to enter the bombed-out library, she remembers seeing ""a boy approaching a girl carrying five or six heavy books. ""He said: 'No, you don't have to carry that much. It's too heavy for you, just carry what you can.' She said: 'Of course I can carry the books, I've come to do just that. Please do your work and carry books, and I'll carry mine.'"" Tahani also put together a football tournament for the library project's volunteers, initially forming one for men and one for women, before deciding this looked too much like gender segregation. To her colleagues' astonishment, she mixed the teams together - an unprecedented move that proved successful. ""The next day, they brought the ball, and said: 'Let's play again.' So we did."" Tahani said that it was not just Mosul's physical fabric that needed rebuilding; it was crucial to harness young people's enthusiasm for freedom in the first few months of liberation. Art and other expressions of culture were banned under IS for three years ""So we started with cultural events - books, music, festivals, colours, painting, photography. ""We wanted to draw media attention to Mosul so that a young person could see his or her image on a global platform and admire themselves and realise their value."" Tahani organised the first concert in the city after IS' defeat, with live music played in front of the university campus. The University of Mosul was heavily damaged in the fight against IS ""One of the girls took me by the hand and told me: 'Tahani, this is the first time I feel really alive,'"" she recalled. And together with some friends, Tahani set up a Facebook page calledWomen of Mosul,external, a place where they could air views and share ideas for projects. The work by young Mosulites like Tahani seems to be gaining some traction. Last month, a day-long peace festival set up by other activists drew a crowd of 25,000 people to the city's main stadium. But Tahani said there was much more to be done, arguing that true success would come when women felt totally free to walk on the street without wearing hijab, or when a bar selling alcohol could function freely in the centre of the city. Tahani said people in Mosul ""need to know that being a girl is not shameful"" ""Only then will I be reassured that the city has begun to truly accept everyone, and accept the world."" That seems a long way away, given the conservative attitudes still dominant in the city. Many fear that former IS supporters remain in the city, trying to blend into the civilian population. Tahani acknowledges that she has received threats over her activism, but refuses to be intimidated. ""If I get scared, then I'll have to return to just sitting at home, which I won't accept. There's no way I will go back to that and forget all my hopes and dreams, no matter the price.""

Why Zimbabwe has a 'Minister of WhatsApp',"Zimbabweans jokingly refer to the newly appointed cyber security tsar as the ""Minister of WhatsApp"" A spoof government notice hit social media as soon as President Robert Mugabe announced he had set up a new ministry responsible for Cyber Security, Threat Detection and Mitigation. Zimbabweans reacted with customary humour to the letter, which faked the signature and letterhead of the newly appointed cyber minister - Patrick Chinamasa - and instructed all WhatsApp group members to register with the ministry by November. The letter was signed ""By The Cyber Powers Vested In Me"". But the jokes have since subsided, and Zimbabweans are now considering what the new ministry will mean for their civil liberties - especially freedom of speech. Zimbabwe's government has been uneasy about social media after pastor Evan Mawararire spearheaded the #ThisFlag movement last year. Zimbabwe's pastor 'hero': #ThisFlag preacher Zimbabwe shutdown: What is behind the protests? Using platforms like Twitter and Facebook it organised a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade. President Robert Mugabe's spokesperson, George Charamba, says Mr Mugabe came up with the idea of a new ministry to deal with an ""emerging threat to the state... a threat founded on abuse and unlawful conduct"". Social media is possibly the primary platform Zimbabweans use to communicate and receive news. It is thriving despite restrictive laws governing freedom of expression. Over the last 16 years, internet usage in the country has grown from 0.3% penetration to 46%, data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) shows. Several TV stations and online publications, some operating from the diaspora, use the internet to disseminate news out of the reach of the government. #ThisFlag protestors brought Harare to a standstill last year When petrol stations ran out of fuel last month, there were dramatic scenes of long queues at supermarket as Zimbabweans stocked up, anticipating food shortages. Worried by these events, the government blamed social media messages for spreading panic. ""Social media was abused to create a sense of panic, thereby creating some sort of destabilising in the economy,"" says Mr Charamba. The new cyber security minister, Mr Chinamasa, agrees. He commented at the time, before his appointment, that ""the cause basically was social media"". ""It means it's a security issue,"" he adds. ""It is also a political agenda, a regime change agenda. We are going to look at what exactly happened with a view to take corrective measures in the security arena."" But others say the government's stance is a threat to civil liberties. One communications rights group, the Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (Misa), says this new scrutiny of social media goes against the spirit of the constitution and freedom of expression. ""These unfortunate threats have resulted in self-censorship by [individuals] when engaging on topical issues affecting the country,"" it said in a statement. It also criticises censorship of Zimbabwe's media, ""who have on occasion been chastised for incorporating citizen opinion as expressed online in their reportage"". How African governments block social media Going a step further, Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says the government's new cyber threat ministry is a means for government to spy on its people. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also believes that the ministry has been created to curb free speech in time for the 2018 polls. ""Mugabe... will do whatever it takes to control and muzzle social media in order to suppress public discontent against his regime,"" he said. ""However the good news is that the regime has no capacity to suppress the use of social media."" Many Zimbabweans have reacted wryly to the news of the creation of a cyber minister, referring to Mr Chinamasa as the ""Minister of WhatsApp"". Allow Twitter content?

Zimbabwe already has several pieces of legislation which rights groups say curb freedom of expression. Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says that since 2010, it has assisted more than 100 people arrested under a law which makes it a jailable offence to ""insult the president"" and ""undermine his authority"". Ordinary people have been arrested and charged for calling the 93-year-old leader ""old"", ""a donkey"" and even for accusing him of ruining the country. The Zimbabwean government has said new legislation will not stifle freedom of expression and will protect the public from new threats such as revenge pornography and cyber attacks. Presidential spokesperson Mr Charamba says Zimbabwe will look closely at how other nations have dealt with the threat of cybercrime - including Russia, China, and South Korea ""who have faced similar challenges"". While several countries around the world have anti-cyber crime departments and agencies, Zimbabwe is among the first to create an entire ministry. Meanwhile on social media, ominous warnings have begun circulating. One is from a ""Mr Chaipa"", urging Zimbabweans only to share content on social media that they would be able to defend in court. Mr Chaipa said it was easy for the government to monitor online messages, and gave a list of online activities that could be classified as criminal offences. ""In the coming months a lot of people will be arrested and used as examples to deter people from 'abusing' social media towards the elections,"" he warns. ""Don't be made an example.""

Briton fighting against IS killed in Syria,"This video can not be played Jac Holmes told the BBC why he went to fight IS, in an interview recorded weeks before he was killed A British man who has been fighting so-called Islamic State in Syria has been killed while clearing landmines in Raqqa, the BBC understands. Jac Holmes had been fighting with Kurdish militia the YPG since 2015. Kurdish representatives in the UK said they had been told by YPG officials the former IT worker from Bournemouth was killed while he was clearing an area to make it safe for civilians. His mother, Angie Blannin, said the 24-year-old was a ""hero in my eyes"". She told the BBC: ""He loved what he was doing there, he loved being a soldier. He had the courage of his convictions. ""He was just a boy when he left the UK, a little bit lost. He told me he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. But by going out there, he found something that he was good at and that he loved."" Ms Blannin, from Dover, Kent, said she had not seen Jac for over a year, but that they regularly kept in touch online and had been making plans for him coming home. This video can not be played Speaking in 2015, Jac Holmes' mother, Angie Blannin, said her son was a ""grown man who makes his own decisions"" ""He stuck by his convictions because he wanted to be there and he wanted to see the end of Raqqa and to see the end of the caliphate. That was a moment in history, and he wanted to be part of it."" ""We thought with any luck he'd be home for Christmas. It had been so tough since he had been away but I was always 100% behind him."" ""After all this, he had said he might go into politics, or perhaps into close protection security. He'd seen so much for a boy of his age."" Ozkan Ozdil, who also fought with Mr Holmes in Syria, told the BBC his friend had become well-known and respected among Kurdish fighting units. He said: ""Everybody knew Jac. By his third tour out there his Kurdish was fluent. We had a bit of a laugh that he was my Kurdish translator. ""He spoke so fondly about Rojava [the name given to the Kurdish region of north east Syria]. He was the reason that made me want to go."" During the battle for the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Mr Holmes became part of a four-man sniper unit Mr Holmes also was known by his Kurdish nom de guerre Sores Amanos - ""sores"" meaning ""revolution"". He was one of a number of British volunteers who travelled out tofight against ISwith the Kurds during the Syrian conflict. Briton shot in IS battle As a former IT worker, Mr Holmes had no prior military training, but he became one of the longest-serving foreign volunteers in the conflict. Since 2015, he had travelled to fight with the Kurds three times, and spent more than a year there on his third trip. ""He loved being out there, he loved the people around him. He had a purpose and he was happy,"" said Mr Ozdil. Mr Holmes (far left) had been sharing pictures and videos of his experiences in Syria on Facebook Mr Holmes fought in operations to push IS out of key towns and villages including Tel Hamis, Manbij, Tabqa and Raqqa. He always knew he could face arrest from UK authorities for fighting abroad, but had previously told the BBC ""you just have to hope that our justice system works in the correct way"". During the battle for the IS stronghold of Raqqa, he became part of afour-man sniper unitmade up of international fighters who, like him, had joined the conflict voluntarily. In the ""223 YPG Sniper Unit"" Mr Holmes fought alongside three others from Spain, the US and Germany. As the fighting for Raqqa intensified, the unit had some narrow escapes. He described on Facebook how they had survived coming close to IS car bombs and being ambushed by jihadist fighters. On Sunday, Mr Holmes posted video of himself on Facebook walking into Raqqa's central sports stadium for the first time since the battle for the city ended. He wrote: ""We spent weeks seeing this place from hundreds of metres away. It was strange walking the streets and finally going inside."" Mr Holmes was photographed guarding a post in north west Syria with the YPG During his time in Syria, he conducted many interviews with various media outlets, even appearing on Kurdish television outlets giving interviews in Kurdish. Through hismedia appearancesand the amount of interest in the exploits of this young man from Bournemouth, Mr Holmes drew wider attention to the role the Kurds were playing in the conflict. Another friend from London, Alan Sahin, told the BBC: ""We could see how much he grew up while he was out there. He found his purpose there. He turned from a young lad into a man."" He described how a close circle had had the news of his death relayed to them from Syria just as they were attending Parliament on Monday evening for a Kurdish event. ""It's gut-wrenching, as Raqqa had just finished,"" said Mr Sahin. ""Jac would have gone on to do good things."" The Home Office has warned against all travel to Syria. Other former British YPG fighters, along with others who knew Mr Holmes, gathered at the Kurdish Community Centre on Monday evening to pay tribute to their friend and comrade. Mr Sahin said ""At his age, to go into a war zone with no experience, ask anyone else in Britain and they'd say you're insane. But there he was, he went out there and was doing it. Even though he knew the danger, you couldn't help but feel he was brave. I had respect for him, admiration even."" IT worker's fight against IS in Raqqa.

Was a 100-year-old tribal artist exploited at a tattoo show?,"Tribal tattoo master Whang-Od was in Manila to showcase her craft Excitement and fervour at a colourful tattoo show in the Philippines turned into outrage after a celebrated tribal artist's appearance was criticised for being ""blatantly exploitive"". But is it all so simple? Legendary tattoo master Whang-Od was transported from her tribal village of Buscalan to the capital for theManila FAME trade show,external, with the help of the Philippine Army and Air Force. The centenarian, believed to be the country's oldest traditional tattoo artist, performed her ancient craft of hand-tapped Filipino tattoos at the weekend event. Whang-Od hails from a remote mountain tribe in the hills of northern Kalinga province. Her artistry has seen her credited with""single-handedly keeping an ancient tradition alive"",external. Using just a few simple tools (thorns from a pomelo tree, bamboo sticks and coal), she has spent thepast eight decadesinking not only headhunting warriors and women of her tribe but a new wave of ""tattoo tourists"" like Carlo Mangoba, 34. Reviving the art of Filipino tribal tattoos ""My tattoo (of a serpent eagle) is a sign of honour and the mark of someone willing to make the difficult trip up north to meet the great master Whang-Od,"" he shared with BBC News. ""After all, she is already widely regarded as a great Filipina artist and icon."" To many Filipinos, the elderly Whang-Od symbolises a dying ancient tradition With a focus on ""celebrating the rich cultural heritage of the Philippines"", organising director Clayton Tugonon said that the institution wanted to support her uniquely traditional art. ""She symbolises the pure talent of Filipinos,"" he said in a statement to the BBC, adding that her invitation was ""sought through proper channels"", which included village elders and indigenous committees. Bearing in mind her health and age, a ""dedicated medical team"" certified that she was fit to travel. Ambulances were also placed on standby throughout the two-day event, Mr Tugonon added. But was flying this tattoo legend out to Manila more beneficial to her art or the organisers? The issues at play are difficult. While organisers have insisted that all money will go to her tribe, many netizens felt having the famed tribal tattoo master work at the trade show was ""a blatant act of exploitation"". In a photo thatswiftly went viral on Facebook,external, Whang-Od was photographed sleeping at a panel conference at the event. It drew tens of thousands of angry reactions from Filipinos on the site, who speculated that she was being ill treated and ""exploited"" for her craft. Allow Twitter content?

Medical care organised by the show was on hand should she need it, but many are also accusing the event of degrading a complex art.

Totattoo artist Richard Tat,external, traditional tattoos like the ones perfected by Whang-Od take ""a huge amount of time"" and could prove tiring during a trade show.

But photojournalist Miguel Guzman was at the event to capture the excitement around the celebrated centenarian and he says it was not her lack of energy that was a concern. ""It was her first time in Manila. There were a lot of people who were excited to see her and to get tattoos from her and she was definitely happy. But I wouldn't say she was exploited. Organisers did take good care of her to ensure she was in good health,"" Mr Guzman explained. ""I saw her myself and I wouldn't say she was tired. The problem I felt going on was the lack of translation and communication. A lot of people around her were speaking in English and Tagalog and where she's from, she can't understand that, she would only know her local dialect,"" he added. Many might argue that such shows are one way of ensuring the tradition gets the attention it deserves to ensure its survival as a core part of the Philippine national heritage. Many who saw her in Manila were charmed by her presence and her legendary tattoo skills But for purists the value of the craft remains its exclusivity, a celebration of why it is just so hard to get.  Carlos Mangoba had this to say: ""I feel sad for those in Manila who got tattooed by her during the event instead of making pilgrimage to see Apo Whang-od in her home village like I did. They clearly missed out on a full experience from such a master. ""After all, she is already widely regarded as a great artist and icon even before this trade show. In this sense, I think the Manila tattoo show needed her more than she needed them."" Additional reporting by Virma Simonette in Manila.

Brit Marling makes Weinstein claims,"Actress and writer Brit Marling has described an encounter with Harvey Weinstein in which she claims the movie mogul suggested they shower together. The co-creator of paranormal Netflix drama The OA is the latest to accuse the producer of sexual harassment. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. Many details of the 2014 incident she recounts,in an essay for The Atlantic,external, are similar to those alleged by other women. Weinstein assistant was ""paid for silence"" George Clooney and Matt Damon speak out on Weinstein Weinstein Co faces harassment inquiry She tweeted that she wanted the article, about gender politics and the issue of consent, to ""give myself and others solace, strength and context"".

Marling, who also starred in and produced The OA, a television series first aired last year, wrote in the piece that she agreed to meet Weinstein and went to the hotel ""thinking that perhaps my entire life was about to change for the better"". She said she, like others have claimed, was asked to meet him in a bar before a female assistant said the meeting had been moved to his suite. Marling said her guard went up but she was reassured by the presence of another woman - then feeling ""terror in the pit of my stomach"" when she was left alone with him. The accusers' stories Did everyone really know? How the scandal unfolded ""I, too, was asked if I wanted a massage, champagne, strawberries,"" she wrote. ""I, too, sat in that chair paralyzed by mounting fear when he suggested we shower together. What could I do? How not to offend this man, this gatekeeper, who could anoint or destroy me? ""It was clear that there was only one direction he wanted this encounter to go in, and that was sex or some version of an erotic exchange. I was able to gather myself together - a bundle of firing nerves, hands trembling, voice lost in my throat - and leave the room. ""I later sat in my hotel room alone and wept. I wept because I had gone up the elevator when I knew better. I wept because I had let him touch my shoulders. I wept because at other times in my life, under other circumstances, I had not been able to leave."" Allegations against Weinstein are subject to criminal investigations in three cities She praised all of the ""courageous"" women who have come forward to speak out against Weinstein in recent weeks. Marling said she believes it was the writer in her who left the room, adding: ""The writer knew that even if this very powerful man never gave her a job in any of his films, even if he blacklisted her from other films, she could make her own work on her own terms and thus keep a roof over her head."" On the issue of consent, she said Weinstein could give actresses a career and fame, ""which is one of few ways for women to gain some semblance of power and voice inside a patriarchal world"". She added: ""Weinstein could also ensure that these women would never work again if they humiliated him. That's not just artistic or emotional exileâthat's also economic exile."" Marling, who has co-written, co-produced and starred in films Another Earth and Sound of My Voice, wrote: ""Consent is a function of power. You have to have a modicum of power to give it."" Allegations against 65-year-old Weinstein are subject to criminal investigations in London, Los Angeles and New York.  He is also undercivil rights investigationin New York state.

'Internet trolls ruined my life',"This video can not be played Victoria, whose full name the BBC has chosen not to use, says her face was superimposed on pornographic images shared on social media A teenager claims internet trolls ""ruined her life"" by superimposing her face on pornographic messages that were shared on social media. Victoria, from Leeds, was told to ""go kill yourself"" on the Live.me streaming app and her home address was shared on Twitter as a ""house to burgle"". Figures obtained by BBC Yorkshire show reports of malicious communication have almost doubled to more than 200 a day. There were 79,372 offences recorded in 2016, up from 42,910 the year before. Police forces in England and Wales were asked to provide the data, with 38 out of 43 responding. West Yorkshire Police said investigations into Victoria's case were ongoing Victoria, 18, had open profiles on Live.me, Twitter and Instagram, where she had thousands of followers. She said she was sent pornographic images that featured her face and had photographs of her house shared online, while another message to her simply said ""die"". ""I'm on anxiety tablets now. It's knocked my confidence. I don't even go out of the house that much,"" she said. ""There's still that thought in the back of my mind, where you never know if they are going to be there while you are out. ""At the end of the day, this has legit just ruined my life. I used to be an outgoing person. I'm just trying to get back to my old self."" Fast growing Live video streaming application Has approximately 20 million users to date Users have no control over who shares their videos Likes and electronic gifts raise a users online ranking In August 2017 a man was convicted after forcing a nine-year-old child to expose herself in a video that has been viewed more than 200 times. Victoria went to the police about the malicious communication - defined as sending a letter or electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety - but no arrests were made. She said: ""Sometimes I feel like it's my fault. But it's easier for people to get targeted because they're putting themselves out there on the internet, which I thought was just fun, to make new friends. ""I never thought it would turn out like this."" Supt Mat Davison said West Yorkshire Police was investigating Victoria's case and new lines of inquiry would be acted on. ""Officers have been in regular contact with the victim and members of her family and provided them with updates on the progress of the investigation,"" he added. The Times recently reportednine people are arrested each day,externalfor posting offensive material online, sparking criticism from human rights groups about ""over-policing"" of the internet. However, Essex Police Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said the rise in malicious communication was ""the tip of the iceberg"". Twitter plans to impose new restrictions on pornographic and hateful imagery to tackle abuse The chairman of the Digital Policing Board, which deals with digital crime nationally, said social network providers should do more to protect online users. ""I think as policing and society changes in to the digital age this is only going to increase,"" Mr Kavanagh said. ""Providers, government, law enforcers and users all need to get ready how we protect people more effectively, and how we bring criminals to justice."" Dr Michelle Newberry, senior lecturer in forensic psychology at Sheffield Hallam University, said there was a correlation between how much we use social media and the increase in trolling. She said: ""It is very unusual for people not to have their phone with them. We just have that instant access these days."" Twitter previously said it planned to imposenew restrictions on pornographic and hateful imageryto tackle abuse. A spokesperson for Live.me said: ""Our goal at Live.me is to create a safe and friendly environment for all of our users which is why it's always heartbreaking to hear stories of users being harassed or bullied.

Operating theatres 'waste two hours a day',"NHS hospitals could carry out 280,000 more non-emergency operations a year by organising operating theatre schedules better, a new study suggests. The research, which looked at data from 2016, found more than two hours were wasted each day on the average operating list. The study says avoidable factors like late starts led to the loss of time. The analysis, seen by the BBC ahead of publication, looked at theatres in 100 NHS Trusts in England. A total of 1.64 million routine surgical procedures were carried out in 2016, including eye, ear, nose and throat operations and orthopaedic procedures.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Routine operations are considered non-emergency, and each surgical team will have a daily operating theatre list of patients who are scheduled to go under the knife. Waiting times for routine operations are going up and there is an ongoing debate over whether more money is needed for the NHS or whether it could be more efficient. The report, by regulator NHS Improvement, says it is not a question of getting surgeons to work harder. Instead, planning lists more effectively and reducing late starts and early finishes would have made a big difference, it argues. Working hard to eliminate last minute cancellations by better pre-op planning enabled one hospital to significantly improve its performance. The health regulator is keen to get hospitals to make better use of their assets. NHS Improvement's Steve Russell says: ""We hope this analysis will enable them to identify bottlenecks within their systems to ensure operations are scheduled more appropriately and more patients receive the care they need quickly."" Croydon University Hospital started overhauling the way it runs operating theatres two years ago. Pre-op assessments now take place much earlier, meaning late cancellations, which leave slots empty, are less of a problem. Patients are also sent reminders ahead of the procedure. Together this has reduced on-the-day cancellations from 12% to 7%. Theatre staff also arrive earlier to ensure lists start on time and sessions are allowed to overrun to stop early finishes when doctors consider there is not enough time to operate on the last patient of the day. It means the trust is able to see more than 1,200 more cases than it did in 2015-16, bringing in an extra Â£1.9m of income. Surgeon Stella Vig says the changes have made a ""huge difference to the numbers of patients we've been able to get through our theatres"". The medical world does not dispute the idea that the health service could make better use of facilities but some argue that it shouldn't be seen as an answer to all the problems. See how the NHS is performing in your area Doctors warn over cancer op cancellations Surgeons 'kick heels' amid bed shortages How do you meet the NHS's funding demands? Professor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, says many of the problems are caused by bed occupancy rates in hospitals being too high. ""The logjam effect is a very major problem because the hospitals are completely full virtually all of the time,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""So if you need an intensive care bed and yesterday's patient is not well enough to leave the intensive care unit, that day's operating list cannot start. ""It's frustrating and it's very wasteful,"" he added. Resolving some of the causes of inefficiency could also be outside the scope of the NHS. Some of the unused theatre time could be explained by problems finding beds for those who need to stay as in-patients. Delayed transfers from hospital of medically fit patients because of shortcomings with social care have put pressure on bed capacity. The idea that some operating theatre capacity might be lying idle will be used as ammunition by those who say efficiency should be the health service's main priority. But is it really that simple? Doing more operations when highly skilled surgeons and theatre staff are there anyway for their lists makes sense. The hospital is paying the salaries and overheads so it's logical to get through as much work as possible. But while extra operations bring in more income for the hospitals, they still have to be paid for by local health commissioning groups and their resources are stretched already. The efficiency versus more money debate will not be resolved definitively. The NHS has to find ways of doing more for the same amount of money, with patient demand rising faster than the resources available. But that will not stop calls for a significant boost in government funding for the NHS beyond what is currently planned. Read more from Hugh NHS Improvement's study excluded all lists which were cancelled and ruled out any unused time which was less than average for a surgeon. It also allowed for 5% of time to be lost owing to last minute cancellations.

I met a homeless addict and recognised a childhood friend,"A chance meeting between two childhood friends helped one begin a journey back from drug addiction after many years living on the street. It was early October and Wanja Mwaura, 32, was on her way to the market in Lower Kabaete, not far from Nairobi, when she heard someone shout out her name. She looked up and was surprised to see a tall man with bulging eyes, an emaciated frame, dirtied black overalls and an equally stained thick woollen hat, sitting on the side of the road. She did not recognise him. But when Patrick ""Hinga"" Wanjiru, 34, introduced himself, Wanja says she found herself in shock. Standing before her was a  friend she had known since she was seven years old. ""Patrick, or Hinga as we called him, and I had met at primary school in 1992,"" says Wanja, who is a nurse from Kiambu County, just outside the Kenyan capital. ""Hinga used to be a great soccer player all throughout school. We nicknamed him 'Pele'."" Hinga was estranged from his parents and lived with his grandmother in a squat. When she couldn't afford to pay his school fees, he was forced to skip classes. Eventually they were evicted even from the squat. But against all the odds, Hinga did well in his exams, until his grandmother died - then he dropped out of school and his life began to take a downward trajectory. Hinga started abusing drugs, first marijuana and then heroin. He spent hours sifting through garbage to find things he could sell on the streets. Hinga and Wanja lost touch. When they met again, more than 15 years later, Hinga had been homeless for more than a decade. He looked nothing like the childhood friend who had once been known as ""Pele"". Sensing Wanja's dismay, Hinga reassured her that he had only wanted to say hello. She asked him if she could buy him lunch. At a local cafe, she ordered the dish she remembered had been his favourite years earlier - pork ribs and mashed potatoes. She said he appeared distracted, unable to finish sentences. ""I gave him my mobile telephone number and told him to call me if he needed anything,"" Wanja says. Over the next couple of days, Hinga borrowed phones and would regularly call his childhood friend, often just to hear her voice for a chat. He told her that he was committed to getting clean from drugs. ""I decided then, that something needed to be done to help him,"" Wanja says. Taking to social media, Wanja appealed to her friends to see if she could raise funds for drug rehabilitation. ""Rehab here is very expensive and I had no ways of raising funds on my own,"" she says. ""We set up a crowdfunding page, but we only managed to raise around 41,000 Kenyan shillings (Â£300) initially. However the cost of nine days rehabilitation at Chiromo Lane Medical Center in Nairobi was more than 100,000 KES. ""I wasn't sure how we would be able to cover this."" But Wanja had promised to help Hinga, so she took him to the centre anyway, unsure how they would cover the cost. A spokesperson for the rehab programme says Hinga was a dedicated patient, who committed fully to the nine-day detox. Within days Hinga had gained weight and his concentration improved.Wanja took to Facebook,externalto speak about her pride at her friend's transformation in such a short period of time. ""A week ago Hinga and I couldn't hold a normal conversation without me trying to hold his head up with my hand in order for him to concentrate. Today we can have a normal conversation with him confidently looking at me,"" she wrote. Mombasa businessman Fauz Khalid spotted Wanja's public post on Facebook and said he wanted to share the story on a wider platform. He posted the photos on Twitter and his post has now been shared more than 50,000 times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After that, the Kenyan media began to cover the story and Chiromo Lane Medical Center agreed to waive the entire fee for Hinga's treatment. Wanja says this was ""a blessing"", but she was keen for her friend to undergo a more sustained recovery, and is now raising funds for him to follow a 90-day programme at The Retreat Rehabilitation Centre, where he is currently staying. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 55,000 Kenyans inject heroin but Kenya does not have a government-funded rehabilitation facility According to theInternational Drugs Policy Consortium,external, heroin was used first in cities which were transit points (such as Mombasa) before spreading to Nairobi and other parts of the country The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse,external, a Kenyan government research body, says it is monitoring 25,000 intravenous drug users around the country - the number of people who snort heroin could be even higher, according to the Anti-Narcotics Unit officials Most of the world's heroin is produced in Afghanistan, and reaches markets in Europe and North America via Central Asia and the Balkans - but the quantity of heroin seized off the coast of Kenya and neighbouring Tanzaniahas increased exponentially in the last eight years,external, leading the UN to conclude that the ""Southern Route"" is growing in importance ""Unfortunately, there is still great stigma around drug abuse in Kenya,"" Wanja says. This may be one reason why the government doesn't provide free drug rehab treatment. ""Rehabs are expensive and out of reach for many people, not only in Kenya but also the greater part of Africa. I am committed to crowdsourcing so I can support my friend at this time,"" says Wanja. ""Wanja is an angel sent from God. I owe her my life. She has stuck with me more closely than a brother or a sister,"" Hinga tells the BBC. On Twitter several users echoed this sentiment. Abraham Wilbourneâ, a financial analyst from Nairobi, told Wanja ""You have a seat in heaven!"" Many called her a ""mashujaa"", which means ""hero"" in Swahili. ""People say I changed Hinga's life, but he changed mine too."" says Wanja. ""I realise now that a small act can change a person's life.""

Weinstein assistant 'paid Â£125k for silence',"This video can not be played George Clooney and Matt Damon spoke out over the Harvey Weinstein accusations A British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein says she was paid Â£125,000 ($165,200) to keep quiet after accusing the movie mogul of sexual harassment. Zelda Perkins told the Financial Times,externalshe signed a non-disclosure agreement in 1998 after making the accusations. She said he asked her to give him massages and tried to pull her into bed, but she ""was made to feel ashamed for disclosing his behaviour"". Weinstein has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex ""unequivocally"". The former assistant said she reported her allegations after a female colleague told her she had also been sexually harassed by the film producer. The two women subsequently sought damages and were awarded a sum of Â£250,000 ($330,500), split equally, but also signed a non-disclosure agreement, prohibiting them from discussing the allegations. By breaking the agreement, Ms Perkins could be liable to repay the settlement, and potentially pay damages and other legal fees stipulated in the contract. The accusers' stories Did everyone really know? How the scandal unfolded However, she told the Financial Times: ""I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement. ""Unless somebody does this there won't be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under."" She claims that the film executive would ask her to massage him while he was in his underwear, when they were alone in hotel rooms. Her testimony is similar to that of a number of Hollywood actresses -Lupita Nyong'o and Gwyneth Paltrowboth claimed Weinstein suggested a massage in his bedroom and hotel room respectively. This video can not be played ""It was an open secret"" a producer tells the BBC Ms Perkins added that she often had to wake him up in the morning and ""he would try to pull me into bed"". Weinstein has apologised for the way he has ""behaved with colleagues in the past"" and acknowledged that his actions have ""caused a lot of pain"". However, he has said many of the accusations against him are ""patently false"", and in a statement to the FT, said he had ""confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances"". Ms Perkins is one of scores of accusers who have come forward after a New York Times investigation into Weinstein's conduct. Actress Rose McGowanclaimed that she reached a $100,000 (Â£84,000) settlement with Weinstein in 1997 after an alleged incident in a hotel room at the Sundance Film Festival. The New York Times said a legal document confirming the settlement stipulated it was ""not to be construed as an admission"", but intended to ""avoid litigation and buy peace"". Allegations against the 65-year-old are subject to criminal investigations in London, Los Angeles and New York. He is also undercivil rights investigationin New York state.

Google phone hit by 'burn in' problems,"A faintly burned-in area, underneath the emergency text, is something only usually seen in older, worn out devices Googleâs new flagship smartphones have been hit by complaints about the quality of the screens. Tech reviewers, who have had the larger of the two devices for about a fortnight, noticed âburn inâ on its display. Others noted âmuddyâ discolouration on the screen. Google said it was investigating the issue, which it took âvery seriouslyâ. Googleâs new line, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, are its attempt to take a bigger share of the smartphone market. Last yearâs Pixel was well-received by reviewers, but sold poorly. It accounted for just 0.5% of the global market. The Pixel 2 was made by HTC, while the Pixel 2 XL was made by LG. A Pixel 2 XL review unit provided to the BBC by Google suffered from mild burn-in - the term given to when a screen is permanently marked by images that have been on screen for an extended period of time. Burn-in is typical of old screens, but should not happen on a new high-end smartphone. On the Google device, the navigation bar that is often at the bottom of the screen could be seen faintly when it should not have been visible. âWe take all reports of issues very seriously, and our engineers investigate quickly,â said Mario Queiroz, Googleâs vice president for the Pixel range. âWe will provide updates as soon as we have conclusive data.â The worst case scenario for Google would be a halt to production of the Pixel - which has already seen shipping delays of up to a month - and potentially a recall for devices already shipped. ""Not a great start for sure,â said Carolina Milanesi, a Silicon Valley-based analyst for Creative Strategies. âThis was Google's big step into really going for the devices market, broadening the breath of the products. It raises the question of whether they can actually take on this much.â The news follows complaints over a separate Google product, the Google Home Mini voice assistant. It was discovered to have been listening in to conversations without usersâ knowledge because of a faulty button.Google has since disabled the feature.

Xi 'most powerful leader since Mao',"This video can not be played Xi to delegates: Is anyone against me? China's ruling Communist Party has voted to enshrine Xi Jinping's name and ideology in its constitution, elevating him to the level of founder Mao Zedong. The unanimous vote to incorporate ""Xi Jinping Thought"" happened at the end of the Communist Party congress, China's most important political meeting. Mr Xi has steadily increased his grip on power since becoming leader in 2012. This move means that any challenge to Mr Xi will now be seen as a threat to Communist Party rule. More than 2,000 delegates gathered in Beijing's Great Hall of the People for the final approval process to enshrine ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era"" into the Communist Party constitution of China. At the end of the process, delegates were asked if they had any objections, to which they responded with loud cries of ""none"", reported journalists at the scene. Allow Twitter content?

Previous Chinese Communist Party leaders have had their ideologies incorporated into theparty's constitution,externalor thinking, but none, besides founder Mao Zedong, have had their philosophy described as ""thought"", which is at the top of the ideological hierarchy. Only Mao and Deng Xiaoping have had their names attached to their ideologies - and Deng's name was only added to the constitution after his death. How China's Communist Party picks leaders The Thoughts of Chairman Xi How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts By Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor, Beijing The change to the constitution puts Xi Jinping (left) on par with party founder Mao Zedong (right) China's new slogan hardly trips off the tongue. But schoolchildren, college students and staff at state factories will now have to join 90 million Communist Party members in studying ""Xi Jinping Thought"" on the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The expression ""new era"" is the party's way of saying this is the third chapter of modern China. If the first was Chairman Mao uniting a country devastated by civil war, and the second was getting rich under Deng Xiaoping, this new era is about even more unity and wealth at the same time as making China disciplined at home and strong abroad. Enshrining all of this under Xi Jinping's name in the party constitution means rivals cannot now challenge China's strongman without threatening Communist Party rule. At first glance, ""Xi Jinping Thought"" may seem like vague rhetoric, but it describes the communist ideals Mr Xi has continuously espoused throughout his rule. Its 14 main principles emphasise the Communist Party's role in governing every aspect of the country, and also include: A call for ""complete and deep reform"" and ""new developing ideas"" A promise of ""harmonious living between man and nature"" - this is a call for improved environmental conservation, and could refer to the stated aim to have the bulk of China's energy needs supplied by renewables An emphasis on ""absolute authority of the party over the people's army"" - which comes amidwhat analysts callthe largest turnover of senior military officials in modern Chinese history An emphasis on the importance of ""'one country two systems"" and reunification with the motherland - a clear reference to Hong Kong and Taiwan More than 2,000 delegates have spent the week-long congress confirming picks for provincial party chiefs, governors and heads of some state-owned enterprises. On Tuesday, they finalised the make-up of top bodies such as the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Last weeka top official claimed high-ranking Communist Party members had plotted to seize power from President Xi, in suggestions of a behind-the-scenes power struggle. The alleged plotters have all been arrested or jailed as part of a corruption crackdown, seen by some as a way for Mr Xi to eliminate political opponents. Profile: China's powerful president What do ordinary Chinese think of the CPC? Charting China's 'great purge' under Xi On Wednesday, the new Central Committee will decide who gets to be in the higher-level Politburo. Though delegates get some say, in reality the elections are guided by the party's top leadership where at each stage voters pick from pre-selected candidates. This video can not be played How a student counsellor sees the Communist Party Congress Also on Wednesday, the party will reveal the new members of its pinnacle body, the Politburo Standing Committee. Mr Xi is widely expected to remain as party leader, while prominent Xi ally and anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan has stepped down and will not be in the next formation of the committee. Those in the Standing Committee will be especially scrutinised. Analysts say its make-up may give signs of how long Mr Xi plans to stay on at the top of the party - he is expected to remain at the helm until at least 2022 - or any possible successors.

Shipwreck find 'earliest navigation tool',"The instrument was once used by mariners to measure the altitude of the Sun during their voyages An artefact excavated from a shipwreck off the coast of Oman has been found to be the oldest known example of a type of navigational tool. Marine archaeologists say the object is an astrolabe, an instrument once used by mariners to measure the altitude of the Sun during their voyages. It is believed to date from between 1495 and 1500. The item was recovered from a Portuguese explorer which sank during a storm in the Indian Ocean in 1503. The boat was called the Esmeralda and was part of a fleet led by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first person to sail directly from Europe to India. This video can not be played Divers uncover 500-year-old Vasco da Gama fleet treasure David Mearns, from Blue Water Recovery, who led the excavation and is the author of The Shipwreck Hunter, told the BBC: ""It's a great privilege to find something so rare, something so historically important, something that will be studied by the archaeological community and fills in a gap."" The astrolabe was discovered by Mr Mearns in 2014, and was one of nearly 3,000 artefacts recovered during a series of dives. The bronze disc measures 17.5cm in diameter and is less than 2mm thick. ""It was like nothing else we had seen and I immediately knew it was something very important because you could see it had these two emblems on it,"" said Mr Mearns. ""One I recognised immediately as a Portuguese coat of arms... and another which we later discovered was the personal emblem of Don Manuel I, the King of Portugal at the time."" The excavation team believed the object was an astrolabe, but they could not see any navigational markings on it. However, a later analysis uncovered its hidden details. Laser scanning work carried out by scientists at the University of Warwick revealed etches around the edge of the disc, each separated by five degrees. The University of Warwick used laser scans to uncover etches on the astrolabe, which helped navigators work out the height of the sun This would have allowed mariners to measure the height of the sun above the horizon at noon to determine their location so they could find their way on the high seas. Mariners' astrolabes are relatively rare, and this is only the 108th to be confirmed catalogued. It is also the earliest known example by several decades. Mr Mearns said: ""We know it had to have been made before 1502, because that's when the ship left Lisbon and Dom Manuel didn't become King until 1495, and this astrolabe wouldn't have carried the emblem of the King unless he was King. ""I believe it's probably fair to say it dates roughly to between 1495 to 1500. Exactly what year we don't know - but it is in that narrow period."" He added: ""It rolls back this history by at least 30 years -  it adds to evolution, it adds to the history, and hopefully astrolabes from this period can be found.""

Pair revisit site of Kim Jong-nam murder,"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the alleged attack at the airport in February Two women charged with killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, are revisiting the crime scene in Malaysia. Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong were at Kuala Lumpur airport on Tuesday. The pair are accused of rubbingthe highly toxic VX nerve agenton Mr Kim's face as he waited for a flight. They have pleaded not guilty to murder, saying it was a TV prank and they were tricked by North Korean agents. Pyongyang has denied any involvement in the 13 February killing, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case. The women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam Main players in a mysterious killing Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? Kuala Lumpur International Airport was packed with journalists awaiting the women on Tuesday morning. The women arrived at the airport soon afterwards, and were seen wearing bulletproof vests. Policewomen held the arms of Doan Thu Huong (centre) as they walked into the terminal Journalists at the scene said Siti Aisyah (centre) looked overwhelmed at one point They were escorted by dozens of armed police officers wearing body armour. Halfway during the visit, Ms Aisyah burst into tears while Ms Huong also appeared unwell, reported AFP news agency. The women were given wheelchairs and officials pushed them around the terminal for the rest of the visit. They were accompanied by their lawyers and the judge presiding over the trial. The visit was aimed at giving those involved in the case a better understanding of the events. The group visited an airport cafe at one point during the visit. They were also taken to the check-in hall where Mr Kim appeared to have been attacked, and the medical centre where he sought assistance. If found guilty, the women face the death penalty. Their defence lawyers are likely to argue that the real culprits are North Korean agents who fled Malaysia. Mr Kim, who was in his mid-40s, was the estranged older half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. At the time of his death, he was believed to have been living in self-imposed exile in Macau and was thought to have had some links to China.

'My job is to put my arms around a bad guy',"The FBI have ensured Tamer El-Noury's true identity remains secret (file pic) An active FBI undercover agent has revealed details of his work infiltrating Islamic extremist groups. Tamer El-Noury - one of the agent's many false identities - talked to the BBC about his covert attempts to gain the trust of those planning attacks. He was instrumental in foiling the plot to derail the New York City to Toronto train route four years ago. He has published a book about his work, saying he wants Americans to understand his work as a Muslim operative. ""The fact is that these jihadists - these radicals that are popping up - are lost souls,"" he told the BBC in an interview. ""They latch on to hatred, and an evil that seems to give them purpose."" ""I am a Muslim and I am an American, and I am appalled at what these animals are doing to my country while desecrating my religion,"" he said. The son of Egyptian immigrants to the US, Mr El-Noury joined the police in New Jersey, where he worked to break up drug distribution networks. Later, he was recruited by the FBI who realised they were desperately short of Arabic speakers. This video can not be played ""Tamer El-Noury"" spoke to the BBC's Frank Gardner about his undercover life One of his undercover operations involved a plan to kill as many people as possible by derailing the New York - Toronto rail route. Tunisian migrant Chiheb Esseghaier, one of the key figures in the plot, was befriended by Mr El-Noury in a ""chance encounter"" arranged by the FBI. He was eventually recruited by Esseghaier, becoming a part of the plot. He posed as a wealthy American of Arabic origin who held a deep personal grudge - a persona, he said, he tried to keep close to the truth. ""None of my legends - none of my cover stories - have ever really drifted far from reality,"" he said. ""When you're travelling the world with an ideological extremist individual, and you're spending days - weeks - along with them, your true colours eventually come out when you get exhausted."" The long weeks spent with extremists, acting as confidant and close friend, ""is the hardest part,"" he said. El-Noury's book has been carefully vetted by the FBI ""My job is to put my arms around a bad guy. And of course, all these atrocities that we are planning are sickening to me."" ""The only way that I can be good at my job and have it believable is I try to latch on to whatever part is human... how well he speaks to his mother, how well he financially takes care of his siblings."" During a trip to New York Esseghaier began planning a future attack on Times Square in New York City on New Years' Eve, to take place after the train derailment, El-Noury told the CBS Sixty Minutes programme. During the same trip, the pair visited the site of the Twin Towers, where Esseghaier said the US ""needed another 9/11"". El-Noury told CBS he ""saw red"" and almost blew his cover over the remark. But none of the schemes ever came to fruition - both Esseghaier and Raed Jaser, a Canadian resident of Palestinian descent, were arrested in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison in 2015 on the back of El-Noury's investigation. Canada rail plotters get life in prison Mr El-Noury's story offers an extraordinary insight into the dark and dangerous world of going undercover as an agent, says the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardener. The FBI initially insisted on listening in on the telephone interview to ensure its active agent was protected, he said. The nature of the agent's work is deceptive - but he said that any accusation of being a traitor was something he considered a badge of honour. ""These traitors, these radicals are the ones desecrating my religion. I am proud to be a patriot, i am proud to be an American Muslim fighting the war on terror.""

Izzard to stand again for Labour executive,"Comedian and actor Eddie Izzard has said he will try for a second time to become a member of the Labour Party's national executive committee. The LGBT rights campaigner, who failed to get an NEC seat in 2016, announced his candidacyin the Guardian,external. He said he wanted to stand for the executive to ""break down barriers"" and make the party more welcoming to groups who feel ""isolated or excluded"". The NEC governs Labour and helps steer its political direction. It consists of the Labour leader, deputy leader, frontbenchers, trade union representatives, constituency party representatives, councillors and members of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Izzard's open letter of intent comes after it was announced there would bethree new seats on the committee. He said: ""I've tried to give a voice to those who don't have one and to be an activist for the political party I believe has the best and strongest values, which will mean we can end poverty and move forward positively as a society and a country. ""Now I want to stand for Labour's national executive committee so that I can break down barriers."" Eddie Izzard has campaigned for Labour in the last four general elections He added that he wanted to help represent the LGBT community, people from disabled and minority backgrounds, and those who have suffered from mental health issues. The comedian is a prominent supporter of Labour, and has campaigned in 100 constituency seats for the party in the last four general elections. In Izzard's article in the Guardian, he says he wants ""to help Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party take the fight to the Tories"", but adds that he is not standing for a particular section of the party. It is expected that at least two of the three available seats will go to supporters of Mr Corbyn. Before party elections in 2016, the Labour leader's relationship with the NEC was fractious, but thensix members of Corbyn-supporting groupsgained seats. In 2016, Izzard came eighth in the ballot, gaining 71,000 votes. He said he was disappointed but was ""in this for the long haul"".

Police 'let down' modern slavery victims,"This video can not be played Aurel was forced to work and felt he couldn't escape Victims of modern slavery are being let down ""at every stage"" by police in England and Wales, a report has said. Cases had been closed without any inquiries being made, and in some cases detectives didn't speak to the victims, the Inspectorate of Constabulary said. The study, which looked at 10 police forces, found some examples of good policing - but said that was the exception, rather than the norm. Police say they ""fully accept"" the recommendations in the report. Slavery 'affecting every city' in UK Thousands of men, women and children are victims of modern slavery and human trafficking in the UK, said the report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. Settings range from nail bars to construction sites, and involve activities from domestic servitude to the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation. After taking office last year,Theresa May vowed that Britain would lead the worldin trying to get rid of the ""barbaric evil"" of modern slavery. Earlier this year, official estimates suggested there were up to 13,000 potential victims in the UK, but last week the anti-slavery commissioner described that figure as ""far too modest"". The inspectorate's report said police had a crucial role to play in protecting victims, but it found that the process of identifying them was inconsistent, sometimes ineffective, and in need of improvement. Examples included: A Polish man had not been paid for seven years and complained of his employer beating him with a stick, but action wasn't taken until he was assaulted seven months later. 14 Romanian workers complained to the police of exploitation on a building site. However, the group said they did not wish to support a prosecution and were repatriated back to Romania within days. No formal statements were taken. An eastern European woman was found by a member of the public heavily pregnant and in distress near a motorway service station. She told police she had been trafficked to the UK and forced into prostitution.  While a modern slavery crime was recorded, rapes she had suffered were not. In some forces, senior officers were reluctant to ""turn over the stone"" of modern slavery, fearing a lack of resources to deal with what they might discover, the report said. In several forces, some officers said they did not believe the public ""were either interested in or sympathetic to victims"". Some frontline personnel did not consider modern slavery to be an issue in their force area, the report added. Victims were not always recognised as such, the report said, and as a result remained in the hands of those exploiting them - or were arrested as offenders or illegal immigrants. HM Inspector of Constabulary Wendy Williams said: ""Whilst modern slavery cases can be complex and require significant manpower, many of the shortcomings in investigating these cases reflect deficiencies in basic policing practice. ""As a result, victims were being left unprotected, leaving perpetrators free to continue to exploit people as commodities."" In one case, police attended an address in response to intelligence suggesting that Chinese nationals were using it as a brothel. When officers forced entry they found a 48-year-old woman and arrested her on suspicion of immigration offences and took her to the police station - but subsequent inquiries revealed that she was in the UK legally. She was taken back to the address and left outside the premises, despite revealing her fear of the man who ran the business. Other officers said they were worried she might be a victim of modern slavery and human trafficking, and police returned to the address but by then it had been vacated. ""The woman is now a missing person and at risk of continued exploitation and re-trafficking,"" said the report. The report found there were ""pockets"" of good practice, particularly in Manchester, and said forces had begun to make improvements since the inspection was carried out between November 2016 and March 2017. Shaun Sawyer, the national policing lead for modern slavery, said the police ""fully accept the recommendations included in this report"", adding they were now actively seeking out modern slavery and the challenge ahead was ""considerable"". Theresa May drew up the 2015 Modern Slavery Act when she was home secretary andset up the first government taskforceon the issue last year, while she also hosted an event tackling the problem at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month. A Home Office spokesman said the government was investing Â£8.5 million to help the police tackle modern slavery.

'Address errors' at root of dentist fines,"The NHS is going to launch an awareness-raising campaign to reduce the level of incorrect fines Many fines incorrectly imposed after dental treatment are because of mistakes over patients' addresses, says a health watchdog. The latest figures show 385,000 fines were issued in the last financial year - and dentists say tens of thousands of Â£100 fines have been wrongly applied. Healthwatch in Kirklees says problems with address records are a big factor. The NHS accepts this accounts for some of the incorrect fines and says it is planning an information campaign. The British Dental Association (BDA) last weekcalled for urgent action to tackle a wave of Â£100 fines being wrongly applied to dental patientswho had free treatment, with particular concerns about confusion among vulnerable people. They had been fined following checks designed to stop people from fraudulently using free dental treatment when they should be paying. 10 fines at the dentist that weren't fine The BDA's research claimed as many as nine in 10 fines that were challenged were subsequently overturned, suggesting that many penalties were being wrongly applied. Figures from a wider range of NHS fines suggest that the rate for withdrawing penalties after they were found to be incorrect is closer to 50%. Healthwatch, which represents people using health services, has been researching the reasons behind this problem and says many mistakes seem to be caused by how patients' addresses are recorded. Director Rory Deighton says differences in spelling, variations in how addresses might be presented or mistakes in postcodes could be misinterpreted as being a different identity. When addresses do not match information held in databases used for checks, penalty fines could be triggered, he says. The NHS Business Services Authority, which oversees the fining system, says there is also a difficulty with patients not updating their addresses, leading to discrepancies between their current addresses and addresses held in databases. The agency says it will improve the information available to patients and make forms easier to complete, after concerns there was confusion about which benefits made people eligible for free treatment. A spokeswoman said the NHS wanted to make sure that patients and staff ""understand the rules around eligibility for free treatment and the consequences of claiming incorrectly"", but she admitted there is ""still a lot of confusion"". Mr Deighton said: ""There is something intuitively wrong about an NHS organisation sending out incorrect penalty charge notices. ""Thousands of people every month receive these notices, increasing stress in households all over England. ""All we are asking for is a simple system, where eligibility for free treatment is clear to everyone. The current system is unclear and unfair on patients."" Mr Deighton suggested that where there were uncertainties about addresses, checks should be made before any fine was issued. In response to growing concerns about the fines, the Dental Defence Union (DDU) has warned dentists to alert patients to rules about payment exemptions. ""Patients are often aggrieved by being fined when they believed they were exempt,"" a DDU spokesman said. ""A large number of complaints of this sort come from the fact that patients feel they were either given poor advice or misinformation when they were filling out the exemption form."" Anyone concerned about fines or seeking information about free dental treatment can call a helpline number, 0300 330 1293.

Disabled 'losing out on jobs' due to cap,"This video can not be played Jenny Sealey says she will not be able to work full time when her grant is capped Disabled people are ""losing out"" on jobs because of a government support scheme that is ""no longer fit for purpose"", campaigners say. Access to Work - which gives workplace support to disabled people - is beset by errors, with many having support cut, charity Inclusion London said. One deaf, leading artistic director said having her funds capped would mean she could no longer work full time. The government said it was ""committed to supporting disabled people"" in work. Access to Work is a government programme aimed at helping disabled people and those with physical and mental health conditions that make it difficult to work. By providing grants - such as to help people with learning disabilities understand written information, or transport for those with physical impairments to attend meetings - it aims to enable people to find or stay in employment. According to government figures, Â£103.9m was spent on the scheme in 2016-17, helping about 25,000 people across England, Scotland and Wales. Jenny Sealey, chief executive at Graeae Theatre and co-artistic director of the London Paralympics opening ceremony, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had relied on the support - which enabled her to pay for sign language interpreters - to get to the top of her field. ""Because I've had Access to Work I've become professional, I've learnt my trade, I've learnt how to cope in big meetings,"" she said. ""It gave me the confidence to say, 'I want to be co-artistic director at the Paralympics opening ceremony'."" A 2004 government review suggested for every Â£1 of money spent on Access to Work, Â£1.48 was generated for the Treasury. But since 2015, new claimants have had the money they can receive each year capped at 1.5 times the average salary - around Â£41,000. From April 2018, this will affect existing claimants too. The report estimates 90% of those affected by the cap will be deaf people. Ms Sealey said having her support capped will mean no longer being able to work full time. ""[At] the thought of having to cut my hours, I can feel me - Jenny - shrinking, becoming this small person, feeling quite terrified of what my future is. ""I can't believe this is going to happen, it makes me feel quite sick."" The government says by capping the amount a claimant can receive, the scheme can reach as many people as possible. Disability rights campaigner Ellen Clifford said deaf people were being particularly affected Ellen Clifford, the author of a new report into the scheme for Inclusion London, said the scheme had enabled disabled people to ""not only get jobs, but to have a choice of jobs - to go into the same range of professions as non-disabled people"". One sign language interpreter said it had allowed deaf and disabled people to ""smash the glass ceiling"". But Ms Clifford said in recent years that they needed to reduce the amount of support they were getting. ""There was a noticeable increase in hostile attitudes from advisers - accusations that people were a burden on the taxpayer."" Ms Clifford said there was also a ""disproportionate impact on deaf customers"", with call centres ""ill-equipped to deal with non-hearing customers"". She added that the level of administrative errors being made was ""making the scheme unworkable for people"". One deaf woman who spoke to the programme, Geraldine O'Halloran, said her budget had been cut twice in 2017 because of administrative errors. A spokeswoman from the Department for Work and Pensions said it was ""committed to supporting disabled people to get into employment or keep their jobs. ""Last year 25,000 people had their request approved by Access to Work, an increase of 8% from 2015-16.""
