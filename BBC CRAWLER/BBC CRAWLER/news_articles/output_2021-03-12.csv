Welsh hairdressers to reopen but retail stays shut,"This video can not be played Visiting the hairdresser and meeting pals in your garden are among lockdown rules being relaxed Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local. Up to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday. Non-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March. Wales' first minister also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, but people can only go with their own household. Mark Drakefordwarned any further reopening in tourism would be haltedif holiday providers took bookings from outside of Wales. Election leaflets can be delivered from Monday A third of people in Wales now had first Covid jab Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? The Welsh Conservatives accused the first minister of a U-turn over retail, which Mr Drakeford denied, while Plaid Cymru said Welsh ministers had raised false hopes with businesses. Shielding for clinically extremely vulnerable people will also be paused from 1 April. For people living in England,the ""stay at home"" rule will end on 29 Marchbut holidays within the UK will not be allowed until 12 April at the earliest. Wales' ""stay at home"" law will switch to ""stay local"" on Saturday and there will be guidance on what that means, according to where you live. It is only likely to last for two weeks, however, ending on 27 March if conditions allow. ""The rule of thumb is that you should think of local as a five-mile radius from where you live,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""But if you live in a valleys community or a rural area you can exercise your judgement and go a little bit further."" Dyfed-Powys Police Federation representative Roger Webb said forces had not been given any information ahead of the announcement on how officers should engage on the new rules and enforce them. He said they would use common sense and work ""in the best way possible"" to make them effective. People in Wales will be able to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation from 27 March South Wales Police urged people to take responsibility for their actions and ""to do the right thing"". ""As some restrictions ease, there will be people looking to push the boundaries and break the rules. My plea to them is don't,"" said police and crime commissioner Alun Michael. From Saturday, 13 March: ""Stay at home"" becomes ""stay local"" Four people from two different households can meet up outdoors to socialise, including in gardens - children are excluded from the number. Mr Drakeford said the rules would allow people to walk through a house to access the garden Outdoor sports facilities such as golf, tennis and basketball will be able to reopen. A maximum of four people from two household can take part in activities Designated solo visitors can enter care homes From Monday, 15 March: All primary school children and those in qualifications years can return to class Schools will have flexibility to bring back year 10 and 12 pupils and more students will return to colleges Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments only Leafletingcan begin for the Senedd election From Monday, 22 March: Restrictions on non-essential aisles in supermarkets will be lifted Garden centres to reopen From Saturday 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation can reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household. Organised children's activities can restart Stay local restrictions will be lifted The Welsh Government also wants to reopen all shops and remaining close-contact services from 12 April, if the situation continues to improve. Stay-local rules 'hard to police' Wales 'on a knife edge' in dealing with pandemic How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Mr Drakeford said he was taking a ""careful and cautious"" phased approach to lifting restrictions. ""If we do too much too quickly, we will lose control of the virus and set off a new wave of infections,"" he said. ""And then we would be back at the beginning again, having to re-impose strict measures to protect people's health and save lives."" Salon owner Vicky Lewis said she saw some ""scary haircuts"" after the first lockdown Vicky Lewis, who owns Vicki's Salon and Kidz Cutz in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, welcomed the news after another lockdown that had been ""horrendous, boring and stressful"". ""I have had my salon for 22 years so I've been desperate to work,"" she said. ""It is also really worrying as you don't know if you still have your clients. It feels like I'm starting over again."" Now she is looking forward to trying to repair the same ""overgrown and scary haircuts"" she saw after the first lockdown. Hairdressers 'excited' over chance to reopen How to deal with your lockdown locks Mr Drakeford defended reopening hairdressers before all children were back in school. He said ""schools are our top priority"", and the scientific advice was clear that the safest way to get children back in class was to do so gradually. Mr Drakeford previously said ministers wouldlook to ""begin to reopen some non-essential retail"" at this review. However, that will now begin on 22 March when garden centres can reopen and supermarkets remove the wrapping from their non-essential items aisles. All other shops are expected to reopen from 12 April and the Welsh Government says it is making an extra Â£150m available to support businesses affected by ongoing restrictions. This video can not be played How do tourism businesses feel about the future? Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said the delayed reopening of shops was ""deeply frustrating"" with the industry losing Â£100m every week in revenue during lockdown. ""At the last review the first minister opened the door for a possible reopening on Monday and many retailers have taken the leap and invested in their stores and furloughed staff in preparation,"" she said. Ms Jones, who is a Conservative councillor in Monmouthshire, added: ""[This delay] will simply exacerbate the woes of a stricken industry."" Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening Welsh retailers 'dealt a hammer blow' by lockdown Mr Drakeford told his press conference that he did not ""change"" his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail. ""Three weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,"" he said. He said he was ""anxious"" about reopening non-essential retail in Wales ahead of the same shops being reopened in England. The first minister said it could act ""as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border."" Non-essential retail in Wales is scheduled to reopen on 12 April, the same date as England. He added it was ""safer"" to lift the ban on shops, including supermarkets, from selling non-essential items ahead of fully reopening shops that have been closed. Garden centre bosses had been frustrated by having to close in lockdownwhile centres in England remained open. Nicola Pugh, senior operations manager at Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff, said she was ""delighted"" at being given the go-ahead to reopen. The owners of Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff were ""frustrated"" at the different rules in England and Wales She said they had continued to grow plants locally at their nurseries so they were able to stock their centres in Radyr and Wenvoe. ""We are ready and waiting and have been working hard to ensure safe shopping for all our wonderful customers,"" Ms Pugh added. Shielding in Wales for people vulnerable from coronavirus will be paused from 1 April. The Health Minister Vaughan Gething said with cases lower than December ""we must only keep this advice in place for as long as is absolutely necessary"". ""In light of the change of context, the Chief Medical Officer has recommended that the advice to the clinically extremely vulnerable to follow shielding measures should be paused after the 31st March,"" Mr Gething wrote. Mr Drakeford suggested pubs and restaurants would only be allowed to serve customers outdoors when they are allowed to reopen Hospitality firms and gyms have not yet been given a date to reopen. At his press conference on Friday Mr Drakeford indicated the sectors will be looked at in a future review during April. He said as they look ahead to the end of that month ""if we continue to see an improving public health picture, we will be able to consider what more we can do to support people to meet each other and what we can do to continue reopening our economy, for example, looking at outdoor hospitality, the wedding sector and leisure centres and gyms."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as 17 May The first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government follows through on its plan to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May. But he said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date. ""In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,"" he said in an interview. ""I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus."" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, welcomed the change to stay local. But he said: ""Labour's U-turn on the opening of non-essential retail at such short notice will be a hammer blow for many businesses, and the decision to now align with England in that area shows we could've adopted a similar roadmap weeks ago. ""The ongoing refusal by Labour ministers to do so will only increase frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk."" Stay-local guidance has been brought in to replace the ""stay home"" message during lockdown Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been ""poor communication"" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he said had ""certainly raised false hopes amongst many businesses"" that they would open earlier. He told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs ""getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that"". Plaid also called for families to be allowed to meet from different householdsbefore tourism reopens. Three weeks ago Mark Drakeford said that today he would be looking at beginning the process of re-opening non-essential retail. Sticking to those words, that's exactly what he's done, but there were a lot of non-essential retailers who thought they would get more. There will be real anger that he allowing shops which have stayed open, and that includes the big supermarkets, to start selling non-essential goods before small privately owned shops are allowed to. For a period in December, the case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world - and lockdown was brought in just before Christmas. However, the rate has fallen significantly during the restrictions and as the vaccination programme is rolled out - it is now at 41 cases per 100,000 people. It remains below the 50 cases per 100,000 ""circuit-breaker"" threshold. In England,all restrictions will be lifted by 21 Juneat the earliest, as part of a four-stage ""roadmap"" based on certain conditions being met, such as a successful vaccine rollout. Scotland has announced thatmore people will be able to meet up outside from Friday, 12 March, which is earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is still to outline its plans to relax restrictions. If you had the chance to run Wales, what would be the first thing on your list of things to do?

Met officer charged with Sarah Everard's murder,"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A serving Met Police officer has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard, who disappeared as she walked home in south London. The 33-year-old's body was found in woodland in Kent more than a week after she was last spotted on 3 March. Wayne Couzens, 48, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court later charged with her murder. Durham University has paid tribute to Ms Everard, describing her as a ""beloved graduate"". Ms Everard was last seen walking alone down a main road in Clapham at 21:30 GMT, with police saying it was unclear whether she reached her home in Brixton. Her body was found by police searching woodland near Ashford, Kent, on Wednesday. Wayne Couzens joined the Met Police in September 2018 Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said Ms Everard's family had been ""informed of this development and remain supported by specialist officers"". ""I would like at this stage to pay tribute to Sarah's family for their fortitude and forbearance through what can only have been the most intensely difficult few days, our thoughts remain with them as this matter progresses,"" he said. ""The investigation continues, of course, supported by hundreds of officers from across the Met, as well as colleagues in Kent Police."" Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Before the charges were confirmed, Mr Couzens was taken to hospital for a second time in two days after being found with head injuries inside his cell. He has since been discharged and returned to his cell, the Met said. Earlier on Friday evening, Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick took part in a walkabout on Clapham Common. She walked with police officers and spoke to members of the public in the park close to Clapham Common Tube station. A vigil planned by Reclaim These Street, due to take place on Clapham Common later, near to where the 33-year-old was last seen alive,has been cancelled. Anna Birley, from the group, said it could not bear the personal risk of Covid-19 fines or prosecution. Flowers have been laid at Clapham Common near to where Sarah Everard was last seen Ms Everard's disappearance when she was walking home along a main road in Clapham on 3 March has prompted a public debate on women's safety. Durham University vice-chancellor Prof Stuart Corbridge said marketing executive Ms Everard studied geography at St Cuthbert's Society. ""Sarah was a popular and lively member of our college community and retained a large Durham University friendship group,"" he said. ""Our thoughts remain with her family and friends at this extremely difficult time."" Mr Couzens joined the force in September 2018 and was initially based in the Bromley area, the Met said. In February last year he moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in the capital. On Thursday, a woman in her 30s who was arrested at the same time as Mr Couzens on suspicion of assisting an offender, was bailed to a date in mid-April. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next?

Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next?,"The last confirmed sighting of Sarah Everard was 30 minutes after she left her friend's home in Clapham A Met Police officer has been charged with the kidnap and murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard. It means criminal proceedings are under way but, with the justice system creaking under a massive backlog, how long might it be before a trial could take place? To start with, Wayne Couzens will be taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court for his first court appearance. All such proceedings start at the magistrate level, where a defendant confirms personal details such as their name, date of birth and where they live. Serious crimes, known as indictable offences, are always sent up to crown court. The 48-year-old will then appear at crown court - most likely the Central Criminal Court in London, which is better known as the Old Bailey. A judge will listen to the background of the case and can grant or refuse bail - although it is extremely rarefor someone accused of murder to be granted bail.,externalThe judge will also set a date for a plea hearing and, should Mr Couzens plead not guilty, he will go on to be tried by a jury. The Old Bailey hears major criminal cases from London and exceptional cases from other parts of England and Wales The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a backlog that stands at an estimated 56,000 crown court cases in England and Wales. About65% of the crown court backlogis believed to be made up of trials, and many will not go before a jury until 2022 at the earliest. The other cases are sentencing hearings and plea preparations. Due to the pandemic, social distancing measures have had to be put in place. This means not all trials in the past year have been able to be heard in court buildings, which often have very cramped conditions. So finding a suitable courtroom could take some time, as dates have already been set for other trials. Mr Couzens has been charged with murderand has already been remanded into custody. Custody ahead of a trial carries a time limit which is currently eight months, but this can be reviewed, extended or cut by a judge. There are protocols in place to expedite the most serious cases, both in the interests of public protection and management of dangerous offenders on remand. Any trial could well take place this year, should it be fast-tracked. Posters of Sarah Everard were widely across social media after her disappearance Particularly now there has been a charge in the case, people need to be especially cautious about what they post about it on social media. Posts should not include comments claiming or implying that any suspect is guilty of an offence of which they have been accused, nor anything else that could prejudice a trial or impede the administration of justice. This is because, according to English law, everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty and everyone has the right to a fair trial. Criminal proceedings against Mr Couzens have been ""active"" since his arrest. This means that under contempt of court laws, nothing should be published that could cause a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing or impeding the legal process, for example by influencing potential jurors. Dame Cressida Dick has said it is a police officer's job ""to patrol the streets and to protect people"" Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said that the arrest of a serving police officer on suspicion of murder had caused anger both within the Met and with the general public. As is usual, because one of its own has been arrested, the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) as well as its in-house Directorate of Professional Standards. Both are responsible for investigating complaints about the professional conduct of officers. The IOPC has also launched an investigation into the Met's initial handling of the missing person investigation. While Ms Everard was missing, police officers and sniffer dogs searched Eagle Pond on Clapham Common Ms Everard's last known movements were at about 21:30 GMT on 3 March, shortly after she got off the phone to her boyfriend. It took roughly 36 hours for police to make their initial appeal for information about the whereabouts of the marketing executive. But the findings of investigations into the way the case was handled would not be made public until after any murder trial.

Everard vigil organisers lose court challenge,"Organisers of a vigil planned for Sarah Everard in south London are still hopeful it can take place, despite effectively losing a High Court challenge against a ban on the event. But the Metropolitan Police urged people to find a ""lawful and safer way"" to express views on women's safety. Earlier, a High Court judge refused to say the event would be permitted under coronavirus regulations. Organisers Reclaim These Streets said discussions with police would continue. Saturday's event was planned after the disappearance of Ms Everard, 33, who was last seen alive on 3 March when she was walking home along a main road in Clapham, prompted public debate about women's safety. On Friday, serving Met Police officerWayne Couzens, 48, was chargedwith the kidnap and murder of Ms Everard. As well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events have been planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool. How many attacks on women are there? Reclaim These Streets said in a statement: ""We are now in discussions with the Met to confirm how the event can proceed in a way that is proportionate and safe - our number one priority."" Commander Catherine Roper of the Met Police said the force's message to those wishing to attend vigils was ""stay at home or find a lawful and safer way to express your views"". She added: ""I understand this ruling will be a disappointment to those hoping to express their strength of feeling, but I ask women and allies across London to find a safe alternative way to express their views."" However, one of the group's barristers, Pippa Woodrow of Doughty Street Chambers, told the BBC the police statement was ""premature"". ""The ball is now effectively in the Met's court to tell the organisers how this event can take place lawfully,"" she said. In the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Holgate refused an application by Reclaim These Streets for the High Court to make ""an interim declaration"" that any ban on outdoor gatherings under Covid rules was ""subject to the right to protest"". The judge also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Met Police of ""prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances"" was unlawful. Following the decision, a government spokesman said: ""All of our thoughts are with Sarah's family and friends at this terrible time, and the government recognises why so many women and girls across the country want to pay their respects. ""We are still in the middle of a pandemic, which is why we urge people to do this safely and to continue to avoid mass gatherings."" Mr Justice Holgate hasn't quite closed the door on the event going ahead anyway. That's because three long hours of legal argument thrashed out the legal principles that the Metropolitan Police should follow. Critically, the force said it did not have a ""blanket ban"" on all protests - which meant it accepted it had to take into account the right to protest which is enshrined in human rights legislation. The judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should comment."" What does that mean in practice? Well, we're now waiting to see whether there are talks - and whether some kind of vigil will be deemed to be lawful after all. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group had ""consistently"" asked the Met Police ""to tell us what would be a safe way to exercise our right"". Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, the Labour MP for Camberwell and Brixton,tweeted,external: ""C'mon [Metropolitan Police] now agree a way for this vigil to happen safely. ""Many women want to show their concern.  Including women Met Police officers!"" Lana Adamou, a lawyer with the human rights group Liberty, said protest was ""the lifeblood of a healthy democracy"" and that socially-distanced demonstrations were ""perfectly possible"". ""The current restrictions should be interpreted compatibly with our rights enshrined in the Human Rights Act and it is concerning that this hasn't been reflected today,"" she said. When asked whether the vigil should be allowed to go ahead, Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said ""at the moment the law is as it is"". She told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions: ""For my own part, I will be standing outside my front door and I will be reclaiming albeit a very small piece of pavement, but I will be standing out there to show my support and my respect and my solidarity with other women at this time."" At the hearing, the judge said the organisers were told by police that ""the vigil would be illegal and that their 'hands were tied' by Covid-19 regulations"". He added that the four claimants ""were told that, as organisers, they would be liable to be issued with Â£10,000 fixed penalty notices"", and could also be arrested. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared Mr Justice Holgate said it would not be ""appropriate for the court"" to make the declaration sought. He ruled that ""the requirements of the law have been clearly stated"" in previous court rulings and concluded: ""I decline to grant the interim relief sought. But I hope that, in this judgment, I have clarified the application of the law in so far as it is appropriate for me to do so at this stage."" Lawyers representing the organisers earlier argued the Met's interpretation of Covid rules goes against human rights law. But George Thomas, representing the Met, said the event could lead to significant crowds in a central London location, at a time when Parliament's intention was to not allow gatherings of more than two people for health reasons amid the pandemic. Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests In other developments, the government is seeking further views on how to tackle violence against women and girls following an outpouring of experiences shared online in response to the Sarah Everard case. The Home Office is reopening a public consultation, which originally closed in February. The findings will help inform its strategy on tackling violence against women and girls - due to be published in the summer. How many violent attacks on women are there?

Tourism to halt 'if bookings made outside Wales',"It is hoped people from Wales will be able to travel further than their local area at Easter The further reopening of the tourism industry will be halted if holiday providers are found to be taking bookings from people from outside of Wales, the first minister says. Self-contained accommodation can reopen in Wales from 27 March, as long as cases remained low. But people in England cannot go on holiday in the UK until 12 April. Mark Drakeford said the ""penalty"" for businesses acting ""irresponsibly"" would be that further reopening would end. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with ""stay at home"" rules replaced by a requirement to ""stay local"" and a plan to reopen parts of tourism industry for Easter has been set out. The ""stay at home"" rule will end in England from 29 March, but people will not be able to holiday in other parts of the UK until at least a fortnight later. In Scotland,people are being asked to stay at home until 5 April, with no date currently set for when people can travel to other parts of the UK. The Stormont Executive in Northern Irelandhas not given a timetable for reopening. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Stay-local rules 'hard to police' Clarity call on reopening Wales to tourists ""People who let accommodation should not be taking bookings from people who live outside Wales,"" Mr Drakeford told the PA news agency. ""We will be talking with our local authority colleagues and with the police next week, just to see if there is anything we need to do to mobilise our own enforcement authorities. ""I know there are rogues in any part of life. But I think that the industry will absolutely recognise that we want to go beyond self-contained accommodation. ""We want the tourism industry in Wales to have a longer and better season this year than we managed last year."" The Welsh coast saw tourists return in their droves when Covid rules eased last year Self-contained accommodation will reopen in Wales from 27 March, but people in England will not be able to holiday in Wales at that time. In England, the ""stay at home"" rule will end onÂ 29 March, but overnight stays in self-catering and self-contained accommodation will not be permitted untilÂ 12 AprilÂ at the earliest. Hotels and B&Bs may be able to take bookings in England from 17 May. Mr Drakeford said any further reopening of Wales' tourism industry would be halted if holiday providers were found taking bookings from people in England over Easter. Gwenan Jones says it is is not financially viable to accommodate people for one-night stays Not being able to accept bookings from customers in England over Easter is a big blow, according to Gwenan Jones, who owns the Cefn Cae Campsite and Holiday Village in Rowen, Conwy. ""When you have a booking from England they'll normally stay for three to seven days, but people in Wales only want one night away because they already know how beautiful Wales is,"" she said. ""We have to make sure our cottages look brand new every time, so when you take cleaning costs into consideration for a one-night booking, it's just not viable."" She said ""business can't continue like this"", adding: ""We're an industry that never asks for handouts - all we need is to be allowed to reopen and we'll be able to run things."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as 17 May The first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government followed through on plans to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May. But he said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date. ""In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,"" he said. ""I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus."" People in Wales will be able to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation from 27 March Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government defined self-contained accommodation as anywhere without shared facilities such as a kitchen or bathroom. He added: ""But that does include, as it did last year when we started down this path, in the same way hotels that are able to offer room service and where people have all the facilities they need in their own room."" The first minister said people will only be able to go on holiday with people in their own household. ""The basic rules about only going with your own household will remain in place and all the other restrictions that we continue to need to observe will be as true if you are in your caravan as it would if you were in your own home,"" he said. Mr Drakeford stressed he was ""making the rules for people in Wales"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged the Welsh Government to put ""families first"" by allowing family members from different households to meet before tourism reopens. ""Case rates remain stubbornly high in many areas attractive to tourists and we must remember the huge pressures already facing local hospitals,"" he said. ""After the sacrifices of the past year we should be putting families first and granting some limited extended freedoms for families to come together before tourism reopens.""

Cabinet Office to move 500 jobs to Glasgow,"The Cabinet Office is to move at least 500 civil servant jobs to Glasgow by 2024 to work at a new secondary headquarters, the BBC understands. An internal letter at Michael Gove's department said it would ""strengthen its commitment to Scotland"". The jobs include senior roles and ministers would be expected to spend ""some time"" in Scotland. It comes amid ongoing efforts by the UK government to bolster support for the union. TheFinancial Times,externalreported one official as saying the move would ""bring the engine room of the UK government to Scotland"". East Kilbride job fears over new 'super department' Darlington Treasury move north welcomed A number of other government offices are expected to set up headquarters in other parts of the UK. These include offices for the Treasury inDarlingtonand for Housing, Communities and Local Government inWolverhampton. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""Decision makers should be close to the people they serve and we want to see opportunity, jobs and investment fairly distributed across the country. ""That's why we've committed to relocating civil service roles out of central London, building on the thousands of civil servants we already have working across the United Kingdom."" Details of the move to Glasgow came in a letter to staff from Alex Chisholm, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office. The department, which has the role of supporting the prime minister and cabinet, currently employs about 8,500 staff. A large number of civil servants already work close to Glasgow, as the  Department for International Development (now part of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office)has for many years been based in East Kilbride.

Australian set to head OECD despite climate record,"Critics say Mr Cormann has an ""atrocious"" record on climate change Mathias Cormann, Australia's longtime former finance minister, is set to take over as chief of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Cormann, a centre-right politician, had faced opposition stemming from his record on climate change. He tried to abolish Australia's renewable energy targets and has called carbon pricing a ""very expensive hoax"". Sweden's Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m was also vying to lead the group, which includes 37 of the world's biggest economies. The Paris-based OECD, which helps develop and coordinate policies among its members, is expected to finalise Mr Cormann's selection next week. He would serve a five-year term starting in June. Greenpeace International, which helped spearhead outside opposition to Mr Cormann's candidacy, called his selection a ""missed opportunity"" for the group, which includes the US, UK, Germany and Japan among others. ""We have little confidence in Mr Cormann's ability to ensure the OECD is a leader in tackling the climate crisis when he himself has an atrocious record on the issue, including opposition to carbon pricing,"" executive director Jennifer Morgan said. ""This was a missed opportunity for the OECD member states to draw a line in the sand and disqualify anyone with a history of blocking climate action from senior international appointments."" Mr Cormann has responded to the criticism, saying he was ""absolutely committed to ambitious and effective action on climate change"", but that there were different ways to achieve it. As the next leader of the Paris-based OECD, Mr Cormann is facing an agenda that includes tackling the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, addressing climate change and reaching a global deal on how to tax technology companies. A native German speaker who was born in Belgium, Mr Cormann moved to Australia in his mid-20s, working in health insurance and politics. Prospects brighter for global economy, says report OECD: No deal on digital tax risks trade war He holds the record as the country's longest-serving finance minister, serving from 2013 to 2020. He also represented western Australia as a Liberal Party senator from 2007 to 2020. Known to favour lower taxes, he pledged during his campaign for the OECD job to deploy ""every policy and analytical capability available through the OECD to help economies around the world achieve global net-zero emissions by 2050"". The group should help identify ""market-based ... solutions which maximise reduction outcomes in a way that preserves energy affordability and is economically responsible"" he added. Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed the selection as a win for his country, calling it ""the most senior appointment of an Australian candidate to an international body for decades,"" in a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald. OECD insiders said that the breadth of Mr Cormann's political experience and personality played a role in his selection as did his detailed knowledge of the issues in hand. Backing from the US was also reportedly key. Insiders also told the BBC that having an Australian in charge would provide good geopolitical balance for an organisation based in the heart of Europe. The most recent country to join was Colombia, and Costa Rica is in the process of doing so. However, there has also been criticism over the lack of transparency in the selection process, which was led by the UK. One observer described it as ""cloak and daggers"" and questioned whether that was appropriate for an organisation whose members are democracies. Former EU trade commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m was the other finalist of the 10 candidates who entered the contest to succeed Mexico's Angel Gurria, who has led the group for 15 years. The possible selection of Mr Cormann prompted debate in the UK, which is set to host an important climate change summit in Glasgow later this year. In December Labour's Shadow International Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to Boris Johnson saying that supporting Mr Cormann ""would make a mockery of your own claims to leadership on climate change and would send entirely the wrong signal to the world about how seriously the UK takes the issue"".

Freed inmate guilty of terror attack plan,"Sahayb Abu and the kit he planned to wear in the attack A former prisoner has been convicted of planning an Islamic State-inspired sword attack. Sahayb Abu, 27, was found guilty by a jury of preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced on 9 April. Muhamed Abu, his 32-year-old brother, was acquitted of failing to warn police about the plan. Sahayb's preparations included buying a sword, a knife, balaclavas, fingerless gloves, and a combat vest, and paying extra to have the sword sharpened. When placing the orders, he asked if the vest could stop bullets. The defendant, from Dagenham in east London, also met an undercover police officer hoping he could provide access to firearms, the Old Bailey heard. Terror accused made pro-IS posts 'for a thrill' Terror plot accused 'wanted to be famous' Sahayb did not react as the majority verdict was delivered in his case and was remanded into custody. Muhamed, who was brought into court separately, wept and shouted out that his brother was a ""clown"". Sahayb is one of several extremist siblings from the same London family: In 2015, two younger half-brothers, Wail and Suleyman Aweys, went to Syria to join the Islamic State group and are believed to have been killed in the fighting In 2018, another half-brother Ahmed Aweys and half-sister Asma Aweys and her partner were jailed for terror offences, including sharing Islamic State material in a family chat group Also in 2018, another half-sister was stopped trying to leave the UK with several children, using another person's identification documents The youngest half brother, a teenager, was also in a group chat in which Sahayb discussed violent extremist beliefs Sahayb and Muhamed Abu were arrested in July in armed raids, hours after Sahayb had told an extremist chat group: ""We need a 9/11 2.0."" The authorities had intervened to prevent delivery of the 18-inch (46cm) sword and protective vest. Muhamed denied knowing that his brother was planning an attack. Prosecutors said Sahayb's violent mindset was expressed in a series of homemade rap recordings in which he rhymed about ""sending bombs"". Another lyric said: ""I'm trying to see many Lee Rigby's heads rolling on the ground"". Fusilier Rigby was murdered by two extremists near Woolwich barracks in May 2013. Anti-clockwise from top left - half-sister Asma Aweys, half-brother Ahmed Aweys and younger brothers Suleyman (in white) and Wail Aweys In some self-made films, Sahayb wore a mask and camouflage hat, which prosecutors said was an outfit he planned to wear to conduct his attack. In one he says he's ""just waiting on the body armour"" that ""will stop a bullet"". Sahayb told jurors he had created a rapper character called the ""masked menace"" as a joke, aspired to be a charitable figure like Captain Tom Moore, and claimed he could not have a radical Islamist mindset because he watched pornography. The counter-terror investigation that first uncovered the activities of the defendants' half-brother and sister came about after police received a tip that Sahayb and Muhamed were going to burgle a jewellery shop, the court was told. The pair, along with Ahmed Aweys, later admitted their part in the burglary conspiracy. Evidence gathered by police showed family members justifying crime against ""kuffar"" (unbelievers), for the purpose of jihad. The trial heard that Sahayb, after being released from prison in March last year, frequently accessed IS propaganda and used various social media platforms to boast about his violent beliefs. CCTV image of Sahayb Abu in the hat, with his brother Muhamed In jail, he had mixed with terrorist prisoners, including a man jailed for encouraging violence against Prince George. In one online comment, Sahayb stated: ""Islam is for war, hostage taking, killing infidels, fighting tyranny, taking war booty, taking women of the enemy as concubines."" He demonstrated particular hatred for Shia Muslims, railing against a specific UK imam, and searched online for the 2014 Camp Speicher Massacre in Iraq, when Islamic State forces killed more than 1,500 militiamen and Iraqi Army cadets, particularly targeting Shias. Sahayb also joined a small private chat group, which contained the undercover police officer,  in which members from the around the world glorified IS atrocities. Using an alias, Sahayb discussed Osama bin Laden, the hate preacher Anjem Choudry, and lionised the killer who carried out the Westminster Bridge attack in 2017. During a meeting with the undercover officer, Sahayb expressed regret at not going to Syria when he could have done, but said that two brothers had and they were martyrs. On another occasion, the court was told, a surveillance team watched Sahayb and Muhamed meet in public and look at an online listing for the sword. During message chats with Muhamed and their teenage brother, Sahayb said there was ""something called biding your time waiting for right moments"" and that Allah would make them ""action men and not chatty men"". Referring to not travelling to Syria, he wrote ""the caravan left without us"". Commander Richard Smith, head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command, described Sahayb as a ""very dangerous individual"".

"PM visits Northern Ireland amid unionist tensionSinn FÃ©in snubs what it calls a ""PR exercise"" by Boris Johnson, while the DUP raises NI Protocol concerns.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Boris Johnson's visit to Northern Ireland included a stop at a Covid-19 vaccination centre Sinn FÃ©in has refused to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his visit to Northern Ireland. The party described his trip on Friday as a publicity stunt. Mr Johnson said he was ""always happy to meet all sides"" but had been told Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in was ""otherwise engaged"". First Minister Arlene Foster urged him ditch what she called the ""intolerable"" post-Brexit arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. It came into effect in January as part of the Brexit deal and means Northern Ireland remains in the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK has left, so checks are required on some goods crossing the Irish Sea. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Mrs Foster said the protocol was unworkable, had the backing of no unionist parties and created societal division and economic harm rather than protecting the Belfast Agreement that effectively brought to an end Northern Ireland's Troubles. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? What will happen when EU-GB grace periods expire? Could there be an NI-Scotland bridge? Arlene Foster says she urged Boris Johnson to ""stand up"" for Northern Ireland ""Whilstgrace periods have been extended unilaterally, we need a permanent solution so business can plan and the integrity of the United Kingdom internal market can be restored,"" said Mrs Foster, speaking after meeting the prime minister at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. Mr Johnson said the government's action to postpone the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""lawful and indeed right in view of the impact on the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and the need to have consent from both communities"". ""The most important thing about the protocol is that it should guarantee the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said. ""There's got to be an east-west consent... as well as a north-south consent so that's what we're doing."" Ms O'Neill, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, said she and her party's president Mary Lou McDonald had a ""long-standing request"" to meet Mr Johnson. Boris Johnson arrived at the vaccination centre at Fermanagh Lakeland Forum with NI Secretary Brandon Lewis They wanted to discuss ""commitments which he and his government have reneged on"" as well as his ""reckless and partisan approach to the Irish protocol"", she said. ""He did not facilitate the meeting,"" added Ms O'Neill. ""I have no plans to meet with him today."" Sinn FÃ©in MP John Finucane went further, describing the prime minister's visit as a ""very superficial PR exercise"". This visit feels like the first step in the prime minister's own pathway to recovery as he seeks to repair badly damaged relations with unionists. It was no surprise that pathway included an early trip to Fermanagh - the home of Arlene Foster. Even before he arrived, his advance party had set the stagereleasing details of events to mark Northern Ireland's centenary. But it will take more than a special postmark, a concert and a centenary rose to heal the unionist hurt. Far from being the union's chief cheerleader, Boris Johnson is regarded by many unionists as the prime minister who betrayed Northern Ireland by agreeing to the protocol which created the Irish Sea border. It is going to be a tricky visit for the prime minister labelled a ""lousy unionist"" by an Orange Order leader. It is no surprise that much of the visit's focus was on the battle against Covid-19 and the successful rollout of the UK's vaccine programme. But until he comes up with a political vaccine to eradicate the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Boris Johnson pathway to unionist recovery will not be smooth. Health Minister Robin Swann said the success of Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme ""shows the strength of the union"".

PM visits Northern Ireland amid unionist tension,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's visit to Northern Ireland included a stop at a Covid-19 vaccination centre Sinn FÃ©in has refused to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his visit to Northern Ireland. The party described his trip on Friday as a publicity stunt. Mr Johnson said he was ""always happy to meet all sides"" but had been told Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in was ""otherwise engaged"". First Minister Arlene Foster urged him ditch what she called the ""intolerable"" post-Brexit arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. It came into effect in January as part of the Brexit deal and means Northern Ireland remains in the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK has left, so checks are required on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.

Gavin Williamson on coping with 'lonely' leadership,"Gavin Williamson was asked by head teachers about his own ""wellbeing"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said that his ""supportive family"" and getting a puppy had helped him. ""A combination of a family and dogs are probably the things that keep you sane,"" said Mr Williamson. ""One thing about pets is that they're always going to be pleased to see you,"" he told the annual conference of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" said Mr Williamson. Pushy parents put on pressure over teachers' exam grades The big summer u-turn over exams Gavin Williamson facing further pressure The education secretary has faced tough criticism over problems such as last year's exams, prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post. ASCL's president Richard Sheriff said mental health had become a bigger concern. He asked the education secretary: ""How have you managed your own wellbeing over the past year, because you must have had some pretty tough days in the office to try and recover from?"" Mr Williamson said the ""thing that's made the biggest difference"" had been his family - ""having them around, having them to talk to"". ""And probably like a lot of families, we seemed to have made an investment in a puppy,"" he told head teachers. Mr Sheriff, a head teacher in North Yorkshire, said school leaders recognised the intense pressures of decision making during the pandemic, including for politicians. ""There are leaders who have led before Covid - and then there are leaders who have led through Covid, who have had an experience that no one else could understand,"" said the ASCL president. But Mr Williamson said he also faced questions about the education department at home from his wife, who is a teaching assistant. ""I obviously get quite a bit of lobbying,"" he said. ""You know our pillow talk is maybe a little bit different. ""She's always highlighting various issues where maybe the Department for Education hasn't always got it perfect all the time."" The education secretary paid tribute to how schools and teachers had responded to the ""unprecedented demands"" created by the pandemic. ""Everyone in this country has a far greater and deeper appreciation of the teaching profession,"" he told the conference. The pandemic has led to the cancellation of written exams this year, for the second year in a row, and Mr Williamson was asked whether there would be changes to the exam system in the future, such as scrapping GCSEs. Mr Williamson ruled out any removal of the exams, saying: ""We're absolutely going to be keeping GCSEs."" He said many students changed school or college at the age of 16 and it was ""really important that we have something that captures their attainment and their progress so far"". ""We're certainly not looking at getting rid of age 16 assessment, so I think GCSE is going to be there for an awful lot longer.""

We'll be back tomorrow with more live updates on the coronavirus throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis, Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Georgina Rannard, George Bowden and Francesca Gillett. There's been a mix of stories about coronavirus around today. Here's a summary: This video can not be played Footage has been released by West Midlands Police of officers turning up at a poker party that was breaching lockdown rules. About 20 fines of Â£800 each were handed out when officers raided the poker event at a Birmingham pub on 6 March. The pub is now facing action for licensing breaches. The previous day, officers arrived to find a party with a buffet, drinks and a four-piece band at an empty shop elsewhere in the city. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent A
Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge
this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being
currently banned from going ahead. Mr
Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan
Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in
London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between
demonstrators and senior officers. The
judgeâs ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could
not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations. The
conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he
could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also
accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether
to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations. That
raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police
that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country. At
the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under
the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police
had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place. Senior
officers had said their ""hands were tied"" by the Covid lockdown laws
which banned all gatherings outdoors. But
as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket
ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the
health implications of a large gathering. The
judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants
and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the
rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should
comment."" More than 100 prisoners have died after testing positive for coronavirus over the last year, preliminary figures suggest. Provisional Ministry of Justice data from 16 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 show 118 prisoners had died after testing positive within 28 days of their death or where it was confirmed postmortem. Of these, the deaths of 93 inmates were suspected or confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus.
The deaths occurred in 54 prisons across England and Wales, the MoJ report said. Some 14,480 prisoners have tested positive for Covid since the start of the pandemic, in 127 jails. Some 106 of these were child criminals in youth custody. The prison with the most positive cases so far is HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire, with 468 between March 2020 and January 2021. This peaked this January when 249 were recorded, the figures show. The state of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken to deal with rising cases and deaths there, the head of the World Health Organization has said. ""Unless serious measures are taken, the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said all stakeholders should take the situation seriously, adding that neighbouring countries could be affected, Reuters news agency reported. ""The situation is deeply concerning and the measures that should be taken should be as serious as possible,"" Tedros said. AstraZeneca says export restrictions will reduce delivery of its vaccines to the European Union. The pharmaceutical company says it still aims to deliver 100
million doses to the EU in the first half of the year. ""Half of the EU's supply in the second quarter, and 10
million doses in the first quarter were due to be sourced from
the companyâs international supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said. ""Unfortunately, export restrictions will reduce deliveries
in the first quarter, and are likely to affect deliveries in the
second quarter."" It comes as a blow to the EU's vaccination plans that have already been hampered by delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. The EU has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in its member states and has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU. There's more about the EU's vaccine progress here. Flowers left at the bandstand on Clapham Common The organisers of the vigil planned for London tomorrow to remember Sarah Everard, who was found dead on Wednesday after going missing in south London on 3 March, have lost their legal challenge against a police ban on the event under coronavirus rules. A court hearing has been taking place at the High Court to challenge the Metropolitan Police's decision to ban the vigil. The organisers, Reclaim the Streets, claimed the decision to stop it amounted to a breach of human rights law. In court, the Met's barrister said the force had ""every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show"". ""But, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place."" Matt Bowring is a personal trainer from Penarth whose business has been badly
affected by lockdown. He and his family are now living in his mother-in-lawâs
living room after their offer on a home fell through. He feels that First Minister Mark Drakeford hasnât given clear
guidelines on when gyms and personal trainers can reopen again in Wales. Matt says: ""I've
been a coach for 15 years and seeing our industry in disarray with no clear map
for us is ridiculous. ""The
science shows that obesity and lifestyle are the main causes of
hospitalisation, yet keeping fast food restaurants open for take away was one
of the first things the government addressed. ""Both
my wife and I have coaching businesses and at the start of the first lockdown
the decision was made to move from our home and in with my in-laws. ""We
have one-year-old twin girls. This has not been an ideal situation as we have
not really been able to keep the majority of our clients training online, thus have
taken a huge revenue hit. ""Mortgage
companies will not touch us due to the uncertainty. We
have a large deposit, we have great accounts. ""The
uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months
living in a front room."" Some people have tested positive with a lateral flow test, despite a PCR test later confirming they were negative. A leading bio-statistician, Prof Sheila Bird, has raised concerns that lateral flow tests are being taken as complete proof of having coronavirus, without being checked with a second lab test. She is concerned that the lateral flow tests give false positives, leading to families having to self-isolate unnecessarily. The lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to a lab and can be done at home, giving a result within minutes, and have been rolled out for schoolchildren. When taken at home or in workplaces, lateral flow tests can be overruled by a lab test, known as a PCR. But the government has insisted this cannot happen for tests done in school - although it has been unable to explain why. ""The law regulations changed at the end of January and this seems to have given permission for NHS Test and Trace to ignore a PCR negative result and not allow it to overrule a lateral flow positive,"" said Prof Bird, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society's Covid-19 taskforce. ""So families who have sought confirmation [and] have a PCR negative are still being obliged to spend 10 days in isolation. ""Personally I think they should submit a yellow card of serious adverse harm to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority."" Read more about the issue here. Life in Scotland could be close to normal as early as mid-June, a leading public health expert has said. Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC she was ""very optimistic"" most restrictions would be lifted by the summer and perhaps even earlier. She warned international travel and mass gatherings were unlikely this summer but said the data was heading in the right direction. Scotland has been in lockdown since 5 January but the first minister has said the country is making progress suppressing the virus. Today the rules were relaxedto allow four adults from two different households to meet outdoors. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all legal limits on social contact could be lifted as early as 21 June if enough progress is made tackling the virus. Read more. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said he'd been helped by his ""supportive family"" and by getting a puppy. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" he added.

Read more. We now have the latest daily coronavirus figures for the UK. The number of deaths recorded is continuing to fall steadily but the fall in the number of cases is slowing. The mass testing of secondary pupils in England, which began this week as schools reopened to all children, may be contributing to an increase in positive cases. More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.3 million people have had a second. The current seven-day average for first doses is around 295,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues. You can explore the figures for your areahere. A new mum has been able to hold her baby for the first time, after eight weeks of being treated for coronavirus. Baby Leo was delivered by caesarean section 10 weeks prematurely after mum Ellie Wright, 20, contracted Covid. Ellie was seriously ill in the critical care unit with the virus and pneumonia, and Leo needed to be on a ventilator. Her recovery could take up to two years, but she has finally had her first cuddle with her son. Ellie, from Walsall, said Leo was heavier than she thought he would be. ""He looks like me; he's got my nose,"" she said. She is still receiving care on a ward at the hospital, while Leo is ""thriving"" at home with his grandparents. Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 120 million. There have been 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. Meanwhile, we've got a graph showing how the number of cases is picking up in some European countries. Earlier this week we reportedhow several Central European countries were struggling with a new wave of the virus. Earlier today we heard aboutthe plans for easing lockdown in Wales. However, some businesses, including hospitality venues and gyms, have not yet been given a date they can reopen. Matt, a personal trainer based in Penarth, Vale Of Glamorgan, described today's announcement as ""another kick in the teeth and a death knell for people in our industry"". He questioned why fast-food restaurants had been allowed to stay open for takeaway, while gyms have had to close - especially when exercise can help people to stay healthy, reducing the risk from Covid-19. Matt is currently living with his wife and one-year-old twin daughters in his mother-in-law's living room but says he is unable to get a mortgage because of the ""uncertainty"" around his employment - despite having a large deposit. ""The uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months living in a front room,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's an absolute travesty.â Rules on meeting outside are among the first to be eased in parts of the UK Scotland hasbegun relaxing rules on meeting up outdoors, allowing four people from two households to gather.Wales will follow suit tomorrow. In England, lockdown will be eased in four stages, with all restrictions possibly lifted from 21 June at the earliest. Northern Ireland will outline its plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks. You can reada full breakdown of all the changes that have been announcedso far here. Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was the
scientific consultant on Contagion â a film about a deadly virus â reflected
on what he described as an âextraordinaryâ year on BBC Radio 4âs World At One
programme. He said the rapid progress and ""unprecedented"" global cooperation on vaccines was the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic. However, he warned there was still not enough vaccine available for the developing world and ""squabbling"" between governments about supply was beginning to emerge. Dr Lipkin said he was ""optimistic"" about the future because evidence suggested the vaccine would have an impact on transmission as well as preventing serious illness and hospital admissions. But he said governments had not learnt the lessons from previous virus outbreaks, including HIV, Sars and Mers and he feared that as the crisis begins to recede, so will funding for public health.

We'll be back tomorrow with more live updates on the coronavirus throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis, Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Georgina Rannard, George Bowden and Francesca Gillett. There's been a mix of stories about coronavirus around today. Here's a summary: This video can not be played Footage has been released by West Midlands Police of officers turning up at a poker party that was breaching lockdown rules. About 20 fines of Â£800 each were handed out when officers raided the poker event at a Birmingham pub on 6 March. The pub is now facing action for licensing breaches. The previous day, officers arrived to find a party with a buffet, drinks and a four-piece band at an empty shop elsewhere in the city. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent A
Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge
this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being
currently banned from going ahead. Mr
Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan
Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in
London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between
demonstrators and senior officers. The
judgeâs ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could
not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations. The
conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he
could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also
accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether
to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations. That
raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police
that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country. At
the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under
the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police
had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place. Senior
officers had said their ""hands were tied"" by the Covid lockdown laws
which banned all gatherings outdoors. But
as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket
ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the
health implications of a large gathering. The
judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants
and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the
rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should
comment."" More than 100 prisoners have died after testing positive for coronavirus over the last year, preliminary figures suggest. Provisional Ministry of Justice data from 16 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 show 118 prisoners had died after testing positive within 28 days of their death or where it was confirmed postmortem. Of these, the deaths of 93 inmates were suspected or confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus.
The deaths occurred in 54 prisons across England and Wales, the MoJ report said. Some 14,480 prisoners have tested positive for Covid since the start of the pandemic, in 127 jails. Some 106 of these were child criminals in youth custody. The prison with the most positive cases so far is HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire, with 468 between March 2020 and January 2021. This peaked this January when 249 were recorded, the figures show. The state of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken to deal with rising cases and deaths there, the head of the World Health Organization has said. ""Unless serious measures are taken, the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said all stakeholders should take the situation seriously, adding that neighbouring countries could be affected, Reuters news agency reported. ""The situation is deeply concerning and the measures that should be taken should be as serious as possible,"" Tedros said. AstraZeneca says export restrictions will reduce delivery of its vaccines to the European Union. The pharmaceutical company says it still aims to deliver 100
million doses to the EU in the first half of the year. ""Half of the EU's supply in the second quarter, and 10
million doses in the first quarter were due to be sourced from
the companyâs international supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said. ""Unfortunately, export restrictions will reduce deliveries
in the first quarter, and are likely to affect deliveries in the
second quarter."" It comes as a blow to the EU's vaccination plans that have already been hampered by delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. The EU has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in its member states and has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU. There's more about the EU's vaccine progress here. Flowers left at the bandstand on Clapham Common The organisers of the vigil planned for London tomorrow to remember Sarah Everard, who was found dead on Wednesday after going missing in south London on 3 March, have lost their legal challenge against a police ban on the event under coronavirus rules. A court hearing has been taking place at the High Court to challenge the Metropolitan Police's decision to ban the vigil. The organisers, Reclaim the Streets, claimed the decision to stop it amounted to a breach of human rights law. In court, the Met's barrister said the force had ""every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show"". ""But, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place."" Matt Bowring is a personal trainer from Penarth whose business has been badly
affected by lockdown. He and his family are now living in his mother-in-lawâs
living room after their offer on a home fell through. He feels that First Minister Mark Drakeford hasnât given clear
guidelines on when gyms and personal trainers can reopen again in Wales. Matt says: ""I've
been a coach for 15 years and seeing our industry in disarray with no clear map
for us is ridiculous. ""The
science shows that obesity and lifestyle are the main causes of
hospitalisation, yet keeping fast food restaurants open for take away was one
of the first things the government addressed. ""Both
my wife and I have coaching businesses and at the start of the first lockdown
the decision was made to move from our home and in with my in-laws. ""We
have one-year-old twin girls. This has not been an ideal situation as we have
not really been able to keep the majority of our clients training online, thus have
taken a huge revenue hit. ""Mortgage
companies will not touch us due to the uncertainty. We
have a large deposit, we have great accounts. ""The
uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months
living in a front room."" Some people have tested positive with a lateral flow test, despite a PCR test later confirming they were negative. A leading bio-statistician, Prof Sheila Bird, has raised concerns that lateral flow tests are being taken as complete proof of having coronavirus, without being checked with a second lab test. She is concerned that the lateral flow tests give false positives, leading to families having to self-isolate unnecessarily. The lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to a lab and can be done at home, giving a result within minutes, and have been rolled out for schoolchildren. When taken at home or in workplaces, lateral flow tests can be overruled by a lab test, known as a PCR. But the government has insisted this cannot happen for tests done in school - although it has been unable to explain why. ""The law regulations changed at the end of January and this seems to have given permission for NHS Test and Trace to ignore a PCR negative result and not allow it to overrule a lateral flow positive,"" said Prof Bird, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society's Covid-19 taskforce. ""So families who have sought confirmation [and] have a PCR negative are still being obliged to spend 10 days in isolation. ""Personally I think they should submit a yellow card of serious adverse harm to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority."" Read more about the issue here. Life in Scotland could be close to normal as early as mid-June, a leading public health expert has said. Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC she was ""very optimistic"" most restrictions would be lifted by the summer and perhaps even earlier. She warned international travel and mass gatherings were unlikely this summer but said the data was heading in the right direction. Scotland has been in lockdown since 5 January but the first minister has said the country is making progress suppressing the virus. Today the rules were relaxedto allow four adults from two different households to meet outdoors. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all legal limits on social contact could be lifted as early as 21 June if enough progress is made tackling the virus. Read more. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said he'd been helped by his ""supportive family"" and by getting a puppy. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" he added. The education secretary has faced tough criticism over how he dealt with issues including how pupils were graded when last year's exams were cancelled - prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post. Read more. We now have the latest daily coronavirus figures for the UK. The number of deaths recorded is continuing to fall steadily but the fall in the number of cases is slowing. The mass testing of secondary pupils in England, which began this week as schools reopened to all children, may be contributing to an increase in positive cases. More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.3 million people have had a second. The current seven-day average for first doses is around 295,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues. You can explore the figures for your areahere. A new mum has been able to hold her baby for the first time, after eight weeks of being treated for coronavirus. Baby Leo was delivered by caesarean section 10 weeks prematurely after mum Ellie Wright, 20, contracted Covid. Ellie was seriously ill in the critical care unit with the virus and pneumonia, and Leo needed to be on a ventilator. Her recovery could take up to two years, but she has finally had her first cuddle with her son. Ellie, from Walsall, said Leo was heavier than she thought he would be. ""He looks like me; he's got my nose,"" she said. She is still receiving care on a ward at the hospital, while Leo is ""thriving"" at home with his grandparents. Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 120 million. There have been 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. Meanwhile, we've got a graph showing how the number of cases is picking up in some European countries. Earlier this week we reportedhow several Central European countries were struggling with a new wave of the virus. Earlier today we heard aboutthe plans for easing lockdown in Wales. However, some businesses, including hospitality venues and gyms, have not yet been given a date they can reopen. Matt, a personal trainer based in Penarth, Vale Of Glamorgan, described today's announcement as ""another kick in the teeth and a death knell for people in our industry"". He questioned why fast-food restaurants had been allowed to stay open for takeaway, while gyms have had to close - especially when exercise can help people to stay healthy, reducing the risk from Covid-19. Matt is currently living with his wife and one-year-old twin daughters in his mother-in-law's living room but says he is unable to get a mortgage because of the ""uncertainty"" around his employment - despite having a large deposit. ""The uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months living in a front room,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's an absolute travesty.â Rules on meeting outside are among the first to be eased in parts of the UK Scotland hasbegun relaxing rules on meeting up outdoors, allowing four people from two households to gather.Wales will follow suit tomorrow. In England, lockdown will be eased in four stages, with all restrictions possibly lifted from 21 June at the earliest. Northern Ireland will outline its plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks. You can reada full breakdown of all the changes that have been announcedso far here. Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was the
scientific consultant on Contagion â a film about a deadly virus â reflected
on what he described as an âextraordinaryâ year on BBC Radio 4âs World At One
programme. He said the rapid progress and ""unprecedented"" global cooperation on vaccines was the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic. However, he warned there was still not enough vaccine available for the developing world and ""squabbling"" between governments about supply was beginning to emerge. Dr Lipkin said he was ""optimistic"" about the future because evidence suggested the vaccine would have an impact on transmission as well as preventing serious illness and hospital admissions. But he said governments had not learnt the lessons from previous virus outbreaks, including HIV, Sars and Mers and he feared that as the crisis begins to recede, so will funding for public health.

Court challenge over Sarah vigil,"A High Court hearing is under way after police said a planned vigil following the death of Sarah Everard would be ""unlawful"". Lawyers representing the organisers of Saturday's event in London say the decision goes against human rights law. In a statement, organisers Reclaim These Streets said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Ms Everard was last seen alive on 3 March in Clapham, south London. Reclaim These Streets said that by forcing them to cancel the vigil, the Met Police would be ""silencing thousands of women"" who want to ""stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets"". Met facing inquiry over Sarah Everard case Vigils for Sarah Everard to be held around Wales How many attacks on women are there? As well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events are planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool. Speaking on a visit to Queen's University in Belfast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""no woman should walk our streets in fear"" and that the whole country would be ""united in their feeling"" for Ms Everard's family and friends. On whether or not vigils should be allowed to go ahead this weekend, he said that the issue was before the courts now and was ""an operational matter for the Met"". Scotland's health secretary Jeane Freeman has called on people not to take part in the Reclaim the Streets vigils, warning that it was not safe to do so while coronavirus was not under control. On Friday, police confirmed that a body found in woodland in Kent on Wednesdayhad been identified as Ms Everard. A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to her disappearance and Scotland Yard isto be investigated over its handling of an allegationof indecent exposure against him. This video can not be played Vigil organiser Anna Birley: ""There's something we need to be angry about and stand up for as women"" One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC meetings were ongoing with the Met and Lambeth Council, while the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been an ""about-face"" by police, after the group had initially been told they were looking at ways to navigate the difficulties. She said organisers were ""put under increasing pressure"" and told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended. Ms Birley added that organisers had emphasised the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. MPs have called for the vigil to be allowed to go ahead, with Conservative Caroline Nokes saying she had asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in. The chair of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee said the Met Police appeared to have given organisers ""mixed messages"" and said the home secretary could ""send a very clear message that at this awful time"" when women wanted to express their sorrow at the tragic case. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she hoped the event could go ahead and said ""women's voices cannot be silenced"". The laws of the coronavirus restrictions are incredibly complicated - almost impossible to follow without repeated and careful reading. On top of that, they leave many decisions on what's lawful or not to frontline police rather than spelling out exactly when and how they should enforce the rules. Today, no-one is allowed to leave home ""without reasonable excuse"", but the examples in the regulations are not exclusive. In other words, it's open to interpretation whether a well-organised and Covid-safe demonstration would be lawful or not. On top of that, every decision by the police to restrict a protest has to first consider the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. During last June's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, senior officers took a softly-softly approach and allowed them to take place. So Reclaim These Streets want the High Court to say the police came down on the wrong side of the human rights balancing exercise - failing to respect the need to remember Sarah Everard and all women who have been victims of violence. In the statement, Reclaim These Streets said the event was planned by a group of women ""who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community"". ""Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence,"" they said. The organisers said they were aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, and had ""proactively reached out"" to Lambeth Council and the Met Police to ensure the event ""could safely and legally take place"". Sarah 'brought joy to our lives', says family 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' The young sisters standing up to call out catcalling The police initially said they were developing a local policing plan to allow the vigil to take place, according to the organisers. But they added: ""Since this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act."" Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people. During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests Human rights lawyers representing Reclaim These Streets have written to the Met challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the statement adds. ""Their view is that the Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering[s] of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act,"" it says. In a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""We understand the public's strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim The Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. ""We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations."" Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said he knew the public felt ""hurt and angry"" and said he recognised wider concerns have been raised about the safety of women in public spaces in London. 3 March:Sarah Everard vanishes after leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road, Battersea, about 21:00 GMT 5 March:Met Police are ""increasingly concerned"" forMs Everard and make an appeal on Twitter,external 6 March:Ms Everard's family say her disappearance is""totally out of character""as officers search Clapham Common's ponds 7 March:Footage taken from a doorbell camera showsMs Everard walking alonealong the A205 Poynder Road towards Tulse Hill at 21:30.

The programme of events also includes an investment conference, a concert and a centenary rose. The prime minister said the events would reflect on what makes Northern Ireland ""the great place it is today"". Northern Ireland was created in May 1921 after the partition of Ireland. A total of Â£1m has been awarded to 39 community projects connected to the centenary, through a shared-history fund in partnership with the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Planned events include: Belfast City Hall - an event marking the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament on 22 June 1921 by King George V Tree-planting - every school in Northern Ireland will be presented with a tree and encouraged to plant it in their grounds Centenary rose - a flower produced in Northern Ireland and presented to the Queen for her own garden International church service - in the autumn with all denominations invited Hillsborough Castle reception Centenary postmark - it will read ""Our Story in the Making - Northern Ireland Beyond 100"" Cultural programme - a series of live and online events including a centenary concert Business conference - London will host a business event at which companies and organisations from across Northern Ireland can promote their products and services Young people's programme - live performance and social media activities There will also be a number of academic events at Queens' University Belfast, examining the historical context of the centenary. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis encouraged people to take part. The centenary rose will be a mix of rose pink, ivory and yellow He said: ""The UK government's centenary programme of events provides an opportunity for us all to reflect on the history of Northern Ireland and to take pride in all this fantastic place has to offer the UK and the world. ""In its 100th year, the people of Northern Ireland can build on their spirit of togetherness and recognise their enormous achievements over past decades."" The events will reflect on the past and the people of Northern Ireland, says Boris Johnson Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""2021 marks 100 years since the creation of Northern Ireland, which has paved the way for the formation of the United Kingdom as we know it. ""Our centenary programme will reflect on the past and on the people and developments that make Northern Ireland the great place it is today. ""The activities will pay tribute to all those who have worked tirelessly to support Northern Ireland throughout the pandemic, and will champion the incredible young people in Northern Ireland who offer so much to the shared success of our United Kingdom."" Marking 100 years of Northern Ireland No Stormont budget for NI centenary 'outrageous' NI centenary should be handled 'sensitively' - PM On the same day as the international church service, some historic buildings across the UK are set be lit up. The colour of the centenary rose is a blend of rose pink, ivory and yellow. A decorative rose pin has been designed, to be worn by VIPs at centenary events and given to programme participants. Full details of the programme, including dates, have yet to be finalised due to the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said a proposal for the House of Commons to hold a sitting in Northern Ireland would be ""terrific"". According to a Daily Telegraph report, Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg is considering plans for MPs to meet in a devolved region each September. ""It would be a historic occasion, it would be wonderful to see that happening in our centenary year if it were possible,"" Sir Jeffrey told BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday. ""I would certainly be making a bid for Northern Ireland to have first crack of the whip and to host a meeting of the House of Commons here in Northern Ireland."" The Lagan Valley MP said it would be ""good for the United Kingdom"" for parliament hold proceedings outside London. However former SDLP leader Mark Durkan described the proposal as a ""gimmick"" which would come with cost and logistical challenges. ""This is just the latest in this game of uber-unionist leapfrog that is being played by ministers in London,"" he told the programme.

Today, no-one is allowed to leave home ""without reasonable excuse"", but the examples in the regulations are not exclusive. In other words, it's open to interpretation whether a well-organised and Covid-safe demonstration would be lawful or not. On top of that, every decision by the police to restrict a protest has to first consider the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. During last June's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, senior officers took a softly-softly approach and allowed them to take place. So Reclaim These Streets want the High Court to say the police came down on the wrong side of the human rights balancing exercise - failing to respect the need to remember Sarah Everard and all women who have been victims of violence. In the statement, Reclaim These Streets said the event was planned by a group of women ""who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community"". ""Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence,"" they said. The organisers said they were aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, and had ""proactively reached out"" to Lambeth Council and the Met Police to ensure the event ""could safely and legally take place"". Sarah 'brought joy to our lives', says family 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' The young sisters standing up to call out catcalling The police initially said they were developing a local policing plan to allow the vigil to take place, according to the organisers. But they added: ""Since this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act."" Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people. During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests Human rights lawyers representing Reclaim These Streets have written to the Met challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the statement adds. ""Their view is that the Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering[s] of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act,"" it says. In a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""We understand the public's strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim The Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. ""We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations."" Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said he knew the public felt ""hurt and angry"" and said he recognised wider concerns have been raised about the safety of women in public spaces in London. 3 March:Sarah Everard vanishes after leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road, Battersea, about 21:00 GMT 5 March:Met Police are ""increasingly concerned"" forMs Everard and make an appeal on Twitter,external 6 March:Ms Everard's family say her disappearance is""totally out of character""as officers search Clapham Common's ponds 7 March:Footage taken from a doorbell camera showsMs Everard walking alonealong the A205 Poynder Road towards Tulse Hill at 21:30.

Police and ambulance 'failures' in restraint death,"Leon Briggs's mother said she was ""disappointed"" the jury had not returned a verdict of unlawful killing The way in which police officers restrained a father-of-two contributed ""more than minimally"" to his death, an inquest jury found. Leon Briggs died in November 2013 after being detained at Luton police station under the Mental Health Act, having been held face-down in the street. His primary cause of death was ""amphetamine intoxication with prone restraint and prolonged struggling"". A jury found a number of serious police and ambulance failures. It recorded a conclusion that his death was ""contributed to by neglect"". Mr Briggs's mother, Margaret Briggs, said the conclusion of neglect did not ""reflect the evidence"". ""I am disappointed that the jury did not return a verdict of unlawful killing,"" she said. This video can not be played Leon Briggs: Witness saw 'police on top of him' Bedfordshire Police said the jury had ""identified a number of significant failings by the police"" for which it was ""truly sorry"", adding the force had made ""extensive changes"" since. Officers were called to Marsh Road in Luton on 4 November due to concerns about the 39-year-old's erratic behaviour. After being restrained face-down, handcuffed and placed in leg restraints, he was lifted into a police van ""like he was a bag of potatoes"", witness Wendy Hamilton said. As Mr Briggs was carried into the police station, the lorry driver was shouting and screaming in distress. He was detained in a cell at about 14:25 GMT. Mr Briggs became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15. Police treatment of man before death was 'shocking' Man who died held in 'potentially dangerous' way Officer used 'common sense' in restraining man The inquest, held in Milton Keynes, was told Acting Sgt Loren Short and PC Geoff Bennett restrained Mr Briggs. The officers said they ""wanted to do the best (they) could"" while he was ""shouting, struggling, and kicking out"", but the lawyer for Mr Briggs's family accused them of ""telling a pack of lies"". The jury was told that Mr Briggs was having ""an acute mental health crisis"" during the incident Witnesses said they heard Mr Briggs call out ""please help me"" while he was restrained face-down in a ""dangerous position"" on the concrete for more than 13 minutes. The jury found that ""inappropriate weight"" was used against him, though police officers did ""reasonably believe"" it was appropriate. A secondary cause of death was given as coronary heart disease. Mr Briggs was described as ""a really good dad"" who loved spending time with his children Before the inquest, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) paramedics who attended the call had admitted a failure to check Mr Briggs's vital signs or take him to hospital in an ambulance for medical treatment. Two paramedics who watched him being restrained ""did not even speak to Leon"" or ""offer medical advice to police"", Lewis Andrews, EEAST clinical general manager, told the inquest. Jurors said Mr Briggs had been experiencing psychotic disorder, caused by high usage of amphetamines, resulting in erratic and irrational behaviour and his subsequent detention. Officers failed to recognise he was in a state of medical emergency and did not monitor him in the police van and cell, which also contributed to his death, the jury said. The juryheard officers were ""laughing""as Mr Briggs was motionless and lying face down in the cell. Officers later called out his name and asked ""are you all right?"". Margaret Briggs says she hopes ""those responsible will be brought to justice eventually"". In a statement after the inquest, Mrs Briggs said: ""Why did the police choose to treat my son, who was mixed race, as if his life had no value? They took away his human rights. ""To this day, those police officers still have their jobs and livelihoods and no one has been punished for Leon's death. ""There has been no accountability or justice."" Mrs Briggs urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ""reconsider bringing prosecutions"". In 2018 the CPS saidno officers would be charged over Mr Briggs's death. Mrs Briggs said she had ""been truly shocked by the brutality of the treatment"" of her son and ""by how he suffered in his last hour of life"". ""He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor - with force used against him - and he was shackled,"" she said. Bedfordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Briggs's loved ones had ""to wait far too long to hear all the facts surrounding his death"". He said Mr Briggs ""was suffering a drug-induced psychosis triggered by amphetamine levels described by one expert as being 'off the scale'"". ""Unbeknown to officers he also had a serious underlying heart condition,"" he said. ""There is no easy way of managing such a situation."" Leon Briggs was detained under the Mental Health Act at Luton police station PC Peter Baron, who assisted officers during the restraint, told the inquest the way Mr Briggs was moved from the ground to the police van went against the ""approved technique"". Emma Carter, secretary of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said she disagreed with the jury's conclusion that Mr Briggs was restrained in a dangerous way, and said officers ""did their very best"" to deal with ""a very tragic incident"". Ms Carter added that ""six colleagues were suspended from duty for more than five years as part of this process"". At the timemisconduct proceedings were droppedagainst five officers in February 2020, more than Â£1m of public money had been spent on their pay while they had been suspended.

"Welsh hairdressers to reopen but retail stays shutFrom Saturday, people can meet another household in the garden, visit care homes and play golf.Wales","This video can not be played Visiting the hairdresser and meeting pals in your garden are among lockdown rules being relaxed Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local. Up to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday. Non-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March. Wales' first minister also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, but people can only go with their own household. Mark Drakefordwarned any further reopening in tourism would be haltedif holiday providers took bookings from outside of Wales. Election leaflets can be delivered from Monday A third of people in Wales now had first Covid jab Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? The Welsh Conservatives accused the first minister of a U-turn over retail, which Mr Drakeford denied, while Plaid Cymru said Welsh ministers had raised false hopes with businesses. Shielding for clinically extremely vulnerable people will also be paused from 1 April. For people living in England,the ""stay at home"" rule will end on 29 Marchbut holidays within the UK will not be allowed until 12 April at the earliest. Wales' ""stay at home"" law will switch to ""stay local"" on Saturday and there will be guidance on what that means, according to where you live. It is only likely to last for two weeks, however, ending on 27 March if conditions allow. ""The rule of thumb is that you should think of local as a five-mile radius from where you live,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""But if you live in a valleys community or a rural area you can exercise your judgement and go a little bit further."" Dyfed-Powys Police Federation representative Roger Webb said forces had not been given any information ahead of the announcement on how officers should engage on the new rules and enforce them. He said they would use common sense and work ""in the best way possible"" to make them effective. People in Wales will be able to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation from 27 March South Wales Police urged people to take responsibility for their actions and ""to do the right thing"". ""As some restrictions ease, there will be people looking to push the boundaries and break the rules. My plea to them is don't,"" said police and crime commissioner Alun Michael. From Saturday, 13 March: ""Stay at home"" becomes ""stay local"" Four people from two different households can meet up outdoors to socialise, including in gardens - children are excluded from the number. Mr Drakeford said the rules would allow people to walk through a house to access the garden Outdoor sports facilities such as golf, tennis and basketball will be able to reopen. A maximum of four people from two household can take part in activities Designated solo visitors can enter care homes From Monday, 15 March: All primary school children and those in qualifications years can return to class Schools will have flexibility to bring back year 10 and 12 pupils and more students will return to colleges Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments only Leafletingcan begin for the Senedd election From Monday, 22 March: Restrictions on non-essential aisles in supermarkets will be lifted Garden centres to reopen From Saturday 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation can reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household. Organised children's activities can restart Stay local restrictions will be lifted The Welsh Government also wants to reopen all shops and remaining close-contact services from 12 April, if the situation continues to improve. Stay-local rules 'hard to police' Wales 'on a knife edge' in dealing with pandemic How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Mr Drakeford said he was taking a ""careful and cautious"" phased approach to lifting restrictions. ""If we do too much too quickly, we will lose control of the virus and set off a new wave of infections,"" he said. ""And then we would be back at the beginning again, having to re-impose strict measures to protect people's health and save lives."" Salon owner Vicky Lewis said she saw some ""scary haircuts"" after the first lockdown Vicky Lewis, who owns Vicki's Salon and Kidz Cutz in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, welcomed the news after another lockdown that had been ""horrendous, boring and stressful"". ""I have had my salon for 22 years so I've been desperate to work,"" she said. ""It is also really worrying as you don't know if you still have your clients. It feels like I'm starting over again."" Now she is looking forward to trying to repair the same ""overgrown and scary haircuts"" she saw after the first lockdown. Hairdressers 'excited' over chance to reopen How to deal with your lockdown locks Mr Drakeford defended reopening hairdressers before all children were back in school. He said ""schools are our top priority"", and the scientific advice was clear that the safest way to get children back in class was to do so gradually. Mr Drakeford previously said ministers wouldlook to ""begin to reopen some non-essential retail"" at this review. However, that will now begin on 22 March when garden centres can reopen and supermarkets remove the wrapping from their non-essential items aisles. All other shops are expected to reopen from 12 April and the Welsh Government says it is making an extra Â£150m available to support businesses affected by ongoing restrictions. This video can not be played How do tourism businesses feel about the future? Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said the delayed reopening of shops was ""deeply frustrating"" with the industry losing Â£100m every week in revenue during lockdown. ""At the last review the first minister opened the door for a possible reopening on Monday and many retailers have taken the leap and invested in their stores and furloughed staff in preparation,"" she said. Ms Jones, who is a Conservative councillor in Monmouthshire, added: ""[This delay] will simply exacerbate the woes of a stricken industry."" Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening Welsh retailers 'dealt a hammer blow' by lockdown Mr Drakeford told his press conference that he did not ""change"" his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail. ""Three weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,"" he said. He said he was ""anxious"" about reopening non-essential retail in Wales ahead of the same shops being reopened in England. The first minister said it could act ""as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border."" Non-essential retail in Wales is scheduled to reopen on 12 April, the same date as England. He added it was ""safer"" to lift the ban on shops, including supermarkets, from selling non-essential items ahead of fully reopening shops that have been closed. Garden centre bosses had been frustrated by having to close in lockdownwhile centres in England remained open. Nicola Pugh, senior operations manager at Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff, said she was ""delighted"" at being given the go-ahead to reopen. The owners of Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff were ""frustrated"" at the different rules in England and Wales She said they had continued to grow plants locally at their nurseries so they were able to stock their centres in Radyr and Wenvoe. ""We are ready and waiting and have been working hard to ensure safe shopping for all our wonderful customers,"" Ms Pugh added. Shielding in Wales for people vulnerable from coronavirus will be paused from 1 April. The Health Minister Vaughan Gething said with cases lower than December ""we must only keep this advice in place for as long as is absolutely necessary"". ""In light of the change of context, the Chief Medical Officer has recommended that the advice to the clinically extremely vulnerable to follow shielding measures should be paused after the 31st March,"" Mr Gething wrote. Mr Drakeford suggested pubs and restaurants would only be allowed to serve customers outdoors when they are allowed to reopen Hospitality firms and gyms have not yet been given a date to reopen. At his press conference on Friday Mr Drakeford indicated the sectors will be looked at in a future review during April. He said as they look ahead to the end of that month ""if we continue to see an improving public health picture, we will be able to consider what more we can do to support people to meet each other and what we can do to continue reopening our economy, for example, looking at outdoor hospitality, the wedding sector and leisure centres and gyms."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as 17 May The first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government follows through on its plan to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May. But he said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date. ""In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,"" he said in an interview. ""I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus."" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, welcomed the change to stay local. But he said: ""Labour's U-turn on the opening of non-essential retail at such short notice will be a hammer blow for many businesses, and the decision to now align with England in that area shows we could've adopted a similar roadmap weeks ago. ""The ongoing refusal by Labour ministers to do so will only increase frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk."" Stay-local guidance has been brought in to replace the ""stay home"" message during lockdown Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been ""poor communication"" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he said had ""certainly raised false hopes amongst many businesses"" that they would open earlier. He told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs ""getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that"". Plaid also called for families to be allowed to meet from different householdsbefore tourism reopens. Three weeks ago Mark Drakeford said that today he would be looking at beginning the process of re-opening non-essential retail. Sticking to those words, that's exactly what he's done, but there were a lot of non-essential retailers who thought they would get more. There will be real anger that he allowing shops which have stayed open, and that includes the big supermarkets, to start selling non-essential goods before small privately owned shops are allowed to. For a period in December, the case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world - and lockdown was brought in just before Christmas. However, the rate has fallen significantly during the restrictions and as the vaccination programme is rolled out - it is now at 41 cases per 100,000 people. It remains below the 50 cases per 100,000 ""circuit-breaker"" threshold. In England,all restrictions will be lifted by 21 Juneat the earliest, as part of a four-stage ""roadmap"" based on certain conditions being met, such as a successful vaccine rollout. Scotland has announced thatmore people will be able to meet up outside from Friday, 12 March, which is earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is still to outline its plans to relax restrictions. If you had the chance to run Wales, what would be the first thing on your list of things to do?

As Mr Briggs was carried into the police station, the lorry driver was shouting and screaming in distress. He was detained in a cell at about 14:25 GMT. Mr Briggs became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15. Police treatment of man before death was 'shocking' Man who died held in 'potentially dangerous' way Officer used 'common sense' in restraining man The inquest, held in Milton Keynes, was told Acting Sgt Loren Short and PC Geoff Bennett restrained Mr Briggs. The officers said they ""wanted to do the best (they) could"" while he was ""shouting, struggling, and kicking out"", but the lawyer for Mr Briggs's family accused them of ""telling a pack of lies"". The jury was told that Mr Briggs was having ""an acute mental health crisis"" during the incident Witnesses said they heard Mr Briggs call out ""please help me"" while he was restrained face-down in a ""dangerous position"" on the concrete for more than 13 minutes. The jury found that ""inappropriate weight"" was used against him, though police officers did ""reasonably believe"" it was appropriate. A secondary cause of death was given as coronary heart disease. Mr Briggs was described as ""a really good dad"" who loved spending time with his children Before the inquest, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) paramedics who attended the call had admitted a failure to check Mr Briggs's vital signs or take him to hospital in an ambulance for medical treatment. Two paramedics who watched him being restrained ""did not even speak to Leon"" or ""offer medical advice to police"", Lewis Andrews, EEAST clinical general manager, told the inquest. Jurors said Mr Briggs had been experiencing psychotic disorder, caused by high usage of amphetamines, resulting in erratic and irrational behaviour and his subsequent detention. Officers failed to recognise he was in a state of medical emergency and did not monitor him in the police van and cell, which also contributed to his death, the jury said. The juryheard officers were ""laughing""as Mr Briggs was motionless and lying face down in the cell. Officers later called out his name and asked ""are you all right?"". Margaret Briggs says she hopes ""those responsible will be brought to justice eventually"". In a statement after the inquest, Mrs Briggs said: ""Why did the police choose to treat my son, who was mixed race, as if his life had no value? They took away his human rights. ""To this day, those police officers still have their jobs and livelihoods and no one has been punished for Leon's death. ""There has been no accountability or justice."" Mrs Briggs urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ""reconsider bringing prosecutions"". In 2018 the CPS saidno officers would be charged over Mr Briggs's death. Mrs Briggs said she had ""been truly shocked by the brutality of the treatment"" of her son and ""by how he suffered in his last hour of life"". ""He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor - with force used against him - and he was shackled,"" she said. Bedfordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Briggs's loved ones had ""to wait far too long to hear all the facts surrounding his death"". He said Mr Briggs ""was suffering a drug-induced psychosis triggered by amphetamine levels described by one expert as being 'off the scale'"". ""Unbeknown to officers he also had a serious underlying heart condition,"" he said. ""There is no easy way of managing such a situation."" Leon Briggs was detained under the Mental Health Act at Luton police station PC Peter Baron, who assisted officers during the restraint, told the inquest the way Mr Briggs was moved from the ground to the police van went against the ""approved technique"". Emma Carter, secretary of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said she disagreed with the jury's conclusion that Mr Briggs was restrained in a dangerous way, and said officers ""did their very best"" to deal with ""a very tragic incident"". Ms Carter added that ""six colleagues were suspended from duty for more than five years as part of this process"". At the timemisconduct proceedings were droppedagainst five officers in February 2020, more than Â£1m of public money had been spent on their pay while they had been suspended.

Court challenge over Sarah Everard vigil,"A High Court hearing is under way after police said a planned vigil following the death of Sarah Everard would be ""unlawful"". Lawyers representing the organisers of Saturday's event in London say the decision goes against human rights law. In a statement, organisers Reclaim These Streets said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Ms Everard was last seen alive on 3 March in Clapham, south London. Reclaim These Streets said that by forcing them to cancel the vigil, the Met Police would be ""silencing thousands of women"" who want to ""stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets"". Met facing inquiry over Sarah Everard case Vigils for Sarah Everard to be held around Wales How many attacks on women are there? As well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events are planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool. Speaking on a visit to Queen's University in Belfast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""no woman should walk our streets in fear"" and that the whole country would be ""united in their feeling"" for Ms Everard's family and friends. On whether or not vigils should be allowed to go ahead this weekend, he said that the issue was before the courts now and was ""an operational matter for the Met"". Scotland's health secretary Jeane Freeman has called on people not to take part in the Reclaim the Streets vigils, warning that it was not safe to do so while coronavirus was not under control. On Friday, police confirmed that a body found in woodland in Kent on Wednesdayhad been identified as Ms Everard. A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to her disappearance and Scotland Yard isto be investigated over its handling of an allegationof indecent exposure against him. This video can not be played Vigil organiser Anna Birley: ""There's something we need to be angry about and stand up for as women"" One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC meetings were ongoing with the Met and Lambeth Council, while the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been an ""about-face"" by police, after the group had initially been told they were looking at ways to navigate the difficulties. She said organisers were ""put under increasing pressure"" and told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended. Ms Birley added that organisers had emphasised the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. MPs have called for the vigil to be allowed to go ahead, with Conservative Caroline Nokes saying she had asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in. The chair of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee said the Met Police appeared to have given organisers ""mixed messages"" and said the home secretary could ""send a very clear message that at this awful time"" when women wanted to express their sorrow at the tragic case. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she hoped the event could go ahead and said ""women's voices cannot be silenced"". The laws of the coronavirus restrictions are incredibly complicated - almost impossible to follow without repeated and careful reading. On top of that, they leave many decisions on what's lawful or not to frontline police rather than spelling out exactly when and how they should enforce the rules. Today, no-one is allowed to leave home ""without reasonable excuse"", but the examples in the regulations are not exclusive. In other words, it's open to interpretation whether a well-organised and Covid-safe demonstration would be lawful or not. On top of that, every decision by the police to restrict a protest has to first consider the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. During last June's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, senior officers took a softly-softly approach and allowed them to take place. So Reclaim These Streets want the High Court to say the police came down on the wrong side of the human rights balancing exercise - failing to respect the need to remember Sarah Everard and all women who have been victims of violence. In the statement, Reclaim These Streets said the event was planned by a group of women ""who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community"". ""Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence,"" they said. The organisers said they were aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, and had ""proactively reached out"" to Lambeth Council and the Met Police to ensure the event ""could safely and legally take place"". Sarah 'brought joy to our lives', says family 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' The young sisters standing up to call out catcalling The police initially said they were developing a local policing plan to allow the vigil to take place, according to the organisers. But they added: ""Since this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act."" Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people. During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests Human rights lawyers representing Reclaim These Streets have written to the Met challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the statement adds. ""Their view is that the Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering[s] of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act,"" it says. In a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""We understand the public's strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim The Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. ""We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations."" Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said he knew the public felt ""hurt and angry"" and said he recognised wider concerns have been raised about the safety of women in public spaces in London. 3 March:Sarah Everard vanishes after leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road, Battersea, about 21:00 GMT 5 March:Met Police are ""increasingly concerned"" forMs Everard and make an appeal on Twitter,external 6 March:Ms Everard's family say her disappearance is""totally out of character""as officers search Clapham Common's ponds 7 March:Footage taken from a doorbell camera showsMs Everard walking alonealong the A205 Poynder Road towards Tulse Hill at 21:30.

Met facing inquiry over Sarah Everard case,"Sarah Everard ""always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour"", her family says The Met Police is to be investigated over its handling of an allegation of indecent exposure against the officer suspected of murdering Sarah Everard. The police watchdog will consider if  officers ""responded appropriately"" to the alleged incident. Ms Everard, 33, was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. The case has prompted an outpouring of shock and anger as women across the country share their own experiences of feeling unsafe. Organisers of a ""Reclaim These Streets"" vigil planned for Saturday evening on Clapham Common claim the police say it cannot go ahead because of pandemic lockdown restrictions, and are preparing to go to the High Court. Court challenge over Sarah Everard vigil Sarah 'brought joy to our lives', says family Prime Minister Boris Johnson ""completely understands the strength of feeling"" around Ms Everard's disappearance, his spokesman said, but is urging people to continue to abide by the coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Sarah Everard case âhas to be a turning pointâ Home Secretary Priti Patel said she would use her role ""to protect women and girls"". Writing a comment piece for the Sun, she said: ""Every single woman and girl should be free to walk our streets without the slightest fear of harassment, abuse or violence."" Police have been searching land near Great Chart Golf Leisure Country Club in Ashford Police looking for the missing marketing executive said human remains had been found in woodland in Kent on Wednesday, but detectives have not yet confirmed their identity. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had launched an investigation after receiving five referrals from the Met Police in relation to its handling of the case. The watchdog says it will examine how officers responded to a report that a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in south London on 28 February - three days before Ms Everard's disappearance. Ms Everard's family said it was out of character for her to disappear The other referrals to the IOPC were over the arrest of a serving officer on suspicion both of kidnap and murder, the Met's actions after Ms Everard was reported missing, and the injury of the suspect while in custody. The arrested man, who is in his 40s and works with the Met's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command,was taken to hospital on Thursday suffering from head injuries. He was treated, discharged and returned to the police station where he is being held after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court. The Met later said he had sustained the injury while alone in his cell and received immediate first aid. The officer was arrested in Kent on Tuesday. Ms Everard was last seen on 3 March walking alone down a main road in Clapham at 21:30 GMT, with police saying it was unclear whether she reached her home in Brixton. The former Durham University student, who is originally from York, was wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers when she went missing. In a statement on Thursday, her family appealed for more information to ""help solve this terrible crime"". ""Sarah was bright and beautiful - a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour,"" they said. ""She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives."" A woman in her 30s, who was arrested in Kent on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail until mid-April. 3 March:Sarah Everard vanishes after leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road, Battersea, about 21:00 GMT 5 March:Met Police are ""increasingly concerned"" forMs Everard and make an appeal on Twitter,external 6 March:Ms Everard's family say her disappearance is""totally out of character""as officers search Clapham Common's ponds 7 March:Footage taken from a doorbell camera showsMs Everard walking alonealong the A205 Poynder Road towards Tulse Hill at 21:30.

Welsh retailers 'dealt a hammer blow' by lockdown,"The Welsh Retail Consortium said the pre-Christmas lockdown ""dealt a hammer"" to Welsh retail. Welsh retailors had a ""disastrous end of year"" because of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has said. Footfall was down 52.3% in December compared to the previous year, more than the UK average decline of 46.1%. The Welsh Retail Consortium said businesses had been dealt a ""hammer blow"" with the pre-Christmas lockdown. Debbie Corkish, who runs Wizarding Boutique in Llandudno, Conwy, said ""it will take years"" for her business to recover from lockdowns. Wales went into anational lockdown on 20 December, following a surge in coronavirus cases, requiring all non-essential shops to close. Empty streets on Boxing Day in lockdown Wales Shops on a 'knife edge' under Covid-19 rules Businesses to get extra Â£110m in lockdown cash Wales saw the most pronounced year-on-year shopping centre footfall decline of all UK regions, at -59.1%, while footfall in Cardiff decreased by 54% compared to December 2019, according toBRC-ShopperTrak,externaldata. Sara Jones, head of Welsh Retail Consortium, said: ""It was a disastrous end to the year for Welsh shops, with the nation experiencing the UK's greatest fall in shopper footfall. ""Any hopes of a golden quarter for Welsh retail were dealt a hammer blow by the early pre-Christmas lockdown, forcing Welsh shops to shut during what should have been their busiest period. ""With the nation now in full lockdown, and so called non-essential shops remaining shuttered, it is time for decision makers to re-group, to re-assess and to identify ways to revitalise the Welsh retail industry given the key role we can play in the economic recovery of the nation."" Debbie Corkish said it is her loyal customers and online sales that kept her afloat in the summer Wizarding Boutique owner Ms Corkish said the financial compensation from the Welsh Government of Â£3,000 will not cover her losses for the Christmas week alone. ""After the English lockdown ended in December, we took a third of what we had the previous Saturday. ""It's like people forgot that they wanted to shop locally after summer [and] went into Manchester and Liverpool for their Christmas shopping. ""The week before Christmas should have been our busiest day but then lockdown was announced. ""It will take years to recover from last year. Being a tourist town, without tourists businesses just can survive. I dread to know what Llandudno is going to look like when all of this is over.""

Here are the main points:  We'll be back with live coverage of Monday's coronavirus update from the Welsh Government. In the meantime, you can keep up to date via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. Stay safe and have a good weekend. Kate Thistleton presents Bitesize Daily Secondary The BBC has announced plans to continue providing learning support to teachers and pupils into the summer months. A three-hour Bitesize Learning Zone will be launchedon CBBC and BBC iPlayer on school days, including new episodes of Bitesize Daily. It is designed to assist teachers in classrooms, as well as for use at home. Patricia Hidalgo, director of BBC Children's and Education, said programmes will be ""full of fun to help kids learn and catch-up"". The plans will target those with limited access to the internet, bringing new educational programming to TV. Residents in Merthyr Tydfil's Swansea Road area are being urged to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of
Covid-19 following a cluster of cases. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, Merthyr council and Public Health Wales are working to identify potential
contacts following the confirmation of 31 cases in
recent weeks. To help limit the spread, a new
drive-through mobile testing unit has been set up at Merthyr Valley Homes, in Gellideg, open from 0900 to 1630 daily. Anyone living or working in the area with symptoms should visit the centre as soon as possible to get tested. Professor Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health for Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, said: âThis latest cluster shows that, while rates
have been on a downward trend, Covid-19 is sadly still circulating in our
communities. ""[It] is a stark reminder to us all of the importance of social
distancing, wearing facemasks, washing our hands and following the lockdown rules."" Testing is also available across Merthyr Tydfil
for people who are asymptomatic. A drive-through testing centre has been set up at Merthyr Valley Homes, in Gellideg This video can not be played Covid: 'Lockdown businesses are coming back into trend' Business is booming again in a Flintshire community, thanks to a local retail voucher scheme and a series of local start-ups during the pandemic. A total of Â£12,000 worth of the ""The Totally Mold"" vouchers have been bought by people in Mold that can only be spent with retailers in the town. Retailers say they have adapted during the pandemic and people wanting to shop more locally. Jo Douglass, from Mold Town Council, said watching businesses thrive during the pandemic has been ""fantastic"". Delivering election leaflets will be allowed in Wales from Monday but door-knocking by activists will not be permitted yet, the first minister said. Smaller parties said restrictions on leafleting were unfair to them as they were less able to afford to pay for leaflets to be posted. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would be publishing guidance for campaigning for the Welsh Parliament and police and crime commissioner elections due to take place in May. ""It's got to be done sensibly and properly,"" he said. ""I am very used to going with a gang of people down the street to leaflet - it'll have to be done in more controlled circumstances than that. ""Yes, it will resume from Monday, we're not going to allow door-to-door canvassing in Wales at this point. ""I don't think it's advisable from a public health perspective and I don't think people would understand that either. ""You cannot meet members of your own family but you can meet a political canvasser? I don't see that being easy to explain, so we're not going to be doing that."" Door-to-door campaigning for England's local elections has been allowed since 8 March and activists can canvas and leaflet there as long as they work alone. Smaller parties said a ban on leafleting was unfair to them as they were less able to afford the cost of postage Care Forum Wales has praised the Welsh Government for its cautious approach to reopening care homes. Chief Executive Mary Wimbury said while indoor visits were being permitted again care homes would need to undertake rigorous risk assessment before judging whether they could safely take place. Many care homes were âterrified"" amid concerns a vaccine-resistant variant of the virus could appear at a time when health experts are convinced a third wave of the disease is inevitable. She said: âWhilst it is excellent news that we are now able to begin the process of reopening care homes to visitors, it will be a phased approach and it is imperative that we proceed with caution. âIt will not be like pressing a button and everybody returning immediately to the normality that existed before the pandemic struck. âWe are looking forward to welcoming some sort of normality in the weeks and months ahead."" Care Forum Wales has praised the Welsh Government for its cautious approach to allowing visits to care homes The Federation of Small Businesses in Wales has branded the Welsh Government's announcement on shops reopening ""confusing and disappointing"". Policy chairman Ben Francis said:

âAt the last review, the first minister strongly suggested that non-essential retail and close-contact services would reopen during this next period. ""Now, the picture seems much more complex and to many, will appear an âabout turnâ on the messaging of recent weeks. âMany businesses will have been closed for four months by the time that non-essential retail will be able to fully open on 12th April, and the consequences may well be severe."" Small and mid-size enterprises, Mr Francis said, had faced some of the worst economic consequences of the pandemic. âFSB has repeatedly asked that Welsh Government explain their position  to smaller businesses and the rationale on continued closures and restriction,"" he said. Mr Francis said he ""welcomed"" the financial support announced by the Welsh Government. ""However, for many of our smallest businesses, todayâs announcement will be bittersweet to say the least,â he added. The further reopening of Wales' tourism industry will be halted if holiday providers are found to betaking bookings from people outside Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Self-contained accommodation can reopen in Wales from 27 March, as long as cases remained low. But people in England cannot go on holiday in the UK until 12 April. Mr Drakeford told PA News the ""penalty"" for businesses acting ""irresponsibly"" would be that further reopening would end. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with ""stay at home"" rules replaced by a requirement to ""stay local"" and a plan to reopen parts of tourism industry for Easter has been set out. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been ""poor communication"" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he claimed raised ""false hopes"" amongst many businesses that they would open earlier. He told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs ""getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that"". Mr Price said such stores would face weeks of competition from large supermarkets who would be allowed to sell non-essential items while smaller stores remained shut. Ministers had raised ""reasonable expectations among thousands and thousands of businesses across Wales"" who would have been ""disappointed after a very difficult time for them"", he said. The Conservative leader in the Senedd has accused Mark Drakeford of ""a cruel betrayal"" towards non-essential retailers in Wales. Supermarkets will be allowed to start re-selling non-essential goods from March 22 while all other shops are expected to reopen from April 12. Andrew RT Davies said: âThe first minister has made a U-turn when it comes to non-essential retailers by not allowing shops to reopen as he indicated three weeks ago in the last review. âPeople on the high street will look across at the major supermarkets and see them trading while they're boarded up until  April the 12th. âItâs a cruel betrayal of non-essential retailers on the high streets the length and breadth of Walesâ. BBC Radio Wales Haberdasher Jane Baker supports the roadmap out of lockdown Non-essential businesses across Wales have reacted to First Minister Mark Drakeford's announcement aboutgradually reopening the economy. He said all shops should be able to reopen from 12 April, although those already open will be able to start selling non-essential items from 22 March. Jane Baker, who has run a fabric and haberdashery store in Carmarthen Indoor Market since November 2019, told BBC Radio Wales: ""I can't wait to be back to work. ""I am obviously missing everybody, all the other stallholders in the market obviously, plus all our customers. ""But Drakeford I think is doing the right thing. ""Opening slowly and steadily. As much as I really want to get back to work we don't want to rush into things.""  Anna Knight said she had been all geared up to reopen on Monday However Anna Knight, who runs gift shop Nest in Cardiff, said the announcement was ""frustrating and disappointing"". ""What's been frustrating has been that all the indications were leading us to believe that we were reopening next week,"" she said. ""We bought in stock, furloughed staff and cleaned up the store. It was all time and money."" Wales' first minister has clarified that people will not be confined to meeting up with the same household outdoors from next week. Rules allowing people to meet up in private gardens are due to take effect on Monday. Asked whether people would have to ""bubble"" in order to do this, the Mark Drakeford responded: âThatâs not what is intended. âYou can meet one household on Monday - four adults from two households can meet, and children under the age of 11 with them. ""On the following day you can meet another household, so long as you are sticking to those rules,â he said. The Welsh Government will look at allowing âgreater household contactâ for the second half of April, the first minister has said. However Mark Drakeford warned mixing inside peopleâs homes is âone of the most dangerous thingsâ with coronavirus. He said household mixing âwas undoubtedly part of the difficulties we got ourselves into in the weeks running up to Christmasâ. From tomorrow up to four people from two households will be allowed to meet in private gardens and Mr Drakeford said the change will make âa big differenceâ. âUp until now, you've only been able to leave your own home, locally and for purposes of exercise,â Mr Drakeford said. âNow you will be able to travel in your own local area, four people will be able to meet from two households for any purpose - not just exercise - and, very importantly, people will be able to meet in gardens. âI have letters from elderly people in particular who just aren't well enough to be able to walk to the park so they haven't seen grandchildren or other family members for weeks and weeks. âAnd now they will be able to meet people in their own gardens, under the circumstances that we described, and that will make a very big difference to lots of people here in Wales.â Mr Drakeford added that âon the journey that we are on, in the second half of April - if everything continues to go well - we will consider what we can do to allow people to meet in the way that I completely understand people miss and want to be able to resume.â First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped that by the end of March ""stay local"" restrictions can be lifted in Wales ""so people can travel to holiday destinations"". ""It will be self-contained accommodation only, not somewhere where facilities have to be shared,"" he said. ""But that does include, as it did last year when we started down this path, hotels that are able to offer room service and where people have all the facilities they need in their own room. ""The basic rules about only going with your own household will remain in place and all the other restrictions that we continue to need to observe will be as true if you are in your caravan as it would if you were in your own home."" Mr Drakeford stressed that he was ""making the rules for people in Wales"". ""It's very important that owners of self-contained accommodation don't take bookings from outside Wales over Easter because the arrangements that will apply across our border, for example in the prime minister's roadmap, will not allow people in England to travel or to stay overnight, away from their own homes,"" he said. It is âjust not possibleâ to guarantee that all coronavirus restrictions in Wales will be able to lifted safely by this summer, according to the first minister. âI think the summer is a long way off,â Mark Drakeford said. âThe further that we are from today, the more this becomes pure speculation. âOf course, if everything continued to go as well as it is now, if we saw no bumps in the road, then we will be able to lift restrictions further. âThe extent to which we will be able to do it is entirely dependent on the way that events unfold."" The first minister added it was his intention to loosen restrictions as quickly as possible, but said he would not sacrifice the gains made so far in combatting the virus. âNobody wants to not see life resume in all its different aspects,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""But here in Wales we will continue to do [things] as safely as we need in order to be able to protect the health of the public. âToday in Wales, we have a new variant, and nobody has any real-world experience of how that will react as we begin to lift restrictions."" Mr Drakeford stressed it was ""just not possible to offer people the sort of level of certainty we would all wish we could, that everything will be over by the summerâ. Wales' first minister said he did not âchangeâ his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail. Mark Drakeford said at the last lockdown review that discussions would be had with the sector âto see how we might beginâ the reopening of shops. âThree weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,â he said. âSupermarkets and other shops that are already open will from the 22nd of March be able to sell the full range of essential and non-essential goods. âFor many people that will mean that they will be able to purchase things that theyâve had to manage without for many, many weeks. âThose shops who are not already open will now have a definite timeframe to do all the things that they will need to do in order to be able to reopen successfully. âPeople need to be able to bring staff back from furlough, they need to be able to restock so that they can open with their shelves with things on them for people to buy, they will need to demonstrate that they are able to meet the new standards, the legally required standards that we have put in place here in Wales in response to the new variant of coronavirus,â he added. Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales. The Welsh Government isrelaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local. Up to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday. Non-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March. First Minister Mark Drakeford also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, providing a potential boost to the tourism industry ahead of Easter. First Minister Mark Drakeford says âan extra Â£150mâ is available to help businesses in Wales which are not yet able to open. He said the money would top up non-domestic rates grants. âThis means hospitality, tourism, leisure and non-essential retail businesses which must remain closed will be eligible for a third payment of between Â£4,000 and Â£5,000 to help them meet ongoing operating costs while they cannot trade,â the first minister said. âThis is on top of the announcement earlier this week extending the business rates holiday for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses for the whole of the next financial year.â Mr Drakeford said âin excessâ of Â£2bn had been made available to businesses over the course of the last year to help them through the pandemic âwhich is over and above the support available from the UK Governmentâs schemesâ. He said: âThis is the most generous business support scheme available in the UK. ""Iâm very pleased weâve been able to safeguard more than 160,000 jobs in these most difficult of times.â Wales' first minister says the âstay localâ rule will be lifted in time for Easter if the public health situation continues to improve. Mark Drakeford said the aim was to lift ""stay local"" rules on March 27 and âbegin the process of opening up our tourism sector, starting with self-contained accommodationâ. He said organised childrenâs outdoor activities would also restart in time for the Easter holidays. ""Libraries will also reopen so children can use them as well,"" he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed that hairdressers and barbers in Wales can reopen for haircuts âby appointmentâ on Monday. He said that if the public health position âremains positiveâ then âall close contact servicesâ will open from 12 April. He said from Monday, 22 March, non-essential retail would  begin to reopen. âWe will start by lifting the restrictions on what the shops which are currently open can sell,â he said. âGarden centres can also re-open from the 22ndâ. âOnce again, if the public health situation remains positive, all shops will be able to open from 12 April â the same date as in England.""

Tourism to halt 'if people from outside Wales book',"It is hoped people from Wales will be able to travel further than their local area at Easter The further reopening of the tourism industry will be halted if holiday providers are found to be taking bookings from people from outside of Wales, the first minister says. Self-contained accommodation can reopen in Wales from 27 March, as long as cases remained low. But people in England cannot go on holiday in the UK until 12 April. Mark Drakeford said the ""penalty"" for businesses acting ""irresponsibly"" would be that further reopening would end. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with ""stay at home"" rules replaced by a requirement to ""stay local"" and a plan to reopen parts of tourism industry for Easter has been set out. The ""stay at home"" rule will end in England from 29 March, but people will not be able to holiday in other parts of the UK until at least a fortnight later. In Scotland,people are being asked to stay at home until 5 April, with no date currently set for when people can travel to other parts of the UK. The Stormont Executive in Northern Irelandhas not given a timetable for reopening. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Stay-local rules 'hard to police' Clarity call on reopening Wales to tourists ""People who let accommodation should not be taking bookings from people who live outside Wales,"" Mr Drakeford told the PA news agency. ""We will be talking with our local authority colleagues and with the police next week, just to see if there is anything we need to do to mobilise our own enforcement authorities. ""I know there are rogues in any part of life. But I think that the industry will absolutely recognise that we want to go beyond self-contained accommodation. ""We want the tourism industry in Wales to have a longer and better season this year than we managed last year."" The Welsh coast saw tourists return in their droves when Covid rules eased last year Self-contained accommodation will reopen in Wales from 27 March, but people in England will not be able to holiday in Wales at that time. In England, the ""stay at home"" rule will end onÂ 29 March, but overnight stays in self-catering and self-contained accommodation will not be permitted untilÂ 12 AprilÂ at the earliest. Hotels and B&Bs may be able to take bookings in England from 17 May. Mr Drakeford said any further reopening of Wales' tourism industry would be halted if holiday providers were found taking bookings from people in England over Easter. Gwenan Jones says it is is not financially viable to accommodate people for one-night stays Not being able to accept bookings from customers in England over Easter is a big blow, according to Gwenan Jones, who owns the Cefn Cae Campsite and Holiday Village in Rowen, Conwy. ""When you have a booking from England they'll normally stay for three to seven days, but people in Wales only want one night away because they already know how beautiful Wales is,"" she said. ""We have to make sure our cottages look brand new every time, so when you take cleaning costs into consideration for a one-night booking, it's just not viable."" She said ""business can't continue like this"", adding: ""We're an industry that never asks for handouts - all we need is to be allowed to reopen and we'll be able to run things."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as 17 May The first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government followed through on plans to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May. But he said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date. ""In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,"" he said. ""I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus."" People in Wales will be able to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation from 27 March Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government defined self-contained accommodation as anywhere without shared facilities such as a kitchen or bathroom. He added: ""But that does include, as it did last year when we started down this path, in the same way hotels that are able to offer room service and where people have all the facilities they need in their own room."" The first minister said people will only be able to go on holiday with people in their own household. ""The basic rules about only going with your own household will remain in place and all the other restrictions that we continue to need to observe will be as true if you are in your caravan as it would if you were in your own home,"" he said. Mr Drakeford stressed he was ""making the rules for people in Wales"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged the Welsh Government to put ""families first"" by allowing family members from different households to meet before tourism reopens. ""Case rates remain stubbornly high in many areas attractive to tourists and we must remember the huge pressures already facing local hospitals,"" he said. ""After the sacrifices of the past year we should be putting families first and granting some limited extended freedoms for families to come together before tourism reopens.""

UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January,"UK goods exports to the European Union fell 40.7% in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while imports tumbled 28.8%. The figures show the biggest drop since records began in 1997, and are the first since new trading rules between the UK and the EU came into force. The ONS said temporary factors were likely to be behind much of the falls. Meanwhile, new data showed the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown. The economy is 9% smaller than it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic. UK delays Brexit border checks on EU goods again Which countries will recover fastest from Covid? Both imports from and exports to the EU fell ""markedly"" in January, the ONS said. The value of goods exported from the UK to the EU fell by Â£5.6bn in January 2021, while imports from the EU dropped by Â£6.6bn. The ONS said the fall in goods coming into the country were largely seen in machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals from the EU. Car imports, as well as medicinal and pharmaceutical products, were particularly affected. Accountancy firm KPMG pointed to Brexit as the likely culprit for the plunge in trade between the UK and the EU. In contrast, the UK's trade with non-EU countries grew by 1.7% in January. KPMG said intense stockpiling in December 2020 had brought some trade flows ahead of the Brexit deadline. The ONS said companies may have been using up that stock instead of buying new goods in January. In addition, the end of the temporary trading arrangement between the UK and the EU coincided with the discovery of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, which caused further complications and delays, after lorry drivers were required to take tests before crossing the border at the English Channel. The figures are the first since the Brexit transition period ended and show the steepest falls since comparable records began. However, the ONS said data showed that things had begun to pick up. Firms were reporting that trade was getting easier and trade levels started to recover towards the end of the month. The number of businesses saying they were unable to export between the middle and the final week of January had fallen by 5.4%, it said, and those saying they could not import had dropped by 3%. The ONS said the data for the period was ""erratic"", while Goldman Sachs called it ""noisy"", meaning there was a lot going on and it was too early to tell how much of the fall was a temporary blip. However, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Suren Thiru, said: ""The significant slump in UK exports of goods to the EU, particularly compared to non-EU trade, provides an ominous indication of the damage being done to post-Brexit trade with the EU by the current border disruption. ""The practical difficulties faced by businesses on the ground go well beyond just teething problems and with disruption to UK-EU trade flows persisting, trade is likely to be a drag on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2021."" A government spokesperson said:  ""A unique combination of factors, including stockpiling last year, Covid lockdowns across Europe, and businesses adjusting to our new trading relationship, made it inevitable that exports to the EU would be lower this January than last. ""This data does not reflect the overall EU-UK trading relationship post Brexit and, thanks to the hard work of hauliers and traders, overall freight volumes between the UK and the EU have been back to their normal levels since the start of February."" The Office of National Statistics was keen to add the relevant health warnings alongside the Brexit trade figures this morning. Some of the drop in both imports and exports may be attributable to firms on both sides of the channel stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period - so they didn't need to move as many goods in January. Some will also be down to the pandemic and in some industries that's difficult to disentangle from any Brexit effect. Nevertheless, as economists have noted this morning, there's no sugar-coating a fall of 40.7% in exports of goods to the European Union in January, our first month under the new trade agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson and signed on Christmas Eve. From the time of the referendum, the BBC has been highlighting the danger that it's not just tariffs that could jeopardise exports. The additional risk, well-known and well-discussed in Parliament, has always been that non-tariff barriers - such as vet checks on meat and poultry to the European Union - will boost exporters' costs sharply. These costs will have to be passed on in higher prices, sharply reducing exporters' competitiveness. And that's if they can pull off the no-mean-feat of getting their goods across the Channel at all. The deal simply didn't get rid of non-tariff barriers to trade. Food exporters especially are now feeling the impact. The ONS said January's contraction in the economy, down 2.9%, was a ""notable hit"". Retailers, restaurants and hairdressers were all affected by the latest Covid-19 lockdown. Jonathan Athow from the ONS, said. ""Manufacturing also saw its first decline since April with car manufacturing falling significantly.""However, increases in health services from both vaccine rollout and increased testing partially offset the declines in other industries."" Economic activity in health stood out, increasing by 8.7%, mainly through Covid testing and vaccine schemes. Pantheon Economics noted a 28.1% drop in output from the food services and accommodation sectors between December and January which ""reflected many cafes and restaurants giving up on offering takeaway and delivery services, while the pandemic was raging"". It also said households ""slammed the brakes on discretionary expenditure"", sending retail and wholesale output down 9%. The contraction during January reflects a difficult period for the economy as the third lockdown kicked in. But it was much smaller than expected and commentators in the main struck a positive note. Pantheon Economics said the GDP figures were ""less dreadful than expected"". Capital Economics said the drop was smaller than during last April's lockdown, which fell 18.3% on the month. Its UK economist, Paul Dale, said: ""Overall, January's lockdown left the economy in a fairly big hole. But the government's easing roadmap has provided the ladder and the vaccinations are providing the willingness to climb out of it. ""By early next year, we think the economy will be peaking (sic) its head out of the top as GDP returns to the pre-pandemic level."" KPMG said: ""Once restrictions are eased the economy is expected to pick up quickly, aided by the significant support the government has put in place. We expect growth of 4.6% this year.""â¯ UK delays Brexit border checks on EU goods again Which countries will recover fastest from Covid?

Vigils for Sarah Everard to be held around Wales,"Sarah Everard was last seen in south London on 3 March A silent vigil planned for this weekend in Cardiff after the death of Sarah Everard will now move ""entirely online, say organisers. Police have confirmedremains found in woodland in Ashford, Kent, are those of Ms Everard anda serving police officer has been charged with her murder. The decision on the Cardiff event was taken afterorganisers of a vigil in London lost their legal challenge in the High Courtagainst a police ban. That vigilhas now been cancelled. However, a Carmarthen vigil is set to go ahead. Organisers of the Cardiff vigil took to Facebook to share their ""great disappointment that we have had to make the difficult decision to move this event entirely online for tomorrow, as opposed to in person"". ""After careful consideration (and much much bigger numbers than we ever expected!) we must respect that we are still under lockdown restrictions and in a pandemic, and neither one of us want anyone to put their health or the health of those they love at adverse risk,"" they said. They added the online candle vigil would be held at the same time, including the same speakers and discussions. The Welsh Government said Ms Everard's killing ""has invoked a strong and passionate response"" and that testimonies received from women who have experienced violence and abuse were ""a stark reminder about why there is still more to do."" But a government spokesperson added: ""We are in the middle of public health emergency. Everard events to be replaced with doorstep vigils Everard vigil organisers lose court challenge Women share their fears of walking alone ""For everyone wishing to hold peaceful vigils this weekend, we would ask people to follow the rules which have protected us all from coronavirus and consider holding online events until larger gatherings can be held."" Women have beensharing their own experiences and fears of sexual violencesince 33-year-old Ms Everard's disappearance. NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts says women felt a sense of ""grief"" but not surprise Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, the National Union of Students Wales president Becky Ricketts said women across the UK were feeling a sense of ""grief"", but not surprise. ""We're still being told the same messages. We're still being told to contact our friends when we get home, making sure we dress in bright clothing, making sure we don't walk in dark areas, we walk home in groups,"" she said. ""The conversation around safety of women is so focused on women that we don't think about the role men have to play in this as well."" Cerys Furlong says most women do not know a woman who has not been a victim of sexual abuse or violence Most women ""don't know a woman who hasn't faced some sort of abuse or sexual violence in their life"", according to Cerys Furlong, chief executive of gender equality charity Chwarae Teg. She said one in five girls and women aged 14 to 21 have experienced sexual harassment in public since the start of lockdown. ""We need to look quickly and clearly at why there are so few convictions and why as a society we don't have confidence in women and believe them when they speak out,"" Ms Furlong told BBC Radio Wales. The chief constable of North Wales Police said Sarah Everard's death has ""brought into sharp focus the fact that everyone, wherever they are, should be able to live, work and walk our streets without fear of harassment, abuse or violence"". Carl Foulkes urged women to report ""any concerns about behaviour in complete confidence that the police will deal with that concern"". ""Tackling abuse and violence in all its forms is a priority for us. We are absolutely committed to doing all we can to prevent this and to prosecute those who commit or attempt to commit such offences,"" he said. Sarah Everard's family have paid tribute to her, saying she ""brought so much joy to our lives"" There have been calls from some for men to be given curfew in the wake of Ms Everard's disappearance. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he was not considering a curfew on men after a row over comments he made on BBC Breakfast television. On the show he said a curfew would not be not be ""top of the list"" to combat sexual harassment, he would be willing to ""consider all options"" if there was a ""crisis"". He said the Welsh Government changed the rules over the winter to allow people to exercise with one other person to help keep people safe. Although the Welsh Parliament can create offences in areas controlled from Cardiff, most criminal law is controlled from Westminster. After Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said such a curfew would be ""barmy"", Mr Drakeford tweeted: ""We are NOT introducing a curfew for men in Wales - or even considering it.

Human remains confirmed as Sarah Everard's,"Sarah Everard has been described by her family as ""kind, thoughtful, caring and dependable"" A body found by police in woodland on Wednesday has been confirmed as that of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old marketing executive disappeared as she walked home in south London last week. A serving Met Police officer remains in custody having been held on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder. In another development, organisers of a vigil for Ms Everardlost a legal challenge at the High Court against a police banon the event. Organisers claimed there had been an ""about-face"" by police, who told them that Saturday's Reclaim These Streets event in Clapham would not now be permitted due to the coronavirus lockdown, having previously said the gathering could go ahead. This video can not be played Vigil organiser Anna Birley: ""There's something we need to be angry about and stand up for as women"" Ms Everard was last seen on 3 March walking alone down a main road in Clapham at 21:30 GMT, with police saying it was unclear whether she reached her home in Brixton. On Friday evening, Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick took part in a walkabout on Clapham Common. She walked with police officers and spoke to members of the public in the park close to Clapham Common Tube station. Dame Cressida Dick said the arrest of a police officer had caused anger within the Met and with the general public Flowers have been laid at Clapham Common near to where Sarah Everard was last seen Earlier, speaking outside New Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave gave a televised update on the police inquiry. ""As you know, on Wednesday evening detectives investigating the disappearance of Sarah Everard discovered a body secreted in woodland in Kent,"" he said. ""The body has now been recovered and formal identification procedure has now been undertaken."" He said specialist officers remained in constant contact with Ms Everard's family and that hundreds of officers were working ""round the clock"" to establish the full circumstances of her disappearance. ""I know that the public feel deeply hurt and angry and I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we too are horrified,"" he said.

Sarah 'brought joy to our lives',"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Sarah Everard's family have paid tribute to her, saying she ""brought so much joy to our lives"". Human remains were found in woodland in Kent on Wednesday in the search for the 33-year-old, who was last seen in south London over a week ago. A serving Met Police officer in his 40s who was arrested on suspicion of Ms Everard's murder remains in custody. The Met has referred itself to the police watchdog over allegations the officer indecently exposed himself. He is also being questioned over the separate indecent exposure allegation, which the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said happened at a fast-food restaurant in south London on 28 February. Ms Everard waslast seen on 3 March walking alone down a main road in Clapham at 21:30 GMT, with police saying it was unclear if she reached her home in Brixton. After extensive searches, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick confirmed""human remains"" were found in woodland near Ashfordon Wednesday. A woman in her 30s, who was arrested in Kent on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail until mid-April. Police are continuing to search land near Great Chart Golf Leisure Country Club in Ashford The arrested man, who works with the Met's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command,was earlier taken to hospital suffering from head injuries. He was being monitored in a custody cell by CCTV and received immediate first aid, the Met said. After going to hospital the officer was treated, discharged and returned to the police station where he is being held after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court. The IOPC said it was investigating whether Met officers responded appropriately to the report of indecent exposure. It is one of five investigations being carried out by the watchdog in relation to the disappearance of Ms Everard. The others include the serving officer being arrested, injured in custody and the Met's actions responding to the initial report of Ms Everard going missing. This video can not be played Cressida Dick: ""Detectives and search teams have found, very sadly, what appears to be human remains"" Former Durham University student Ms Everard, who is originally from York,was wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers when she went missing. In a statement, her family appealed for more information to ""help solve this terrible crime"". ""Sarah was bright and beautiful - a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour,"" they said. ""She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives."" Home and woods searched over missing Sarah Everard 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns The marketing executive's family also thanked friends and the public for supporting them. ""We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing,"" they added. ""We are now pleading for additional help from the public."" Floral tributes have been laid near to where human remains were found in Kent The case has prompted an outpouring of shock and anger as women across the country share their own experiences of feeling unsafe. Earlier, Labour MP Jess Phillipsread out the names of almost 120 women killedin the UK where a man has been convicted or charged as the primary perpetrator. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"", adding: ""We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime."" Allow Twitter content?

We'll be back tomorrow with more live updates on the coronavirus throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis, Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Georgina Rannard, George Bowden and Francesca Gillett. There's been a mix of stories about coronavirus around today. Here's a summary: This video can not be played Footage has been released by West Midlands Police of officers turning up at a poker party that was breaching lockdown rules. About 20 fines of Â£800 each were handed out when officers raided the poker event at a Birmingham pub on 6 March. The pub is now facing action for licensing breaches. The previous day, officers arrived to find a party with a buffet, drinks and a four-piece band at an empty shop elsewhere in the city. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent A
Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge
this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being
currently banned from going ahead. Mr
Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan
Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in
London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between
demonstrators and senior officers. The
judgeâs ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could
not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations. The
conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he
could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also
accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether
to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations. That
raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police
that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country. At
the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under
the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police
had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place. Senior
officers had said their ""hands were tied"" by the Covid lockdown laws
which banned all gatherings outdoors. But
as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket
ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the
health implications of a large gathering. The
judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants
and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the
rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should
comment."" More than 100 prisoners have died after testing positive for coronavirus over the last year, preliminary figures suggest. Provisional Ministry of Justice data from 16 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 show 118 prisoners had died after testing positive within 28 days of their death or where it was confirmed postmortem. Of these, the deaths of 93 inmates were suspected or confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus.
The deaths occurred in 54 prisons across England and Wales, the MoJ report said. Some 14,480 prisoners have tested positive for Covid since the start of the pandemic, in 127 jails. Some 106 of these were child criminals in youth custody. The prison with the most positive cases so far is HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire, with 468 between March 2020 and January 2021. This peaked this January when 249 were recorded, the figures show. The state of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken to deal with rising cases and deaths there, the head of the World Health Organization has said. ""Unless serious measures are taken, the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said all stakeholders should take the situation seriously, adding that neighbouring countries could be affected, Reuters news agency reported. ""The situation is deeply concerning and the measures that should be taken should be as serious as possible,"" Tedros said. AstraZeneca says export restrictions will reduce delivery of its vaccines to the European Union. The pharmaceutical company says it still aims to deliver 100
million doses to the EU in the first half of the year. ""Half of the EU's supply in the second quarter, and 10
million doses in the first quarter were due to be sourced from
the companyâs international supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said. ""Unfortunately, export restrictions will reduce deliveries
in the first quarter, and are likely to affect deliveries in the
second quarter."" It comes as a blow to the EU's vaccination plans that have already been hampered by delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. The EU has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in its member states and has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU. There's more about the EU's vaccine progress here. Flowers left at the bandstand on Clapham Common The organisers of the vigil planned for London tomorrow to remember Sarah Everard, who was found dead on Wednesday after going missing in south London on 3 March, have lost their legal challenge against a police ban on the event under coronavirus rules. A court hearing has been taking place at the High Court to challenge the Metropolitan Police's decision to ban the vigil. The organisers, Reclaim the Streets, claimed the decision to stop it amounted to a breach of human rights law. In court, the Met's barrister said the force had ""every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show"". ""But, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place."" Matt Bowring is a personal trainer from Penarth whose business has been badly
affected by lockdown. He and his family are now living in his mother-in-lawâs
living room after their offer on a home fell through. He feels that First Minister Mark Drakeford hasnât given clear
guidelines on when gyms and personal trainers can reopen again in Wales. Matt says: ""I've
been a coach for 15 years and seeing our industry in disarray with no clear map
for us is ridiculous. ""The
science shows that obesity and lifestyle are the main causes of
hospitalisation, yet keeping fast food restaurants open for take away was one
of the first things the government addressed. ""Both
my wife and I have coaching businesses and at the start of the first lockdown
the decision was made to move from our home and in with my in-laws. ""We
have one-year-old twin girls. This has not been an ideal situation as we have
not really been able to keep the majority of our clients training online, thus have
taken a huge revenue hit. ""Mortgage
companies will not touch us due to the uncertainty. We
have a large deposit, we have great accounts. ""The
uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months
living in a front room."" Some people have tested positive with a lateral flow test, despite a PCR test later confirming they were negative. A leading bio-statistician, Prof Sheila Bird, has raised concerns that lateral flow tests are being taken as complete proof of having coronavirus, without being checked with a second lab test. She is concerned that the lateral flow tests give false positives, leading to families having to self-isolate unnecessarily. The lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to a lab and can be done at home, giving a result within minutes, and have been rolled out for schoolchildren. When taken at home or in workplaces, lateral flow tests can be overruled by a lab test, known as a PCR. But the government has insisted this cannot happen for tests done in school - although it has been unable to explain why. ""The law regulations changed at the end of January and this seems to have given permission for NHS Test and Trace to ignore a PCR negative result and not allow it to overrule a lateral flow positive,"" said Prof Bird, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society's Covid-19 taskforce. ""So families who have sought confirmation [and] have a PCR negative are still being obliged to spend 10 days in isolation. ""Personally I think they should submit a yellow card of serious adverse harm to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority."" Read more about the issue here. Life in Scotland could be close to normal as early as mid-June, a leading public health expert has said. Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC she was ""very optimistic"" most restrictions would be lifted by the summer and perhaps even earlier. She warned international travel and mass gatherings were unlikely this summer but said the data was heading in the right direction. Scotland has been in lockdown since 5 January but the first minister has said the country is making progress suppressing the virus. Today the rules were relaxedto allow four adults from two different households to meet outdoors. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all legal limits on social contact could be lifted as early as 21 June if enough progress is made tackling the virus. Read more. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said he'd been helped by his ""supportive family"" and by getting a puppy. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" he added. The education secretary has faced tough criticism over how he dealt with issues including how pupils were graded when last year's exams were cancelled - prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post. Read more. We now have the latest daily coronavirus figures for the UK. The number of deaths recorded is continuing to fall steadily but the fall in the number of cases is slowing. The mass testing of secondary pupils in England, which began this week as schools reopened to all children, may be contributing to an increase in positive cases. More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.3 million people have had a second. The current seven-day average for first doses is around 295,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues. You can explore the figures for your areahere. A new mum has been able to hold her baby for the first time, after eight weeks of being treated for coronavirus. Baby Leo was delivered by caesarean section 10 weeks prematurely after mum Ellie Wright, 20, contracted Covid. Ellie was seriously ill in the critical care unit with the virus and pneumonia, and Leo needed to be on a ventilator. Her recovery could take up to two years, but she has finally had her first cuddle with her son. Ellie, from Walsall, said Leo was heavier than she thought he would be. ""He looks like me; he's got my nose,"" she said. She is still receiving care on a ward at the hospital, while Leo is ""thriving"" at home with his grandparents. Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 120 million. There have been 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. Meanwhile, we've got a graph showing how the number of cases is picking up in some European countries. Earlier this week we reportedhow several Central European countries were struggling with a new wave of the virus. Earlier today we heard aboutthe plans for easing lockdown in Wales. However, some businesses, including hospitality venues and gyms, have not yet been given a date they can reopen. Matt, a personal trainer based in Penarth, Vale Of Glamorgan, described today's announcement as ""another kick in the teeth and a death knell for people in our industry"". He questioned why fast-food restaurants had been allowed to stay open for takeaway, while gyms have had to close - especially when exercise can help people to stay healthy, reducing the risk from Covid-19. Matt is currently living with his wife and one-year-old twin daughters in his mother-in-law's living room but says he is unable to get a mortgage because of the ""uncertainty"" around his employment - despite having a large deposit. ""The uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months living in a front room,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's an absolute travesty.â Rules on meeting outside are among the first to be eased in parts of the UK Scotland hasbegun relaxing rules on meeting up outdoors, allowing four people from two households to gather.Wales will follow suit tomorrow. In England, lockdown will be eased in four stages, with all restrictions possibly lifted from 21 June at the earliest. Northern Ireland will outline its plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks. You can reada full breakdown of all the changes that have been announcedso far here. Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was the
scientific consultant on Contagion â a film about a deadly virus â reflected

Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge
this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being
currently banned from going ahead. Mr
Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan
Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in
London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between
demonstrators and senior officers. The
judgeâs ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could
not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations. The
conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he
could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also
accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether
to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations. That
raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police
that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country. At
the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under
the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police
had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place. Senior
officers had said their ""hands were tied"" by the Covid lockdown laws
which banned all gatherings outdoors. But
as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket
ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the
health implications of a large gathering. The
judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants
and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the
rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should
comment."" More than 100 prisoners have died after testing positive for coronavirus over the last year, preliminary figures suggest. Provisional Ministry of Justice data from 16 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 show 118 prisoners had died after testing positive within 28 days of their death or where it was confirmed postmortem. Of these, the deaths of 93 inmates were suspected or confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus.
The deaths occurred in 54 prisons across England and Wales, the MoJ report said. Some 14,480 prisoners have tested positive for Covid since the start of the pandemic, in 127 jails. Some 106 of these were child criminals in youth custody. The prison with the most positive cases so far is HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire, with 468 between March 2020 and January 2021. This peaked this January when 249 were recorded, the figures show. The state of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken to deal with rising cases and deaths there, the head of the World Health Organization has said. ""Unless serious measures are taken, the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said all stakeholders should take the situation seriously, adding that neighbouring countries could be affected, Reuters news agency reported. ""The situation is deeply concerning and the measures that should be taken should be as serious as possible,"" Tedros said. AstraZeneca says export restrictions will reduce delivery of its vaccines to the European Union. The pharmaceutical company says it still aims to deliver 100
million doses to the EU in the first half of the year. ""Half of the EU's supply in the second quarter, and 10
million doses in the first quarter were due to be sourced from
the companyâs international supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said. ""Unfortunately, export restrictions will reduce deliveries
in the first quarter, and are likely to affect deliveries in the
second quarter."" It comes as a blow to the EU's vaccination plans that have already been hampered by delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. The EU has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in its member states and has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU. There's more about the EU's vaccine progress here. Flowers left at the bandstand on Clapham Common The organisers of the vigil planned for London tomorrow to remember Sarah Everard, who was found dead on Wednesday after going missing in south London on 3 March, have lost their legal challenge against a police ban on the event under coronavirus rules. A court hearing has been taking place at the High Court to challenge the Metropolitan Police's decision to ban the vigil. The organisers, Reclaim the Streets, claimed the decision to stop it amounted to a breach of human rights law. In court, the Met's barrister said the force had ""every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show"". ""But, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place."" Matt Bowring is a personal trainer from Penarth whose business has been badly
affected by lockdown. He and his family are now living in his mother-in-lawâs
living room after their offer on a home fell through. He feels that First Minister Mark Drakeford hasnât given clear
guidelines on when gyms and personal trainers can reopen again in Wales. Matt says: ""I've
been a coach for 15 years and seeing our industry in disarray with no clear map
for us is ridiculous. ""The
science shows that obesity and lifestyle are the main causes of
hospitalisation, yet keeping fast food restaurants open for take away was one
of the first things the government addressed. ""Both
my wife and I have coaching businesses and at the start of the first lockdown
the decision was made to move from our home and in with my in-laws. ""We
have one-year-old twin girls. This has not been an ideal situation as we have
not really been able to keep the majority of our clients training online, thus have
taken a huge revenue hit. ""Mortgage
companies will not touch us due to the uncertainty. We
have a large deposit, we have great accounts. ""The
uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months
living in a front room."" Some people have tested positive with a lateral flow test, despite a PCR test later confirming they were negative. A leading bio-statistician, Prof Sheila Bird, has raised concerns that lateral flow tests are being taken as complete proof of having coronavirus, without being checked with a second lab test. She is concerned that the lateral flow tests give false positives, leading to families having to self-isolate unnecessarily. The lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to a lab and can be done at home, giving a result within minutes, and have been rolled out for schoolchildren. When taken at home or in workplaces, lateral flow tests can be overruled by a lab test, known as a PCR. But the government has insisted this cannot happen for tests done in school - although it has been unable to explain why. ""The law regulations changed at the end of January and this seems to have given permission for NHS Test and Trace to ignore a PCR negative result and not allow it to overrule a lateral flow positive,"" said Prof Bird, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society's Covid-19 taskforce. ""So families who have sought confirmation [and] have a PCR negative are still being obliged to spend 10 days in isolation. ""Personally I think they should submit a yellow card of serious adverse harm to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority."" Read more about the issue here. Life in Scotland could be close to normal as early as mid-June, a leading public health expert has said. Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC she was ""very optimistic"" most restrictions would be lifted by the summer and perhaps even earlier. She warned international travel and mass gatherings were unlikely this summer but said the data was heading in the right direction. Scotland has been in lockdown since 5 January but the first minister has said the country is making progress suppressing the virus. Today the rules were relaxedto allow four adults from two different households to meet outdoors. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all legal limits on social contact could be lifted as early as 21 June if enough progress is made tackling the virus. Read more. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said he'd been helped by his ""supportive family"" and by getting a puppy. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" he added. The education secretary has faced tough criticism over how he dealt with issues including how pupils were graded when last year's exams were cancelled - prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post. Read more. We now have the latest daily coronavirus figures for the UK. The number of deaths recorded is continuing to fall steadily but the fall in the number of cases is slowing. The mass testing of secondary pupils in England, which began this week as schools reopened to all children, may be contributing to an increase in positive cases. More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.3 million people have had a second. The current seven-day average for first doses is around 295,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues. You can explore the figures for your areahere. A new mum has been able to hold her baby for the first time, after eight weeks of being treated for coronavirus. Baby Leo was delivered by caesarean section 10 weeks prematurely after mum Ellie Wright, 20, contracted Covid. Ellie was seriously ill in the critical care unit with the virus and pneumonia, and Leo needed to be on a ventilator. Her recovery could take up to two years, but she has finally had her first cuddle with her son. Ellie, from Walsall, said Leo was heavier than she thought he would be. ""He looks like me; he's got my nose,"" she said. She is still receiving care on a ward at the hospital, while Leo is ""thriving"" at home with his grandparents. Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 120 million. There have been 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. Meanwhile, we've got a graph showing how the number of cases is picking up in some European countries. Earlier this week we reportedhow several Central European countries were struggling with a new wave of the virus. Earlier today we heard aboutthe plans for easing lockdown in Wales. However, some businesses, including hospitality venues and gyms, have not yet been given a date they can reopen. Matt, a personal trainer based in Penarth, Vale Of Glamorgan, described today's announcement as ""another kick in the teeth and a death knell for people in our industry"". He questioned why fast-food restaurants had been allowed to stay open for takeaway, while gyms have had to close - especially when exercise can help people to stay healthy, reducing the risk from Covid-19. Matt is currently living with his wife and one-year-old twin daughters in his mother-in-law's living room but says he is unable to get a mortgage because of the ""uncertainty"" around his employment - despite having a large deposit. ""The uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months living in a front room,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's an absolute travesty.â Rules on meeting outside are among the first to be eased in parts of the UK Scotland hasbegun relaxing rules on meeting up outdoors, allowing four people from two households to gather.Wales will follow suit tomorrow. In England, lockdown will be eased in four stages, with all restrictions possibly lifted from 21 June at the earliest. Northern Ireland will outline its plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks. You can reada full breakdown of all the changes that have been announcedso far here. Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the

But he said governments had not learnt the lessons from previous virus outbreaks, including HIV, Sars and Mers and he feared that as the crisis begins to recede, so will funding for public health.

We'll be back tomorrow with more live updates on the coronavirus throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis, Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Georgina Rannard, George Bowden and Francesca Gillett. There's been a mix of stories about coronavirus around today. Here's a summary: This video can not be played Footage has been released by West Midlands Police of officers turning up at a poker party that was breaching lockdown rules. About 20 fines of Â£800 each were handed out when officers raided the poker event at a Birmingham pub on 6 March. The pub is now facing action for licensing breaches. The previous day, officers arrived to find a party with a buffet, drinks and a four-piece band at an empty shop elsewhere in the city. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent A
Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge
this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being
currently banned from going ahead. Mr
Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan
Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in
London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between
demonstrators and senior officers. The
judgeâs ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could
not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations. The
conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he
could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also
accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether
to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations. That
raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police
that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country. At
the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under
the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police
had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place. Senior
officers had said their ""hands were tied"" by the Covid lockdown laws
which banned all gatherings outdoors. But
as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket
ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the
health implications of a large gathering. The
judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants
and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the
rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should
comment."" More than 100 prisoners have died after testing positive for coronavirus over the last year, preliminary figures suggest. Provisional Ministry of Justice data from 16 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 show 118 prisoners had died after testing positive within 28 days of their death or where it was confirmed postmortem. Of these, the deaths of 93 inmates were suspected or confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus.
The deaths occurred in 54 prisons across England and Wales, the MoJ report said. Some 14,480 prisoners have tested positive for Covid since the start of the pandemic, in 127 jails. Some 106 of these were child criminals in youth custody. The prison with the most positive cases so far is HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire, with 468 between March 2020 and January 2021. This peaked this January when 249 were recorded, the figures show. The state of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken to deal with rising cases and deaths there, the head of the World Health Organization has said. ""Unless serious measures are taken, the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said all stakeholders should take the situation seriously, adding that neighbouring countries could be affected, Reuters news agency reported. ""The situation is deeply concerning and the measures that should be taken should be as serious as possible,"" Tedros said. AstraZeneca says export restrictions will reduce delivery of its vaccines to the European Union. The pharmaceutical company says it still aims to deliver 100
million doses to the EU in the first half of the year. ""Half of the EU's supply in the second quarter, and 10
million doses in the first quarter were due to be sourced from
the companyâs international supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said. ""Unfortunately, export restrictions will reduce deliveries
in the first quarter, and are likely to affect deliveries in the
second quarter."" It comes as a blow to the EU's vaccination plans that have already been hampered by delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. The EU has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in its member states and has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU. There's more about the EU's vaccine progress here. Flowers left at the bandstand on Clapham Common The organisers of the vigil planned for London tomorrow to remember Sarah Everard, who was found dead on Wednesday after going missing in south London on 3 March, have lost their legal challenge against a police ban on the event under coronavirus rules. A court hearing has been taking place at the High Court to challenge the Metropolitan Police's decision to ban the vigil. The organisers, Reclaim the Streets, claimed the decision to stop it amounted to a breach of human rights law. In court, the Met's barrister said the force had ""every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show"". ""But, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place."" Matt Bowring is a personal trainer from Penarth whose business has been badly
affected by lockdown. He and his family are now living in his mother-in-lawâs
living room after their offer on a home fell through. He feels that First Minister Mark Drakeford hasnât given clear
guidelines on when gyms and personal trainers can reopen again in Wales. Matt says: ""I've
been a coach for 15 years and seeing our industry in disarray with no clear map
for us is ridiculous. ""The
science shows that obesity and lifestyle are the main causes of
hospitalisation, yet keeping fast food restaurants open for take away was one
of the first things the government addressed. ""Both
my wife and I have coaching businesses and at the start of the first lockdown
the decision was made to move from our home and in with my in-laws. ""We
have one-year-old twin girls. This has not been an ideal situation as we have
not really been able to keep the majority of our clients training online, thus have
taken a huge revenue hit. ""Mortgage
companies will not touch us due to the uncertainty. We
have a large deposit, we have great accounts. ""The
uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months
living in a front room."" Some people have tested positive with a lateral flow test, despite a PCR test later confirming they were negative. A leading bio-statistician, Prof Sheila Bird, has raised concerns that lateral flow tests are being taken as complete proof of having coronavirus, without being checked with a second lab test. She is concerned that the lateral flow tests give false positives, leading to families having to self-isolate unnecessarily. The lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to a lab and can be done at home, giving a result within minutes, and have been rolled out for schoolchildren. When taken at home or in workplaces, lateral flow tests can be overruled by a lab test, known as a PCR. But the government has insisted this cannot happen for tests done in school - although it has been unable to explain why. ""The law regulations changed at the end of January and this seems to have given permission for NHS Test and Trace to ignore a PCR negative result and not allow it to overrule a lateral flow positive,"" said Prof Bird, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society's Covid-19 taskforce. ""So families who have sought confirmation [and] have a PCR negative are still being obliged to spend 10 days in isolation. ""Personally I think they should submit a yellow card of serious adverse harm to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority."" Read more about the issue here. Life in Scotland could be close to normal as early as mid-June, a leading public health expert has said. Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC she was ""very optimistic"" most restrictions would be lifted by the summer and perhaps even earlier. She warned international travel and mass gatherings were unlikely this summer but said the data was heading in the right direction. Scotland has been in lockdown since 5 January but the first minister has said the country is making progress suppressing the virus. Today the rules were relaxedto allow four adults from two different households to meet outdoors. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all legal limits on social contact could be lifted as early as 21 June if enough progress is made tackling the virus. Read more. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said he'd been helped by his ""supportive family"" and by getting a puppy. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" he added. The education secretary has faced tough criticism over how he dealt with issues including how pupils were graded when last year's exams were cancelled - prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post. Read more. We now have the latest daily coronavirus figures for the UK. The number of deaths recorded is continuing to fall steadily but the fall in the number of cases is slowing. The mass testing of secondary pupils in England, which began this week as schools reopened to all children, may be contributing to an increase in positive cases. More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.3 million people have had a second. The current seven-day average for first doses is around 295,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues. You can explore the figures for your areahere. A new mum has been able to hold her baby for the first time, after eight weeks of being treated for coronavirus. Baby Leo was delivered by caesarean section 10 weeks prematurely after mum Ellie Wright, 20, contracted Covid. Ellie was seriously ill in the critical care unit with the virus and pneumonia, and Leo needed to be on a ventilator. Her recovery could take up to two years, but she has finally had her first cuddle with her son. Ellie, from Walsall, said Leo was heavier than she thought he would be. ""He looks like me; he's got my nose,"" she said. She is still receiving care on a ward at the hospital, while Leo is ""thriving"" at home with his grandparents. Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 120 million. There have been 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. Meanwhile, we've got a graph showing how the number of cases is picking up in some European countries. Earlier this week we reportedhow several Central European countries were struggling with a new wave of the virus. Earlier today we heard aboutthe plans for easing lockdown in Wales. However, some businesses, including hospitality venues and gyms, have not yet been given a date they can reopen. Matt, a personal trainer based in Penarth, Vale Of Glamorgan, described today's announcement as ""another kick in the teeth and a death knell for people in our industry"". He questioned why fast-food restaurants had been allowed to stay open for takeaway, while gyms have had to close - especially when exercise can help people to stay healthy, reducing the risk from Covid-19. Matt is currently living with his wife and one-year-old twin daughters in his mother-in-law's living room but says he is unable to get a mortgage because of the ""uncertainty"" around his employment - despite having a large deposit. ""The uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months living in a front room,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's an absolute travesty.â Rules on meeting outside are among the first to be eased in parts of the UK Scotland hasbegun relaxing rules on meeting up outdoors, allowing four people from two households to gather.Wales will follow suit tomorrow. In England, lockdown will be eased in four stages, with all restrictions possibly lifted from 21 June at the earliest. Northern Ireland will outline its plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks. You can reada full breakdown of all the changes that have been announcedso far here. Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was the
scientific consultant on Contagion â a film about a deadly virus â reflected
on what he described as an âextraordinaryâ year on BBC Radio 4âs World At One
programme. He said the rapid progress and ""unprecedented"" global cooperation on vaccines was the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic. However, he warned there was still not enough vaccine available for the developing world and ""squabbling"" between governments about supply was beginning to emerge. Dr Lipkin said he was ""optimistic"" about the future because evidence suggested the vaccine would have an impact on transmission as well as preventing serious illness and hospital admissions. But he said governments had not learnt the lessons from previous virus outbreaks, including HIV, Sars and Mers and he feared that as the crisis begins to recede, so will funding for public health.

"Police and ambulance 'failures' in restraint deathJurors find the way officers restrained Leon Briggs contributed ""more than minimally"" to his death.","Leon Briggs's mother said she was ""disappointed"" the jury had not returned a verdict of unlawful killing The way in which police officers restrained a father-of-two contributed ""more than minimally"" to his death, an inquest jury found. Leon Briggs died in November 2013 after being detained at Luton police station under the Mental Health Act, having been held face-down in the street. His primary cause of death was ""amphetamine intoxication with prone restraint and prolonged struggling"". A jury found a number of serious police and ambulance failures. It recorded a conclusion that his death was ""contributed to by neglect"". Mr Briggs's mother, Margaret Briggs, said the conclusion of neglect did not ""reflect the evidence"". ""I am disappointed that the jury did not return a verdict of unlawful killing,"" she said. This video can not be played Leon Briggs: Witness saw 'police on top of him' Bedfordshire Police said the jury had ""identified a number of significant failings by the police"" for which it was ""truly sorry"", adding the force had made ""extensive changes"" since. Officers were called to Marsh Road in Luton on 4 November due to concerns about the 39-year-old's erratic behaviour. After being restrained face-down, handcuffed and placed in leg restraints, he was lifted into a police van ""like he was a bag of potatoes"", witness Wendy Hamilton said. As Mr Briggs was carried into the police station, the lorry driver was shouting and screaming in distress. He was detained in a cell at about 14:25 GMT. Mr Briggs became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15. Police treatment of man before death was 'shocking' Man who died held in 'potentially dangerous' way Officer used 'common sense' in restraining man The inquest, held in Milton Keynes, was told Acting Sgt Loren Short and PC Geoff Bennett restrained Mr Briggs. The officers said they ""wanted to do the best (they) could"" while he was ""shouting, struggling, and kicking out"", but the lawyer for Mr Briggs's family accused them of ""telling a pack of lies"". The jury was told that Mr Briggs was having ""an acute mental health crisis"" during the incident Witnesses said they heard Mr Briggs call out ""please help me"" while he was restrained face-down in a ""dangerous position"" on the concrete for more than 13 minutes. The jury found that ""inappropriate weight"" was used against him, though police officers did ""reasonably believe"" it was appropriate. A secondary cause of death was given as coronary heart disease. Mr Briggs was described as ""a really good dad"" who loved spending time with his children Before the inquest, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) paramedics who attended the call had admitted a failure to check Mr Briggs's vital signs or take him to hospital in an ambulance for medical treatment. Two paramedics who watched him being restrained ""did not even speak to Leon"" or ""offer medical advice to police"", Lewis Andrews, EEAST clinical general manager, told the inquest. Jurors said Mr Briggs had been experiencing psychotic disorder, caused by high usage of amphetamines, resulting in erratic and irrational behaviour and his subsequent detention. Officers failed to recognise he was in a state of medical emergency and did not monitor him in the police van and cell, which also contributed to his death, the jury said. The juryheard officers were ""laughing""as Mr Briggs was motionless and lying face down in the cell. Officers later called out his name and asked ""are you all right?"". Margaret Briggs says she hopes ""those responsible will be brought to justice eventually"". In a statement after the inquest, Mrs Briggs said: ""Why did the police choose to treat my son, who was mixed race, as if his life had no value? They took away his human rights. ""To this day, those police officers still have their jobs and livelihoods and no one has been punished for Leon's death. ""There has been no accountability or justice."" Mrs Briggs urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ""reconsider bringing prosecutions"". In 2018 the CPS saidno officers would be charged over Mr Briggs's death. Mrs Briggs said she had ""been truly shocked by the brutality of the treatment"" of her son and ""by how he suffered in his last hour of life"". ""He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor - with force used against him - and he was shackled,"" she said. Bedfordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Briggs's loved ones had ""to wait far too long to hear all the facts surrounding his death"". He said Mr Briggs ""was suffering a drug-induced psychosis triggered by amphetamine levels described by one expert as being 'off the scale'"". ""Unbeknown to officers he also had a serious underlying heart condition,"" he said. ""There is no easy way of managing such a situation."" Leon Briggs was detained under the Mental Health Act at Luton police station PC Peter Baron, who assisted officers during the restraint, told the inquest the way Mr Briggs was moved from the ground to the police van went against the ""approved technique"". Emma Carter, secretary of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said she disagreed with the jury's conclusion that Mr Briggs was restrained in a dangerous way, and said officers ""did their very best"" to deal with ""a very tragic incident"". Ms Carter added that ""six colleagues were suspended from duty for more than five years as part of this process"". At the timemisconduct proceedings were droppedagainst five officers in February 2020, more than Â£1m of public money had been spent on their pay while they had been suspended.

Wales hairdressers to reopen but retail stays shut,"This video can not be played Visiting the hairdresser and meeting pals in your garden are among lockdown rules being relaxed Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local. Up to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday. Non-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March. Wales' first minister also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, but people can only go with their own household. Mark Drakefordwarned any further reopening in tourism would be haltedif holiday providers took bookings from outside of Wales. Election leaflets can be delivered from Monday A third of people in Wales now had first Covid jab Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? The Welsh Conservatives accused the first minister of a U-turn over retail, which Mr Drakeford denied, while Plaid Cymru said Welsh ministers had raised false hopes with businesses. Shielding for clinically extremely vulnerable people will also be paused from 1 April. For people living in England,the ""stay at home"" rule will end on 29 Marchbut holidays within the UK will not be allowed until 12 April at the earliest. Wales' ""stay at home"" law will switch to ""stay local"" on Saturday and there will be guidance on what that means, according to where you live. It is only likely to last for two weeks, however, ending on 27 March if conditions allow. ""The rule of thumb is that you should think of local as a five-mile radius from where you live,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""But if you live in a valleys community or a rural area you can exercise your judgement and go a little bit further."" Dyfed-Powys Police Federation representative Roger Webb said forces had not been given any information ahead of the announcement on how officers should engage on the new rules and enforce them. He said they would use common sense and work ""in the best way possible"" to make them effective. People in Wales will be able to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation from 27 March South Wales Police urged people to take responsibility for their actions and ""to do the right thing"". ""As some restrictions ease, there will be people looking to push the boundaries and break the rules. My plea to them is don't,"" said police and crime commissioner Alun Michael. From Saturday, 13 March: ""Stay at home"" becomes ""stay local"" Four people from two different households can meet up outdoors to socialise, including in gardens - children are excluded from the number. Mr Drakeford said the rules would allow people to walk through a house to access the garden Outdoor sports facilities such as golf, tennis and basketball will be able to reopen. A maximum of four people from two household can take part in activities Designated solo visitors can enter care homes From Monday, 15 March: All primary school children and those in qualifications years can return to class Schools will have flexibility to bring back year 10 and 12 pupils and more students will return to colleges Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments only Leafletingcan begin for the Senedd election From Monday, 22 March: Restrictions on non-essential aisles in supermarkets will be lifted Garden centres to reopen From Saturday 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation can reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household. Organised children's activities can restart Stay local restrictions will be lifted The Welsh Government also wants to reopen all shops and remaining close-contact services from 12 April, if the situation continues to improve. Stay-local rules 'hard to police' Wales 'on a knife edge' in dealing with pandemic How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Mr Drakeford said he was taking a ""careful and cautious"" phased approach to lifting restrictions. ""If we do too much too quickly, we will lose control of the virus and set off a new wave of infections,"" he said. ""And then we would be back at the beginning again, having to re-impose strict measures to protect people's health and save lives."" Salon owner Vicky Lewis said she saw some ""scary haircuts"" after the first lockdown Vicky Lewis, who owns Vicki's Salon and Kidz Cutz in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, welcomed the news after another lockdown that had been ""horrendous, boring and stressful"". ""I have had my salon for 22 years so I've been desperate to work,"" she said. ""It is also really worrying as you don't know if you still have your clients. It feels like I'm starting over again."" Now she is looking forward to trying to repair the same ""overgrown and scary haircuts"" she saw after the first lockdown. Hairdressers 'excited' over chance to reopen How to deal with your lockdown locks Mr Drakeford defended reopening hairdressers before all children were back in school. He said ""schools are our top priority"", and the scientific advice was clear that the safest way to get children back in class was to do so gradually. Mr Drakeford previously said ministers wouldlook to ""begin to reopen some non-essential retail"" at this review. However, that will now begin on 22 March when garden centres can reopen and supermarkets remove the wrapping from their non-essential items aisles. All other shops are expected to reopen from 12 April and the Welsh Government says it is making an extra Â£150m available to support businesses affected by ongoing restrictions. This video can not be played How do tourism businesses feel about the future? Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said the delayed reopening of shops was ""deeply frustrating"" with the industry losing Â£100m every week in revenue during lockdown. ""At the last review the first minister opened the door for a possible reopening on Monday and many retailers have taken the leap and invested in their stores and furloughed staff in preparation,"" she said. Ms Jones, who is a Conservative councillor in Monmouthshire, added: ""[This delay] will simply exacerbate the woes of a stricken industry."" Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening Welsh retailers 'dealt a hammer blow' by lockdown Mr Drakeford told his press conference that he did not ""change"" his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail. ""Three weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,"" he said. He said he was ""anxious"" about reopening non-essential retail in Wales ahead of the same shops being reopened in England. The first minister said it could act ""as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border."" Non-essential retail in Wales is scheduled to reopen on 12 April, the same date as England. He added it was ""safer"" to lift the ban on shops, including supermarkets, from selling non-essential items ahead of fully reopening shops that have been closed. Garden centre bosses had been frustrated by having to close in lockdownwhile centres in England remained open. Nicola Pugh, senior operations manager at Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff, said she was ""delighted"" at being given the go-ahead to reopen. The owners of Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff were ""frustrated"" at the different rules in England and Wales She said they had continued to grow plants locally at their nurseries so they were able to stock their centres in Radyr and Wenvoe. ""We are ready and waiting and have been working hard to ensure safe shopping for all our wonderful customers,"" Ms Pugh added. Shielding in Wales for people vulnerable from coronavirus will be paused from 1 April. The Health Minister Vaughan Gething said with cases lower than December ""we must only keep this advice in place for as long as is absolutely necessary"". ""In light of the change of context, the Chief Medical Officer has recommended that the advice to the clinically extremely vulnerable to follow shielding measures should be paused after the 31st March,"" Mr Gething wrote. Mr Drakeford suggested pubs and restaurants would only be allowed to serve customers outdoors when they are allowed to reopen Hospitality firms and gyms have not yet been given a date to reopen. At his press conference on Friday Mr Drakeford indicated the sectors will be looked at in a future review during April. He said as they look ahead to the end of that month ""if we continue to see an improving public health picture, we will be able to consider what more we can do to support people to meet each other and what we can do to continue reopening our economy, for example, looking at outdoor hospitality, the wedding sector and leisure centres and gyms."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as 17 May The first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government follows through on its plan to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May. But he said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date. ""In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,"" he said in an interview. ""I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus."" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, welcomed the change to stay local. But he said: ""Labour's U-turn on the opening of non-essential retail at such short notice will be a hammer blow for many businesses, and the decision to now align with England in that area shows we could've adopted a similar roadmap weeks ago. ""The ongoing refusal by Labour ministers to do so will only increase frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk."" Stay-local guidance has been brought in to replace the ""stay home"" message during lockdown Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been ""poor communication"" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he said had ""certainly raised false hopes amongst many businesses"" that they would open earlier. He told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs ""getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that"". Plaid also called for families to be allowed to meet from different householdsbefore tourism reopens. Three weeks ago Mark Drakeford said that today he would be looking at beginning the process of re-opening non-essential retail. Sticking to those words, that's exactly what he's done, but there were a lot of non-essential retailers who thought they would get more. There will be real anger that he allowing shops which have stayed open, and that includes the big supermarkets, to start selling non-essential goods before small privately owned shops are allowed to. For a period in December, the case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world - and lockdown was brought in just before Christmas. However, the rate has fallen significantly during the restrictions and as the vaccination programme is rolled out - it is now at 41 cases per 100,000 people. It remains below the 50 cases per 100,000 ""circuit-breaker"" threshold. In England,all restrictions will be lifted by 21 Juneat the earliest, as part of a four-stage ""roadmap"" based on certain conditions being met, such as a successful vaccine rollout. Scotland has announced thatmore people will be able to meet up outside from Friday, 12 March, which is earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is still to outline its plans to relax restrictions. If you had the chance to run Wales, what would be the first thing on your list of things to do?

"Police and ambulance 'failures' in restraint deathLeon Briggs died after being restrained in the street by police under the Mental Health Act in 2013.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Leon Briggs's mother said she was ""disappointed"" the jury had not returned a verdict of unlawful killing The way in which police officers restrained a father-of-two contributed ""more than minimally"" to his death, an inquest jury found. Leon Briggs died in November 2013 after being detained at Luton police station under the Mental Health Act, having been held face-down in the street. His primary cause of death was ""amphetamine intoxication with prone restraint and prolonged struggling"". A jury found a number of serious police and ambulance failures. It recorded a conclusion that his death was ""contributed to by neglect"". Mr Briggs's mother, Margaret Briggs, said the conclusion of neglect did not ""reflect the evidence"". ""I am disappointed that the jury did not return a verdict of unlawful killing,"" she said. This video can not be played Leon Briggs: Witness saw 'police on top of him' Bedfordshire Police said the jury had ""identified a number of significant failings by the police"" for which it was ""truly sorry"", adding the force had made ""extensive changes"" since. Officers were called to Marsh Road in Luton on 4 November due to concerns about the 39-year-old's erratic behaviour. After being restrained face-down, handcuffed and placed in leg restraints, he was lifted into a police van ""like he was a bag of potatoes"", witness Wendy Hamilton said. As Mr Briggs was carried into the police station, the lorry driver was shouting and screaming in distress. He was detained in a cell at about 14:25 GMT. Mr Briggs became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15. Police treatment of man before death was 'shocking' Man who died held in 'potentially dangerous' way Officer used 'common sense' in restraining man The inquest, held in Milton Keynes, was told Acting Sgt Loren Short and PC Geoff Bennett restrained Mr Briggs. The officers said they ""wanted to do the best (they) could"" while he was ""shouting, struggling, and kicking out"", but the lawyer for Mr Briggs's family accused them of ""telling a pack of lies"". The jury was told that Mr Briggs was having ""an acute mental health crisis"" during the incident Witnesses said they heard Mr Briggs call out ""please help me"" while he was restrained face-down in a ""dangerous position"" on the concrete for more than 13 minutes. The jury found that ""inappropriate weight"" was used against him, though police officers did ""reasonably believe"" it was appropriate. A secondary cause of death was given as coronary heart disease. Mr Briggs was described as ""a really good dad"" who loved spending time with his children Before the inquest, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) paramedics who attended the call had admitted a failure to check Mr Briggs's vital signs or take him to hospital in an ambulance for medical treatment. Two paramedics who watched him being restrained ""did not even speak to Leon"" or ""offer medical advice to police"", Lewis Andrews, EEAST clinical general manager, told the inquest. Jurors said Mr Briggs had been experiencing psychotic disorder, caused by high usage of amphetamines, resulting in erratic and irrational behaviour and his subsequent detention. Officers failed to recognise he was in a state of medical emergency and did not monitor him in the police van and cell, which also contributed to his death, the jury said. The juryheard officers were ""laughing""as Mr Briggs was motionless and lying face down in the cell. Officers later called out his name and asked ""are you all right?"". Margaret Briggs says she hopes ""those responsible will be brought to justice eventually"". In a statement after the inquest, Mrs Briggs said: ""Why did the police choose to treat my son, who was mixed race, as if his life had no value? They took away his human rights. ""To this day, those police officers still have their jobs and livelihoods and no one has been punished for Leon's death. ""There has been no accountability or justice."" Mrs Briggs urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ""reconsider bringing prosecutions"". In 2018 the CPS saidno officers would be charged over Mr Briggs's death. Mrs Briggs said she had ""been truly shocked by the brutality of the treatment"" of her son and ""by how he suffered in his last hour of life"". ""He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor - with force used against him - and he was shackled,"" she said. Bedfordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Briggs's loved ones had ""to wait far too long to hear all the facts surrounding his death"". He said Mr Briggs ""was suffering a drug-induced psychosis triggered by amphetamine levels described by one expert as being 'off the scale'"". ""Unbeknown to officers he also had a serious underlying heart condition,"" he said. ""There is no easy way of managing such a situation."" Leon Briggs was detained under the Mental Health Act at Luton police station PC Peter Baron, who assisted officers during the restraint, told the inquest the way Mr Briggs was moved from the ground to the police van went against the ""approved technique"". Emma Carter, secretary of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said she disagreed with the jury's conclusion that Mr Briggs was restrained in a dangerous way, and said officers ""did their very best"" to deal with ""a very tragic incident"". Ms Carter added that ""six colleagues were suspended from duty for more than five years as part of this process"". At the timemisconduct proceedings were droppedagainst five officers in February 2020, more than Â£1m of public money had been spent on their pay while they had been suspended.

"Zaghari-Ratcliffe 'needs urgent help for trauma'The British-Iranian woman faces a new court hearing this weekend, following a five-year sentence.UK","This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe warns of the ""deep scars"" left by his wife's five-year imprisonment in Iran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government. The charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed. The report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD. Despite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied. Prior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has called for her permanent releaseso she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK. 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? The report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence. The Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday. Neither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC. In the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing. According to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to ""extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old. Whilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online. ""The interrogations were traumatising,"" she is quoted as saying in the report. ""They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service. ""They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job."" She says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day. ""The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,"" she says. ""There were times I could not breathe."" She was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time. Gabriella, now six, counted down the days to her mother's release Mr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: ""This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away. ""She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people."" The two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals. Mr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's ""need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands"". He adds: ""And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands."" Her interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors. ""I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,"" she reported. She told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter. ""It was unbearable,"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. ""I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me."" Richard Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since 2016 In July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands. Her incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment. The report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives. ""She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,"" the report says. ""She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband."" Dr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group. She described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a ""remarkably resilient woman"" who was ""trying to keep hope, trying to be strong"" during her evaluation. But she said: ""Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty."" She may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats. Concern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report. The doctors say it is ""possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury"" in her right hand. And even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery. She will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms. ""Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,"" it concludes. ""In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment."" But it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK. ""The threat of a second trial remains very real,"" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative. ""This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family."" Her treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.""

Kate Thistleton presents Bitesize Daily Secondary The BBC has announced plans to continue providing learning support to teachers and pupils into the summer months. A three-hour Bitesize Learning Zone will be launchedon CBBC and BBC iPlayer on school days, including new episodes of Bitesize Daily. It is designed to assist teachers in classrooms, as well as for use at home. Patricia Hidalgo, director of BBC Children's and Education, said programmes will be ""full of fun to help kids learn and catch-up"". The plans will target those with limited access to the internet, bringing new educational programming to TV. Residents in Merthyr Tydfil's Swansea Road area are being urged to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of
Covid-19 following a cluster of cases. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, Merthyr council and Public Health Wales are working to identify potential
contacts following the confirmation of 31 cases in
recent weeks. To help limit the spread, a new
drive-through mobile testing unit has been set up at Merthyr Valley Homes, in Gellideg, open from 0900 to 1630 daily. Anyone living or working in the area with symptoms should visit the centre as soon as possible to get tested. Professor Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health for Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, said: âThis latest cluster shows that, while rates
have been on a downward trend, Covid-19 is sadly still circulating in our
communities. ""[It] is a stark reminder to us all of the importance of social
distancing, wearing facemasks, washing our hands and following the lockdown rules."" Testing is also available across Merthyr Tydfil
for people who are asymptomatic. A drive-through testing centre has been set up at Merthyr Valley Homes, in Gellideg This video can not be played Covid: 'Lockdown businesses are coming back into trend' Business is booming again in a Flintshire community, thanks to a local retail voucher scheme and a series of local start-ups during the pandemic. A total of Â£12,000 worth of the ""The Totally Mold"" vouchers have been bought by people in Mold that can only be spent with retailers in the town. Retailers say they have adapted during the pandemic and people wanting to shop more locally. Jo Douglass, from Mold Town Council, said watching businesses thrive during the pandemic has been ""fantastic"". Delivering election leaflets will be allowed in Wales from Monday but door-knocking by activists will not be permitted yet, the first minister said. Smaller parties said restrictions on leafleting were unfair to them as they were less able to afford to pay for leaflets to be posted. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would be publishing guidance for campaigning for the Welsh Parliament and police and crime commissioner elections due to take place in May. ""It's got to be done sensibly and properly,"" he said. ""I am very used to going with a gang of people down the street to leaflet - it'll have to be done in more controlled circumstances than that. ""Yes, it will resume from Monday, we're not going to allow door-to-door canvassing in Wales at this point. ""I don't think it's advisable from a public health perspective and I don't think people would understand that either. ""You cannot meet members of your own family but you can meet a political canvasser? I don't see that being easy to explain, so we're not going to be doing that."" Door-to-door campaigning for England's local elections has been allowed since 8 March and activists can canvas and leaflet there as long as they work alone. Smaller parties said a ban on leafleting was unfair to them as they were less able to afford the cost of postage Care Forum Wales has praised the Welsh Government for its cautious approach to reopening care homes. Chief Executive Mary Wimbury said while indoor visits were being permitted again care homes would need to undertake rigorous risk assessment before judging whether they could safely take place. Many care homes were âterrified"" amid concerns a vaccine-resistant variant of the virus could appear at a time when health experts are convinced a third wave of the disease is inevitable. She said: âWhilst it is excellent news that we are now able to begin the process of reopening care homes to visitors, it will be a phased approach and it is imperative that we proceed with caution. âIt will not be like pressing a button and everybody returning immediately to the normality that existed before the pandemic struck. âWe are looking forward to welcoming some sort of normality in the weeks and months ahead."" Care Forum Wales has praised the Welsh Government for its cautious approach to allowing visits to care homes The Federation of Small Businesses in Wales has branded the Welsh Government's announcement on shops reopening ""confusing and disappointing"". Policy chairman Ben Francis said:

âAt the last review, the first minister strongly suggested that non-essential retail and close-contact services would reopen during this next period. ""Now, the picture seems much more complex and to many, will appear an âabout turnâ on the messaging of recent weeks. âMany businesses will have been closed for four months by the time that non-essential retail will be able to fully open on 12th April, and the consequences may well be severe."" Small and mid-size enterprises, Mr Francis said, had faced some of the worst economic consequences of the pandemic. âFSB has repeatedly asked that Welsh Government explain their position  to smaller businesses and the rationale on continued closures and restriction,"" he said. Mr Francis said he ""welcomed"" the financial support announced by the Welsh Government. ""However, for many of our smallest businesses, todayâs announcement will be bittersweet to say the least,â he added. The further reopening of Wales' tourism industry will be halted if holiday providers are found to betaking bookings from people outside Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Self-contained accommodation can reopen in Wales from 27 March, as long as cases remained low. But people in England cannot go on holiday in the UK until 12 April. Mr Drakeford told PA News the ""penalty"" for businesses acting ""irresponsibly"" would be that further reopening would end. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with ""stay at home"" rules replaced by a requirement to ""stay local"" and a plan to reopen parts of tourism industry for Easter has been set out. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been ""poor communication"" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he claimed raised ""false hopes"" amongst many businesses that they would open earlier. He told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs ""getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that"". Mr Price said such stores would face weeks of competition from large supermarkets who would be allowed to sell non-essential items while smaller stores remained shut. Ministers had raised ""reasonable expectations among thousands and thousands of businesses across Wales"" who would have been ""disappointed after a very difficult time for them"", he said. The Conservative leader in the Senedd has accused Mark Drakeford of ""a cruel betrayal"" towards non-essential retailers in Wales. Supermarkets will be allowed to start re-selling non-essential goods from March 22 while all other shops are expected to reopen from April 12. Andrew RT Davies said: âThe first minister has made a U-turn when it comes to non-essential retailers by not allowing shops to reopen as he indicated three weeks ago in the last review. âPeople on the high street will look across at the major supermarkets and see them trading while they're boarded up until  April the 12th. âItâs a cruel betrayal of non-essential retailers on the high streets the length and breadth of Walesâ. BBC Radio Wales Haberdasher Jane Baker supports the roadmap out of lockdown Non-essential businesses across Wales have reacted to First Minister Mark Drakeford's announcement aboutgradually reopening the economy. He said all shops should be able to reopen from 12 April, although those already open will be able to start selling non-essential items from 22 March. Jane Baker, who has run a fabric and haberdashery store in Carmarthen Indoor Market since November 2019, told BBC Radio Wales: ""I can't wait to be back to work. ""I am obviously missing everybody, all the other stallholders in the market obviously, plus all our customers. ""But Drakeford I think is doing the right thing. ""Opening slowly and steadily. As much as I really want to get back to work we don't want to rush into things.""  Anna Knight said she had been all geared up to reopen on Monday However Anna Knight, who runs gift shop Nest in Cardiff, said the announcement was ""frustrating and disappointing"". ""What's been frustrating has been that all the indications were leading us to believe that we were reopening next week,"" she said. ""We bought in stock, furloughed staff and cleaned up the store. It was all time and money."" Wales' first minister has clarified that people will not be confined to meeting up with the same household outdoors from next week. Rules allowing people to meet up in private gardens are due to take effect on Monday. Asked whether people would have to ""bubble"" in order to do this, the Mark Drakeford responded: âThatâs not what is intended. âYou can meet one household on Monday - four adults from two households can meet, and children under the age of 11 with them. ""On the following day you can meet another household, so long as you are sticking to those rules,â he said. The Welsh Government will look at allowing âgreater household contactâ for the second half of April, the first minister has said. However Mark Drakeford warned mixing inside peopleâs homes is âone of the most dangerous thingsâ with coronavirus. He said household mixing âwas undoubtedly part of the difficulties we got ourselves into in the weeks running up to Christmasâ. From tomorrow up to four people from two households will be allowed to meet in private gardens and Mr Drakeford said the change will make âa big differenceâ. âUp until now, you've only been able to leave your own home, locally and for purposes of exercise,â Mr Drakeford said. âNow you will be able to travel in your own local area, four people will be able to meet from two households for any purpose - not just exercise - and, very importantly, people will be able to meet in gardens. âI have letters from elderly people in particular who just aren't well enough to be able to walk to the park so they haven't seen grandchildren or other family members for weeks and weeks. âAnd now they will be able to meet people in their own gardens, under the circumstances that we described, and that will make a very big difference to lots of people here in Wales.â Mr Drakeford added that âon the journey that we are on, in the second half of April - if everything continues to go well - we will consider what we can do to allow people to meet in the way that I completely understand people miss and want to be able to resume.â First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped that by the end of March ""stay local"" restrictions can be lifted in Wales ""so people can travel to holiday destinations"". ""It will be self-contained accommodation only, not somewhere where facilities have to be shared,"" he said. ""But that does include, as it did last year when we started down this path, hotels that are able to offer room service and where people have all the facilities they need in their own room. ""The basic rules about only going with your own household will remain in place and all the other restrictions that we continue to need to observe will be as true if you are in your caravan as it would if you were in your own home."" Mr Drakeford stressed that he was ""making the rules for people in Wales"". ""It's very important that owners of self-contained accommodation don't take bookings from outside Wales over Easter because the arrangements that will apply across our border, for example in the prime minister's roadmap, will not allow people in England to travel or to stay overnight, away from their own homes,"" he said. It is âjust not possibleâ to guarantee that all coronavirus restrictions in Wales will be able to lifted safely by this summer, according to the first minister. âI think the summer is a long way off,â Mark Drakeford said. âThe further that we are from today, the more this becomes pure speculation. âOf course, if everything continued to go as well as it is now, if we saw no bumps in the road, then we will be able to lift restrictions further. âThe extent to which we will be able to do it is entirely dependent on the way that events unfold."" The first minister added it was his intention to loosen restrictions as quickly as possible, but said he would not sacrifice the gains made so far in combatting the virus. âNobody wants to not see life resume in all its different aspects,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""But here in Wales we will continue to do [things] as safely as we need in order to be able to protect the health of the public. âToday in Wales, we have a new variant, and nobody has any real-world experience of how that will react as we begin to lift restrictions."" Mr Drakeford stressed it was ""just not possible to offer people the sort of level of certainty we would all wish we could, that everything will be over by the summerâ. Wales' first minister said he did not âchangeâ his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail. Mark Drakeford said at the last lockdown review that discussions would be had with the sector âto see how we might beginâ the reopening of shops. âThree weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,â he said. âSupermarkets and other shops that are already open will from the 22nd of March be able to sell the full range of essential and non-essential goods. âFor many people that will mean that they will be able to purchase things that theyâve had to manage without for many, many weeks. âThose shops who are not already open will now have a definite timeframe to do all the things that they will need to do in order to be able to reopen successfully. âPeople need to be able to bring staff back from furlough, they need to be able to restock so that they can open with their shelves with things on them for people to buy, they will need to demonstrate that they are able to meet the new standards, the legally required standards that we have put in place here in Wales in response to the new variant of coronavirus,â he added. Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales. The Welsh Government isrelaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local. Up to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday. Non-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March. First Minister Mark Drakeford also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, providing a potential boost to the tourism industry ahead of Easter. First Minister Mark Drakeford says âan extra Â£150mâ is available to help businesses in Wales which are not yet able to open. He said the money would top up non-domestic rates grants. âThis means hospitality, tourism, leisure and non-essential retail businesses which must remain closed will be eligible for a third payment of between Â£4,000 and Â£5,000 to help them meet ongoing operating costs while they cannot trade,â the first minister said. âThis is on top of the announcement earlier this week extending the business rates holiday for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses for the whole of the next financial year.â Mr Drakeford said âin excessâ of Â£2bn had been made available to businesses over the course of the last year to help them through the pandemic âwhich is over and above the support available from the UK Governmentâs schemesâ. He said: âThis is the most generous business support scheme available in the UK. ""Iâm very pleased weâve been able to safeguard more than 160,000 jobs in these most difficult of times.â Wales' first minister says the âstay localâ rule will be lifted in time for Easter if the public health situation continues to improve. Mark Drakeford said the aim was to lift ""stay local"" rules on March 27 and âbegin the process of opening up our tourism sector, starting with self-contained accommodationâ. He said organised childrenâs outdoor activities would also restart in time for the Easter holidays. ""Libraries will also reopen so children can use them as well,"" he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed that hairdressers and barbers in Wales can reopen for haircuts âby appointmentâ on Monday. He said that if the public health position âremains positiveâ then âall close contact servicesâ will open from 12 April. He said from Monday, 22 March, non-essential retail would  begin to reopen. âWe will start by lifting the restrictions on what the shops which are currently open can sell,â he said. âGarden centres can also re-open from the 22ndâ. âOnce again, if the public health situation remains positive, all shops will be able to open from 12 April â the same date as in England.""

Court challenge over Sarah Everard vigilLawyers for Reclaim These Streets event go to the High Court after police say it would be unlawful.UK,"A High Court hearing is under way after police said a planned vigil following the death of Sarah Everard would be ""unlawful"". Lawyers representing the organisers of Saturday's event in London say the decision goes against human rights law. In a statement, organisers Reclaim These Streets said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Ms Everard was last seen alive on 3 March in Clapham, south London. Reclaim These Streets said that by forcing them to cancel the vigil, the Met Police would be ""silencing thousands of women"" who want to ""stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets"". Met facing inquiry over Sarah Everard case Vigils for Sarah Everard to be held around Wales How many attacks on women are there? As well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events are planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool. Speaking on a visit to Queen's University in Belfast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""no woman should walk our streets in fear"" and that the whole country would be ""united in their feeling"" for Ms Everard's family and friends. On whether or not vigils should be allowed to go ahead this weekend, he said that the issue was before the courts now and was ""an operational matter for the Met"". Scotland's health secretary Jeane Freeman has called on people not to take part in the Reclaim the Streets vigils, warning that it was not safe to do so while coronavirus was not under control. On Friday, police confirmed that a body found in woodland in Kent on Wednesdayhad been identified as Ms Everard. A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to her disappearance and Scotland Yard isto be investigated over its handling of an allegationof indecent exposure against him. This video can not be played Vigil organiser Anna Birley: ""There's something we need to be angry about and stand up for as women"" One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC meetings were ongoing with the Met and Lambeth Council, while the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been an ""about-face"" by police, after the group had initially been told they were looking at ways to navigate the difficulties. She said organisers were ""put under increasing pressure"" and told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended. Ms Birley added that organisers had emphasised the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. MPs have called for the vigil to be allowed to go ahead, with Conservative Caroline Nokes saying she had asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in. The chair of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee said the Met Police appeared to have given organisers ""mixed messages"" and said the home secretary could ""send a very clear message that at this awful time"" when women wanted to express their sorrow at the tragic case. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she hoped the event could go ahead and said ""women's voices cannot be silenced"". The laws of the coronavirus restrictions are incredibly complicated - almost impossible to follow without repeated and careful reading. On top of that, they leave many decisions on what's lawful or not to frontline police rather than spelling out exactly when and how they should enforce the rules. Today, no-one is allowed to leave home ""without reasonable excuse"", but the examples in the regulations are not exclusive. In other words, it's open to interpretation whether a well-organised and Covid-safe demonstration would be lawful or not. On top of that, every decision by the police to restrict a protest has to first consider the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. During last June's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, senior officers took a softly-softly approach and allowed them to take place. So Reclaim These Streets want the High Court to say the police came down on the wrong side of the human rights balancing exercise - failing to respect the need to remember Sarah Everard and all women who have been victims of violence. In the statement, Reclaim These Streets said the event was planned by a group of women ""who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community"". ""Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence,"" they said. The organisers said they were aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, and had ""proactively reached out"" to Lambeth Council and the Met Police to ensure the event ""could safely and legally take place"". Sarah 'brought joy to our lives', says family 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' The young sisters standing up to call out catcalling The police initially said they were developing a local policing plan to allow the vigil to take place, according to the organisers. But they added: ""Since this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act."" Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people. During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests Human rights lawyers representing Reclaim These Streets have written to the Met challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the statement adds. ""Their view is that the Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering[s] of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act,"" it says. In a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""We understand the public's strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim The Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. ""We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations.""

""It would be a historic occasion, it would be wonderful to see that happening in our centenary year if it were possible,"" Sir Jeffrey told BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday. ""I would certainly be making a bid for Northern Ireland to have first crack of the whip and to host a meeting of the House of Commons here in Northern Ireland."" The Lagan Valley MP said it would be ""good for the United Kingdom"" for parliament hold proceedings outside London. However former SDLP leader Mark Durkan described the proposal as a ""gimmick"" which would come with cost and logistical challenges.

Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge
this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being
currently banned from going ahead. Mr
Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan
Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in
London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between
demonstrators and senior officers. The
judgeâs ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could
not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations. The
conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he
could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also
accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether
to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations. That
raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police
that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country. At
the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under
the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police
had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place. Senior
officers had said their ""hands were tied"" by the Covid lockdown laws
which banned all gatherings outdoors. But
as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket
ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the
health implications of a large gathering. The
judge said: ""There may well be further communication between the claimants
and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the
rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should
comment."" More than 100 prisoners have died after testing positive for coronavirus over the last year, preliminary figures suggest. Provisional Ministry of Justice data from 16 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 show 118 prisoners had died after testing positive within 28 days of their death or where it was confirmed postmortem. Of these, the deaths of 93 inmates were suspected or confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus.
The deaths occurred in 54 prisons across England and Wales, the MoJ report said. Some 14,480 prisoners have tested positive for Covid since the start of the pandemic, in 127 jails. Some 106 of these were child criminals in youth custody. The prison with the most positive cases so far is HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire, with 468 between March 2020 and January 2021. This peaked this January when 249 were recorded, the figures show. The state of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken to deal with rising cases and deaths there, the head of the World Health Organization has said. ""Unless serious measures are taken, the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said all stakeholders should take the situation seriously, adding that neighbouring countries could be affected, Reuters news agency reported. ""The situation is deeply concerning and the measures that should be taken should be as serious as possible,"" Tedros said. AstraZeneca says export restrictions will reduce delivery of its vaccines to the European Union. The pharmaceutical company says it still aims to deliver 100
million doses to the EU in the first half of the year. ""Half of the EU's supply in the second quarter, and 10
million doses in the first quarter were due to be sourced from
the companyâs international supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said. ""Unfortunately, export restrictions will reduce deliveries
in the first quarter, and are likely to affect deliveries in the
second quarter."" It comes as a blow to the EU's vaccination plans that have already been hampered by delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. The EU has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in its member states and has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU. There's more about the EU's vaccine progress here. Flowers left at the bandstand on Clapham Common The organisers of the vigil planned for London tomorrow to remember Sarah Everard, who was found dead on Wednesday after going missing in south London on 3 March, have lost their legal challenge against a police ban on the event under coronavirus rules. A court hearing has been taking place at the High Court to challenge the Metropolitan Police's decision to ban the vigil. The organisers, Reclaim the Streets, claimed the decision to stop it amounted to a breach of human rights law. In court, the Met's barrister said the force had ""every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show"". ""But, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place."" Matt Bowring is a personal trainer from Penarth whose business has been badly
affected by lockdown. He and his family are now living in his mother-in-lawâs
living room after their offer on a home fell through. He feels that First Minister Mark Drakeford hasnât given clear
guidelines on when gyms and personal trainers can reopen again in Wales. Matt says: ""I've
been a coach for 15 years and seeing our industry in disarray with no clear map
for us is ridiculous. ""The
science shows that obesity and lifestyle are the main causes of
hospitalisation, yet keeping fast food restaurants open for take away was one
of the first things the government addressed. ""Both
my wife and I have coaching businesses and at the start of the first lockdown
the decision was made to move from our home and in with my in-laws. ""We
have one-year-old twin girls. This has not been an ideal situation as we have
not really been able to keep the majority of our clients training online, thus have
taken a huge revenue hit. ""Mortgage
companies will not touch us due to the uncertainty. We
have a large deposit, we have great accounts. ""The
uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months
living in a front room."" Some people have tested positive with a lateral flow test, despite a PCR test later confirming they were negative. A leading bio-statistician, Prof Sheila Bird, has raised concerns that lateral flow tests are being taken as complete proof of having coronavirus, without being checked with a second lab test. She is concerned that the lateral flow tests give false positives, leading to families having to self-isolate unnecessarily. The lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to a lab and can be done at home, giving a result within minutes, and have been rolled out for schoolchildren. When taken at home or in workplaces, lateral flow tests can be overruled by a lab test, known as a PCR. But the government has insisted this cannot happen for tests done in school - although it has been unable to explain why. ""The law regulations changed at the end of January and this seems to have given permission for NHS Test and Trace to ignore a PCR negative result and not allow it to overrule a lateral flow positive,"" said Prof Bird, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society's Covid-19 taskforce. ""So families who have sought confirmation [and] have a PCR negative are still being obliged to spend 10 days in isolation. ""Personally I think they should submit a yellow card of serious adverse harm to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority."" Read more about the issue here. Life in Scotland could be close to normal as early as mid-June, a leading public health expert has said. Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC she was ""very optimistic"" most restrictions would be lifted by the summer and perhaps even earlier. She warned international travel and mass gatherings were unlikely this summer but said the data was heading in the right direction. Scotland has been in lockdown since 5 January but the first minister has said the country is making progress suppressing the virus. Today the rules were relaxedto allow four adults from two different households to meet outdoors. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all legal limits on social contact could be lifted as early as 21 June if enough progress is made tackling the virus. Read more. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic. ""Not every day has been brilliant,"" he told a head teachers' online conference. He said he'd been helped by his ""supportive family"" and by getting a puppy. ""I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,"" he added. The education secretary has faced tough criticism over how he dealt with issues including how pupils were graded when last year's exams were cancelled - prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post. Read more. We now have the latest daily coronavirus figures for the UK. The number of deaths recorded is continuing to fall steadily but the fall in the number of cases is slowing. The mass testing of secondary pupils in England, which began this week as schools reopened to all children, may be contributing to an increase in positive cases. More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.3 million people have had a second. The current seven-day average for first doses is around 295,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues. You can explore the figures for your areahere. A new mum has been able to hold her baby for the first time, after eight weeks of being treated for coronavirus. Baby Leo was delivered by caesarean section 10 weeks prematurely after mum Ellie Wright, 20, contracted Covid. Ellie was seriously ill in the critical care unit with the virus and pneumonia, and Leo needed to be on a ventilator. Her recovery could take up to two years, but she has finally had her first cuddle with her son. Ellie, from Walsall, said Leo was heavier than she thought he would be. ""He looks like me; he's got my nose,"" she said. She is still receiving care on a ward at the hospital, while Leo is ""thriving"" at home with his grandparents. Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 120 million. There have been 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. Meanwhile, we've got a graph showing how the number of cases is picking up in some European countries. Earlier this week we reportedhow several Central European countries were struggling with a new wave of the virus. Earlier today we heard aboutthe plans for easing lockdown in Wales. However, some businesses, including hospitality venues and gyms, have not yet been given a date they can reopen. Matt, a personal trainer based in Penarth, Vale Of Glamorgan, described today's announcement as ""another kick in the teeth and a death knell for people in our industry"". He questioned why fast-food restaurants had been allowed to stay open for takeaway, while gyms have had to close - especially when exercise can help people to stay healthy, reducing the risk from Covid-19. Matt is currently living with his wife and one-year-old twin daughters in his mother-in-law's living room but says he is unable to get a mortgage because of the ""uncertainty"" around his employment - despite having a large deposit. ""The uncertainty has crippled our chances so we are set for another six to 12 months living in a front room,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's an absolute travesty.â Rules on meeting outside are among the first to be eased in parts of the UK Scotland hasbegun relaxing rules on meeting up outdoors, allowing four people from two households to gather.Wales will follow suit tomorrow. In England, lockdown will be eased in four stages, with all restrictions possibly lifted from 21 June at the earliest. Northern Ireland will outline its plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks. You can reada full breakdown of all the changes that have been announcedso far here. Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was the
scientific consultant on Contagion â a film about a deadly virus â reflected
on what he described as an âextraordinaryâ year on BBC Radio 4âs World At One
programme. He said the rapid progress and ""unprecedented"" global cooperation on vaccines was the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic. However, he warned there was still not enough vaccine available for the developing world and ""squabbling"" between governments about supply was beginning to emerge. Dr Lipkin said he was ""optimistic"" about the future because evidence suggested the vaccine would have an impact on transmission as well as preventing serious illness and hospital admissions. But he said governments had not learnt the lessons from previous virus outbreaks, including HIV, Sars and Mers and he feared that as the crisis begins to recede, so will funding for public health.

Flowers have been left by members of the public near to an area of woodland in Kent where Sarah's body was found A hearing is under way at the High Court to challenge a decision to ban a planned vigil tomorrow to honour Sarah Everard,the missing woman whose body has now been found. Organisers Reclaim These Streets are planning the event on Clapham Common - as well as others across the UK - but said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the event to take place. One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She said organisers were told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended - but added that she and others had made clear the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. Our full storyon the row over the planned vigil is here. The vaccine was developed mainly by J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division The World Health Organisation has added the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to its list of approved vaccines. The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the other vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer. The UK, US, EU and Canada have already ordered doses, and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations. The Johnson & Johnson jab is the first to be listed by the WHO as just needing a single dose. The WHO added that the data from large clinical trials shared by the company has shown the vaccine is effective in older populations. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news but urged governments to work to make sure the vaccines were available and affordable for all. Gwyneth Paltrow starred in Contagion - a film about a global pandemic This week marked one year since the World Health
Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Virologist Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was the
scientific consultant on Contagion â a film about a deadly virus â reflected
on what he described as an âextraordinaryâ year on BBC Radio 4âs World At One
programme. He said the rapid progress and ""unprecedented"" global cooperation on vaccines was the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic. However, he warned there was still not enough vaccine available for the developing world and ""squabbling"" between governments about supply was beginning to emerge. Dr Lipkin said he was ""optimistic"" about the future because evidence suggested the vaccine would have an impact on transmission as well as preventing serious illness and hospital admissions. But he said governments had not learnt the lessons from previous virus outbreaks, including HIV, Sars and Mers and he feared that as the crisis begins to recede, so will funding for public health.

Court challenge over Sarah Everard vigilOrganisers of the Reclaim These Streets event head to the High Court as police say it would be unlawful.UK,"A High Court hearing is under way after police said a planned vigil following the death of Sarah Everard would be ""unlawful"". Lawyers representing the organisers of Saturday's event in London say the decision goes against human rights law. In a statement, organisers Reclaim These Streets said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions. Ms Everard was last seen alive on 3 March in Clapham, south London. Reclaim These Streets said that by forcing them to cancel the vigil, the Met Police would be ""silencing thousands of women"" who want to ""stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets"". Met facing inquiry over Sarah Everard case Vigils for Sarah Everard to be held around Wales How many attacks on women are there? As well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events are planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool. Speaking on a visit to Queen's University in Belfast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""no woman should walk our streets in fear"" and that the whole country would be ""united in their feeling"" for Ms Everard's family and friends. On whether or not vigils should be allowed to go ahead this weekend, he said that the issue was before the courts now and was ""an operational matter for the Met"". Scotland's health secretary Jeane Freeman has called on people not to take part in the Reclaim the Streets vigils, warning that it was not safe to do so while coronavirus was not under control. On Friday, police confirmed that a body found in woodland in Kent on Wednesdayhad been identified as Ms Everard. A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to her disappearance and Scotland Yard isto be investigated over its handling of an allegationof indecent exposure against him. This video can not be played Vigil organiser Anna Birley: ""There's something we need to be angry about and stand up for as women"" One of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC meetings were ongoing with the Met and Lambeth Council, while the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been an ""about-face"" by police, after the group had initially been told they were looking at ways to navigate the difficulties. She said organisers were ""put under increasing pressure"" and told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended. Ms Birley added that organisers had emphasised the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature. MPs have called for the vigil to be allowed to go ahead, with Conservative Caroline Nokes saying she had asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in. The chair of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee said the Met Police appeared to have given organisers ""mixed messages"" and said the home secretary could ""send a very clear message that at this awful time"" when women wanted to express their sorrow at the tragic case. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she hoped the event could go ahead and said ""women's voices cannot be silenced"". The laws of the coronavirus restrictions are incredibly complicated - almost impossible to follow without repeated and careful reading. On top of that, they leave many decisions on what's lawful or not to frontline police rather than spelling out exactly when and how they should enforce the rules. Today, no-one is allowed to leave home ""without reasonable excuse"", but the examples in the regulations are not exclusive. In other words, it's open to interpretation whether a well-organised and Covid-safe demonstration would be lawful or not. On top of that, every decision by the police to restrict a protest has to first consider the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. During last June's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, senior officers took a softly-softly approach and allowed them to take place. So Reclaim These Streets want the High Court to say the police came down on the wrong side of the human rights balancing exercise - failing to respect the need to remember Sarah Everard and all women who have been victims of violence. In the statement, Reclaim These Streets said the event was planned by a group of women ""who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community"". ""Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence,"" they said. The organisers said they were aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, and had ""proactively reached out"" to Lambeth Council and the Met Police to ensure the event ""could safely and legally take place"". Sarah 'brought joy to our lives', says family 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' The young sisters standing up to call out catcalling The police initially said they were developing a local policing plan to allow the vigil to take place, according to the organisers. But they added: ""Since this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act."" Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people. During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests Human rights lawyers representing Reclaim These Streets have written to the Met challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the statement adds. ""Their view is that the Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering[s] of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act,"" it says. In a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""We understand the public's strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim The Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. ""We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations."" Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said he knew the public felt ""hurt and angry"" and said he recognised wider concerns have been raised about the safety of women in public spaces in London. 3 March:Sarah Everard vanishes after leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road, Battersea, about 21:00 GMT 5 March:Met Police are ""increasingly concerned"" forMs Everard and make an appeal on Twitter,external 6 March:Ms Everard's family say her disappearance is""totally out of character""as officers search Clapham Common's ponds 7 March:Footage taken from a doorbell camera showsMs Everard walking alonealong the A205 Poynder Road towards Tulse Hill at 21:30.

"Wales hairdressers to reopen but retail stays shutPeople will soon be able meet friends in their garden, visit care homes inside and play golf.Wales","This video can not be played Visiting the hairdresser and meeting pals in your garden are among lockdown rules being relaxed Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales. The Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local. Up to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday. Non-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March. Wales' first minister also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, but people can only go with their own household. Mark Drakefordwarned any further reopening in tourism would be haltedif holiday providers took bookings from outside of Wales. Election leaflets can be delivered from Monday A third of people in Wales now had first Covid jab Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? The Welsh Conservatives accused the first minister of a U-turn over retail, which Mr Drakeford denied, while Plaid Cymru said Welsh ministers had raised false hopes with businesses. Shielding for clinically extremely vulnerable people will also be paused from 1 April. For people living in England,the ""stay at home"" rule will end on 29 Marchbut holidays within the UK will not be allowed until 12 April at the earliest. Wales' ""stay at home"" law will switch to ""stay local"" on Saturday and there will be guidance on what that means, according to where you live. It is only likely to last for two weeks, however, ending on 27 March if conditions allow. ""The rule of thumb is that you should think of local as a five-mile radius from where you live,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""But if you live in a valleys community or a rural area you can exercise your judgement and go a little bit further."" Dyfed-Powys Police Federation representative Roger Webb said forces had not been given any information ahead of the announcement on how officers should engage on the new rules and enforce them. He said they would use common sense and work ""in the best way possible"" to make them effective. People in Wales will be able to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation from 27 March South Wales Police urged people to take responsibility for their actions and ""to do the right thing"". ""As some restrictions ease, there will be people looking to push the boundaries and break the rules. My plea to them is don't,"" said police and crime commissioner Alun Michael. From Saturday, 13 March: ""Stay at home"" becomes ""stay local"" Four people from two different households can meet up outdoors to socialise, including in gardens - children are excluded from the number. Mr Drakeford said the rules would allow people to walk through a house to access the garden Outdoor sports facilities such as golf, tennis and basketball will be able to reopen. A maximum of four people from two household can take part in activities Designated solo visitors can enter care homes From Monday, 15 March: All primary school children and those in qualifications years can return to class Schools will have flexibility to bring back year 10 and 12 pupils and more students will return to colleges Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments only Leafletingcan begin for the Senedd election From Monday, 22 March: Restrictions on non-essential aisles in supermarkets will be lifted Garden centres to reopen From Saturday 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation can reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household. Organised children's activities can restart Stay local restrictions will be lifted The Welsh Government also wants to reopen all shops and remaining close-contact services from 12 April, if the situation continues to improve. Stay-local rules 'hard to police' Wales 'on a knife edge' in dealing with pandemic How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Mr Drakeford said he was taking a ""careful and cautious"" phased approach to lifting restrictions. ""If we do too much too quickly, we will lose control of the virus and set off a new wave of infections,"" he said. ""And then we would be back at the beginning again, having to re-impose strict measures to protect people's health and save lives."" Salon owner Vicky Lewis said she saw some ""scary haircuts"" after the first lockdown Vicky Lewis, who owns Vicki's Salon and Kidz Cutz in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, welcomed the news after another lockdown that had been ""horrendous, boring and stressful"". ""I have had my salon for 22 years so I've been desperate to work,"" she said. ""It is also really worrying as you don't know if you still have your clients. It feels like I'm starting over again."" Now she is looking forward to trying to repair the same ""overgrown and scary haircuts"" she saw after the first lockdown. Hairdressers 'excited' over chance to reopen How to deal with your lockdown locks Mr Drakeford defended reopening hairdressers before all children were back in school. He said ""schools are our top priority"", and the scientific advice was clear that the safest way to get children back in class was to do so gradually. Mr Drakeford previously said ministers wouldlook to ""begin to reopen some non-essential retail"" at this review. However, that will now begin on 22 March when garden centres can reopen and supermarkets remove the wrapping from their non-essential items aisles. All other shops are expected to reopen from 12 April and the Welsh Government says it is making an extra Â£150m available to support businesses affected by ongoing restrictions. This video can not be played How do tourism businesses feel about the future? Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said the delayed reopening of shops was ""deeply frustrating"" with the industry losing Â£100m every week in revenue during lockdown. ""At the last review the first minister opened the door for a possible reopening on Monday and many retailers have taken the leap and invested in their stores and furloughed staff in preparation,"" she said. Ms Jones, who is a Conservative councillor in Monmouthshire, added: ""[This delay] will simply exacerbate the woes of a stricken industry."" Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening Welsh retailers 'dealt a hammer blow' by lockdown Mr Drakeford told his press conference that he did not ""change"" his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail. ""Three weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,"" he said. He said he was ""anxious"" about reopening non-essential retail in Wales ahead of the same shops being reopened in England. The first minister said it could act ""as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border."" Non-essential retail in Wales is scheduled to reopen on 12 April, the same date as England. He added it was ""safer"" to lift the ban on shops, including supermarkets, from selling non-essential items ahead of fully reopening shops that have been closed. Garden centre bosses had been frustrated by having to close in lockdownwhile centres in England remained open. Nicola Pugh, senior operations manager at Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff, said she was ""delighted"" at being given the go-ahead to reopen. The owners of Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff were ""frustrated"" at the different rules in England and Wales She said they had continued to grow plants locally at their nurseries so they were able to stock their centres in Radyr and Wenvoe. ""We are ready and waiting and have been working hard to ensure safe shopping for all our wonderful customers,"" Ms Pugh added. Shielding in Wales for people vulnerable from coronavirus will be paused from 1 April. The Health Minister Vaughan Gething said with cases lower than December ""we must only keep this advice in place for as long as is absolutely necessary"". ""In light of the change of context, the Chief Medical Officer has recommended that the advice to the clinically extremely vulnerable to follow shielding measures should be paused after the 31st March,"" Mr Gething wrote. Mr Drakeford suggested pubs and restaurants would only be allowed to serve customers outdoors when they are allowed to reopen Hospitality firms and gyms have not yet been given a date to reopen. At his press conference on Friday Mr Drakeford indicated the sectors will be looked at in a future review during April. He said as they look ahead to the end of that month ""if we continue to see an improving public health picture, we will be able to consider what more we can do to support people to meet each other and what we can do to continue reopening our economy, for example, looking at outdoor hospitality, the wedding sector and leisure centres and gyms."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as 17 May The first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government follows through on its plan to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May. But he said he was ""asking UK ministers to think very carefully"" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date. ""In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,"" he said in an interview. ""I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus."" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, welcomed the change to stay local. But he said: ""Labour's U-turn on the opening of non-essential retail at such short notice will be a hammer blow for many businesses, and the decision to now align with England in that area shows we could've adopted a similar roadmap weeks ago. ""The ongoing refusal by Labour ministers to do so will only increase frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk."" Stay-local guidance has been brought in to replace the ""stay home"" message during lockdown Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been ""poor communication"" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he said had ""certainly raised false hopes amongst many businesses"" that they would open earlier. He told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs ""getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that"". Plaid also called for families to be allowed to meet from different householdsbefore tourism reopens. Three weeks ago Mark Drakeford said that today he would be looking at beginning the process of re-opening non-essential retail. Sticking to those words, that's exactly what he's done, but there were a lot of non-essential retailers who thought they would get more. There will be real anger that he allowing shops which have stayed open, and that includes the big supermarkets, to start selling non-essential goods before small privately owned shops are allowed to. For a period in December, the case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world - and lockdown was brought in just before Christmas. However, the rate has fallen significantly during the restrictions and as the vaccination programme is rolled out - it is now at 41 cases per 100,000 people. It remains below the 50 cases per 100,000 ""circuit-breaker"" threshold. In England,all restrictions will be lifted by 21 Juneat the earliest, as part of a four-stage ""roadmap"" based on certain conditions being met, such as a successful vaccine rollout. Scotland has announced thatmore people will be able to meet up outside from Friday, 12 March, which is earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is still to outline its plans to relax restrictions. If you had the chance to run Wales, what would be the first thing on your list of things to do?

Zaghari-Ratcliffe 'needs urgent help for trauma',"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe warns of the ""deep scars"" left by his wife's five-year imprisonment in Iran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government. The charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed. The report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD. Despite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied. Prior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has called for her permanent releaseso she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK. 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? The report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence. The Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday. Neither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC. In the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing. According to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to ""extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old. Whilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online. ""The interrogations were traumatising,"" she is quoted as saying in the report. ""They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service. ""They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job."" She says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day. ""The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,"" she says. ""There were times I could not breathe."" She was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time. Gabriella, now six, counted down the days to her mother's release Mr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: ""This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away. ""She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people."" The two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals. Mr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's ""need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands"". He adds: ""And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands."" Her interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors. ""I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,"" she reported. She told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter. ""It was unbearable,"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. ""I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me."" Richard Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since 2016 In July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands. Her incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment. The report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives. ""She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,"" the report says. ""She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband."" Dr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group. She described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a ""remarkably resilient woman"" who was ""trying to keep hope, trying to be strong"" during her evaluation. But she said: ""Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty."" She may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats. Concern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report. The doctors say it is ""possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury"" in her right hand. And even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery. She will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms. ""Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,"" it concludes. ""In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment."" But it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK. ""The threat of a second trial remains very real,"" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative.

Royal Mail to pilot Sunday parcel delivery,"Royal Mail is to trial Sunday parcel deliveries for major retailers amid an online shopping boom. Internet sales were already on the up before the coronavirus crisis, but the pandemiccaused huge growth in 2020,external. Royal Mail said the trial would open the door to parcel deliveries seven days a week. The postal service has been hit by coronavirus delays, but a spokesperson said it was ""working hard"" to make deliveries. Royal Mail said an increasing number of customers were shopping online and expected to get their purchases as soon as possible after placing their orders. It said that ""a number of retail brands are trialling the service"" but declined to name them as yet. Rivals such as DPD and Hermes already make Sunday deliveries for major retailers such as Amazon. Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: ""The last year has reset so many customer expectations and the desire for even more convenient and even more frequent parcel deliveries has certainly been one of them."" Royal Mail said it had ""processed unprecedented parcel volumes"" in the past year as non-essential retailers were closed during lockdowns. However, its customers were hit with postal delays over Christmasdue to ""exceptional"" volumes of post, while delays continued into the New Year as itsworkforce was affected by Covid-19. Royal Mail delays blamed on 'exceptional' volumes of post Royal Mail names areas hit by Covid postal delays The postal service still hasadvice on its website,externalabout delays which says: ""Some areas of the country may experience a reduction in service levels due to higher volumes of mail, the ongoing impact of Covid-related staff absences and necessary social distancing measures at local mail centres and delivery offices."" A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""Our first priority throughout this pandemic has been the safety of our people and our customers. ""We have worked hard to deliver the most comprehensive service we can, includingretaining around 10,000 temporary workersto help us deal with the increased demand."" In addition, Royal Mail is building a second parcel hub in Daventry, which will be larger than its existing hub in Warrington, to meet the growth in demand, it said. ""Once complete, the new hub will be the size of more than 10 football pitches and have the capacity to process over one million parcels per day, making it the largest Royal Mail parcel hub in the UK,"" the firm said in a statement. Royal Mailpiloted Sunday parcel deliveries in 2014, but took the decision not to roll out that service. The Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""We were early adopters with the 2014 Sunday trial, which was limited to within the M25 area. ""Since that time, there has been a seismic change in consumers' online behaviours."" The spokesperson said that customers were making more online purchases than ever before and expected deliveries seven days a week. ""This trial is responding to those changing demands for even higher levels of convenience across the UK,"" the spokesperson added. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""With the e-commerce boom continuing through the latest lockdown, online shoppers have come to expect seven-days-a-week delivery as standard. ""Launching a Sunday delivery service is clearly an attempt to seize the moment and capitalise on the snowballing momentum the group has picked up over the past four months. ""This week, Royal Mail again upgraded its profits forecasts because of the surge in home deliveries and renaissance of letter writing during the pandemic."" However, Ms Streeter said that whether it would be a success or not ""is far from signed, sealed and delivered"", adding that there had ""long been under-investment in automation"" in the service. ""Royal Mail needs to show it has the capacity to meet this unprecedented demand."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: ""This expansion into Sunday parcel deliveries will certainly be a challenge for Royal Mail which has struggled with the increase in demand during the pandemic, and has been outshone by some of its competitors. However, she said that Royal Mail remained one of the largest couriers in the UK, and the introduction of two parcel hubs in the UK ""shows its commitment to modernising"". ""Now the long-running dispute over pay and conditions with the union is over, it can focus on investing in its parcels division."" ""Although the move may be out of necessity rather than the business being fully prepared, consumer shopping habits have now shifted. Royal Mail needs to stamp its authority and deliver on its commitment or face being bottom of the pile.""

Insurance claims plunge as drivers stay at home,"The number of motor insurance claims settled last year dropped by 19%, as vehicles sat idle with drivers staying at home. The total amount paid out fell by 6% compared with the previous year, the data from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) shows. But the average price paid by drivers for new comprehensive car insurance fell by only 1%. The ABI said that insurers had faced other costs when supporting customers. With so many fewer journeys taking place during the various Covid lockdown restrictions across the country in 2020, it was inevitable that there would be fewer accidents, thefts and insurance claims. There were still 2.1 million claims settled, down 19% on the previous year. Average payouts did rise, particularly for personal injury. However, there was still a cut of 6% in total payouts made by insurers, to Â£8.3bn. Motorists may have hoped to see these savings reflected in lower premiums. The cost of new comprehensive motor insurance did fall to a four-year low, but only dropped by 1%. Car insurance cover extended during lockdown The ABI said this was the result of various factors, some - but not all - of which were the result of the impact of the pandemic. It said that some insurers had been altering existing policyholders' deals owing to their lower mileage, which had included offering rebates. Extra services had also been included, without charge, such as automatic cover for those driving to and from work, or delivering medicines or groceries. Drivers who are financially stretched have also been given the option to pay premiums in instalments. There is no guarantee that prices will get any cheaper in the future, despite new controls on whiplash claims. ""As we edge back to some form of normality, cost pressures remain, such as increasing vehicle repair costs, reflecting ever more complex vehicle technology,"" said Laura Hughes, the ABI's general insurance manager.

Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber-crisis,"Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers. Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack. It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems. But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses. Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly. The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium. Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies. The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world. US warns of 'active threat' over Microsoft attack EU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves. However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected. According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries. Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves. ""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said. ""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers."" This video can not be played Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network. Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks. Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK. Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems. CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour. The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail. Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems. ""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind. ""There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.""

"Society has 'just accepted' dead women, says MPJess Phillips reads a list of all women killed in UK over the past year, in Women's Day debate.UK Politics","This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. Labour's shadow domestic violence minister, Jess Phillips, has said society has ""just accepted"" dead women as ""one of those things"". She read out the names of 118 women and girls killed in the UK this year, where a man has been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator, in an International Women's Day debate. Ms Phillips said there was currently no government research into the data. Ministers say they have prioritised support for victims during lockdown. Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns ,externalDomestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge 'I felt like a slave to my husband in my marriage' Since being elected in 2015, Ms Phillips has marked the annual International Women's Day debate by remembering the individuals whose lives were taken in the past twelve months. Reading lists out in the chamber is normally prohibited, but Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said she was suspending a three-minute time limit on speeches to enable this tradition to go ahead. The debate was dominated by tributes to 33-year-old Sarah Everard, who disappeared in south London on 3 March. A Metropolitan police officeris being questioned on suspicion of murderand kidnap after human remains were found in the search for Ms Everard. MPs said her death shone a spotlight once more on the scale of the violence against women. Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared Speaking in the Commons chamber, Ms Phillips said: ""In this place we count what we care about. ""We count the vaccines done, the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count and we obsessively track that data. We love to count data of our own popularity. However, we don't currently count dead women."" She said there was no government study done into data on victims of domestic abuse who are killed, die by suicide or die suddenly. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,"" she added. ""Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common."" Listening to Ms Phillips read out the list of victims, the Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, said it was ""impossible not to be overcome as those names echo round the chamber"". Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield has previously spoken of her personal experience of domestic abuse. She said: ""Every year we bring tissues, we prepare ourselves mentally as well as we can"" to list to the ""horrific list"" but pandemic or not, she said, ""women are tired having to pre-empt possible violence and risk assess every action"". SNP deputy leader at Westminster Kirsten Oswald told how she feels walking alone in the dark:  ""I will not change my behaviour, but do feel scared sometimes"", she said. ""I cross the road, I have my keys in my hand, I think about where the street lights are, where the dark alleys are."" ""I'm aware and vigilant, because, like all women, I have to be."" The Conservative MP, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said things would only change when there were greater societal changes and ""more women in the room"" in positions of authority. ""Despite everything that's been achieved for women's rights,"" he said the debate proved ""this is not a job that has been done, it is still very much a job to do"". As vigils highlighting women's safety are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard, more than 200 women have signed an open letter to the government calling for a ""firm commitment"" to tackle male violence. The letter, which has been signed by Labour MP Harriet Harman, charity workers and campaigners, says ""women are still at risk doing the most simple of things"". ""Something has to change - and it cannot be women, the victims in this, to be responsible for leading that charge."" Domestic abuse charities have warned that calls to their helplines have""gone through the roof"" since the lockdown began. More than 40,000 calls and contacts were made to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline in the first three months of the lockdown in 2020. Under the government's Domestic Abuse Bill, councils in England will get an extra Â£6m to provide support and safe accommodation for abuse survivors and their families. The additional money comes on top of a Â£10m emergency fund given to councils to help domestic abuse survivors during the pandemic.
