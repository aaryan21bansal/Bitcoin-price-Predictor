West Bromwich Albion 0-1 Liverpool,"Roberto Firmino's header brought his 11th Premier League goal of the season Roberto Firmino scored a winner for the second weekend running as Liverpool beat West Brom to go third in the Premier League. The Brazil striker headed in at the end of the first half after Lucas Leiva had glanced on James Milner's free-kick. Milner volleyed over after half-time, and Simon Mignolet saved with his legs from Matt Phillips at the other end. Late on, Alberto Moreno missed an empty goal from 40 yards after Albion keeper Ben Foster had gone up for a corner. Despite that miss, Jurgen Klopp's side secured a fifth win in seven games, sending West Brom to a third straight defeat. Relive West Brom v Liverpool as it happened West Brom had only 10 touches in Liverpool's penalty area (right) Klopp has spoken recently of the need for Liverpool to ""win ugly"" - having developed a habit of beating the Premier League's top teams and then slipping up against sides lower down. Liverpool's manager was particularly wary of the threat that West Brom might pose from set-pieces, an area in which his team have been vulnerable defensively this season. To counter that danger, Klopp used the fierce winds that hit Merseyside last Wednesday to his advantage - getting his players to face a barrage of high crosses and long throws in training that day. The manager's reasoning was that if his players could deal with the ball in the air as it swirled about in the wind, they would be able to handle anything West Brom threw at them. This video can not be played Reds delivered perfect victory - Klopp By and large, the preparation worked - with Liverpool also making sure not to give away too many set-pieces - although there was one hairy moment in the first half when Nacer Chadli miskicked with the goal at his mercy after Liverpool had failed to defend a free-kick. What was particularly impressive about Liverpool, though, was their midfield domination, which restricted the home side to just a handful of efforts at goal. Lucas, Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can were key to keeping West Brom at bay, and ensured a win that keeps Klopp's side well on course for next season's Champions League. Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho have scored four of Liverpool's past five goals Before last weekend's trip to Stoke, Liverpool had not won a league game all season without Sadio Mane in the team. Klopp needed that statistic to change after a knee injury sustained against Everton on 1 April ended the Senegalese striker's season early. He found inspiration in the Potteries as goals from Philippe Coutinho and Firmino sealed a 2-1 victory, and the two Brazil internationals were involved in Liverpool's best attacking moments at The Hawthorns. Firmino proved his value in terms of creating chances as well as getting the winner, providing a fine diagonal pass that Coutinho volleyed wide in the first half, and crossing for Milner to volley over when well placed in the second. Liverpool could have won by a greater margin with better finishing - with Moreno guilty of the most glaring miss. The full-back, on as a substitute, burst away in the closing seconds after keeper Foster was caught upfield for a corner. Instead of running the ball into the net, Moreno elected to shoot from long range, and missed the target. Albion's Matt Phillips was denied by Simon Mignolet with 10 minutes left West Brom remain on course to finish eighth, and equal their highest final league placing since 1981, but their season is in danger of petering out. Of their past seven matches, Tony Pulis' side have lost five and failed to score in six, with a 3-1 win over Arsenal on 18 March providing their only win and goals during that run. Albion under Pulis have made a habit of being well organised, and of digging out victories with a significantly smaller share of possession. This video can not be played Pulis praises 'fantastic' West Brom season But they failed to cause Liverpool enough problems, managing just two shots on target all afternoon. Hal Robson-Kanu hit the first tamely at Mignolet in the opening half, and the goalkeeper reacted well to save with his legs as Phillips ran clear with 10 minutes to go. Even when they won a series of set-pieces in the closing moments, they could not make Liverpool pay. The Liverpool midfielder was involved in more duels (20) than anyone else on the pitch - and was instrumental in breaking West Brom's rhythm Roberto Firmino has now surpassed his Premier League goal tally from last season (10 in 2015-16, 11 in 2016-17). Since the start of last season, Firmino has been directly involved in 34 Premier League goals (21 goals, 13 assists), more than any other Liverpool player. Liverpool have won 66 points from 33 games this season; six points more than they picked up in the whole of 2015-16. West Brom have failed to score in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2003. Liverpool have scored in more league away games this season (14) than they did in 2015-16 (13). Lucas has provided two assists in a Premier League season for the first time since 2009-10. West Brom have lost three of their past four Premier League games at The Hawthorns, as many as they lost in their previous 14 combined. Liverpool kept only their second ;eague clean sheet in 2017, in what was their 14th game of this calendar year. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""It was a big win against a good, tall team. We played really well from the first second. ""We needed to adapt to what West Brom wanted to do. In all our plans, it was 'no set-pieces, no set-pieces, no set-pieces'."" On Liverpool's Champions League qualification chances:""It is the Premier League, Arsenal have three, four, five games in hand so we should not think about this. Today we could only get to 66 points, so it feels perfect. ""Next week we try at Anfield to get 69 points, and let's carry on. If we do what we have to do, we will be where we want to be."" West Brom manager Tony Pulis:""We are disappointed. I thought we did enough to get a point. ""The goal really knocked us. It took us 20 minutes, in which time they had some good opportunities. ""Chadli had a great chance at the back post, Matty Phillips should have scored one-on-one, Hal should have scored one-on-one - it wasn't all set-pieces. ""The difference between the top teams is the quality they have up front. The players have been fantastic this year, we have an opportunity to play some of the young players now too.""

The city where children fend for themselves on the streets,"Joao Vitor ended up on the streets aged 14 In 1937, Jorge Amado published Captains of the Sands, a novel about a gang of orphaned children living on the streets of Salvador, north-east Brazil. Eighty years on, little has changed - thousands of children and adolescents still roam the city and sleep rough. David Baker hears some of their stories. Zeca (not his real name) isn't proud of his past. A tall, skinny, slightly shy black teenager, he mumbles and looks down at his feet when he speaks about the years he spent living on the streets of Salvador. He's 17, though he has the weary, cracked voice of an old man who has seen too much of life, and he talks about his time in the city's drugs gangs with regret. ""I found many types of job [with the gangs]"", he says, ""trafficking, packing, stealingâ¦"" And then, after a long pause, he adds: ""killing."" He won't be drawn on the details but he says gang life was a case of kill or be killed. I have come to Salvador to meet people like Zeca because of a book published here 80 years ago that became a classic of Brazilian literature. Jorge Amado's Captains of the Sands tells the story of a gang of orphaned children and adolescents living in an abandoned warehouse in Salvador's docks area who live by begging, stealing and hustling. ""Dressed in rags, dirty, half-starved, aggressive, cursing, and smoking cigarette butts, they were, in truth, the masters of the city,"" Amado wrote. He wanted to show the freedom and fun these children could have looking after each other and having adventures through the city's streets. But he also wanted to show the misery of their lives and to shame Brazil into doing something about the thousands of homeless children in the country that richer Brazilians at the time viewed as little more than pests. That was then, but there are still gangs of children, like the Captains of the Sands, living on the city's streets. I met Zeca in a government-run shelter that takes children and adolescents off Salvador's streets and helps them reintegrate into mainstream life. Like him, many come from broken homes. And, almost the moment they arrive on the streets, they run the risk of being picked up by one of the many drugs gangs that run great swathes of this, Brazil's third-largest, city. Brazil's Modern-day Captains of the Sands was broadcast on BBC World Service's Assignment programme.Listen again on iPlayer. When Zeca talks of his own time with them his eyes develop a far-off look, as if something has died inside him. ""It was very violent,"" he says. ""If you live on the streets you have to be evil."" Zeca's story is so shocking that it's easy to forget he is still just a child. ""When I was 10 I used cocaine and smoked weed,"" says Zeca. ""I used to snort a lot of cocaine. And one day there was no coke for me to snort so I went on to the streets and started smoking crack."" Immediately he discovered how violent life on Brazil's streets can be. ""I had a knife, a gun, all these sorts of things, to defend myself,"" he says. ""I could only sleep in the morning because during the night I had to stay awake. There were many dangers, someone could come and kill me."" NGOs working in the city reckon there are as many as 3,500 people under 25 living on Salvador's streets still. And among them is a friendly, intelligent and curious young man I met one day in a square down by the city's docks - Joao Vitor. Joao Vitor is 20, black and very much at ease with his life on the streets. He's thrilled to talk and clears some space on the foam mattress he sleeps on for me to sit down and join him. He grew up, he says, being looked after by his grandmother and, from the age of eight, he helped her cook and sell acaraje, deep-fried dumplings that are a classic Salvador street food. But when he was 14, she fell ill and had to move back to the countryside and Joao Vito ended up on the streets. Grafitti of a street kid in Salvador It was tough, he says, ""having to sleep in the streets, having to eat food that I didn't like, worrying about other people trying to attack you, but as time went by you get used to it"". And, he says, like the teenagers in Captains of the Sands, you quickly find yourself part of a gang who look out for each other. ""I've got nothing of value here,"" he says, showing me the few possessions he keeps next to his mattress. ""The things I really value are my friends here. They are my family."" Joao Vitor has kept clear of the drugs gangs and he's pleased about that. ""Drugs diminish you as a person,"" he says. But he has certainly experienced violence. He has scars on his arm and the side of his neck from when someone attacked him with a machete. And he has seen police attack people sleeping in the streets. There is also, he says, the problem of poor people on the streets attacking each other. ""You will see many zombies on crack,"" he says. ""When they have money, they're happy because everyone is their friend. But when they have no money, if you touch them there will be a fight."" His experience, though, is very different from Zeca's. He says he prefers to deal with arguments through talking rather than a fight. And, when it comes to enjoying the freedom of Salvador's streets, he absolutely sees himself as like the children in Captains of the Sands. ""I am a Captain of the Sands,"" he says with a big smile. ""Because look at the life we live, bro. The only part I'm not is when it comes to stealing. But it's true as far as living adventures, always exploring the day that we're living, for sure I am."" He picks up his stuff and says he's off soon to have a dip in the sea and to catch up with some other people he knows who live on the city's streets. ""There'll be other friends of mine there too. If I need anything they'll sort me out,"" he says. ""This is what friendship is. It's a family."" Neither Joao Vitor nor Zeca are certain about what the future holds for them - though Zeca, in the shelter, has at least taken a first step in getting off the streets. Both boys say they take life one day at a time. But, however their lives turn out, there are thousands of young people like them living on Salvador's streets today and the Brazilian state has very few resources (and, some would say, very little political will) to help them. If he returned to his city today, Jorge Amado would still feel the need to shame his country into action.

Does Lagos slum hold secret to producing top footballers?,"Taribo West is just one of the many top footballers to come out of Ajegunle Ajegunle is known for being one of Lagos' toughest, most dangerous slums, but it also has another reputation - for producing some of Nigeria's top footballers. So what's the secret to its unlikely success?  BBC Africa's Stanley Kwenda has been finding out. For a football-obsessed nation like Nigeria, talent can be found in every corner, but there's definitely something special about Ajegunle, or AJ City, as it's known by locals. Since the early 1990s, Ajegunle has been churning out football talent. Famous names such as Taribo West, Odion Ighalo, Brown Ideye, Samson Siasia, Obafemi Martins, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborie all started here. Life is not easy for many of the residents of this sprawling ghetto. They have to contend with high crime rates, as well the absence of running water, grid-powered electricity or healthcare. So what are the factors that contribute to Ajegunley's footballing pedigree? Diversity, for one. ""It's a community with so many people from different ethnicities,"" says Bennedict Ehenemba, a football scout for German clubs who is a native of Ajegunle. ""Ajegunle accommodates the Yorubas, the Igbos, the Hausas, the Itsekiris and all the other tribes in Nigeria. ""It's a raw talent hub of Nigeria,"" he tells me. Young boys have to find safe spaces to play football in Ajegunle Many success stories can be traced back to two local institutions - St Mary's Catholic Church and the Navy Barracks Camp. They remain safe places for many young people to play the game. Other open spaces are often claimed by so-called ""Area Boys"", unruly gangs who often demand a fee for people to play there. Super Eagles striker Jonathan Akpoborie, who made his name in Germany's Bundesliga in the 1990s, also honed his skills here. ""This is actually the home of football in Nigeria,"" Akpoborie tells me, adding that the game is seen by many youngsters as a route to a better life. ""I don't want to downgrade the area by attributing the success of footballers to poverty but there's just nothing to do for the kids. ""They spend most of their time here playing football and in so doing they develop themselves and naturally become gifted footballers. ""In one national team there's always one player who originated from Ajegunle. ""It's exactly how I started - the grown-ups play first, we watch them play, then eventually we get in the field. They were inspirational to us."" Nigerian forward Jonathan Akpoborie made his name in Germany in the 1990s The slum also has an established system of grassroots football, which encourages talented youngsters to play competitive football for local clubs at an early age. This often gives them an edge over players at competing academies across the country. Alfred Emuejeraye, who plies his trade in the Swiss lower leagues, also grew up in Ajegunle. He believes the secret of the slum lies in its deep love of the game. ""The people here, the community are passionate about football, passionate about everything and are driven to succeed in whatever they do from musicians to taxi drivers... It's an all-round community,"" he tells me. Odion Ighalo - formerly of Watford FC in the English Premier League but now playing for Chinese Super League outfit Changchun Yatai FC - is another Ajegunle native. Now he lives in some of the world's biggest cities, but still remembers Ajegunle fondly. ""It was very tough growing up there. It's not like in Europe where you have everything provided. ""You have to look for money to buy football shoes, jerseys, transport and even water for to drink after training. If you can't afford the transport then you stay - and those who stay are great players,"" says Ighalo. Odion Ighalo - a striker for Chinese club Changchun Yatai FC - grew up in Ajegunle Bolarinwa Olajide is a sports reporter with Lagos-based radio station Wazobia. He saw many of these players emerge from Ajegunle over the years. ""We see the hopeless, those who know they have a talent but they can't exhibit it anywhere. They can't afford fees to join a football academy, so they go to Ajegunle because they know scouts come to watch them play, and it's a chance to show what they can do as footballers,"" he tells me. Leicester City and Nigeria midfielder Wilfred Ndidi did not grow up in Ajegunle but played against boys from the slum during his time at an academy in Lagos. He believes Ajegunle has produced good football players because the boys there ""work hard, the lifestyle is difficult so they try to work very hard and come out with their best."" To keep the Ajegunle legacy going, some of the footballers are already giving back to the community with projects to nurture future talent. Akpoborie is helping to identify future football talent, while Ighalo is building an orphanage in the heart of the slum.

Why some Brits are opting for Belgian citizenship,"Brussels is gripped with gossip about the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. The rights of British citizens living there and elsewhere are still to be decided, but a handful of the 25,000 British people living in Belgium do not want to wait for the outcome and are applying for citizenship in their adopted home. In her house in a smart Brussels suburb, British-born business consultant Glynis Whiting brandished her stiff, shiny, new Belgian passport. ""I went through customs in Germany with it recently and I thought: 'This is me stating that I am a slightly different person than I was,'"" she told me. A resident of Belgium for two decades, she applied for Belgian citizenship before the UK's referendum on membership of the EU. She described it as her insurance policy. ""If the UK had voted to leave it would have been essential for me to stay in Europe with no worries,"" she explained. ""If the UK had voted to stay then it was a vote of confidence in my now home country."" The application for Belgian citizenship is made at a local level It was relatively easy for Glynis to meet the conditions laid down by the Belgian government: five years of residence, proof of economic integration such as payments into the social security system, and the ability to speak one of the national languages of French, Dutch or German. Her only mistake was failing to read the small-print on the application form, which specifies that copies of birth certificates must be less than three months old. It all cost 200 euros (Â£170) plus a translator's fee. Applications are made at the level of the commune, the branch of local government that plays a big part in any Belgian resident's official life. Staff at the town hall in Ms Whiting's neighbourhood of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert were bemused but welcoming, she said. Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Britons in Finland face uncertainty over their future The people who will negotiate Brexit Article 50: What happens next? The neighbouring district of Ixelles is assessing 50 applications from Brits and there have been another 300 requests for information. Local councillor, Delphine Bourgeois, said interest has come in two distinct waves: immediately after the referendum, and the days before and after the delivery of Theresa May's letter that triggered the official start of the Brexit process. Eleven cases are being processed in the suburb of Forest and 48 people have applied to the commune that covers the Brussels city centre. This suggests there is a steady stream of British people adopting Belgian nationality, but not a stampede. Just over a thousand UK citizens currently work for the EU Commission Questions and rumours abound in the expat community, from which commune has the most relaxed attitude concerning paperwork to whether the police inspect bedrooms to check that couples are definitely married. To help expats navigate the system, the British Brussels Community Association is planning a series of workshops. But becoming Belgian is not an option for some of the UK nationals employed in the EU institutions, such as the bloc's executive arm, the European Commission. Many of the Commission's 1023 British staff pay their tax directly into the EU budget which means they may not have contributed enough to the Belgian state coffers, for example. Then there are the EU agencies' own regulations. A letter from a British official, circulating among the European civil service trade unions, is calling on the EU Commission to clarify whether it will apply or ignore the paragraph of the staff handbook that specifies that only citizens of an EU member state can be employed by the organisation. EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said all EU employees would be treated ""as Europeans"" ""With a snap of a finger, the commission could give certainty to British colleagues,"" said Michael Ashbrook of Solidarity, Independence, Democracy (SID), a trade union representing employees of EU institutions and agencies. The European Commission President, Jean Claude Juncker, wrote to staff on the day after the referendum, saying that all employees would be treated ""as Europeans"" regardless of their nationality. His spokesman said further details will emerge during the negotiation of the UK's departure. The Brexit process gives hope to some British expats, such as Jason Phaetos, who runs the city's only Cornish pasty stall. ""I've asked a few people about how to get Belgian papers but [the EU and the UK] have got to come to some sort of arrangement so I'm not too worried about it at the moment,"" he told me. And does he know of anyone who has left Belgium, fearful for the their future after the referendum? ""Only a couple. They supported Brexit. They moved back England with big smiles on their faces."" 10 areas that will shape the Brexit talks PM suggests free movement extension What are the European Parliament's 'red lines' on Brexit?

Withnail and I: Cult classic turns 30,"Charting the travails of two out-of-work actors in the dying days of the 1960s, British film comedy Withnail and I has staggered to its 30th birthday. Star Richard E Grant looks back at its filming and considers whether anyone else could have tackled the role that put him on the road to Hollywood. Chin chin! Camden Town. Two sleep-deprived thespians wallow in filth, battling drug-induced paranoia, a worrying lack of booze and stalled careers. What follows - an ill-fated jaunt ""to the country"" and run-ins with an assortment of misfits and malcontents - would marry with caustic dialogue to produce an oft-quoted classic. Largely unnoticed on its release in April 1987, standout performances by Grant as the acid-tongued Withnail and Paul McGann as the more introspective I helped the film gradually gather a dedicated following. No less memorable was its supporting cast of colourful characters, among them the love-struck Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths), drug-dealer Danny (Ralph Brown) and poacher Jake (Michael Elphick). Initially created as a semi-autobiographical novel by Bruce Robinson more than a decade and a half earlier, the writer-turned-director would largely use hisone-time flatmate Vivian MacKerrell as the inspiration for the scabrous Withnail,external, while I - identified as Marwood in the script - was a version of Robinson himself. It was, as he has outlined, ""a tale of English hopelessness"" and threw a spotlight on his ""appalling lifestyle"" as he struggled to find work after leaving London's Central School of Speech and Drama. ""Wait till the morning and we'll go in together"" - Marwood pleads with Withnail to abandon plans to tackle the fetid kitchen sink With each set-piece so perfectly penned, the stale cigarette smoke and alcohol fumes almost seeped through the screen. But while the story may have been loaded with laughs, Robinson demanded his dialogue was delivered with a straight face. ""Bruce was very exacting and did not brook any improvisation or word substitutions,"" says Grant, who himself had been without work for nine months and become increasingly beset by nagging doubts about his chosen career, having emigrated from Swaziland to Britain at the turn of the 80s. ""He was also adamant that as there were no jokes or punchlines, it had to be played with deadly seriousness. ""The script was so accurate in expressing the frustrations of being an out-of-work actor that as soon as Paul and I played everything 'for real', Bruce was very open and accommodating. ""That experience [of being unemployed] proved invaluable. Withnail is so staggeringly self-obsessed and entitled, which anyone who has been to drama school will be all too familiar with!"" Auditioning for the part would almost mirror the character's woes, as Grant competed against a gaggle of better-known names in a casting merry-go-round as dizzying as the concoction of drink and drugs downed throughout the film. ""I've been watching you"" - poacher Jake warns the hapless pair Daniel Day-Lewis had turned down the role and other leading contenders included Bill Nighy and Ed Tudor-Pole. It was not much easier for McGann, with the role of Marwood offered to Michael Maloney. Having stepped into his shoes, his strong Liverpudlian accent promptly saw him sacked before an equally swift reinstatement. So what was it that Robinson eventually identified in the duo? ""Finding a contrasting pair of actors made the audition process protracted,"" Grant recalls, ""as Bruce was very determined to secure two people who looked and sounded like Vivian and himself. ""Paul is incredibly handsome and had the quality of 'an innocent abroad', which Bruce was after."" While it may seem almost inconceivable for fans to imagine anyone else in the role of Withnail, Grant modestly disagrees. ""We want the finest wines available to humanity"" - the drunkards offend the owner of the Penrith Tea Rooms Bruce Robinson paid for the filming of additional scenes out of his own pocket after Handmade refused to stump up the extra cash Producer Denis O'Brien wanted filming shut down as he had expected a comedy more akin to Monty Python Devoted fans make pilgrimages to many of the film's locations. However, anyone visiting Penrith for its tea rooms will be sorely disappointed - that scene was filmed 240 miles away in Stony Stratford, Milton Keynes Paul McGann had only just passed his driving test when shooting began, and for the motorway scenes was replaced behind the wheel by Robinson Despite his acclaimed portrayal of a desperate drunk, Richard E Grant is famously allergic to alcohol ""I absolutely believe that all those illustrious names could have essayed the role, as it is so brilliantly well written. ""Bruce writes stage directions with the same exactitude as his dialogue - hugely entertaining, mordant, witty, and conveying the precise mood so that you simultaneously 'see' and 'feel' what the scene is about."" Indeed so expertly crafted was Robinson's dialogue, fans delight in reciting the characters' one-liners and stinging rebukes - and sometimes in the most unexpected of places. ""Oh, my boys"" - Uncle Monty shows his affection at the cottage dinner table ""[Some years later] I was filming in the Australian outback beside a dirt road in the middle of nowhere,"" says Grant. ""The only car that drove past all day was a battered yellow 1959 Ford Anglia - my dreaded primary school maths teacher drove one - and the driver leant out of his window and yelled 'scrubbers!' at me - to the bewilderment of the film crew."" Shooting got under way in August 1986, but, like the pair's rain-lashed on-screen drive from London to the Lakes, the film's journey to the cinema screen was tortuous. A modest million-pound budget would come from Beatles legend George Harrison's Handmade Films and a New York businessman. Decamping to Cumbria's Wet Sleddale to begin work at isolated cottage ""Crow Crag"" (the real-life Sleddale Hall, near Shap), interference from its backers threatened to derail production, causing Robinson to issue a ""back me or sack me"" ultimatum. For Grant, that period of time was difficult for an altogether more tragic reason as he and his wife, Joan, grieved the loss of their daughter Tiffany, born prematurely at seven months and pronounced dead within a few minutes. ""She is the size of a little bird,"" he recalled in his book With Nails: The Film Diaries of Richard E Grant. ""She is warm but dead. And perfect. Ten toes, ten fingers. Eyes, mouth, all. Broken. No breath. ""Our hearts are broken and will we ever cease weeping."" ""I want something's flesh"" - Withnail goes fishing for lunch The film would have its own sense of sadness and loss as McGann's I packs his bags having landed the lead role in a Manchester-based play - leaving the desperate Withnail railing in despair with only a bottle of Uncle Monty's wine and the Regent's Park wolves for company. Just as eloquently it would sum up the end of the 60s dream, replaced by commercialism and cynicism with the selling of ""hippy wigs in Woolworths"". Although Withnail and I failed to make a commercial splash upon its release, McGann would establish a solid stage and screen career, while Grant had Hollywood hot-shots Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese all come calling. He has hardly stopped working since. It is, he admits, ""some ironyâ¦ playing an unemployed actor opened every subsequent career door I've walked through"". Robinson would have more mixed fortunes. Follow-up How to Get Ahead in Advertising, also starring Grant, was an altogether more patchy affair while Jennifer 8 and The Rum Diary also met with criticism. Thirty years on, though, Withnail and I's popularity shows no sign of waning and a series of screenings are being staged by fans across the country throughout the coming months - withSleddale Hall itself among the venues in July,external. ""Are you a sponge or a stone?"" - Monty propositions Marwood So just what does the now 59-year-old Grant believe lies at the heart of its enduring appeal, and does he ever feel trapped by the role which, for many, defines his career? ""The film is so accurate about Bruce's experience of being an unemployed actor at the end of the 60s, encompassing his breadline, booze and drugged desolation, and being friends with the coruscating and charismatic MacKerrell, that it is indelibly authentic. ""His portrayal of a symbiotic male friendship is the core of the story, and its disintegration is painful and poetic. ""If I had only been offered 'alcoholic actor' roles I might have something to complain about, but that never happened. Playing someone so extreme has meant I've been cast in roles that demand a certain level of intensity or mania, which I've hugely enjoyed. ""I'm genuinely amazed that a film made so long ago, which initially met with such a lukewarm response, has accrued the status and cult following it has done. ""For that, I am eternally grateful.""

Branwen Jeffreys: Special needs pupils 'losing out',"The Lib Dems want to stop primary school tests narrowing learning Is there such a thing as a ""curriculum for life"" ? That's what the Lib Dems want to offer for children in England. If you have a child at school you'll know how much what they learn is already changing. The end of primary school tests known as Sats have been made tougher, with more complex grammar and maths among the changes. And if your household is going through the agony of GCSE revision, you'll know this is the first year of the new English and maths exams which are also designed to be more challenging. There has been so much change that schools have been complaining they can barely keep up. The unglamorous, but important issue of what children learn at school rarely features in election campaigns. Yet subjects matter because it influences the choices your child can make about their future job, or what they want to study at college and university. So it's striking that the Lib Dems have chosen to make the subjects taught in schools, the curriculum, a large part of their education election offer. Their manifesto says this would mean a shorter list of core subjects all state funded schools would have to teach. But they also want learning about money, and mental health to be included alongside age appropriate sex and relationship lessons. It is only weeks since a change in the law to make sex and relationship education compulsory for all secondary schools in England, with primary schools teaching just about relationships. There is a promise too to protect creative subjects like music, art and drama amid concerns that tightening budgets and a focus on results are squeezing them out. Quite how they would be protected isn't clear, although the party is likely to argue that promising extra money will help. So should politicians be deciding what your kids learn at school? An interesting question as some recent Education Secretaries have had very definite views. The Lib Dems are making a bid to take the politics of changing governments out of these decisions. They want to set up what looks like a new quango - an Educational Standards Authority - which would bring in changes after consulting teachers. But in the end, when there are issues in schools, just like in hospitals, the buck stops with politicians. Voters tend to have little time for a senior politician trying to outsource the blame for any decisions. So, as the Lib Dem manifesto delicately puts it - there would have to be some way of retaining ""legitimate democratic accountability"".

Can Toshiba escape corporate Japan's zombie hordes?,"Another of Japan's corporate behemoths faces the prospect of biting the dust Once a household name, Toshiba is now bleeding billions of dollars and frantically trying to reassure investors that it will not succumb to the kiss of death. But it also faces another fate: becoming the most high-profile member of Japan's corporate living dead, also known as zombie firms. Toshiba admitted this week that itssurvival is at riskand that the firm could be delisted from the Tokyo stock exchange, following amajor accounting scandaland an ill-timed bet on nuclear power. The 142-year-old company is poised to record Japan's biggest industrial loss after its investment in US nuclear unitWestinghouse turned toxic. So what's next? Well, a lot hinges on Toshiba's ability to raise much-needed cash through the sale of its valuable memory chip unit. Here are three possible scenarios. Toshiba is already the ""walking dead"" financially, says Gerhard Fasol, chief executive of Eurotechnology Japan: ""Action should have been taken 20 years ago"". Zombie companies are loosely defined as loss-making or insolvent entities that should be allowed to fail, but continue to operate because of lenient creditors. Thousands exist in Japan and the issue is considered to be a reason why Japan's economy risks suffering from a third ""lost decade"". This video can not be played Why is Toshiba on the ropes? All Toshiba needs now is a bailout from theInnovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ),externalor the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, two government-backed bodies that rescue ailing companies, for this to happen. However, many investors are not fans of this option. They argue that zombie firms need to be killed off, so that""creative destruction""can take place. Amir Anvarzadeh of BGC Partners said if the government gets involved, ""then we suspect we will find Toshiba back on the brink again sometime in the the future."" Want more proof of zombies? Not a single publicly-listed Japanese firm went bust last year. In fact, overall bankruptcies havefallen for eight years in a row,external. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, touts those statistics as a sign of economic success, but being saved from going extinct is not necessarily a good thing. Innovation and new firm creation remains incredibly low in Japan compared with other developed countries,according to OECD research,external. Breaking up is hard to do. But Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa has no other choice but to sell off some prized parts if he wants to keep the company afloat and alive. Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa (right) has a massive financial headache on his hands Toshiba is in the process of auctioning off its semiconductor unit, which makes memory chips for smartphones, computers and other electronic devices. It is the world's second-largest chip manufacturer behind Samsung, which is no mean feat, given how competitive the industry is. Over the last two years, there has been an aggressive wave of consolidation. So when Toshiba's unit was put up for grabs, an array of interested bidders quickly assembled. The chip unit is estimated to be worth between $9bn (Â£7.2bn) and $13bn. Taiwan's Foxconn, which assembles Apple's iPhones, has reportedly offered as much as $27bn. Foxconn alsobought Japan's Sharplast year. But things could easily change. The chip sale is now said to be facing opposition from various stakeholders, including US firm Western Digital, which has a joint venture deal with Toshiba. The Japanese government is also believed to be reluctant to allow the sale of another company with proprietary technologies to a Chinese or South Korean rival. BGC Partners' Mr Anvarzadeh dismisses the latter. ""Arguments that technology transfer ultimately trickle down to China sound dubious,"" he says, adding that Taiwan and Korea have more advanced chip technologies anyway. If the chip sale falls through, more accounting irregularities emerge or the banks decide to call in their loans, then all bets are off. Toshiba could be allowed to fail. But that would have serious ramifications and will see thousands of shareholders lose their savings. Then there is the issue of national pride. Toshiba launched the world's first mass-market laptop in 1985 and became known for its consumer electronics products such as televisions, although it is worth stating those units are no longer at the heart of its business and some are loss-making. In addition, the decline of Japan Inc, once renowned the world over for its game-changing companies, has beengoing on for a long time now. After 142 years of existence, is Toshiba now toast? Analysts pretty much all agree that Toshiba is in a difficult, complicated situation. But they differ on the probable course of action. Eurotechnology's Mr Fasol is predicting a ""politically brokered solution"", in which a US firm and a Japanese government investment fund acquire the chip company. But Mr Anvarzadeh believes Toshiba should be allowed to sell the unit to Foxconn, because it is willing to pay the highest price. ""Pride is very expensive. I don't think the government can afford to be proud with Toshiba on the brink,"" he said. ""We think the best case scenario is for the Japanese government to stay out of this bidding process and, for once, allow market forces to run their course.""

Can Trump's Arab honeymoon last?,"Mr Trump has been warm towards Egypt's president, after relations cooled under President Obama They're calling him ""Abu Ivanka al-Amriki"" - ""Father of Ivanka, the American"". From Cairo to Qatar, the US presidential candidate once derided as impulsive, an Islamophobe and a misogynist appears to have turned into the Arab world's most popular US president since George H W Bush led the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in 1991. Today, Donald Trump is riding high in much of the Arab world's eyes. So what is behind this and will it last? Ask anyone in the Arab world what they think of former President Barack Obama and most will tell you that his eight years in office were a massive disappointment, at least as far as the Middle East is concerned. It started with Mr Obama's 2009 Cairo speech, entitled ""A New Beginning"". This was supposed to set America on a path to new and better relations with the Arab world. Expectations were raised to unrealistically high levels and disappointment swiftly ensued. In his 2009 speech, Barack Obama imagined Muslim and Western democrats working together The Arab world watched the Syrian war spiral out of control, a presidential ""red line"" get crossed with impunity when chemical weapons were fired at civilians outside Damascus, and no tangible progress made on a Palestinian-Israeli peace deal. Worst of all, in Gulf Arab eyes, Mr Obama was seen as being soft on Iran, fuelling a suspicion that Washington was preparing to downgrade its Gulf Arab ties. ""People on the [Arab] street got sick and tired of Obama,"" says Mustafa Alani, director of the security and defence department at the Gulf Research Centre. ""During his time, we witnessed the rise of [so-called Islamic State], the entry of Russia into the region and the aggressive expansionism of Iran across the Middle East."" Donald Trump is already well known in the Gulf for his business interests, like this golf course in Dubai Enter Mr Trump. A man who, as one of his first acts in office, tried to ban visitors from several Muslim-majority countries, none of which have ever attacked the United States. No matter. This seems to have been largely overlooked in the gushing praise being heaped on the president for both talking tough and acting tough when it comes to Syria. One hashtag doing the rounds on social media even reads ""We love you Trump"". What people admire is what they see as his willingness to act on his convictions, in contrast to how Mr Obama was perceived by many in the region - perhaps unfairly - as weak, indecisive and not really interested in the Middle East. The US missile attack on a Syrian airbase was broadly welcomed in the Arab world Behind the scenes and in the corridors of power in several Arab capitals, there is enormous relief that a new team is in the White House. On his recent visit to Washington, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi was given a red carpet welcome, effusive praise from Mr Trump and little mention made of the mounting human rights abuses being committed by his government in the name of national security. In Yemen, the Obama administration was so appalled by the civilian casualties caused by faulty targeting from Saudi-led air strikes that it rowed back on US military support for Riyadh's coalition battling the rebel Houthi movement. The Trump administration has reversed this. Saudi Arabia and Mr Trump share hostility to Iran In Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, two countries about whose human rights record the Obama administration had concerns, the White House has strengthened ties. Earlier this year, President Trump's newly appointed CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, was given a warm welcome in both countries' capitals. And on Iran, where Egyptian, Jordanian and Gulf Arab rulers all feared that the Obama administration was turning a blind eye to what they saw as Iranian expansionism for the sake of the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the Trump administration has reassured them with its hostile rhetoric towards Tehran. Mr Trump's stance on Israeli settlements and Jerusalem though has angered Palestinians But approval for President Trump is far from universal. Writing in Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National in February, the president of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby,complained,externalof what he called ""ham-fisted anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies that have caused [IS], al-Qaeda and the Iranian leader to thank him"". What the Arab world wanted, he wrote, was a relationship with a US partner who would work with them to ensure regional stability. Mr Alani told the BBC that while President Trump was certainly riding high on the back of the recent US missile strike on a Syrian air force base, there was still huge uncertainty in the region about his future intentions and what he expected from Arab leaders in return for US support. ""What will he demand from us in return? Will it be money? Will it be physical participation in military or other operations?"" he asked. ""We can agree [with Washington] on joint aims for the region, but we may still have differences on how to get there.""

The election where no-one came to vote,"Protesters have been attacking polling centres in Indian-administered Kashmir Eight people died and more than 100 were injured in Indian-administered Kashmir in a highly contentious by-election over the weekend. Separatist leaders called for voters to boycott the polls and protestors attacked more than 150 polling centres. On Thursday India attempted to re-run the disrupted ballots. There was massive security in place. But an election without voters is a very sad affair. I arrived at one polling station five hours after it had opened. Not one ballot had been cast. The eyes of seven bored election officers looked up expectantly as I walked in. It was a sorry scene. The windows were broken but no-one had bothered to sweep up the puddles of broken glass on the floor. On Sunday, protesters had stormed the building, pelting stones.  The polling centres was forced to close, hence the ballot today. I introduced myself and asked how things were going. ""We're hatching eggs here,"" laughed Ali Mohammad, one of the election officers. He meant they were sitting doing nothing. Polling booths remained empty despite government efforts to conduct elections again When I asked why it was so quiet, he conceded that India's efforts to ensure there was no disruption this time round might well have put some voters off. Kashmir is one of the most militarised region in the world - there are more personnel per capita here than in Iraq or Syria.  We'd driven through streets lined with heavily armed officers to get here - one for every three eligible voters. The 'studious' 12-year-old victim of India's Kashmir problem The teenager blinded by pellets in Kashmir Kashmir profile ""Area domination"", the policeman in-charge called it, seemingly unconscious of how ominous his words sounded in a region many believe is on the brink of separatist revolt. But back at the polling station, Mr Mohammad didn't think military muscle alone accounted for the lack of interest in the electoral process. Will it get any busier, I asked? He shook his head. ""We are ready for voters if they come, but it won't be busy here today,"" he told me, smiling gently. Then he frowned, clearly unhappy with his fellow Kashmiris' lack of engagement.  Mr Mohammad is a teacher by profession. ""The right to vote is important,"" he said after a pause, ""it gives us the power to determine our own fate."" Kashmir is one of the most militarised places in the world His words underscore just what an indictment of the mainstream Kashmiri parties the turnout on Sunday was when only 7% of the electorate bothered to vote. Yes, separatists called for a boycott and yes, there were stone-throwing mobs at some polling stations, but if the electorate had been persuaded that politicians could deliver a brighter future, more would surely have made the effort to vote. That was certainly the view of the group of young men I got talking to outside another of the polling centres that had been attacked. When I asked how many of them had been part of the stone-throwing mob, they shuffled nervously. Then 13, 14, 15 hands went up: half the group. The justification was all too familiar - ""azadi"" or freedom. Kashmiris have long dreamt of creating an independent nation up here in the bright green valleys of the Himalayas.  It's an ambition India has no intention of allowing. In the 80s and 90s, a few thousand militants were at the vanguard of the independence struggle. There are far fewer now - perhaps 250 or so - but opposition to Indian rule appears to be becoming more widespread. It is the reason the young men give for trying to disrupt the polls. ""All politicians are the same and none of them will bring freedom, so why vote?"" asked one. Kashmiri people say their only option is to fight Indian rule in the state But what is the alternative? The answer these young men gave doesn't augur well for Kashmir - or for India.  They said they wanted to fight. ""When you suffer atrocity after atrocity you lose all fear.  We aren't scared of anything now,"" claimed Aijaz Amin, his long eyebrows fluttering nervously. He said he had never been involved in violence but he used an ominous Urdu phrase. The direct translation is, ""We have shrouds over our heads.""  It means they will do anything to get what we want, and it implies a fight to the death. By late afternoon I had arrived at one of the most notorious villages in the constituency. Once again, no votes had been cast but, with a sickening inevitability, hundreds of young men came out to throw stones at the security forces. The battle that followed had a ritual quality. These riots are repeated virtually every week here in Kashmir. And it all ended promptly at 4pm, when the polls closed. The last officers fired off a volley of shotgun rounds into the crowd, before leaping into their armoured vehicles and driving rapidly away. A couple of hours later the Kashmir Election Commission released the figures for the day's ballot. Just 709 people had voted, a 2% turnout.

Poulter fifth after alligator encounter,"Poulter needs a good finish to help secure his PGA status RBC Heritage third round leaderboard -13J Dufner (US);-12G DeLaet (Can);-11K Kisner, W Simpson (both US);-10I Poulter (Eng);-9L Donald (Eng), W Bryan, W McGirt (both US) Selected others:-8T Hatton (Eng);-5R Knox (Sco);-4A Johnston (Eng), G McDowell (NI);-3M Laird (Sco), S Lowry (Ire) Ian Poulter moved to within three shots of the lead at the RBC Heritage in South Carolina - despite a close encounter with an alligator. The Englishman shot a third-round 69 to move to 10 under, with American Jason Dufner leading the field on 13 under. Overnight co-leader Luke Donald of England dropped back after a 72. Poulter, 41, hit his tee shot into the water on the 10th hole and took a drop on the bank, only to spot an alligator in the shallows nearby. His playing partner Webb Simpson's caddie eventually chased it away but Poulter would double bogey the hole and bogey the next, before a birdie on the 14th helped him remain in contention. ""I took a couple of dummy swings and he decided to come in and take a closer look,"" Poulter told Sky Sports. ""I wasn't very comfortable with that. It's a little unnerving. I didn't want to put my club in the water because I didn't want him to take it. One of the other caddies came in and was a bit more aggressive, and he went."" Asked if the incident had affected his play, Poulter said: ""No, not at all. My game feels good and I feel confident going into tomorrow."" Poulter is playing on a major medical exemption after foot surgery last year and has this week and one more start to collect the prize money he needs to secure his playing status for the rest of the season. Despite three bogeys on the front nine, Dufner's two eagles and five birdies helped him to a 65 and moved him to 13 under at Hilton Head. Canada's Graham DeLaet is second after a 69, one ahead of Kevin Kisner and Simpson. England's Tyrrell Hatton remains in contention after a three-under 68 saw him move to eight under, a shot behind Donald and five shots adrift of 2013 PGA Championship winner Dufner. However, Scotland's Russell Knox fell behind as a one-over 72 saw him fall to a tie for 20th place, one shot in front of England's Andrew Johnston and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell. 2013 PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner is seeking his fifth PGA Tour win Donald shares halfway lead at Heritage Donald sits second at RBC Heritage 'Inner peace can help Garcia win more' Garcia pips Rose to win Masters PGA Tour West Ham sack manager Lopetegui Belgian GP agrees new F1 rotational deal until 2031 Fantasy holes with lava fields - it's golf for the 21st Century Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.
