Scuffle at Rees-Mogg student event,"This video can not be played Protesters disrupt a speech by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was caught up in a scuffle after protesters disrupted a speech he was giving at a student event. Videos show the backbencher surrounded by a group of people at the University of the West of England (UWE). Bristol Anti-Fascists claimed online they disrupted the event because of the politician's ""homophobic and anti-abortion beliefs"". Mr Rees Mogg said they were ""entitled to protest"". However, he said it was ""sad"" they would not engage and discuss views to which they objected. The prominent Brexiteer had been invited to speak at an event organised by the university's Politics and International Relations Society. Police said they had launched an investigation into the scenes at the Frenchay Campus in Bristol, but no arrests had yet been made. The university vice-chancellor Steve West said: ""At the moment, as far as I'm aware, no UWE students were involved. But if it transpires that one or more students were involved then disciplinary action will be taken which could mean expulsion."" In a statement on Twitter the university added it was ""absolutely appalled by the conduct of a small number of attendees"" at the event. This video can not be played ""They weren't going to hit me,"" said Jacob Rees-Mogg MP It continued: ""It is our understanding at this stage that a small group of protesters broke into the lecture theatre where the event was due to take place via the back doors. ""We understand that these protesters were not UWE Bristol students and did not have tickets for the event. ""We support the democratic right to free speech and peaceful protest. However, we strongly condemn the actions of protesters who disrupted normal debate and behaved in this way. ""There is no place for such action on a university campus or in a civilised society."" It was due to be a fairly routine event - Jacob Rees-Mogg was booked to speak to a few hundred students at a ticketed event. He would've spoken for about half an hour before taking questions. Just a few minutes after he started speaking, a group of protesters came into the back of the lecture theatre and started shouting anti-Conservative rhetoric, very loudly, trying to shout him down. Rather than halting the event, or ignoring them, Mr Rees-Mogg walked up to the back of the theatre to try and talk them down. At that point, various other members of the audience got involved, leading to a scuffle. It looked to me that Mr Rees-Mogg was actually pushed and shoved, although he insists he wasn't. But it was a very aggressive and unexpected scene. After the scuffle, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""Some people who don't agree with me wanted to make their point, and I don't object to this. ""I think we live in a free society and freedom of speech is very important. ""And people like me, who advocate freedom of speech, support it when it's not exactly what we want, as well as when it is what we want."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah branded the protesters' behaviour ""thuggish"", adding: ""Free speech under the law is fundamental to our democracy."" He praised Mr Rees-Mogg for ""not being cowed into silence"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Spice Girls to reunite on new work,"The Spice Girls have confirmed they are planning to work on new projects, after meeting for the first time since 2012. It comes after Victoria Beckham, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm were pictured together at Horner's house in Hertfordshire. Mel C told BBC Radio 2 they had been talking about ""opportunities and ideas"" but there was ""nothing set in stone"". Their debut single Wannabe propelled the Spice Girls to fame in 1996 and they split up six years later. The five members - nicknamed Posh, Ginger, Baby, Scary and Sporty - were accompanied at the meeting by their former manager Simon Fuller. Mel C told Dermot O'Leary on Radio 2's Saturday Breakfast Show the five stars had wanted ""a little catch up"" to ""see where everyone's at"". ""It's the worst kept secret in showbiz always,"" she said. ""It was lovely to get together, so we are talking about opportunities, ideas we have for the future... but you know, it's early stages and there's nothing set in stone, there is no big announcement."" She added: ""But it's just great to be back in Spiceworld and to see the reaction, all over social media, the press and it's so lovely to know that people out there still care.""

Mums' names to go on marriage certificate,"Ministers have backed calls for mothers' names to be put on marriage certificates in England and Wales. The Home Office said it will support a private member's bill, which aims to modernise marriage registration for the first time since 1837. If passed, it would allow the names of both parents of the couple to be included on marriage certificates - instead of just those of their fathers. Home Secretary Amber Rudd says the move will modernise an outdated system. 'Keep sex abuse dad's name off my wedding certificate' Put mothers' names on marriage certificates MPs from all parties have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded. Their campaign received the backing of former Prime Minister David Cameron, who pledged to address this ""inequality in marriage"" - but he was gone from Downing Street before any action could be taken. The move would bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership. On Friday, the Home Office said it would back Tory MP Tim Loughton's Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which also modernises the process of marriage registration away from a solely paper-based system. Ms Rudd said: ""A marriage is not just a major event for the couple but also in the life of any parent - and it is only right that all parents have the opportunity to have their names included on marriage certificates. ""The current legislation which only allows for fathers' names is completely outdated and does not reflect modern Britain. ""There are around 250,000 marriages every year. It is about time that there are equal rights and recognition when it comes to registering a child's marriage."" The changes would mean that marriage entries - currently stored in 84,000 hard copy marriage registers - would be held in a single electronic register, which the Home Office says could result in savings of Â£33.8m over 10 years. Mr Loughton's billalso calls for heterosexual co-habiting partners to be allowed to form civil partnerships- in the same way as gay couples - a move the government has pledged to review. The MP said it was ""not fair"" that opposite sex couples have ""the single option of marriage"". Mr Loughton also urgedthe registration of stillbirthsdelivered before the required 24-week legal age to be considered viable. His bill received an unopposed second reading.

'Censored' nymphs painting back on show,"Hylas and the Nymphs by JW Waterhouse dates from 1896 A gallery is to put a Victorian painting of naked adolescent girls back on display after a row over censorship. Manchester Art Gallery said it took down Hylas and the Nymphs by JW Waterhouse to ""encourage debate"" about how such images should be displayed. But critics accused curators of being puritanical and politically correct. The painting will return on Saturday. ""It's been clear that many people feel very strongly about the issues raised,"" Manchester City Council said. The 1896 paintingwas removed a week agoin an attempt to rethink the ""very old-fashioned"" way images of women's bodies were exhibited as ""either as passive beautiful objects or femmes fatales"". Curator Clare Gannaway said: ""It's not about saying these things can't exist in a public gallery - it's about saying, maybe we just need to challenge the way these paintings have been read and enable them to speak in a different way."" Visitors were invited to write their views about the decision on sticky notes and post them in the vacant space. Visitors can stick notes to the wall where the painting hung But after a backlash, the city council, which runs the gallery, announced that the painting would return to the wall. The gallery's interim director Amanda Wallace said: ""We were hoping the experiment would stimulate discussion, and it's fair to say we've had that in spades - and not just from local people but from art-lovers around the world. ""Throughout the painting's seven day absence, it's been clear that many people feel very strongly about the issues raised, and we now plan to harness this strength of feeling for some further debate on these wider issues."" The gallery is now planning a series of public events ""to encourage further debate"". Speaking on Thursday, Clare Gannaway denied that the gallery was censoring the picture, but there were strong reactions on social media and in the art world. ""Removing art due to political concerns is exactly censorship,""wrote Gary Brooks on Twitter,external. ""I think you can spark a debate without removing the painting,""said Ben Perkins,external. Professor Liz Prettejohn, who curated a Waterhouse exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 2009, told BBC News: ""Taking it off display is killing any kind of debate that you might be able to have about it in relation to some of the really interesting issues that it might raise about sexuality and gender relationships. ""The Victorians are always getting criticised because they're supposed to be prudish. But here it would seem it's us who are taking the roles of what we think of as the very moralistic Victorians."" The painting's initial removal was filmed to be made into a new piece of video art forartist Sonia Boyce's exhibition at the gallery,externalin March. Postcards of the painting were also taken out of the gallery shop. The furore came two months after two sisters started a petition asking the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to remove, or at least reimagine the way it presented, a painting by Balthus of a neighbour's daughter in an erotic pose. The sisters said the Met was ""romanticising voyeurism and the objectification of children"". The museum refused to remove it,external, saying it wanted to encourage ""the continuing evolution of existing culture through informed discussion and respect for creative expression"".

Man jailed over wife-in-suitcase murder,"This video can not be played CCTV of Ashwin Daudia dragging the suitcase with his ex inside was shown to the jury A ""controlling"" husband who was caught on CCTV dragging his ex-wife's body in a suitcase has been jailed for her murder. Ashwin Daudia, 51, strangled Kiran Daudia and stuffed her remains into the luggage before dumping it in an alley behind bins. Leicester Crown Court heard Daudia killed Kiran on the day he was due to be kicked out of the home they shared. He was given a life sentence with a minimum of 18 years behind bars. The court heard Kiran was reported missing by her family when she did not return home from work. Kiran Daudia was 46 when she died and had two sons, then aged 17 and 25 Police went to the home address and spoke to Daudia, who claimed he had not seen her. Live updates and stories from across the East Midlands Officers received a call the next morning from a neighbour who had found the suitcase abandoned in their back yard. They later discovered the footage of Daudia dragging the suitcase around a corner near Kiran's home. The court heard the couple, who had an arranged marriage in 1998, continued living together after their divorce in 2014. But their house in Lyme Road had been sold to Kiran's sister, with Daudia set to move out on 16 January last year. Ashwin Daudia was given a life sentence with a minimum of 18 years behind bars Prosecutors said Daudia's claim he had ""lost control"" and killed his ex in self-defence was a lie designed to protect himself. They argued ligature marks on her neck suggested she had been strangled with her own scarf. Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Spencer QC said he was satisfied Daudia had killed Kiran ""in what should have been the safety of her own home"". ""In my judgment you were arrogant, bullying and bent upon maintaining control. ""In short, I'm quite satisfied the course of destruction of your family was a course charted by you. ""Your selfish pride fuelled your anger."" In a statement, Kiran's family said she had ""lots of dreams and aspirations which were... taken away by this demonic act"".

Trump Russia affair explained,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

Key parts of memo - and what it means,"After days - weeks - of breathless anticipation, the secret memo is a secret no more. Was it a bomb or a dud? Written by House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes and his staff, the memo was being billed by some conservatives as revealing misdeeds ""worse than Watergate,external"" and offences ""a hundred times bigger,external"" than what prompted the American Revolution. Meanwhile Democrats in Congress, and members of Donald Trump's Justice Department, were fighting to keep the memo, warning that it contained ""material omissions"" and threatened revealing important intelligence-gathering methods. That's a lot to pack into a four-page document. So what's the scoop? Here's a look at four key passages from the memo, and what they mean. The words ""essential part"" do the heavy lifting in this paragraph. This sets up the central point of the memo that the application to beginsurveillance of Carter Pagewas dependent upon information contained in the Steele dossier - the collection of raw intelligence information, much of which has not been substantiated and some of which is quite salacious - compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. The memo notes that Steele's efforts were funded in part by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, although it neglects to mention that the Fusion GPS opposition research effort directed toward Mr Trump was originally bankrolled by a prominent conservative donor and activist. The memo asserts that the FBI did not present evidence of this possible bias to the Fisa judge tasked with reviewing the surveillance warrant - and that this is evidence of, at best, neglect or, at worst, an anti-Trump agenda. As further evidence of Steele's bias, the memo recounts how Steele, during contacts with a senior Justice Department official, expressed negative views about Mr Trump. Bruce Ohr, the official in question, made a record of Steele's opinions - somewhat undercutting the accusation of rampant bias within the department, given that a truly compromised individual wouldn't jot that sort of thing down. That notwithstanding, the memo says this information also should have been - but wasn't - included in the Fisa application. For a bit of context, the Fisa warrant review system was established by Congress in 1978 and, as of 2013, had reviewed more than 35,000 surveillance requests. Of that number, the judges on the court had rejected only 12 applications. The question, then, is whether knowing a bit more about Christopher Steele's motivations or opinions would have been enough to put this application in the very small pile of discarded requests. Or would the evidence Steele presented, or other information that the Nunes memo may have omitted, have stood on its own and justified the surveillance? The portion of this paragraph questioning James Comey's decision to inform Mr Trump about the dossier was probably well-received by the president, but it seems irrelevant to the point. It does, however,somewhat mischaracterise,externalhow the then-FBI director described the Steele dossier. Yes, Mr Comey used the words ""salacious and unverified"" - but that was only in relation to portions of the dossier. He declined to comment on the veracity of certain ""criminal allegations"" in other parts of the dossier - at least in open testimony. With this in mind, the final line of this paragraph is of particular note. The memo asserts that Andrew McCabe, the then-deputy director of the FBI, testified that there would have been no surveillance request without the dossier. If this is in fact an accurate characterisation of Mr McCabe's testimony, then it would go a long way toward substantiating the memo's contention that the dossier and the surveillance request are inextricably linked. But without Mr McCabe's actual testimony, this becomes a very big ""if"". The last paragraph of the Nunes memo contains a somewhat jaw-dropping ""oh, by the way"" aside. The memo makes a considerable effort to draw a line from the Steele dossier to the Page surveillance request to questions about the legitimacy of the Russia investigation as a whole. The memo then notes it was information about George Papadopoulos, another Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, that prompted the launch of the FBI counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 - months before the Page surveillance request was granted. Read the memo in full on the House website,external The things that don't add up about Carter Page The biggest news was Papadopoulous Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian nationals while a Trump campaign adviser and was told by one contact that the Russians had ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"". The memo doesn't address any of this, instead opting to recount how that investigation was initiated by Peter Strzok, a senior FBI agent who has since become mired in a scandal surrounding an affair with a co-worker in which they made derogatory remarks about Mr Trump via text message on government mobile phones. This video can not be played George Papadopoulos: The Trump adviser who lied to the FBI The document concludes with the oft-cited line about an ""insurance"" policy for the possibility of Mr Trump's election, although it provides no context for this vague reference in an isolated text. The memo's focus on Page is interesting. The unpaid Trump campaign adviser had been on the FBI's radar since 2013, because of his ties to a Russian bank executive who was later convicted of spying on the US. Page had resigned as a Trump foreign policy adviser in September 2016 - a month before the Fisa warrant was approved. The Trump team has characterised Page as a bit player in the campaign, which raises questions about whether an order to monitor Page should be viewed as a direct assault by the FBI on the heart of the Trump campaign, undermining the entire Russia investigation, or a particularly colourful sideshow to a much larger and justifiable endeavour.

Freezer murder case co-accused 'panicked',"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston, south-west London A man accused of helping a builder kidnap two women lied to police because he ""panicked"", a court has heard. Vincent Tappu, 28, is charged with helping Mujahid Arshid kidnap Celine Dookhran, whose body was found in a freezer. He has also denied aiding the kidnap of the second woman. Giving evidence in his defence, Mr Tappu told the Old Bailey he had no involvement and Mr Arshid had ""implicated"" him in the crime. Mr Arshid, 33, is accused of taking the two women to an empty house in Kingston, south-west London, on 19 July 2017. He is charged with the rape and murder of his niece Ms Dookhran, and the rape and attempted murder of the second woman, who cannot be named. Mr Tappu admitted lying in early police interviews as to his whereabouts on the day in question. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said the defendant had been ""forced"" into changing his initial account only after telephone evidence exposed his lies Mr Emlyn Jones told Mr Tappu such evidence ""proves you were that second kidnapper"". He admitted telling lies during his police interviews because he ""was worried"" and ""panicked"" - but said he eventually told the truth. Body-in-freezer web search 'coincidence' Murder accused rejects sex fantasy claim Accused blames murder on 'rape victim' Mr Tappu told jurors he went to meet his co-defendant in the area of the alleged kidnap to collect money he was owed for labouring work. He said he had gone home without seeing Mr Arshid after waiting in his car for about two hours. He told jurors he ""smoked a joint,"" used his iPad, and ""nodded off"" for a while. Mr Tappu, from Acton, said the only conversations he had with Mr Arshid around the time in question related to building work, his health, and a proposed plan to grow cannabis. He denied being known as Jay - which prosecutors said was his nickname, heard by the surviving woman during the kidnap. Prosecutor Mr Emlyn Jones told Mr Tappu he had ""been roped into committing an appallingly serious criminal offence"" and ""now the net is tightening around you"". Mr Tappu said he was being ""implicated"" by his co-accused. ""I'm nothing like Mujahid,"" he added. Mujahid Arshid (left) and Vincent Tappu are charged with kidnapping Ms Dookhran and the second woman Mr Tappu denies kidnap, conspiracy to falsely imprison, and possession of a firearm with intent. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, denies all charges. The trial continues.

Sprawling Maya cities uncovered by lasers,"The Maya city of Tikal was found to be just a fraction of an immense hidden metropolis Researchers have found more than 60,000 hidden Maya ruins in Guatemala in a major archaeological breakthrough. Laser technology was used to survey digitally beneath the forest canopy, revealing houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications. The landscape, near already-known Maya cities, is thought to have been home to millions more people than other research had previously suggested. The researchers mapped over 810 square miles (2,100 sq km) in northern Peten. Archaeologists believe the cutting-edge technology will change the way the world will see the Maya civilisation. ""I think this is one of the greatest advances in over 150 years of Maya archaeology,"" said Stephen Houston, Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology at Brown University. Mr Houston told the BBC that after decades of work in the archaeological field, he found the magnitude of the recent survey ""breathtaking"". He added, ""I know it sounds hyperbolic but when I saw the [Lidar] imagery, it did bring tears to my eyes."" Most structures are believed to be stone platforms for pole-and-thatch homes Results from the research using Lidar technology, which is short for ""light detection and ranging"", suggest that Central America supported an advanced civilisation more akin to sophisticated cultures like ancient Greece or China. ""Everything is turned on its head,"" Ithaca College archaeologist Thomas Garrison told the BBC. He believes the scale and population density has been ""grossly underestimated and could in fact be three or four times greater than previously thought"". Described as ""magic"" by some archaeologists, Lidar unveils archaeological finds almost invisible to the naked eye, especially in the tropics. It is a sophisticated remote sensing technology that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth Millions of laser pulses every four seconds are beamed at the ground from a plane or helicopter The wavelengths are measured as they bounce back, which is not unlike how bats use sonar to hunt The highly accurate measurements are then used to produce a detailed three-dimensional image of the ground surface topography The group of scholars who worked on this project used Lidar to digitally remove the dense tree canopy to create a 3D map of what is really under the surface of the now-uninhabited Guatemalan rainforest. ""Lidar is revolutionising archaeology,externalthe way the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionised astronomy,"" Francisco Estrada-Belli, a Tulane University archaeologist, told National Geographic. ""We'll need 100 years to go through all [the data] and really understand what we're seeing."" The Lidar images have surprised surveyors Archaeologists excavating a Maya site called El Zotz in northern Guatemala, painstakingly mapped the landscape for years. But the Lidar survey revealed kilometres of fortification wall that the team had never noticed before. ""Maybe, eventually, we would have gotten to this hilltop where this fortress is, but I was within about 150 feet of it in 2010 and didn't see anything,"" Mr Garrison told Live Science. While Lidar imagery has saved archaeologists years of on-the-ground searching, the BBC was told that it also presents a problem. ""The tricky thing about Lidar is that it gives us an image of 3,000 years of Mayan civilisation in the area, compressed,"" explained Mr Garrison, who is part of a consortium of archaeologists involved in the recent survey. ""It's a great problem to have though, because it gives us new challenges as we learn more about the Maya."" In recent years Lidar technology has also been used to reveal previously hidden cities near the iconic ancient temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. How lasers revealed a lost city in the Cambodian jungle 'Mayan day of apocalypse' marked Radio 4's In Our Time: The Maya Civilisation Maya civilisation, at its peak some 1,500 years ago, covered an area about twice the size of medieval England, with an estimated population of around five million. ""With this new data it's no longer unreasonable to think that there were 10 to 15 million people there,"" said Mr Estrada-Belli, ""including many living in low-lying, swampy areas that many of us had thought uninhabitable."" Most of the 60,000 newly identified structures are thought to be stone platforms that would have supported the average pole-and-thatch Maya home. The archaeologists were struck by the ""incredible defensive features"", which included walls, fortresses and moats. They showed that the Maya invested more resources into defending themselves than previously thought, Mr Garrison said. One of the hidden finds is a seven-storey pyramid so covered in vegetation that it practically melts into the jungle. Another discovery that surprised archaeologists was the complex network of causeways linking all the Maya cities in the area. The raised highways, allowing easy passage even during rainy seasons, were wide enough to suggest they were heavily trafficked and used for trade. ""The idea of seeing a continuous landscape, but understanding everything is connected across many square miles is amazing,"" said Mr Houston. ""We can expect many further surprises,"" he added. The Lidar survey was the first part of a three-year project led by a Guatemalan organisation that promotes cultural heritage preservation. It will eventually map more than 5,000 sq miles (14,000 sq km) of Guatemala's lowlands. The project's discoveries will feature in a Channel 4 programme called Lost Cities of the Maya: Revealed, airing in the UK on Sunday 11 February at 20:00 GMT.

MP's tears over stillborn daughter,"This video can not be played Emotionally charged Commons hears stillbirth account An MP wept as she told the Commons how not being able to register the life or death of her stillborn daughter has left her devastated. Labour's Sharon Hodgson's daughter Lucy was delivered three days short of the required 24 week legal age to be considered viable. Instead her records recorded the birth as a miscarriage, she said. Tory Will Quince, whose son was stillborn, told her: ""I think Lucy would be very proud of her mummy."" Will Quince MP on stillbirths and infant deaths Baby loss: 'People sharing stories is the biggest comfort' A stillborn baby's parents faced 'fight' for full story The emotionally charged exchanges came during debate on a bill to allow heterosexual couples to form civil partnerships, and for all stillborn deaths to be registered. Many MPs were seen wiping away tears as Mrs Hodgson admitted that although her experience happened almost 20 years ago, she still found it very difficult to talk about. Had her third child Lucy been born alive, she would have been incubated at 23.5 weeks, taken in an ambulance to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary's special care baby unit and ""had the very best world class care"", she said. ""She would have a birth certificate. She would have been celebrating her 20th birthday this year. ""But sadly she was stillborn. So no flashing blue lights, no incubator and no birthday parties. Ever. ""And I found out to my horror - no birth or death certificate. So as I held her in my arms and had to come to terms with that had just happened, I also then had to come to terms with the fact that unfortunately, she did not exist ... ""She was three to four days short of the required 24 week legal age to be considered eligible for a death certificate."" Mrs Hodgson said she was ""further traumatised"" when she discovered Lucy's birth had been recorded as a miscarriage. ""Because she was pre-24 weeks, she didn't even get the dignity of being classed as a stillbirth,"" she commented. The MP said Lucy was named at a blessing conducted by the hospital chaplain, and she was ""buried in a tiny white coffin"" in the same grave as her grandparents, A small family service was funded by the Co-op, and because her elder children were only two and three and a half years old at the time, only her husband and their parents were in attendance. ""I tell you all this to highlight that to the chaplain, to the Co-op funeral service, to us - her family - she existed. She was a baby who was sadly born dead. ""Her heart was beating throughout my labour just up to minutes before she was born - she just couldn't make the final push into this world. ""And because of a matter of a few days, she doesn't officially exist in any records, other than in our memories and our own family records. ""Even the entry on the deeds for the grave is in my name - as if I or in this case, a bit of me, was buried there."" Mrs Hodgson said she hoped MPs would understand how hard it had been to deal with what happened, which ""was and still is the worst thing I've had to experience in all my life"". Having seen the ""miracle"" of babies surviving birth before 24 weeks, she added: ""Surely there's a way to recognise a 22 or 23 week baby who didn't quite make it to their first birthday?"" Mr Quince, who intervened during Mrs Hodgson's address to allow her to compose herself, said all bereaved parents ""want to ensure that our child's life, however short, has meaning"". ""If you don't mind me saying, I think Lucy would be very proud of her mummy today,"" he added. Mrs Hodgson, smiled, thanked him and laughed: ""If you were trying to calm me down, you've probably made me worse."" Later in the debate, Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the government would review the issue to see if the law needed to be changed to allow for the registration of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks gestation. ""The Department of Health and Social Care recognises the need to do more to support families affected by a miscarriage,"" she said. ""Some families may want their loss to be acknowledged and registered, others however may feel distressed at any mandatory requirement to do so in the circumstances of their grief, and so this issue must therefore be approached with great care and sensitivity."" Tory MP Tim Loughton's Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which calls for the formal registration of stillborn children, received an unopposed second reading on Friday.

Pressure on May to choose over Brexit,"This video can not be played PM: The UK will not have to choose between EU deal and one with the rest of the world. Theresa May is coming under increasing pressure to set out where she stands on Britain's future trade agreements. Speaking at the end of a trade visit to China, the PM said Britain would not face a choice between a free trade deal with the EU after Brexit and striking deals with the rest of the world. It comes as she has faced criticism from Eurosceptic Tory MPs that she is heading for a ""Brexit in name only"". Full negotiations on the UK's 2019 exit are to resume on Monday. Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet his EU counterpart Michel Barnier in London on Monday for the first time this year, with officials from both sides continuing technical discussions during the week.

During the prime minister's three-day visit to China, Downing Street said more than Â£9bn of business deals were signed and it agreed to a joint investment and trade review as the ""first step"" to an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal with the world's second largest economy. What the EU really wants from the UK Kuenssberg: PM returns from China to Brexit tensions May hails 'first step' to China trade deal However, Mrs May has faced growing criticism from MPs, including many in her own party, who have called for her to be more specific about her priorities on UK's future trade arrangements with the EU. Inan interview with Bloomberg News,external, Liam Fox, who was with Mrs May in China, said the UK cannot be involved in any customs union with the EU following Brexit. Number 10 said the international trade secretary was speaking for the government - but also said the details of future arrangements with Brussels were a matter for negotiation. ""It is fair to say the prime minister has an open mind when it comes to these negotiations,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. Theresa May and her husband Philip in Shanghai By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent While Theresa May has been away - successfully signing trade deals -  I have been assessing the battles she faces on the home front, within her own party. What is most striking is that some who supported her have, at the very least, become wobblier. One ex-minister said he felt ""badly let down"". She has been accused of blocking, not delivering, radical change. A former supporter questioned her lack of decisiveness: ""She has more reviews than a film critic would produce in a lifetime."" A Remainer who despises Boris Johnson wondered if - to coin a phrase - the foreign secretary's ""bad leadership would be better than no leadership"". Council candidates fear poor results in London's May elections and think this could be a trigger for the PM to go. And a Conservative-supporting business leader felt - though he didn't advocate it - that her opponents ""will pull the pin from the grenade"". Downing Street believes the feeding frenzy of speculation will abate when more progress is made on EU withdrawal. But they are aware of the challenges at home as well as abroad. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said she had already spelled out what she wants from the deal and did not believe the UK would have to choose between Europe and the rest of the world. ""I don't believe that those are the alternatives,"" she said. ""What the British people voted for is for us to take back control of our money, our borders and our laws and that's exactly what we are going to do. ""We also want to ensure that we can trade across borders."" By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst, BBC Monitoring Mainland Chinese media have praised Theresa May's 31 January-2 February visit from start to finish. Official broadcaster CCTV says that the nickname media have given her - ""Auntie May"" - shows that she has become ""one of the family"" and newspapers have heralded her trip as showing that Sino-UK ties signal new heights for bilateral cultural exchanges, and post-Brexit trade deals. They have also given a nod to Mrs May for, reportedly, not raising human rights issues in Hong Kong during her stay. Nationalist newspaper Global Timescommends the UK prime minister,externalfor ""not making any comment contrary to the goals of her China trip"", saying ""the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere"". Independent Hong Kong and Taiwanese media have been critical of the Prime Minister for not raising the contentious issue of pro-democracy protests. Publications including influential paper South China Morning Postquote former British governor Chris Patten,external, who said the Hong Kong dialogue was ""critical"" to granting assurances that developing ties with the mainland won't come at Hong Kong's expense. The prime minister has come under pressure from Eurosceptics worried about potential concessions by the UK in the Brexit talks. Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested Britain's relationship with the EU would change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit. However, cabinet members - including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - have warned the UK will lose the main advantages of Brexit if it remains bound by trade rules of the single market and customs union. They have called for the prime minister to be clearer about her own position. She told the BBC her goal in upcoming talks with Europe was to strike a deal that ""is going to be good for trade between the UK and EU and good for jobs in Britain"". This video can not be played Theresa May: I am not a quitter She added: ""It means a free trade agreement with the EU. We are now starting to negotiate that free trade agreement with the EU."" She has repeatedly said Brexit will mean leaving the single market and customs union. Asked again about her own future as prime minister, Mrs May said: ""I'm not a quitter. I'm in this because there is a job to be done here and that's delivering for the British people and doing that in a way that ensures the future prosperity of our country.""

Struggling council bans spending,"The government ordered a review into the county council's finances last month A cash-strapped local authority has imposed emergency spending controls as it faces ""severe financial challenges"". The section 114 notice bans all new expenditure at Northamptonshire County Council, with the exception of statutory services for protecting vulnerable people. Last month the government said an inspector would look into allegations of financial failings at the authority. It is believed to be the first such notice issued in more than 20 years. The implications are due to be discussed at the full council meeting on 22 February. A spokeswoman said: ""The notice has been served in light of the severe financial challenge facing the authority and the significant risk that it will not be in a position to deliver a balanced budget by the end of the year."" The authority said staff pay would not be affected. Bob Scott, leader of the Labour Group on the council, said: ""I'm not surprised. I've been saying for the past five years there are problems there, and two years ago I said I expected a section 114 order to be issued. ""My only surprise is that it's been issued just after an inspector has been appointed and started his work."" Northamptonshire County Council's new headquarters officially opened in October The Conservative-led council announced in December that it was looking toincrease council tax by almost 5% as it sought to make savings of Â£34.3m. At the time, council leaders claimed they were facing huge demand for services, as well as cuts in government grants. It was revealed in January the authority wasconsidering selling its new Â£53m headquarters, which officially opened in October. One Angel Square was designed to save money by closing 12 offices and making best use of a new office block. Rob Whiteman, Chief Executive of Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, called the move ""highly unusual"" and said it was the first section 114 notice for more than 20 years. ""Whilst Northamptonshire has had a difficult context within which to balance its budget in relation to government cuts, other councils in a similar situation have successfully managed their budgets,"" he said. Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, announced last month thata government inspector would be assessing the council's financial state. Council leader Heather Smith said the authority had always been ""open and transparent"".

Man at 'wits' end' when he killed daughter,"Olivia Kray, 19, was strangled by her father, Richard Kray A father killed his daughter because he was ""at his wits' end"" with her mental health problems before then trying to murder her mother, a court has heard. Richard Kray, 64, strangled Olivia, 19, in a caravan at Westlands Caravan Park, near Herne Bay in Kent, last July. A sentencing hearing at Maidstone Crown Court heard he then tried to strangle his ex-partner Damyantee Cowan. In December he admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and attempted murder. He will be sentenced on Monday. Simon Taylor, prosecuting, told the court Ms Kray, who was described as ""loving and ""kind"", had a severe anxiety disorder, and had battled mental health problems since the age of 10. She was also dependent on her father to accompany her when she wanted to go out. In 2016 health professionals noted her parents had ""reached the end of their tether with her"". The court heard that on 24 May last year Kray told his sister it would be ""easier to kill the three of them"", referring to himself, Ms Cowan and Ms Kray. Mr Taylor said by July his ability to cope with his daughter's illness was ""rapidly diminishing"". Less than a week before he carried out the killing, Kray told Ms Cowan: ""Let's crash the car, let's all be killed together."" Three days before his daughter's death Kray told her friend's mother: ""I've even thought about killing the pair of them. Obviously I wouldn't, I love her, she's my daughter. ""It's my bloody fault, I've let it go on too long."" Police were called to Westlands Caravan Park on 21 July last year After strangling Ms Kray on 21 July in the caravan where he lived, Kray went to Ms Cowan's house and grabbed her by the neck, leaving her ""frozen with panic"", Mr Taylor said. The court was told he dragged her between rooms, then put his hands over her mouth, pushed her onto the stairs and climbed on top of her. Ms Cowan managed to break free, and ran out of the house to a police station. Kray handed himself into police a short while later, telling them where his daughter's body was and saying that he ""couldn't let her suffer anymore"". ""I'm at my wits' end for months and months. I know it's no excuse,"" he said. Kray was deemed unfit for interview and taken to a psychiatric clinic in Maidstone for treatment. Judge Philip Statman indicated he would pass a sentence which allows Kray to continue to be treated at the facility before being moved to jail. He added: ""There's a great deal of public interest in this case and I wouldn't want it thought that the medical services failed her [Ms Kray] in any way. ""It's very important we understand that.""

Postman stole birthday cards for two years,"Paul Heaney's thefts took place at the Dundee West Delivery Office A postman who stole dozens of greetings cards and other items he thought may contain money has been given a community sentence. Paul Heaney was caught when suspicious managers put two fake birthday cards into the system in the delivery office in Dundee where he worked. Heaney, 38, pleaded guilty by letter to three charges of theft and one under the Postal Services Act 2000. He was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Heaney was also placed on a restriction of liberty order confining him to his home from 19:00 to 07:00 for four months. Dundee Sheriff Court was told 89 stolen items were discovered in Heaney's garden shed and additional stolen items were found in his house. Depute fiscal Joanne Smith said postal staff launched an investigation in 2016 after receiving a tip-off. The fiscal said: ""Accordingly an investigating manager put through greetings cards test packets to be placed and sequenced by the accused. ""Investigations were conducted and despite an extensive search throughout the delivery office no trace could be found of the test postal packets. ""The accused was approached on his return to the delivery office and two of them were found within his delivery pouch."" Heaney initially said he had been stealing packets for about six weeks. However, following the search of his home, he admitted stealing items over the course of two years. The court was told the mail was forwarded to the correct addresses with a letter of explanation. The thefts took place between August 2014 and October 2016 at the Dundee West Delivery Office in Baird Avenue. Defence solicitor John Boyle said: ""He has shown remorse and shame for his actions. He knows this is utterly unacceptable."" Sheriff Tom Hughes told Heaney: ""This is a matter of the utmost seriousness and the court cannot sit back and watch this going on. ""People should be able to post things in confidence.""

Finsbury Park attacker jailed for life,"Darren Osborne was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, at Woolwich Crown Court A man who drove a van into a crowd of Muslims near a north London mosque has been sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 43 years behind bars. Darren Osborne, 48, was found guilty of murdering Makram Ali, 51, after deliberately ploughing into a crowd of people in Finsbury Park in June. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Osborne, from Cardiff: ""This was a terrorist attack. You intended to kill."" Mr Ali's family said they could not imagine the trauma he felt as he died. Speaking outside court, his daughter, Ruzina Akhtar, said: ""Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful."" ""He was such a peaceful and simple man, he had no bad thoughts for anyone,"" she added. Osborne mowed down worshippers in Finsbury Park shortly after 12.15am on 19 June last year, killing Mr Ali and injuring nine others. The father-of-four, who was also found guilty of attempted murder, said ""God bless you all, thank you"", as he was led away from court. The jury took an hour to return the verdict at Woolwich Crown Court on Thursday after a nine-day trial. This video can not be played Ruzina Akhtar says her father, who died in the Finsbury Park attack, 'will never be forgotten'. Sentencing him,Justice Cheema-Grubb told Osborne,externalthe jury in his trial had seen though his ""pathetic last-ditch attempt to deceive them"", by claiming an apparent accomplice called ""Dave"" had been the driver. The judge said Osborne had planned ""a suicide mission"" and expected to be shot dead by the police. He was guilty of a ""terrorist murder"", she added. Osborne had been ""rapidly radicalised over the internet by those determined to spread hatred of Muslims"", she said. ""Your use of Twitter exposed you to racists and anti-Islamic ideology,"" she added. ""In short, you allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claimed to be leaders."" This video can not be played CCTV showed Darren Osborne's movements before and during the attack Before sentencing, the court heard a statement from Mr Ali's daughter, who said she had suffered ""recurring nightmares"" since the death of her father. Ms Akhtar said: ""The incident was near to our house and I walk past it most days. It keeps me awake at night thinking about the attack."" She said her mother was now scared to go outside by herself for fear of being attacked. ""My father was the most sincere and warmest person I know. He was full of jokes and laughter, and full of love for his family and grandchildren. ""His life was taken in a cruel way by a narrow-minded, heartless being,"" the statement added. Other witnesses suffered feelings of anxiety, flashbacks, fear of going out and loss of confidence, prosecutors said. Makram Ali, 51, was killed in the attack Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb also heard a list of Osborne's previous convictions - including a string of violent offences - spanning more than 30 years. Osborne had appeared before the courts on 33 occasions for 102 offences, she was told. The judge said Osborne's previous convictions showed he was a ""belligerent and violent character"". She said Mr Ali died immediately after being struck by the van. He was found with tyre marks on his torso, she added. Reacting to the sentencing, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, said she hoped Osborne's conviction for a ""horrific terrorist attack"" would come as ""some solace to his family and those injured"". Cdr Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism team, said Osborne had carried out an ""evil and cowardly attack"". ""Some of those injured have still not fully recovered and could suffer from health issues for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""I would like to pay tribute to Mr Ali's family and the local community in Finsbury Park, for their tremendous support and understanding with our investigation during what must have been an extremely difficult time for them."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack During the trial, the court the victims of the attack had been outside the Muslim Welfare House, in Finsbury Park, when the area had been busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers. Mr Ali had collapsed at the roadside in the minutes before the attack. Police later found a letter in the van written by Osborne, referring to Muslim people as ""rapists"" and ""feral"". He also wrote that Muslim men were ""preying on our children"". Osborne, the trial heard, had became ""obsessed"" with Muslims in the weeks leading up to the attack, having watched the BBC drama Three Girls, about the Rochdale grooming scandal. He then rented a van and had intended to target an Al Qud's Day march, on 18 June. Unable to access the march, he drove around London until arriving in north London at about midnight.

Morning campers: The inside story of Hi-de-Hi!,"Hi-de-Hi! was set in a holiday camp at the end of the 1950s The antics of the employees of Maplins holiday camp entertained viewers for nearly a decade and made huge stars of the cast of Hi-de-Hi! Thirty years after the last episode was shown, on 30 January 1988, they have been sharing their memories with the BBC. ""All these years later, people say to me how wonderful it was and how we love the show,"" says Jeffrey Holland, who played the camp's comedian Spike Dixon. ""You can't get 19 or 20 million viewers now. ""I meet young actors now who know me from the 1980s, and they are often thrilled to meet me for that reason, and that's so gratifying."" Hi-de-Hi! was Holland's big break, with the role of Spike written with him in mind. ""It was the first thing I ever did that made my face known,""  the actor says. ""Whatever else I've done since, or will in the future, I'll always be that bloke from Hi-de-Hi! and I wouldn't want it any other way."" Su Pollard and Jeffrey Holland as Peggy Ollerenshaw and Spike Dixon Set in the late 1950s and early 60s, Hi-de-Hi! followed the trials and tribulations of the camp's staff at a time when the popularity of domestic holidays was already in decline. Package holidays were increasingly luring campers abroad - in the final episode of the sitcom many of the staff at Maplins lose their jobs. In real life, the holiday camp where the outdoor scenes were filmed, Warner's in the small seaside town of Dovercourt in Essex, closed in the 1990s and has since been turned into a housing estate. Series star Su Pollard, who played chalet maid Peggy Ollerenshaw, recalls how spending time on location brought the group together. ""There weren't just two or three of us in it - there was a good dozen, and that instigated the family thing,"" she says. Warner's Holiday Camp hosted happy campers for decades until its closure in the 1990s Hi-de-Hi! - which won a Bafta in 1984 for Best Comedy Series - was based on writer Jimmy Perry's experience as aRedcoat at Butlins,externalin the 1950s. (He and co-writer David Croftcreated some of Britain's best-known sitcoms, including Dad's Army and It Ain't Half Hot Mum, while Croftwas also responsible for comedy classicssuch as Are You Being Served? and 'Allo 'Allo!) Hi-de-Hi! became known for its long-running comedy themes, such as the smouldering passion of Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) for the camp's uptight and rather innocent manager Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell), and Peggy's dreams of becoming a Yellowcoat. The popularity of the show led to a stage show, and at one stage there were even plans for a feature film. The programme's rock and roll theme tune Holiday Rock, which was composed by Perry, was released as a single by star Paul Shane - who played host Ted Bovis - and reached the UK top 40. Jimmy Perry (l) and David Croft received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards The show was typically filmed in September and October, when the cast would take up residence at The Cliff Hotel in Dovercourt, near Harwich. ""We used to move in on the last weekend in September, and the weather was always stunning,"" recalls Holland. ""We used to call it Croft weather - he was legendary with his luck when it came to the weather. He must have had a hotline to the man upstairs."" However, any luck ran out during the filming of the long-running show's final series. ""When we did the last week of filming in October 1987,the Great Storm happened during the nightbefore our last filming day,"" says 71-year-old Holland. ""We had one scene to shoot the following morning, which was to be shot around the pool. ""Fifty-eight poplar trees came down that night - the whole place was wrecked."" Hi-de-Hi! ran for nine series, starting in 1980 The actor recalls how one crew member had a lucky escape. ""When we filmed, lots of the electricians and crew stayed in chalets at the holiday camp. ""During the night, with the [wind] blowing, one of the sparks nipped out to use the loo and when he came back there was a tree clean through the middle of his chalet. ""If he'd been inside he would have been killed - the chalet came down like a matchbox."" Damage was done to the park during the Great Storm of October 1987, while the final series of Hi-de-Hi! was being filmed The Cliff Hotel's former manager John Wade remembers the cast gathering in the lobby as the storm rattled the windows - and that one of them was particularly shaken. ""The night of the hurricane, my night porter knocked and said: 'Ruth Madoc's a bit worried as her room is moving',"" he recalls. ""There were proper balconies outside and the support went through into the room, and it was moving outside in the wind. ""Of course it was moving the floor joists of the room, which gave the appearance of the whole room moving."" Hotel manager John Wade and Hi-de-Hi! star Su Pollard Those few weeks of each year when the cast and crew of Hi-De-Hi! would descend are remembered with fondness by residents. ""The number of times we sat in our back garden and [heard them] shout Hi-de-Hi! and Ho-de-Ho! in reply,"" recalls David Whittle, who lived 200 metres from the camp. ""And if they didn't get it right, they did it time and time again!"" The Cliff Hotel, which was home to many cast members during filming, is soon to be knocked down The BBC ghost spoof that duped a nation Victoria Wood: In her own words Ooh Betty! Frank's cliff stunt recalled Tamsin Lord, whose family lived in nearby Wix, remembers an encounter with the props department. ""My dad was outside the house, polishing his green Morris Traveller,"" she says. ""The prop guy passed by and requested to hire the car to take Gladys to the farm. Dad cleaned and smartened up the car so it shone. ""Gladys was going to a pig farm. The car came back covered in pig poo. We laughed until snot poured out our noses. Dad saw the funny side... having been well paid for the loan of the car."" Harwich and Dovercourt were once top holiday destinations Pollard says the reason the show ended up being made where it was was down to being rejected by the business that was the inspiration for Hi-de-Hi! ""They made thousands, Warner's Camp, because Butlins wouldn't have us,"" she says. ""They were trying to get away from the Hi-de-Hi! holiday camp image. But Warner's loved us and got Â£4,000 a week, I think, and it was out of season so great for them."" For Pollard, who is now 68, those heady 1980s days spent working on one of the country's most popular TV shows are, unsurprisingly, recalled with great affection. She describes how the cast would explore Harwich's culinary scene with Croft, who was something of a foodie - although the word was not in currency then - and, as his ""dealer"", supplying him with his sugar fix via his favourite Pontefract cakes. The cast and crew would often take over this Harwich restaurant, says Pollard There was also a tradition, Pollard says, for Croft to treat his stars to a ""tumbler of champagne"" to celebrate every 100th take they did. ""It all came off his budget, and they made sure we weren't filming later that day,"" she recalls. ""Champagne on the boss's orders!"" Looking back, Pollard and Holland are in agreement about the show's legacy. ""I've heard people in other shows trying to distance themselves from them as times gone by,"" Pollard says. ""But I would never want to deny I was in Hi-de-Hi! as I'm proud to have the feel-good feelings of having been in it. ""I wasn't just another show; it was such a big success."" Holland agrees. ""I don't understand people who turn their back on what made them,"" he says. ""I'll always be proud to have been in something that brought so much happiness.""

Why can't I pull on a sparkly dress?,"Former world champion Raymond van Barneveld is supporting the petition for the walk on girls' reinstatement A Scottish darts walk-on girl says she has never felt objectified in her job and is calling for a reversal of the governing body's decision to ban them. Lynsay Macdonald has been working on the Scottish darts circuit for six years. She has told critics not to judge her because she feels it is a privilege to work beside her sporting heroes. A Scottish promoter says he will keep using the women ""until he is told it's illegal"". Lynsay MacDonald, who lives in Glasgow, started at a local darts exhibition match and now works regularly on the Scottish darts exhibition circuit. She said she was ""disappointed"" when the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) announced last week that it would stop using young women to escort darts players at tournaments. The practice ended with the omission of the walk-on girls at the Masters tournament in Milton Keynes last weekend. Lynsay Macdonald was disappointed at the decision to ban walk-on girls from PDC events She told theBBC Scotland Kaye Adams Programmeshe supports the women who will now lose this part of their livelihood: ""These women do this job full time - that's how they make their bread and butter. ""It's all right for people like myself who also work full time. ""For me its a huge privilege to be part of an event like this and I've never once felt objectified in any way. ""So I see where they are coming from."" Lynsay thinks there is no harm in what she does, and she does it as much for the enjoyment of the game: ""Literally, all we do is escort the players to the oche, stand for a couple of minutes, smile, and then walk off. ""I see this job as a confidence boost for me, as well as getting to meet the players I enjoy watching on TV as a big fan."" Darts champion Michael van Gerwen supported the end of the practice She makes money, but that is not what it is all about: ""Yeah, I do well from it, it is extra pocket money for me I suppose. ""But I mainly do it because I enjoy the sport and I get to meet my sporting heroes so it's more a privilege than a financial gain."" Lynsay dismissed arguments from those who support the ban, that the practice of using good-looking women to ""glamorise"" a male-dominated sports event is outdated and sexist. She said: ""It's been 100 years since we've been granted the right to vote so that surely means that we have the right as women to choose what we want to do in life, say what we want. ""So, if we decide we want to put a sparkly dress on and smile, surely that can be seen as a good thing for women nowadays. We should be able to do what we want."" Former Olympian Susan Egelstaff joined the argument, saying the walk-on girls are unnecessary. She said that in 2018 people should not be celebrating girls who are there purely to be looked at. Susan Egelstaff wants women ""for decoration"" banned from all sports The Commonwealth Games bronze medallist would rather see women playing sport than ""decorating"" it: ""Thank goodness they got rid of walk-on girls,"" she said. ""I don't think anybody can argue that having walk-on girls that are basically told not to speak, not to do anything, just shut your mouth and look pretty, is a progressive kind of move. ""It says to young girls who are watching that the men are there to play sport and be successful and the girls are there just to look pretty and as decoration for the men and they are basically just there for men to ogle. ""The wider benefit of getting rid of walk-on girls is a bit more important than a few individuals maybe losing a bit of money."" Meanwhile, Scottish darts promoter David Hanson has revealed the walk-on girls might live on in Scotland. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He told Kaye Adams: ""It was a sad day for the sport - the walk-on girls are part of darts these days. ""These girls are very professional. It's a difficult thing to do, and only a very limited number of people could do it."" He said the first televised game without them had lost its appeal: ""Last week's game without them, there was something missing."" And that's why he is promising to keep up the tradition during all his live events. He said: ""These girls are looked after and do a great job. ""Until I am told it's illegal, as a promoter in Scotland, I will keep on doing it.""

Man guilty of wife-in-suitcase murder,"This video can not be played CCTV of Ashwin Daudia dragging the suitcase with his ex inside was shown to the jury A ""controlling"" husband who was caught on CCTV dragging his ex-wife's body in a suitcase has been jailed for her murder. Ashwin Daudia, 51, strangled Kiran Daudia and stuffed her remains into the luggage before dumping it in an alley behind bins. Leicester Crown Court heard Daudia killed Kiran on the day he was due to be kicked out of the home they shared. He was given a life sentence with a minimum of 18 years behind bars. The court heard Kiran was reported missing by her family when she did not return home from work. Kiran Daudia was 46 when she died and had two sons, then aged 17 and 25 Police went to the home address and spoke to Daudia, who claimed he had not seen her. Live updates and stories from across the East Midlands Officers received a call the next morning from a neighbour who had found the suitcase abandoned in their back yard. They later discovered the footage of Daudia dragging the suitcase around a corner near Kiran's home. The court heard the couple, who had an arranged marriage in 1998, continued living together after their divorce in 2014. But their house in Lyme Road had been sold to Kiran's sister, with Daudia set to move out on 16 January last year. Ashwin Daudia was given a life sentence with a minimum of 18 years behind bars Prosecutors said Daudia's claim he had ""lost control"" and killed his ex in self-defence was a lie designed to protect himself. They argued ligature marks on her neck suggested she had been strangled with her own scarf. Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Spencer QC said he was satisfied Daudia had killed Kiran ""in what should have been the safety of her own home"". ""In my judgment you were arrogant, bullying and bent upon maintaining control. ""In short, I'm quite satisfied the course of destruction of your family was a course charted by you. ""Your selfish pride fuelled your anger."" In a statement, Kiran's family said she had ""lots of dreams and aspirations which were... taken away by this demonic act"". ""Life without her will never be the same.""

"Finsbury Park attacker jailed for lifeDarren Osborne, who drove a van into a crowd of Muslims in London, will serve a minimum of 43 years.","Darren Osborne was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, at Woolwich Crown Court A man who drove a van into a crowd of Muslims near a north London mosque has been sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 43 years behind bars. Darren Osborne, 48, was found guilty of murdering Makram Ali, 51, after deliberately ploughing into a crowd of people in Finsbury Park in June. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Osborne, from Cardiff: ""This was a terrorist attack. You intended to kill."" Mr Ali's family said they could not imagine the trauma he felt as he died. Speaking outside court, his daughter, Ruzina Akhtar, said: ""Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful."" ""He was such a peaceful and simple man, he had no bad thoughts for anyone,"" she added. Osborne mowed down worshippers in Finsbury Park shortly after 12.15am on 19 June last year, killing Mr Ali and injuring nine others. The father-of-four, who was also found guilty of attempted murder, said ""God bless you all, thank you"", as he was led away from court. The jury took an hour to return the verdict at Woolwich Crown Court on Thursday after a nine-day trial. This video can not be played Ruzina Akhtar says her father, who died in the Finsbury Park attack, 'will never be forgotten'. Sentencing him,Justice Cheema-Grubb told Osborne,externalthe jury in his trial had seen though his ""pathetic last-ditch attempt to deceive them"", by claiming an apparent accomplice called ""Dave"" had been the driver. The judge said Osborne had planned ""a suicide mission"" and expected to be shot dead by the police. He was guilty of a ""terrorist murder"", she added. Osborne had been ""rapidly radicalised over the internet by those determined to spread hatred of Muslims"", she said. ""Your use of Twitter exposed you to racists and anti-Islamic ideology,"" she added. ""In short, you allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claimed to be leaders."" This video can not be played CCTV showed Darren Osborne's movements before and during the attack Before sentencing, the court heard a statement from Mr Ali's daughter, who said she had suffered ""recurring nightmares"" since the death of her father. Ms Akhtar said: ""The incident was near to our house and I walk past it most days. It keeps me awake at night thinking about the attack."" She said her mother was now scared to go outside by herself for fear of being attacked. ""My father was the most sincere and warmest person I know. He was full of jokes and laughter, and full of love for his family and grandchildren. ""His life was taken in a cruel way by a narrow-minded, heartless being,"" the statement added. Other witnesses suffered feelings of anxiety, flashbacks, fear of going out and loss of confidence, prosecutors said. Makram Ali, 51, was killed in the attack Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb also heard a list of Osborne's previous convictions - including a string of violent offences - spanning more than 30 years. Osborne had appeared before the courts on 33 occasions for 102 offences, she was told. The judge said Osborne's previous convictions showed he was a ""belligerent and violent character"". She said Mr Ali died immediately after being struck by the van. He was found with tyre marks on his torso, she added. Reacting to the sentencing, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, said she hoped Osborne's conviction for a ""horrific terrorist attack"" would come as ""some solace to his family and those injured"". Cdr Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism team, said Osborne had carried out an ""evil and cowardly attack"". ""Some of those injured have still not fully recovered and could suffer from health issues for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""I would like to pay tribute to Mr Ali's family and the local community in Finsbury Park, for their tremendous support and understanding with our investigation during what must have been an extremely difficult time for them."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack During the trial, the court the victims of the attack had been outside the Muslim Welfare House, in Finsbury Park, when the area had been busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers. Mr Ali had collapsed at the roadside in the minutes before the attack. Police later found a letter in the van written by Osborne, referring to Muslim people as ""rapists"" and ""feral"". He also wrote that Muslim men were ""preying on our children"". Osborne, the trial heard, had became ""obsessed"" with Muslims in the weeks leading up to the attack, having watched the BBC drama Three Girls, about the Rochdale grooming scandal. He then rented a van and had intended to target an Al Qud's Day march, on 18 June. Unable to access the march, he drove around London until arriving in north London at about midnight.

"US killer dad taunts ex-wife at execution""I've seen enough of him,"" John Battaglia's ex-wife said as she walked away after his execution.5h5 hours agoUS & Canada","John Battaglia killed the girls in his Texas apartment ""Well hi, Mary Jean,"" a Texas death row inmate said to his ex-wife as he was executed for murdering their two daughters in 2001. ""See ya'll later. Go ahead please,"" said John Battaglia, 62, as he prepared for Thursday night's lethal injection. The former accountant murdered his six- and nine-year-old daughters in his apartment as ex-wife Mary Jean Pearl listened helplessly on the phone. Lawyers filed a last-minute appeal to spare his life, but it was rejected. The Americans volunteering to watch executions Battaglia's legal team had asked the US Supreme Court to review his case because his ""perception of reality may be so distorted that he is incompetent to be executed"". John Battaglia with Liberty (L) and Faith After the lethal injection was administered, he closed his eyes for several moments, opened them, smiled and asked: ""Am I still alive?"" Battaglia then grinned and sighed,according to Dallas Morning News,external. ""Oh, here, I feel it,"" he said before gasping for breath and beginning to snore. After 22 minutes Battaglia was pronounced dead at 21:40 local time (03:45 GMT on Friday). ""I've seen enough of him,"" his ex-wife said as she walked away from the glass window that separated her from Battaglia,according to the Associated Press,external. He was the third prisoner put to death in the US this year. All the executions in 2018 have taken place in the state of Texas. 'Dementia' inmate's execution called off Battaglia and Ms Pearl divorced a year before the killings. She was seeking his arrest for violating a protective order against her on the day he murdered their daughters Liberty, six, and Faith, nine. On that evening in May 2001, Battaglia was scheduled to have dinner with the two girls when police informed him that he was violating probation and needed to surrender, court documents show. Battaglia's ex-wife heard gunshots and screams When the girls arrived at his Dallas apartment he called his wife and put her on speaker phone. Faith asked: ""Mommy, why do you want Daddy to go to jail?"" US death sentences fall to 40-year low A few seconds later Ms Pearl said she heard her daughter say: ""No, Daddy, please don't, don't do it."" Ms Pearl then heard gunshots and screams. The girls were found dead in Battaglia's apartment after being shot multiple times, police said. According to court documents, he went to a bar with his girlfriend after killing his daughters. Battaglia was later arrested at a tattoo parlour where he was getting tattoos of roses to remember them. A jury took 20 minutes to convict him in 2002. Experts determined that he had ""delusional disorder of the persecutory type"" after examining him. However, prosecutors said that Battaglia was aware of his crimes and therefore fit to be executed.

New regimental goat evades Army capture,"This video can not be played The Great Orme goat evaded Army capture for eight hours Stealthy, fleet of foot and elusive - The Royal Welsh's newest recruit is everything a battalion could want. Unfortunately, the kid in question is Shenkin IV - a wild goat on the Great Orme in Conwy county who the Army hoped to dart and capture to be the 3rd battalion's newest mascot. After eight fruitless hours, the search was called off on Friday afternoon and will resume near Llandudno next week. A new goat is needed afterShenkin III died in September, aged seven. An Army team, accompanied by an RSPCA vet, was deployed to select the successor before the new Shenkin could be taken to Maindy Barracks in Cardiff to begin his training. But after unsuccessfully pursuing the Kashmiri from the royal herd across the hills, they had to call off the search when it began to get dark. Bureaucats: Felines with official positions Indonesian army destroys ridiculed tiger statue Half-eel, half-aeroplane named Japan's best mascot So near, yet so far - the chosen successor to Shenkin III proved too quick to catch Camouflage was not enough to stop Shenkin spotting his potential would-be captors The regiment's Goat Major, Sgt Mark Jackson, said: ""He's a cheeky looking chap - when I was calling him, he was looking directly at me. He's got a lovely quiff of hair on top of his horns - he's the one we want."" Once Shenkin IV has been caught, Sgt Jackson will be responsible for introducing him to new sights and sounds - including a trip to Baglan RFC and walks around Cardiff city centre - so he is placid and well-disciplined around people when it is time to clip clop into the spotlight. Shenkin IV will hold the rank of fusilier and it is hoped his first public appearance will be at National Armed Forces Day in Llandudno on 30 June. Presuming they can catch him by then. Strike a pose: Shenkin shows he is not camera shy at an event at Cardiff Castle in March 2000 The National Army Museum said The Royal Welsh and its predecessor units have adopted goats as mascots since the 1770s It stems from the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American War of Independence when a wild goat is said to have strayed into the battle and led the Royal Welsh Fusiliers' colour party from the field Another story said a young Welsh soldier found a kid goat during the Crimean War and kept him as a pet. While on sentry duty one night, he tucked the goat inside his coat to keep warm and fell asleep, but was alerted to the enemy's advance when the goat bleated, giving him time to tell his fellow soldiers who were then able to repel the Russian attack In 1884, Queen Victoria presented the regiment with a Kashmir goat from the royal herd, starting the tradition that continues to this day All Royal Welsh goats hold a rank within the regiment A wild goat chase for new Army recruit.

Online estate agent in row over sales claimPurplebricks refutes a claim that it only sells about half of properties listed by customers.8h8 hours agoBusiness,"Online estate agency Purplebricks has defended its business after critical comments by analysts. On Thursday, stockbrokers Jefferies issued a research note questioning its claim it sold more than three quarters of homes listed with it. Jefferies said Purplebricks' sales success rate was just over 51% and near the middle of the pack of its study of 7,000 agents. But Purplebricks said it sold 78% of homes listed. Purplebricks charges a flat fee rather than a percentage of the sale price and uses a mix of online and local agents. The company's latest results, published in December, reported that its average revenue per UK customer was Â£1,138. Jefferies called selling with Purplebricks a ""Â£1,000 coin toss"", saying that, unlike traditional agents, its customers had to pay the fee regardless of whether the property sold. The brokers said the business model had not been sufficiently tested and that its shares were priced ""for perfection"". The note from Jefferies said: ""Purplebricks does not disclose how many homes it sells. Our research sample found that it had sold 51.6% of the homes listed in November 2016 within 10 months, a similar success rate to the overall market, but below the company's claim of 88% [made in an interview on the BBC's Moneybox programme]. ""Our concern is that the group has expanded quickly across three continents before the model has been proven and therefore that the shares are priced for perfection. Our research is not able to replicate the views on selling success expressed by the company."" In a statement, Purplebricks said: ""Purplebricks firmly refutes the criticism in the research note of its revenue recognition policy and stands behind both the fully audited results and the accounting policy itself."" It added that the estimated completion rate in the Jefferies research note was based on one month's data and did not cover deals that have yet to be included on the Land Registry. The company said its most recently published sales conversion rate was 78%, which it said ""more accurately reflects its sales performance"". Shares in Purplebricks fell 7% on Thursday, and dropped a further 3% on Friday to about 440p. However, this is still well above the valuation given in the Jefferies note, which said the true value of the shares was between 94-158p. Purplebricks, which operates in Australia as well as the UK and is moving into the US, has come in for criticism in the past. The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a number of complaints about its marketing.

""All these years later, people say to me how wonderful it was and how we love the show,"" says Jeffrey Holland, who played the camp's comedian Spike Dixon. ""You can't get 19 or 20 million viewers now. ""I meet young actors now who know me from the 1980s, and they are often thrilled to meet me for that reason, and that's so gratifying."" Hi-de-Hi! was Holland's big break, with the role of Spike written with him in mind. ""It was the first thing I ever did that made my face known,""  the actor says. ""Whatever else I've done since, or will in the future, I'll always be that bloke from Hi-de-Hi! and I wouldn't want it any other way."" Su Pollard and Jeffrey Holland as Peggy Ollerenshaw and Spike Dixon Set in the late 1950s and early 60s, Hi-de-Hi! followed the trials and tribulations of the camp's staff at a time when the popularity of domestic holidays was already in decline. Package holidays were increasingly luring campers abroad - in the final episode of the sitcom many of the staff at Maplins lose their jobs. In real life, the holiday camp where the outdoor scenes were filmed, Warner's in the small seaside town of Dovercourt in Essex, closed in the 1990s and has since been turned into a housing estate. Series star Su Pollard, who played chalet maid Peggy Ollerenshaw, recalls how spending time on location brought the group together. ""There weren't just two or three of us in it - there was a good dozen, and that instigated the family thing,"" she says. Warner's Holiday Camp hosted happy campers for decades until its closure in the 1990s Hi-de-Hi! - which won a Bafta in 1984 for Best Comedy Series - was based on writer Jimmy Perry's experience as aRedcoat at Butlins,externalin the 1950s. (He and co-writer David Croftcreated some of Britain's best-known sitcoms, including Dad's Army and It Ain't Half Hot Mum, while Croftwas also responsible for comedy classicssuch as Are You Being Served? and 'Allo 'Allo!) Hi-de-Hi! became known for its long-running comedy themes, such as the smouldering passion of Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) for the camp's uptight and rather innocent manager Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell), and Peggy's dreams of becoming a Yellowcoat. The popularity of the show led to a stage show, and at one stage there were even plans for a feature film. The programme's rock and roll theme tune Holiday Rock, which was composed by Perry, was released as a single by star Paul Shane - who played host Ted Bovis - and reached the UK top 40. Jimmy Perry (l) and David Croft received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards The show was typically filmed in September and October, when the cast would take up residence at The Cliff Hotel in Dovercourt, near Harwich. ""We used to move in on the last weekend in September, and the weather was always stunning,"" recalls Holland. ""We used to call it Croft weather - he was legendary with his luck when it came to the weather. He must have had a hotline to the man upstairs."" However, any luck ran out during the filming of the long-running show's final series. ""When we did the last week of filming in October 1987,the Great Storm happened during the nightbefore our last filming day,"" says 71-year-old Holland. ""We had one scene to shoot the following morning, which was to be shot around the pool. ""Fifty-eight poplar trees came down that night - the whole place was wrecked."" Hi-de-Hi! ran for nine series, starting in 1980 The actor recalls how one crew member had a lucky escape. ""When we filmed, lots of the electricians and crew stayed in chalets at the holiday camp. ""During the night, with the [wind] blowing, one of the sparks nipped out to use the loo and when he came back there was a tree clean through the middle of his chalet. ""If he'd been inside he would have been killed - the chalet came down like a matchbox."" Damage was done to the park during the Great Storm of October 1987, while the final series of Hi-de-Hi! was being filmed The Cliff Hotel's former manager John Wade remembers the cast gathering in the lobby as the storm rattled the windows - and that one of them was particularly shaken. ""The night of the hurricane, my night porter knocked and said: 'Ruth Madoc's a bit worried as her room is moving',"" he recalls. ""There were proper balconies outside and the support went through into the room, and it was moving outside in the wind. ""Of course it was moving the floor joists of the room, which gave the appearance of the whole room moving."" Hotel manager John Wade and Hi-de-Hi! star Su Pollard Those few weeks of each year when the cast and crew of Hi-De-Hi! would descend are remembered with fondness by residents. ""The number of times we sat in our back garden and [heard them] shout Hi-de-Hi! and Ho-de-Ho! in reply,"" recalls David Whittle, who lived 200 metres from the camp. ""And if they didn't get it right, they did it time and time again!"" The Cliff Hotel, which was home to many cast members during filming, is soon to be knocked down The BBC ghost spoof that duped a nation Victoria Wood: In her own words Ooh Betty! Frank's cliff stunt recalled Tamsin Lord, whose family lived in nearby Wix, remembers an encounter with the props department. ""My dad was outside the house, polishing his green Morris Traveller,"" she says. ""The prop guy passed by and requested to hire the car to take Gladys to the farm. Dad cleaned and smartened up the car so it shone. ""Gladys was going to a pig farm. The car came back covered in pig poo. We laughed until snot poured out our noses. Dad saw the funny side... having been well paid for the loan of the car."" Harwich and Dovercourt were once top holiday destinations Pollard says the reason the show ended up being made where it was was down to being rejected by the business that was the inspiration for Hi-de-Hi! ""They made thousands, Warner's Camp, because Butlins wouldn't have us,"" she says. ""They were trying to get away from the Hi-de-Hi! holiday camp image. But Warner's loved us and got Â£4,000 a week, I think, and it was out of season so great for them."" For Pollard, who is now 68, those heady 1980s days spent working on one of the country's most popular TV shows are, unsurprisingly, recalled with great affection. She describes how the cast would explore Harwich's culinary scene with Croft, who was something of a foodie - although the word was not in currency then - and, as his ""dealer"", supplying him with his sugar fix via his favourite Pontefract cakes. The cast and crew would often take over this Harwich restaurant, says Pollard There was also a tradition, Pollard says, for Croft to treat his stars to a ""tumbler of champagne"" to celebrate every 100th take they did. ""It all came off his budget, and they made sure we weren't filming later that day,"" she recalls. ""Champagne on the boss's orders!"" Looking back, Pollard and Holland are in agreement about the show's legacy. ""I've heard people in other shows trying to distance themselves from them as times gone by,"" Pollard says. ""But I would never want to deny I was in Hi-de-Hi! as I'm proud to have the feel-good feelings of having been in it. ""I wasn't just another show; it was such a big success."" Holland agrees. ""I don't understand people who turn their back on what made them,"" he says. ""I'll always be proud to have been in something that brought so much happiness.""

But the tabby has now been banned from the Southbourne Grove site for hygiene reasons,the Bournemouth Echo reported,external.

Why can't I pull on a sparkly dress?VideoVideoWhat it's like to be a Viking in 2018,"Former world champion Raymond van Barneveld is supporting the petition for the walk on girls' reinstatement A Scottish darts walk-on girl says she has never felt objectified in her job and is calling for a reversal of the governing body's decision to ban them. Lynsay Macdonald has been working on the Scottish darts circuit for six years. She has told critics not to judge her because she feels it is a privilege to work beside her sporting heroes. A Scottish promoter says he will keep using the women ""until he is told it's illegal"". Lynsay MacDonald, who lives in Glasgow, started at a local darts exhibition match and now works regularly on the Scottish darts exhibition circuit. She said she was ""disappointed"" when the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) announced last week that it would stop using young women to escort darts players at tournaments. The practice ended with the omission of the walk-on girls at the Masters tournament in Milton Keynes last weekend. Lynsay Macdonald was disappointed at the decision to ban walk-on girls from PDC events She told theBBC Scotland Kaye Adams Programmeshe supports the women who will now lose this part of their livelihood: ""These women do this job full time - that's how they make their bread and butter. ""It's all right for people like myself who also work full time. ""For me its a huge privilege to be part of an event like this and I've never once felt objectified in any way. ""So I see where they are coming from."" Lynsay thinks there is no harm in what she does, and she does it as much for the enjoyment of the game: ""Literally, all we do is escort the players to the oche, stand for a couple of minutes, smile, and then walk off. ""I see this job as a confidence boost for me, as well as getting to meet the players I enjoy watching on TV as a big fan."" Darts champion Michael van Gerwen supported the end of the practice She makes money, but that is not what it is all about: ""Yeah, I do well from it, it is extra pocket money for me I suppose. ""But I mainly do it because I enjoy the sport and I get to meet my sporting heroes so it's more a privilege than a financial gain."" Lynsay dismissed arguments from those who support the ban, that the practice of using good-looking women to ""glamorise"" a male-dominated sports event is outdated and sexist. She said: ""It's been 100 years since we've been granted the right to vote so that surely means that we have the right as women to choose what we want to do in life, say what we want. ""So, if we decide we want to put a sparkly dress on and smile, surely that can be seen as a good thing for women nowadays. We should be able to do what we want."" Former Olympian Susan Egelstaff joined the argument, saying the walk-on girls are unnecessary. She said that in 2018 people should not be celebrating girls who are there purely to be looked at. Susan Egelstaff wants women ""for decoration"" banned from all sports The Commonwealth Games bronze medallist would rather see women playing sport than ""decorating"" it: ""Thank goodness they got rid of walk-on girls,"" she said. ""I don't think anybody can argue that having walk-on girls that are basically told not to speak, not to do anything, just shut your mouth and look pretty, is a progressive kind of move. ""It says to young girls who are watching that the men are there to play sport and be successful and the girls are there just to look pretty and as decoration for the men and they are basically just there for men to ogle. ""The wider benefit of getting rid of walk-on girls is a bit more important than a few individuals maybe losing a bit of money."" Meanwhile, Scottish darts promoter David Hanson has revealed the walk-on girls might live on in Scotland. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He told Kaye Adams: ""It was a sad day for the sport - the walk-on girls are part of darts these days. ""These girls are very professional. It's a difficult thing to do, and only a very limited number of people could do it."" He said the first televised game without them had lost its appeal: ""Last week's game without them, there was something missing."" And that's why he is promising to keep up the tradition during all his live events. He said: ""These girls are looked after and do a great job.

The women who faced Nassar,"This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Former Olympic doctor Larry Nassar has been handed a jail sentence of 175 years in Michigan for abusing female athletes he was supposed to be treating. Here, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, who was in court, and Roland Hughes detail the extraordinary testimony given in court by the survivors of his abuse. This article contains graphic details of sexual abuse One hundred and fifty-six young women - mothers, sisters, daughters, Olympians. All say they were abused by the same man: former Team USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Over seven days, they took to the stand one by one to do what few survivors of sexual abuse ever get the chance to do - directly confront their attacker. Nassar had already pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault for abusing young girls under the guise of medical treatment. Women who filed criminal complaints against Nassar spoke out at his sentencing hearing in Lansing. But they were followed by close to 150 others, many of whom chose to do so without the anonymity to which they were entitled. Kyle Stephenswas the first to tell her story. For years she was known only as Victim ZA, but as she stood before Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, she calmly shared her name. In doing so, she waived her anonymity in public just as she was about to testify to the damage her abuser had done. ""I was ready to speak,"" Kyle said in an interview with the BBC after her testimony. ""I think it was really empowering to get up there and give my story from start to finish."" For decades, Larry Nassar abused young women. It was Kyle's call to police that led to him finally being arrested. Unlike many of the other women who shared their stories in this case, Kyle wasn't a gymnast and a patient of Nassar's. Her parents were friends with his family. As she stood in the small courtroom, photos of her as a smiling child were projected on to a screen. Nassar first abused her when she was six, ""when I still had not lost all my baby teeth"". Images of Kyle Stephens as a child were projected on to a screen in court It began with him exposing himself. Later, he would masturbate before her. Then, he physically abused her - all while both their families were in the same house. When Kyle, aged 12, told her parents that Nassar would rub his erect penis on her bare feet, he denied it. Back then, her parents did not believe her, and urged her to apologise to him. ""He forced me to grow up really fast,"" Kyle told the BBC after the hearing. ""It was such a benign action until you grow up and realise it was a vile thing."" Kyle Stephens addressed Nassar (foreground) in court Seven minutes into her testimony, delivered alongside her mother, Kyle looked up at Judge Rosemarie Aquilina and politely asked if she could address Nassar directly. She reminded him of how her parents invited him round to their home after she had accused him. Sitting in her living room, he had denied abusing her and had said that if she was ever really abused, she should remember to report it. ""Well Larry, I'm here,"" she told him in court. ""Not to tell someone, but to tell everyone. ""Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but little girls don't stay little forever. They grow into strong women who return to destroy your world."" In her teens, Kyle was asked to babysit Nassar's two daughters. Doing so helped her protect them, she told the court, and allowed her to save enough money to pay for counselling. Having reached a point where she had started to question whether the abuse had indeed occurred, she tried again to explain to her parents what had happened. This time, they believed her. Nassar, 54, graduated from the University of Michigan in 1985 and joined the medical staff of the US national gymnastics team based in Indianapolis a year later. In 1997, alongside his work with the national gym team, he began working as a team physician at Michigan State University (MSU). He began abusing Kyle Stephens a year later. He worked for the US gymnastics team in four Olympic Games, regularly rushing to the help of gymnasts who might have fallen awkwardly. Many of Nassar's victims cited the moment he helped injured gymnast Kerri Strug at the 1996 Olympics, a moment that boosted his reputation as a caring, well-respected doctor Carrie Hogan, a former softball player at MSU, told the court it was seen as a ""privilege"" to be treated by Nassar. Successful treatment could make a difference to the university's stars on the brink of a sports career. ""I was very aware of the signed photographs of the Olympic gymnasts he had treated,"" she said. ""He was the best of the best."" Others said he was seen as a ""god"" in the gymnastics world. In an episode of a gymnastics podcast broadcast in December 2013,Nassar spoke about how important it was to look after young athletes,external. ""Not just physically but mentally, you have to protect your athletes,"" he told GymCastic, speaking uncharacteristically slowly. ""You have to let them know they will be cared [for]."" He also warned of the danger of mental injury to athletes, saying ""the physical injuries almost always they can recover from. The mental injury leaves the scars that keep coming back and haunt them later."" Many of the women who spoke in court said that after he abused them, they were intimidated by his powerful status. Reporting the offence - if they understood that they had been subject to an offence at all - felt almost impossible. Nassar had a strikingly similar pattern of how he abused young women, the vast majority of whom were gymnasts. They came to him often in pain, looking for help. At their most vulnerable moment, he tried to convince them what he was doing was normal - even talking about everyday life and joking as he touched them. This video can not be played Former gymnast Jeanette Antolin: 'You made me believe you were my friend' By projecting a sense of normality from his position of authority, Nassar made his victims feel they were wrong to believe this was abuse, and that they would be in the wrong if they complained. ""I remember having the option of keeping my spandex on, which I was very grateful for and chose,"" saidJennifer Rood Bedford, a volleyball player at MSU between 2000 and 2003. ""He had me lay down face down on the medical table. When he started treatment, I remember him saying his treatment relied upon applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that this was normal. ""So when he went down there, I just told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's doing and don't be a baby. ""I remember laying there and thinking 'Is this OK? This doesn't seem right'."" Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast from Michigan, was the first victim to speak up publicly in 2016. She told the BBC that Nassar abused her during every visit she made to his clinic over a year after she turned 15. Nassar would position Rachael's mother at the head of the table so she was not able to see what he was doing. With one hand, he would carry out sports massage. With the other, covered by a towel, he would insert his fingers into Rachael's vagina or anus. In one of their last sessions, he unhooked her bra and fondled her breast - the only time Rachael said she knew she was definitely being assaulted and not treated. This video can not be played Nassar reacts as former gymnast Gwen Anderson testifies Many of the women said their trust in male relatives, partners, doctors, strangers, friends and teachers was destroyed as a result of Nassar's actions. ""My first reaction was to question myself, to blame myself,"" said Jennifer Rood Bedford. ""I wanted to believe the best in people, but no matter how much I rationalised - he's a doctor, he's treating you, he didn't mean for that to happen - I couldn't shake the voice in my head that something wasn't right.""

If you are in the UK, you can find links here:BBC Action Line If you are in the US,you can contact Rainn, the national sexual abuse hotline, here,external, or by calling 800.656.HOPE ForGwen Anderson, a former gymnast who competed for her state of Michigan, the abuse began when she was just 12. Now, as a teacher to girls of the same age, she says she sees Nassar's actions in an even starker light. ""I teach 12, 13, 14-year-olds every day,"" she told the court. ""And every single day, when I look at them, I am faced with the reality of how young and defenceless we were when you molested us. ""I look at them every single day and I think to myself 'I am their safe place. I am their protector. I am their encouragement. I am their motivator. I am their rock'."" It is unclear when and how Nassar's abuse of his patients started, though the first allegations date to 1994. In August 2016,the Indianapolis Star published a story detailing allegations of sexual abuse,externalcommitted by coaches working for USA Gymnastics. It claimed that the sporting body did not report allegations of abuse to relevant authorities. The initial article did not name Nassar. But after it was published, Rachael Denhollander realised this was her chance to speak up. The newspaper published allegations against him,externalfrom two named former gymnasts, including Rachael, a month later. ""I knew this was how it was going to have to be done,"" she told the BBC outside court. ""When you have a predator who is surrounded by two very powerful institutions, one anonymous voice is never going to be enough. ""When you have a predator who is manipulative, gregarious and as engaging as Larry is, you have to be willing to meet him where he is the most comfortable - on very public ground. And never flinch."" This video can not be played Gold medallists Raisman and Wieber face their abuser Rachael's bravery helped encourage other women to come forward. In the corridors outside the sentencing hearing, countless women cited Rachael's actions as inspiration for their own decision to speak up. As a result, instead of 90 survivors sharing their stories of abuse over four days - as had been expected at the start of the hearing - 156 women and girls ended up doing so over seven days. The feeling in the courtroom throughout was one of collective empowerment and solidarity built through a shared experience of horror. Four-time Rio Olympic championSimone Bilesissued a statement to say she too had been abused by Nassar. Then, Olympic gold medallistsAly Raisman and Jordyn Wiebercame to court to detail what he did to them during the 2012 Games in London. Nassar was eventually arrested on 21 November, 2016. He was sentenced to 60 years in jaila year later for three counts relating to child sex abuse images on his computer. He then pleaded guilty to molesting females at his home, at a gymnastics club and in his MSU office, a plea that led to the 156 pre-sentence testimonies. ""I realise what I am feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotional disturbance that I have wreaked,"" Nassar told the survivors as the hearings drew to a close. ""There are no words that can describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred. ""I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days."" At the start of the hearings, Nassar had stared blankly down at his hands, avoiding eye contact with all those who came forward to speak. His former colleague, gym coach Tom Brennan, stood alongside Gwen Anderson while she was testifying. ""Look at her,"" he yelled at the man he called his former mentor, ordering him to pay attention to the women as they testified. After that, Nassar appeared to look up and listen to the survivors with greater frequency. The question of how repentant he was remained unanswered at the end of the hearings, however: Judge Aquilina read excerpts of a letter he sent her, saying he was a good doctor, and that the media had convinced the young women to believe he had acted wrongly. This video can not be played Judge Aquilina: 'I have just signed your death warrant' Judge Aquilina's role in this case was crucial. Almost every testimony began with survivors thanking her for her support and encouragement. Given that Nassar had admitted his guilt months before, Judge Aquilina had no obligation to be impartial. As she took on the role of therapist, advocate and friend to the women who stood before her, she condemned his actions. ""The monster who took advantage of you is going to wither, much like the scene in the 'Wizard of Oz' where the water gets poured on the witch and the witch withers away,"" she told one woman after her testimony. She also encouraged a number of the abuse survivors not to kill themselves when they said they had considered suicide - taking their own lives would hand Nassar victory, she said. ""I know you're a little nervous, pretend you're talking to me and your mum,"" she told another woman as she prepared to deliver her testimony. Who is Judge Aquilina? A crime writer in her spare time, Judge Aquilina's words were a powerful force throughout the hearing. She described the women as ""sister survivors"" and ""warriors"" who had demonstrated ""superwoman steel."" ""I didn't want even one victim to lose their voice,"" she told the court, as she explained why she was prepared to let the hearing go on for as long as it took to hear all of the survivors who wanted to speak. The survivors, in turn, responded. One after the other waived their anonymity and came to realise this was a chance to take charge of their own story. This video can not be played Tiffany Thomas Lopez: ""You created an army when you violated us"" Not all the women knew each other, but many acknowledged the invisible bond between them, and the strength they had gained from the others who had spoken in court. One former MSU softball player,Tiffany Thomas Lopez, told Nassar she was part of ""the army you created when you violated us"", going on to say: ""Your actions have had me by the throat for years. I'm ready to be released from your clench."" As the hearings went on past the four days that were initially scheduled, anger gradually built towards the institutions where Nassar worked. Aly Raisman, part of the gold medal-winning gymnastics team in the 2012 Olympics, demanded an independent investigation into how Nassar was allowed to continue abusing girls even after complaints were made. She attacked both USA Gymnastics - an organisation she said was ""rotting from the inside"" - and the US Olympic Committee for their lack of support. Three senior USA Gymnastics board members subsequently quit. The focus has now shifted on to who knew what, and when. Rachael Denhollander, ""the five-star general in the army of survivors"" The Lansing State Journal newspaper reports that seven women or girls made complaints about Nassar to coaches, trainers, police or university officials between 1997 and 2015. In 2014, an investigation by MSU even cleared Nassar of wrongdoing after a recent graduate accused him of molesting her. Two years later, he was under arrest. The university has put aside $10m (Â£7.2m) to reimburse former students for counselling, but is being sued by about 140 women. MSU President Lou Anna Simon has also quit. Meanwhile, MSU's board of trustees asked the Michigan attorney general's office to conduct an outside review into how it handled the allegations. As Nassar starts his jail sentence - brought about by a team of female investigators, prosecutors and judges - the battle to seek answers from the authorities is only just starting. Why did they not listen to survivors' stories sooner? Rachael Denhollander, now a mother of three and a lawyer, was the last to give her testimony. Judge Aquilina called her ""the five-star general in the army of survivors"". For Rachael, the sentence has been a vindication of her decision to speak out publicly 16 months ago. ""I'm so deeply grateful for where we are,"" she told the BBC. ""But it's absolutely heartbreaking to me. ""To know that the vast majority of those little girls could have been saved from what they went through is devastating.""

Trump attacks FBI amid row over memoThe US president says leaders at the FBI and Justice Department have politicised investigations.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation US President Donald Trump has accused top officials of politicising FBI and justice department investigations to damage his Republican party. Later on Friday, he is expected to approve the release of a memo that is thought to suggest the FBI abused its powers to spy on one of his aides. Controversy over the memo has railed for days in US politics and the two main parties are divided on it. Democrats say the document is aimed at derailing investigations into Mr Trump. They portray the memo, commissioned by the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, as an attempt to undermine a federal inquiry into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election campaign. However, another top Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, played down the potential impact of the memo's publication on the inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He said Congress had a duty to see surveillance powers were used correctly. Meet the cast in the drama to end all dramas Political time bomb or rumour mill? Mr Trump tweeted,external: ""The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans."" The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, was nominated to the post by Mr Trump after the president dismissed his predecessor, James Comey. Last week the agency's deputy director, Andrew McCabe, resigned. Mr Trump had repeatedly accused him of political bias but the White House said the president was not involved in the decision. Approved by the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, the document reportedly accuses the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and justice department of misleading a judge in March of last year while seeking to extend a surveillance warrant against Carter Page. The memo is said to argue the FBI and justice department did not tell the judge that some of their justification for the warrant relied on a much-disputed Trump dossier. Compiled by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, that dossier was financed in part through the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. Unnamed sources told Reuters news agency the Republican memo was misleading because all the dossier excerpts used in the FBI warrant application were independently confirmed by US intelligence. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Carter Page, 46, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, visited Russia several times in 2016.He adamantly denies allegations in the Trump dossier that he served as an intermediarybetween Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Devin Nunes, 44, has long been pursuing President Trump's claims that he was put under surveillance by the Obama administration - so much so thatthe congressman was dubbed ""Inspector Clouseau"" by a fellow Republican,external, Sen Lindsey Graham, in March. Rod Rosenstein, 53, was appointed deputy attorney general last April.He is said by the New York Times to have been involved at various points in authorising applications for the surveillance,external.President Trump questioned his loyalties,externalin December, CNN reports. House Speaker Ryan denied the memo was an indictment of the FBI and justice department. ""It does not impugn the Mueller investigation, or the deputy attorney general,"" he added. He said it was job of his chamber to ""conduct oversight over the executive branch if abuses were made"". Another House Republican who read the memo, Jeff Duncan, predicted it would shake the FBI ""down to its core"". It would, he tweeted, show ""Americans just how the agency was weaponized"" by the Obama administration and Democrats to ""target political adversaries"". Allow Twitter content?

Several Republican lawmakers are opposed to releasing the memo. John Thune, who is the party's number three in the Senate, said FBI objections should be heeded. Senators Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins also voiced unease. Senator Jeff Flake teamed up with a Democrat, Chris Coons, to issued a joint statement. It said releasing the memo ""risks undermining US intelligence-gathering efforts, politicizing Congress' oversight role and eroding confidence in our institutions of government"". Congressional Democratic leaders called on Thursday for Mr Nunes' immediate removal as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff accused Republicans of having amended the memo after it was approved. However, an unnamed Republican aide said the amendments were grammatical changes and ""minor edits"", including two tweaks requested by the FBI and by Democrats. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words It has voiced ""grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". The justice department, which oversees the FBI, has warned the memo's release could jeopardise intelligence-gathering and damage trust between the agency and lawmakers. Pressure has mounted on the FBI, which is the subject of a forthcoming inspector general report. Its deputy director, Andrew McCabe, resigned on Tuesday. He had been repeatedly accused of political bias by President Trump. James Comey, who led the FBI at the time of the 2016 election and who was sacked by the new president, suggested the agency was being subjected to a witch hunt by ""weasels and liars"". While President Trump is expected to approve the memo's release, the exact method for publishing it is ""still being figured out"", the Associated Press news agency reports. As president, Mr Trump has the power to declassify the document himself and either release it or hand it to Congress to release.

New regimental goat evades Army captureIt was hoped a successor to Shenkin III would be caught - but he evades Royal Welsh soldiers.5m6 minutes agoWales,"This video can not be played The Great Orme goat evaded Army capture for eight hours Stealthy, fleet of foot and elusive - The Royal Welsh's newest recruit is everything a battalion could want. Unfortunately, the kid in question is Shenkin IV - a wild goat on the Great Orme in Conwy county who the Army hoped to dart and capture to be the 3rd battalion's newest mascot. After eight fruitless hours, the search was called off on Friday afternoon and will resume near Llandudno next week. A new goat is needed afterShenkin III died in September, aged seven. An Army team, accompanied by an RSPCA vet, was deployed to select the successor before the new Shenkin could be taken to Maindy Barracks in Cardiff to begin his training. But after unsuccessfully pursuing the Kashmiri from the royal herd across the hills, they had to call off the search when it began to get dark. Bureaucats: Felines with official positions Indonesian army destroys ridiculed tiger statue Half-eel, half-aeroplane named Japan's best mascot So near, yet so far - the chosen successor to Shenkin III proved too quick to catch Camouflage was not enough to stop Shenkin spotting his potential would-be captors The regiment's Goat Major, Sgt Mark Jackson, said: ""He's a cheeky looking chap - when I was calling him, he was looking directly at me. He's got a lovely quiff of hair on top of his horns - he's the one we want."" Once Shenkin IV has been caught, Sgt Jackson will be responsible for introducing him to new sights and sounds - including a trip to Baglan RFC and walks around Cardiff city centre - so he is placid and well-disciplined around people when it is time to clip clop into the spotlight. Shenkin IV will hold the rank of fusilier and it is hoped his first public appearance will be at National Armed Forces Day in Llandudno on 30 June. Presuming they can catch him by then. Strike a pose: Shenkin shows he is not camera shy at an event at Cardiff Castle in March 2000 The National Army Museum said The Royal Welsh and its predecessor units have adopted goats as mascots since the 1770s It stems from the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American War of Independence when a wild goat is said to have strayed into the battle and led the Royal Welsh Fusiliers' colour party from the field Another story said a young Welsh soldier found a kid goat during the Crimean War and kept him as a pet. While on sentry duty one night, he tucked the goat inside his coat to keep warm and fell asleep, but was alerted to the enemy's advance when the goat bleated, giving him time to tell his fellow soldiers who were then able to repel the Russian attack In 1884, Queen Victoria presented the regiment with a Kashmir goat from the royal herd, starting the tradition that continues to this day All Royal Welsh goats hold a rank within the regiment A wild goat chase for new Army recruit.

Call for straight couple civil partnerships,"Tim Loughton MP says civil partnerships for all is a matter of fairness A Tory MP has launched a bid to allow heterosexual couples in England and Wales to form civil partnerships in the same way as gay couples. Tim Loughton said it was ""not fair"" that opposite sex couples have ""the single option of marriage"". He also called for mothers' names to be included on marriage certificates and for all still births to be formally registered. The government is backing Mr Loughton's Private Members Bill. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was time both parents' names were included on marriage certificates. ""The current legislation which only allows for fathers' names is completely outdated and does not reflect modern Britain,"" she said. Are civil partnerships under threat? 'Why we want a civil partnership' The Home Office says it has been considering options for updating the marriage entry and working with stakeholders, including the Church of England and Church in Wales, to develop plans for this possible reform. But Mr Loughton has been forced to water down his proposals on civil partnerships - to promise a review of the current laws rather than a straightforward commitment to allow straight couples to form civil partnerships. This could result in equality being achieved by scrapping civil partnerships for everyone. But Mr Loughton is confident ministers will be persuaded to back his position after they have carried out their review. He said his Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which received an unopposed second reading, would ""correct an unintended, but glaring inequality"". Civil partnerships in England and Wales were introduced in 2004 as an initial step on the road to legalising gay marriage. Demand then fell after gay marriage was legalised in England and Wales in March 2014, and in Scotland in December 2014. But some straight couples who do not want a traditional marriage have argued there is now inequality in the law as they do not have the choice of a civil partnership. Legal and financial protection for both parties in the event of the relationship ending It is free of the religious connotations of marriage Some object to marriage as an institution and its associations with property and patriarchy Mr Loughton argued that offering opposite sex couples the chance to form a civil partnership could improve family stability and give partners legal protection if either one of them dies. Civil partnership ruling faces challenge 'Keep sex abuse dad's name off my wedding certificate' He said there are 3.2 million cohabiting opposite sex couples in England and Wales, but many shun traditional marriage because they view it as having establishment, religious and patriarchal connotations, as well as being ""rather expensive"". Many family law solicitors have written to the MP in support of his campaign ""because they see the fall out"" when partnerships breakdown. ""We need to find new ways for the state to recognise committed relationships and give children stability,"" he said, adding that all that would be required to rectify the situation would be a one line amendment to the 2004 bill. There were just over a thousand civil partnerships formed in the UK in 2015, according to House of Commons library research. By contrast, between 29 March 2014 and 30 June 2015, there were 7,366 marriages formed between same sex couples in England and Wales. But Mr Loughton said the ""conversion rate"" of gay people in civil partnerships opting to get married was thought to be about 14%. Conservative MP Edward Leigh asked if co-habiting sisters could also be covered by the proposed legislation - but Mr Loughton rejected the call, saying it would make the measure ""even more complicated"". Labour shadow minister Karen Lee said her party fully supported Mr Loughton's bill, but argued that scrapping civil partnerships would be a ""step backwards"" for those that do not want to marry. Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan lost their case for heterosexual civil partnerships in the Court of Appeal in February 2017 The UK government has previously said it did not intend to consult further on the future of civil partnerships or to change the law after two reviews, but Mr Loughton's bill is set to herald a fresh look at the issue. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are proud that we introduced marriage for same-sex couples and that they are finally able to celebrate their relationship in the way other couples have done for centuries. ""It is right that we evaluate the demand for civil partnerships before we make changes to the law. ""We continue to keep this under review and are assessing the demand for civil partnerships amongst both same-sex and opposite sex couples."" The issue made the headlines when a heterosexual couple who want to enter a civil partnership instead of getting married were granted the right to take their case to the Supreme Court, which is due to make a ruling on it mid-May. Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, from west London, argue the government's position is ""incompatible with equality law"" and there is still ""everything to fight for"".

Victim's dad lunges at disgraced Olympic doctor,"This video can not be played Victims' father attacks Larry Nassar in courtroom A father whose three daughters were abused by disgraced US gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar has tried to attack him in a Michigan courtroom. Randall Margraves had to be restrained by three court security officers. Before rushing to the table where Nassar was sitting, the man had asked to have ""five minutes in a locked room with that demon"". Judge Janice Cunningham said she could not allow that. Mr Margraves then asked the judge for just one minute, to awkward laughter from the courtroom. USA Gymnastics doctor 'abused 265 girls' Michigan police apologise to Nassar victim The 156 women who confronted a predator The judge repeated her refusal - and shouts and gasps were heard as the furious father bolted towards Nassar, who was present in an orange prison jumpsuit. Court security staff try to shield Larry Nassar Mr Margraves was tackled by three guards The dramatic intervention brought Nassar's final sentencing hearing on sexual abuse charges to an abrupt halt. ""I want that son of a bitch!"" Mr Margraves shouted as he was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed. ""What if this happened to you guys?"" he demanded of the officers who escorted him from the courtroom. Two of the Margraves daughters, Madison and Lauren, had just testified about their abuse at the hands of the doctor. The incident came as dozens of young women waited for their turn to face Nassar in court. Mr Margraves later came back to the courtroom to apologise for his actions, and was told he would not face charges. Madison Rae Margraves gives her victim impact statement, alongside her parents and sister Lauren Nassar, a former US Olympic gymnastics team doctor, was sentenced to up to 175 years in prisona week ago after testimony from nearly 160 of his victims. In handing down that sentence, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar: ""Sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again."" The 54-year-old was already serving 60 years in prison for possession of child sex abuse images. Gymnasts and Olympic gold medallists Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber were among those the doctor molested. Other victims were taken to be treated by him at Michigan State University (MSU), where he worked as a sports doctor between 1997 and 2016. This video can not be played Defence lawyer Shannon Smith explains what it was like to represent Larry Nassar The entire board of directors for USA Gymnastics agreed to resign in the wake of Nassar's earlier sentencing on 24 January. The president and athletic director of MSU also stood down. Nassar's Michigan university faces probe University head quits in gymnast abuse row At his current sentencing hearing this week, Judge Cunningham said the number of known victims had grown to 265. On Thursday, Michigan police offered a public apology to a woman whose complaint against the child abuser was ignored in 2004. Brianne Randall-Gay was 17 years old when she reported Nassar, but police closed the case after he said he was using a medical technique. Despite the disruption, Friday's sentencing hearing continued after a short break. Judge Janice Cunningham called the situation ""scary"", but added: ""I recognise that Mr Margraves had three daughters that he has had to watch go through the pain and the hurt. I can't imagine what it is like for a parent."" The distraught father was later brought before the judge in handcuffs, and apologised to everyone in the courtroom, saying he was ""embarrassed"". ""I'm not here to upstage my daughters, I'm here to help them heal,"" he said. Randall Margraves apologised for his outburst, a lawyer by his side He explained that he had not known in advance what his children were going to say. ""I got to hear that, and I got to see Larry Nassar over here shaking his head 'no,' like it didn't happen,"" Mr Margraves said. The judge accepted his apology, and confirmed he will not face contempt of court charges. ""There is no way that this court is going to issue any type of punishment, given the circumstances of this case,"" Judge Cunningham said.

The 156 women who confronted a predator,"This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Former Olympic doctor Larry Nassar has been handed a jail sentence of 175 years in Michigan for abusing female athletes he was supposed to be treating. Here, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, who was in court, and Roland Hughes detail the extraordinary testimony given in court by the survivors of his abuse. This article contains graphic details of sexual abuse One hundred and fifty-six young women - mothers, sisters, daughters, Olympians. All say they were abused by the same man: former Team USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Over seven days, they took to the stand one by one to do what few survivors of sexual abuse ever get the chance to do - directly confront their attacker. Nassar had already pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault for abusing young girls under the guise of medical treatment. Women who filed criminal complaints against Nassar spoke out at his sentencing hearing in Lansing. But they were followed by close to 150 others, many of whom chose to do so without the anonymity to which they were entitled. Kyle Stephenswas the first to tell her story. For years she was known only as Victim ZA, but as she stood before Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, she calmly shared her name. In doing so, she waived her anonymity in public just as she was about to testify to the damage her abuser had done. ""I was ready to speak,"" Kyle said in an interview with the BBC after her testimony. ""I think it was really empowering to get up there and give my story from start to finish."" For decades, Larry Nassar abused young women. It was Kyle's call to police that led to him finally being arrested. Unlike many of the other women who shared their stories in this case, Kyle wasn't a gymnast and a patient of Nassar's. Her parents were friends with his family. As she stood in the small courtroom, photos of her as a smiling child were projected on to a screen. Nassar first abused her when she was six, ""when I still had not lost all my baby teeth"". Images of Kyle Stephens as a child were projected on to a screen in court It began with him exposing himself. Later, he would masturbate before her. Then, he physically abused her - all while both their families were in the same house. When Kyle, aged 12, told her parents that Nassar would rub his erect penis on her bare feet, he denied it. Back then, her parents did not believe her, and urged her to apologise to him. ""He forced me to grow up really fast,"" Kyle told the BBC after the hearing. ""It was such a benign action until you grow up and realise it was a vile thing."" Kyle Stephens addressed Nassar (foreground) in court Seven minutes into her testimony, delivered alongside her mother, Kyle looked up at Judge Rosemarie Aquilina and politely asked if she could address Nassar directly. She reminded him of how her parents invited him round to their home after she had accused him. Sitting in her living room, he had denied abusing her and had said that if she was ever really abused, she should remember to report it. ""Well Larry, I'm here,"" she told him in court. ""Not to tell someone, but to tell everyone. ""Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but little girls don't stay little forever. They grow into strong women who return to destroy your world."" In her teens, Kyle was asked to babysit Nassar's two daughters. Doing so helped her protect them, she told the court, and allowed her to save enough money to pay for counselling. Having reached a point where she had started to question whether the abuse had indeed occurred, she tried again to explain to her parents what had happened. This time, they believed her. Nassar, 54, graduated from the University of Michigan in 1985 and joined the medical staff of the US national gymnastics team based in Indianapolis a year later. In 1997, alongside his work with the national gym team, he began working as a team physician at Michigan State University (MSU). He began abusing Kyle Stephens a year later. He worked for the US gymnastics team in four Olympic Games, regularly rushing to the help of gymnasts who might have fallen awkwardly. Many of Nassar's victims cited the moment he helped injured gymnast Kerri Strug at the 1996 Olympics, a moment that boosted his reputation as a caring, well-respected doctor Carrie Hogan, a former softball player at MSU, told the court it was seen as a ""privilege"" to be treated by Nassar. Successful treatment could make a difference to the university's stars on the brink of a sports career. ""I was very aware of the signed photographs of the Olympic gymnasts he had treated,"" she said. ""He was the best of the best."" Others said he was seen as a ""god"" in the gymnastics world. In an episode of a gymnastics podcast broadcast in December 2013,Nassar spoke about how important it was to look after young athletes,external. ""Not just physically but mentally, you have to protect your athletes,"" he told GymCastic, speaking uncharacteristically slowly. ""You have to let them know they will be cared [for]."" He also warned of the danger of mental injury to athletes, saying ""the physical injuries almost always they can recover from. The mental injury leaves the scars that keep coming back and haunt them later."" Many of the women who spoke in court said that after he abused them, they were intimidated by his powerful status. Reporting the offence - if they understood that they had been subject to an offence at all - felt almost impossible. Nassar had a strikingly similar pattern of how he abused young women, the vast majority of whom were gymnasts. They came to him often in pain, looking for help. At their most vulnerable moment, he tried to convince them what he was doing was normal - even talking about everyday life and joking as he touched them. This video can not be played Former gymnast Jeanette Antolin: 'You made me believe you were my friend' By projecting a sense of normality from his position of authority, Nassar made his victims feel they were wrong to believe this was abuse, and that they would be in the wrong if they complained. ""I remember having the option of keeping my spandex on, which I was very grateful for and chose,"" saidJennifer Rood Bedford, a volleyball player at MSU between 2000 and 2003. ""He had me lay down face down on the medical table. When he started treatment, I remember him saying his treatment relied upon applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that this was normal. ""So when he went down there, I just told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's doing and don't be a baby. ""I remember laying there and thinking 'Is this OK? This doesn't seem right'."" Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast from Michigan, was the first victim to speak up publicly in 2016. She told the BBC that Nassar abused her during every visit she made to his clinic over a year after she turned 15. Nassar would position Rachael's mother at the head of the table so she was not able to see what he was doing. With one hand, he would carry out sports massage. With the other, covered by a towel, he would insert his fingers into Rachael's vagina or anus. In one of their last sessions, he unhooked her bra and fondled her breast - the only time Rachael said she knew she was definitely being assaulted and not treated. This video can not be played Nassar reacts as former gymnast Gwen Anderson testifies Many of the women said their trust in male relatives, partners, doctors, strangers, friends and teachers was destroyed as a result of Nassar's actions. ""My first reaction was to question myself, to blame myself,"" said Jennifer Rood Bedford. ""I wanted to believe the best in people, but no matter how much I rationalised - he's a doctor, he's treating you, he didn't mean for that to happen - I couldn't shake the voice in my head that something wasn't right.""

Now, as a teacher to girls of the same age, she says she sees Nassar's actions in an even starker light. ""I teach 12, 13, 14-year-olds every day,"" she told the court. ""And every single day, when I look at them, I am faced with the reality of how young and defenceless we were when you molested us. ""I look at them every single day and I think to myself 'I am their safe place. I am their protector. I am their encouragement. I am their motivator. I am their rock'."" It is unclear when and how Nassar's abuse of his patients started, though the first allegations date to 1994. In August 2016,the Indianapolis Star published a story detailing allegations of sexual abuse,externalcommitted by coaches working for USA Gymnastics. It claimed that the sporting body did not report allegations of abuse to relevant authorities. The initial article did not name Nassar. But after it was published, Rachael Denhollander realised this was her chance to speak up. The newspaper published allegations against him,externalfrom two named former gymnasts, including Rachael, a month later. ""I knew this was how it was going to have to be done,"" she told the BBC outside court. ""When you have a predator who is surrounded by two very powerful institutions, one anonymous voice is never going to be enough. ""When you have a predator who is manipulative, gregarious and as engaging as Larry is, you have to be willing to meet him where he is the most comfortable - on very public ground. And never flinch."" This video can not be played Gold medallists Raisman and Wieber face their abuser Rachael's bravery helped encourage other women to come forward. In the corridors outside the sentencing hearing, countless women cited Rachael's actions as inspiration for their own decision to speak up. As a result, instead of 90 survivors sharing their stories of abuse over four days - as had been expected at the start of the hearing - 156 women and girls ended up doing so over seven days. The feeling in the courtroom throughout was one of collective empowerment and solidarity built through a shared experience of horror. Four-time Rio Olympic championSimone Bilesissued a statement to say she too had been abused by Nassar. Then, Olympic gold medallistsAly Raisman and Jordyn Wiebercame to court to detail what he did to them during the 2012 Games in London. Nassar was eventually arrested on 21 November, 2016. He was sentenced to 60 years in jaila year later for three counts relating to child sex abuse images on his computer. He then pleaded guilty to molesting females at his home, at a gymnastics club and in his MSU office, a plea that led to the 156 pre-sentence testimonies. ""I realise what I am feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotional disturbance that I have wreaked,"" Nassar told the survivors as the hearings drew to a close. ""There are no words that can describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred. ""I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days."" At the start of the hearings, Nassar had stared blankly down at his hands, avoiding eye contact with all those who came forward to speak. His former colleague, gym coach Tom Brennan, stood alongside Gwen Anderson while she was testifying. ""Look at her,"" he yelled at the man he called his former mentor, ordering him to pay attention to the women as they testified. After that, Nassar appeared to look up and listen to the survivors with greater frequency. The question of how repentant he was remained unanswered at the end of the hearings, however: Judge Aquilina read excerpts of a letter he sent her, saying he was a good doctor, and that the media had convinced the young women to believe he had acted wrongly. This video can not be played Judge Aquilina: 'I have just signed your death warrant' Judge Aquilina's role in this case was crucial. Almost every testimony began with survivors thanking her for her support and encouragement. Given that Nassar had admitted his guilt months before, Judge Aquilina had no obligation to be impartial. As she took on the role of therapist, advocate and friend to the women who stood before her, she condemned his actions. ""The monster who took advantage of you is going to wither, much like the scene in the 'Wizard of Oz' where the water gets poured on the witch and the witch withers away,"" she told one woman after her testimony. She also encouraged a number of the abuse survivors not to kill themselves when they said they had considered suicide - taking their own lives would hand Nassar victory, she said. ""I know you're a little nervous, pretend you're talking to me and your mum,"" she told another woman as she prepared to deliver her testimony. Who is Judge Aquilina? A crime writer in her spare time, Judge Aquilina's words were a powerful force throughout the hearing. She described the women as ""sister survivors"" and ""warriors"" who had demonstrated ""superwoman steel."" ""I didn't want even one victim to lose their voice,"" she told the court, as she explained why she was prepared to let the hearing go on for as long as it took to hear all of the survivors who wanted to speak. The survivors, in turn, responded. One after the other waived their anonymity and came to realise this was a chance to take charge of their own story. This video can not be played Tiffany Thomas Lopez: ""You created an army when you violated us"" Not all the women knew each other, but many acknowledged the invisible bond between them, and the strength they had gained from the others who had spoken in court. One former MSU softball player,Tiffany Thomas Lopez, told Nassar she was part of ""the army you created when you violated us"", going on to say: ""Your actions have had me by the throat for years. I'm ready to be released from your clench."" As the hearings went on past the four days that were initially scheduled, anger gradually built towards the institutions where Nassar worked. Aly Raisman, part of the gold medal-winning gymnastics team in the 2012 Olympics, demanded an independent investigation into how Nassar was allowed to continue abusing girls even after complaints were made. She attacked both USA Gymnastics - an organisation she said was ""rotting from the inside"" - and the US Olympic Committee for their lack of support. Three senior USA Gymnastics board members subsequently quit. The focus has now shifted on to who knew what, and when. Rachael Denhollander, ""the five-star general in the army of survivors"" The Lansing State Journal newspaper reports that seven women or girls made complaints about Nassar to coaches, trainers, police or university officials between 1997 and 2015. In 2014, an investigation by MSU even cleared Nassar of wrongdoing after a recent graduate accused him of molesting her. Two years later, he was under arrest. The university has put aside $10m (Â£7.2m) to reimburse former students for counselling, but is being sued by about 140 women. MSU President Lou Anna Simon has also quit. Meanwhile, MSU's board of trustees asked the Michigan attorney general's office to conduct an outside review into how it handled the allegations. As Nassar starts his jail sentence - brought about by a team of female investigators, prosecutors and judges - the battle to seek answers from the authorities is only just starting. Why did they not listen to survivors' stories sooner? Rachael Denhollander, now a mother of three and a lawyer, was the last to give her testimony. Judge Aquilina called her ""the five-star general in the army of survivors"". For Rachael, the sentence has been a vindication of her decision to speak out publicly 16 months ago. ""I'm so deeply grateful for where we are,"" she told the BBC. ""But it's absolutely heartbreaking to me. ""To know that the vast majority of those little girls could have been saved from what they went through is devastating.""

Ninety migrants feared drowned off Libya,"The EU has tried to reduce migrant numbers with a highly criticised deal with the Libyan coastguard Ninety migrants are feared drowned after a boat capsized off the Libyan coast, says the UN's migration agency. Three survivors said most of those who drowned were Pakistani nationals. Libyans were also aboard. Libya has for years been a major transit route for migrants trying to reach southern Europe by sea. EU countries have wrangled over both reducing migrant numbers and deciding which countries are responsible for processing migrants on arrival. The EU struck a deal with the Libyan coastguard last year to help intercept migrants and return them to Libya. But aid agencies andthe UN accused European governments of taking an ""inhuman"" approach. EU governments 'complicit in migrant torture in Libya' 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre This video can not be played Inside a Libyan migrant detention camp From a boat carrying more than 90, only three survivors are reported - two of whom managed to swim to shore, while the third was picked up by a fishing boat. ""Ten bodies are reported to have washed up on Libyan shores,"" the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said,externalin a statement. Unusually, there were also Libyans among the dead and survivors of the shipwreck, reports the BBC's North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad. The Facebook page of the security directorate in the coastal city of Zuwara, where the bodies washed up, said a Libyan woman had drowned, but that of the three survivors two were Libyan nationals. The majority of incidents of this kind involve migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. In this case, most of those on board were Pakistani. The IOM says this is becoming more common. While Pakistanis were 13th on a list of the number of migrants trying to reach Europe last year by nationality, so far this year they are third, the IOM says. Perhaps aware of the danger, Libyans rarely attempt the boat journey from their country to southern Europe. Some cases of illegal Libyan migration were documented last year, but they usually involved sturdier boats that were carrying few people. Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent Although it is not the first time Libyans have attempted this crossing, this is a rising development that European countries will likely be watching with concern. The EU's entire strategy to curb illegal migration from Libya onto its southern shores is built on refugees and asylum seekers from countries like Syria, Eritrea and Sudan, as well as the broader swathe of sub-Saharan African countries which generate the most economic migrants. It's largely been about border controls in the south, as well as getting the Libyan coastguard to intercept more migrants so they can be ""voluntarily repatriated"" to their countries of origin. As the uncertainties over the country's future as a functioning state continue to mount, Libyans are getting increasingly desperate. I've been told by a UN special rapporteur for human rights that some of the country's internally displaced people have recently been expressing a desire to make the illegal journey to Italy. Overall this year, the IOM reports that there have been 6,624 arrivals by sea to Europe, compared to 5,983 in the same period of 2017. So the numbers are comparable but this year's figures still represent a considerable bounce-back following a dramatic fall over the second half of 2017, the IOM told the BBC. Some of last year's decline can be attributed to the EU's controversial deal with the Libyan coastguard, but the IOM also believes there were difficulties within the people-trafficking industry. ""We think that there was a lot of pent-up demand in terms of migrants being held in warehouses by the smugglers,"" said the IOM's Joel Millman. If the channels have been opened again, that might explain the sudden surge which has seen numbers increase again. The latest deaths come just after the EU border agency Frontex announced the launch of Operation Themis on Thursday. Unlike its previous mission, known as Triton, migrants rescued at sea will now be taken to the country that is co-ordinating the rescue, rather than just Italy. Italy has increasingly vocally complained about a lack of EU solidarity in managing migration. It is also conscious of popular unease ahead of a 4 March national election. However, as Italy undertakes the vast majority of sea rescues in waters between North Africa and its coast, Themis is unlikely to have more than a token effect on the numbers arriving in the country.

Prostate cancer deaths overtake breast cancer,"This video can not be played 'I didn't want to be a statistic' The number of men dying from prostate cancer has overtaken female deaths from breast cancer for the first time in the UK, figures show. An ageing population means more men are developing and dying from the disease. Prostate Cancer UK says advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are paying off, and increased funding could benefit prostate cancer. The biggest cancer killers in the UK remain lung and bowel cancer, with prostate now in third place. The latest figures from 2015 show there were 11,819 deaths from prostate cancer compared with 11,442 from breast cancer. Although deaths from prostate cancer have been rising over the past 10 years or so, the mortality rate or the proportion of men dying from the disease has fallen - by 6% - between 2010 and 2015. For breast cancer the mortality rate has come down by 10%, meaning deaths in women are declining more quickly. Gary Pettit works in the City of London Gary Pettit was 43 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, five years ago, after a routine medical through work. He had no symptoms - only an abnormally high PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test, which led to further tests and biopsies. Within weeks, he had a seven-hour operation at the Royal Marsden in London to remove the cancer. ""I'm a lucky boy. I stored my sperm before the op and now we've got a little seven-month-old miracle baby, called Teddy. I can't say how lucky I've been."" Gary says recovering from the surgery took quite a while and there were some side-effects which he is still getting used to - but he is clear of cancer and keen to raise awareness among other men. ""It is still a taboo subject with men. They get shy and embarrassed, but it's so important to get checked out."" Men 'dangerously ignorant' of prostate Lasers 'transform' prostate treatment Test could aid prostate cancer treatment Angela Culhane, chief executive of the charity Prostate Cancer UK, said the disease currently received half the funding and half the research that is devoted to breast cancer. She said developing better diagnostic tests that could be used as part of a nationwide screening programme would be a priority. At present, there is no single, reliable test for prostate cancer - the PSA test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used. Men with prostate cancer can also live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment because the disease often progresses very slowly. There can be fewsymptoms of prostate cancer,externalin the early stages, and because of its location most symptoms are linked to urination: needing to urinate more often, especially at night needing to run to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate weak urine flow or taking a long time while urinating feeling your bladder has not emptied fully Men with male relatives who have had prostate cancer, black men and men over 50 are at higher risk of getting the disease. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK Ms Culhane said: ""It's incredibly encouraging to see the tremendous progress that has been made in breast cancer over recent years. ""The introduction of precision medicine, a screening programme and a weighty research boost has no doubt played an important role in reducing the number of women who die from the disease. ""The good news is that many of these developments could be applied to prostate cancer and we're confident that with the right funding, we can dramatically reduce deaths within the next decade."" Michael Chapman, director of information and involvement at Cancer Research UK, said: ""The number of men getting and dying from prostate cancer is increasing mostly because of population growth and because we are living longer. ""We're dedicated to improving diagnosis and treatments for all cancers which is why we're investing in research to help develop more treatments to give more people more time this World Cancer Day on Sunday.""

Trump attacks FBI amid row over memo,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation US President Donald Trump has accused top officials of politicising FBI and justice department investigations to damage his Republican party. Later on Friday, he is expected to approve the release of a memo that is thought to suggest the FBI abused its powers to spy on one of his aides. Controversy over the memo has railed for days in US politics and the two main parties are divided on it. Democrats say the document is aimed at derailing investigations into Mr Trump. They portray the memo, commissioned by the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, as an attempt to undermine a federal inquiry into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election campaign. However, another top Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, played down the potential impact of the memo's publication on the inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He said Congress had a duty to see surveillance powers were used correctly. Meet the cast in the drama to end all dramas Political time bomb or rumour mill? Mr Trump tweeted,external: ""The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans."" The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, was nominated to the post by Mr Trump after the president dismissed his predecessor, James Comey. Last week the agency's deputy director, Andrew McCabe, resigned. Mr Trump had repeatedly accused him of political bias but the White House said the president was not involved in the decision. Approved by the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, the document reportedly accuses the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and justice department of misleading a judge in March of last year while seeking to extend a surveillance warrant against Carter Page. The memo is said to argue the FBI and justice department did not tell the judge that some of their justification for the warrant relied on a much-disputed Trump dossier. Compiled by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, that dossier was financed in part through the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. Unnamed sources told Reuters news agency the Republican memo was misleading because all the dossier excerpts used in the FBI warrant application were independently confirmed by US intelligence. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Carter Page, 46, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, visited Russia several times in 2016.He adamantly denies allegations in the Trump dossier that he served as an intermediarybetween Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Devin Nunes, 44, has long been pursuing President Trump's claims that he was put under surveillance by the Obama administration - so much so thatthe congressman was dubbed ""Inspector Clouseau"" by a fellow Republican,external, Sen Lindsey Graham, in March. Rod Rosenstein, 53, was appointed deputy attorney general last April.He is said by the New York Times to have been involved at various points in authorising applications for the surveillance,external.President Trump questioned his loyalties,externalin December, CNN reports. House Speaker Ryan denied the memo was an indictment of the FBI and justice department. ""It does not impugn the Mueller investigation, or the deputy attorney general,"" he added. He said it was job of his chamber to ""conduct oversight over the executive branch if abuses were made"". Another House Republican who read the memo, Jeff Duncan, predicted it would shake the FBI ""down to its core"". It would, he tweeted, show ""Americans just how the agency was weaponized"" by the Obama administration and Democrats to ""target political adversaries"". Allow Twitter content?

Several Republican lawmakers are opposed to releasing the memo. John Thune, who is the party's number three in the Senate, said FBI objections should be heeded. Senators Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins also voiced unease. Senator Jeff Flake teamed up with a Democrat, Chris Coons, to issued a joint statement. It said releasing the memo ""risks undermining US intelligence-gathering efforts, politicizing Congress' oversight role and eroding confidence in our institutions of government"". Congressional Democratic leaders called on Thursday for Mr Nunes' immediate removal as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff accused Republicans of having amended the memo after it was approved. However, an unnamed Republican aide said the amendments were grammatical changes and ""minor edits"", including two tweaks requested by the FBI and by Democrats. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words It has voiced ""grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". The justice department, which oversees the FBI, has warned the memo's release could jeopardise intelligence-gathering and damage trust between the agency and lawmakers. Pressure has mounted on the FBI, which is the subject of a forthcoming inspector general report. Its deputy director, Andrew McCabe, resigned on Tuesday. He had been repeatedly accused of political bias by President Trump. James Comey, who led the FBI at the time of the 2016 election and who was sacked by the new president, suggested the agency was being subjected to a witch hunt by ""weasels and liars"". While President Trump is expected to approve the memo's release, the exact method for publishing it is ""still being figured out"", the Associated Press news agency reports. As president, Mr Trump has the power to declassify the document himself and either release it or hand it to Congress to release.

Online estate agent in row over sales claim,"Online estate agency Purplebricks has defended its business after critical comments by analysts. On Thursday, stockbrokers Jefferies issued a research note questioning its claim it sold more than three quarters of homes listed with it. Jefferies said Purplebricks' sales success rate was just over 51% and near the middle of the pack of its study of 7,000 agents. But Purplebricks said it sold 78% of homes listed. Purplebricks charges a flat fee rather than a percentage of the sale price and uses a mix of online and local agents. The company's latest results, published in December, reported that its average revenue per UK customer was Â£1,138. Jefferies called selling with Purplebricks a ""Â£1,000 coin toss"", saying that, unlike traditional agents, its customers had to pay the fee regardless of whether the property sold. The brokers said the business model had not been sufficiently tested and that its shares were priced ""for perfection"". The note from Jefferies said: ""Purplebricks does not disclose how many homes it sells. Our research sample found that it had sold 51.6% of the homes listed in November 2016 within 10 months, a similar success rate to the overall market, but below the company's claim of 88% [made in an interview on the BBC's Moneybox programme]. ""Our concern is that the group has expanded quickly across three continents before the model has been proven and therefore that the shares are priced for perfection. Our research is not able to replicate the views on selling success expressed by the company."" In a statement, Purplebricks said: ""Purplebricks firmly refutes the criticism in the research note of its revenue recognition policy and stands behind both the fully audited results and the accounting policy itself."" It added that the estimated completion rate in the Jefferies research note was based on one month's data and did not cover deals that have yet to be included on the Land Registry. The company said its most recently published sales conversion rate was 78%, which it said ""more accurately reflects its sales performance"". Shares in Purplebricks fell 7% on Thursday, and dropped a further 3% on Friday to about 440p. However, this is still well above the valuation given in the Jefferies note, which said the true value of the shares was between 94-158p. Purplebricks, which operates in Australia as well as the UK and is moving into the US, has come in for criticism in the past. The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a number of complaints about its marketing.

Woman arrested over railway station fire,"This video can not be played The building was evacuated and trains were cancelled A woman has been arrested on suspicion of arson over the huge fire that closed Nottingham railway station. British Transport Police said the 33-year-old from Derby was arrested earlier and questioned by officers. Ten fire crews were needed to bring the fire under controlafter it broke out at about 06:30 GMT on 12 January. Nottinghamshire Police said the woman had been released under investigation while inquiries continued. East Midlands Trains confirmed the fire caused ""significant damage"" to the station, part of which remains closed. Smoke filled the foyer at the station after the fire broke out Prior to the fire, whichstarted in a set of women's toiletson the new side of the station, the main entrance to the stationhad recently been refurbished in a multi-million pound projectbetween Network Rail, Nottingham City Council, East Midlands Trains and the Rail Heritage Trust. Last month, Bryn Coleman, an incident commander with Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, saidthe fire could have been contained more easily had sprinklers been fitted. He told the BBC the damage ""would have been less"" and could have avoided the closure of the railway station had they been in place. Most of the fire damage was to the new Southern Concourse part of the station All trains going in and out of Nottingham were cancelled on the day of the fire, but the station reopened at 04:45 on 13 January and was running a ""near to normal"" service by the following day. British Transport Police is looking to speak to any witnesses who were around the railway station between 05:00 and 06:30 on 12 January.

Five migrants shot in Calais mass brawl,"A man gets medical help from rescue workers after clashes in Calais, northern France At least five migrants have been shot during a mass brawl between Afghans and Eritreans in the French port city of Calais, local officials say. A 37-year-old Afghan man is suspected of firing shots at a queue for food handouts. Four Eritreans aged between 16 to 18 are in a critical condition. Hundreds of migrants have converged on the area in an attempt to cross the Channel to the UK. A sprawling camp known as the ""Jungle"" was dismantled near Calais in 2016. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the violence had reached a new level and accused gangs that try to smuggle migrants to the UK of instigating the violence. This is the worst outbreak of violence between migrants in Calais for months, and the use of firearms is a worrying escalation of the tensions, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports. The cause is not yet clear but an initial fight on the city's southern outskirts broke out on Thursday afternoon, where migrants had been queuing for food handouts. Around 100 Eritreans and some 30 Afghans were caught up in the violence, which lasted almost two hours after the shots were fired. The four critically injured were shot in the neck, chest, abdomen and spine, AFP news agency reported. A group of migrants pictured with sticks during the clashes A second melee erupted shortly afterwards at an industrial site around 5km (three miles) away, when between 150 and 200 Eritreans armed with iron rods and sticks clashed with about 20 Afghans, the local prefecture said. Later in the afternoon further violence broke out at a food distribution point in an area of Calais not far from the site of the old ""Jungle"" camp. Security forces were sent to the area and there were no reports of incidents during the night. In total, 22 people were injured, including some with stab wounds, AFP added. WATCH: Child refugees hope to leave France for UK Visiting Calais, Mr Collomb added: ""There's been an escalation of violence that has become unbearable for both the people of Calais and the migrants"". The government would take control of food distribution, currently done by charities, with those groups working in association with authorities, he said. Though the""Jungle"" camp was demolished in 2016, hundreds of migrants are still living rough in the nearby woods, hoping to reach the UK. Many are young men. This video can not be played Violence broke out near the old ""Jungle"" camp Local charities put the number of such migrants living in Calais at around 800, while the authorities say there are between 550 and 600. Mr Collomb urged migrants not to head to Calais if they wanted to try to get to the UK, saying their attempts from there - often trying to hide themselves in lorries - would be unsuccessful. What next after the Jungle? The Calais ""Jungle"" became the French symbol of the European migrant crisis, and some 7,000 people - most from the Middle East and Africa - were living there before the area was cleared. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Theresa Maysigned a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais. This video can not be played The migrants living where the Calais Jungle once stood Mr Macron has said that France will not allow a new migrant camp to be set up in Calais, and French police have been accused of brutality by some activists. He is expected to unveil a new migrant policy next month, which will include speeding up the application process for asylum seekers and faster removal of those who fail to be accepted. Charities and some of the president's allies have accused the government of taking a hard line on immigration. Could Calais Jungle grow back? Video, 00:01:43Could Calais Jungle grow back?

Players taunted footballer over depression,"David Cox previously played for Forfar Athletic A footballer has described being taunted by fellow players and fans after he spoke out publicly about his mental health struggles. David Cox, who plays for Scottish League Two side Cowdenbeath, said he had been called a ""psycho"" and mocked about ""slitting his wrists"". The 28-year-old has called for the game's authorities to act on the abuse in the same way they do against racism. The Scottish Football Association said reported cases would be investigated. Speaking toRadio Scotland's John Beattie, David Cox said he had been abused by football fans and colleagues alike sincerevealing that he had self-harmed and attempted suicide. He said: ""I had fans shouting on the pitch to me shortly after I did my story, 'go and hang yourself and do it right this time'. ""I've had other players mentioning me slitting my wrists and stuff. ""You get the fans that come in and pay their money, they say what they want and then they go home and forget about it and I'm the one that it affects. This video can not be played David Cox previously spoke to BBC Scotland Sport's reporter Chris McLaughlin ""It bothers me for the rest of the weekend. It gets me in a bad place again."" Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' Teenager challenges 100-calorie snack ad Airline bans 'emotional support' peacock The former Forfar Athletic striker said that on the pitch, opponents had used his depression to undermine his efforts during games. He said: ""Maybe after a bad tackle, or if it's been rough and stuff like that, [they'd say] 'watch your wrists wee man, oh, I better not wind you up cos you're a psycho'."" He added: ""I've had them apologising and messaging me after games and stuff. ""What makes it even worse is that they will say things like 'I'm really sorry, I had a mate who killed himself through mental health', and I'm like 'why would you even mention that?'. ""It's all good and fine saying you're sorry, but to have that bit in you to mention it in the first place, when you know you've seen someone deal with that situation or you've seen people go through that kind of thing. ""Why does it make it ok for you to say it to someone else just because you don't like the way they're playing against you? It's a game of football."" BBC: Mental Health Concussion link to mental health issues for ex-sportsmen PFA: More players affected by mental health issues The footballer said attempts to deal with the stigma surrounding mental health had to be matched with efforts to challenge other social issues, such as racism and bigotry. He said: ""It's just as bad as being racist for me. ""If you were racist on the pitch, if a fan was racist at football games, you'd get done for it. ""People don't see mental health as an illness, you can't physically see it, it doesn't mean it's not there."" ""It's got to the point that if somebody shouts it to me again in a park, I will walk off."" He said that unless clubs and the authorities were willing to take the taunts seriously, his abusers would continue to feel they could behave as they pleased. ""I'm not saying what I've been through is the worst thing that anybody could ever go through, because there's people out there that are worse off than me. ""But for me, I've been through the worst period of my life ever and to have people mocking you about it and making fun, and to think that it's ok and just shake hands with you after the game and it's forgotten about, it's not on."" A Scottish Football Association spokesman said: ""The health and mental wellbeing of professional footballers in Scotland is of paramount importance to the Scottish FA. ""Since 2016, thanks to funding from William Hill, and in partnership with PFA Scotland and the Hampden Sports Clinic, we have offered Support Within Sport, a project aimed at combating mental health issues in Scottish football. ""It provides access to a specialist support network of experienced doctors, counsellors and psychologists, offered free of charge to clubs, players and coaches across Scotland. ""Any on-field instances of abuse related to mental health that are witnessed by a match official would result in the offending player's dismissal. The offending player would also be reported to the Compliance Officer for consideration of disciplinary proceedings. ""Equally, any incidents of abuse not witnessed by the match officials, but which are subsequently brought to the attention of the referee, would be similarly reported to the Compliance Officer for his consideration. We strongly encourage all players to report any such conduct in order that this investigative process can take place.""

When asked by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether she would want more control for politicians or less disruption for the economy and staying close to the European Union, the prime minister said she does not believe they are alternatives. ""We want that free trade agreement... that will be good for jobs in the UK, but that also gives us the freedom to negotiate and sign up trade deals around the rest of the world,"" she said.

Kuenssberg: China tensions,"This video can not be played In full: Theresa May on Brexit tensions and China Theresa May believes hertrip to Chinahas made her slogan ""Global Britain"" come alive. Hands shaken, businesses going home with new deals in their pockets that she says will bring jobs to the UK. But she simply refused to accept that her next round of deal-making with the EU will require a choice between a closely-bound relationship with Brussels or a more dramatic break. She told me she did not see those as alternatives and insisted she has spelled out what she really wants from the deal. Mrs May said: ""We will be out there ensuring the deal we get delivers on what the British people want. That's what this is about and I know what the British people want as well is good jobs for themselves and their children, and that's why it is important for me to be here in China where businesses have been signing deals."" Her comments will do little to dispel thetension at homewhere there are growing calls for her to be more specific about her ambition. With disagreement in cabinet and from top to bottom in the Conservative party over the direction to take, Theresa May seems not ready yet to have the argument over which way to go, in public at least. The prime minister also made it plain she has no intention of walking away from her post any time soon.

May hails 'first step' to China deal,"Theresa May has agreed a joint trade and investment review with China as the first step towards an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal, Downing Street said. The prime minister said ""we will be free to strike our own trade deals"" after leaving the EU, following talks with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi said China's markets would be further opened to the UK, including in beef, dairy and other food products. Mrs May said Â£9bn in business deals would be signed on her three-day trip. There was no specific discussion of a particular model for a trade deal between the two countries after Brexit during the two leaders' 80 minute meeting, Downing Street said. But the point of the review agreed by the two countries was to look at what model could work best, a spokesman said. Mrs May and Mr Xi also discussed their shared determination to end illegal nuclear activity by North Korea and agreed that denuclearisation was the objective, Downing Street said. May to fight post-Brexit residency move I'm not a quitter, says Theresa May as China visit begins China thrilled over 'Auntie May' visit In the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong, they restated their commitment to the ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement in place since the former colony was handed back by the UK to China in 1997. Stressing that he was looking forward to building on the success of the UK-China relationship, Mr Xi quoted Shakespeare, saying: ""What's past is prologue."" Mrs May ""pointed to the joint trade and investment review which will now take place as the first step towards delivering ambitious future trade arrangements"", Downing Street said. The two leaders also agreed to hold more talks on China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative at their meeting, which was also attended by the UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mrs May and Mr Xi agreed the importance of having frank conversations in areas where the two countries do not see eye-to-eye, Downing Street said in a statement. Talks between the two leaders were followed by a traditional Chinese tea ceremony for Mrs May and husband Philip, hosted by President Xi and China's First Lady Madame Peng and a dinner at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The UK prime minister is in China at the head of a 50-strong business delegation. Theresa May outside the British Embassy in Beijing Mrs May is understood to have raised environmental issues with Mr Xi - and she presented him with a box-set of the BBC's Blue Planet II series, with a personal message from presenter Sir David Attenborough. The show examined the effect of human behaviour on the environment and was referenced by Mrs May last month when she pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042as part of a 25-year green strategy. On the first day of her trip the prime minister announced a UK-China effort to strengthen international action against the illegal trade in ivory. UK-China trade is currently worth a Â£59bn a year. One of the UK companies travelling with the PM, health-tech firm Medopad, has said it signed more than Â£100m of commercial projects and partnerships with organisations including China Resources, GSK China, Peking University and Lenovo. By Laura Kuenssberg, political editor International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this week during the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over Â£9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line.

Fidel Castro's son 'takes own life',"""Fidelito"" (right) lived in his famous father's shadow The 68-year-old son of Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro has killed himself in Havana, according to Cuban state media. Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart was found on Thursday morning and is said to have suffered from depression. The first-born son of the late president was nicknamed ""Fidelito"", or Little Fidel, after his father. He was a nuclear physicist, trained by the former Soviet Union. ""Fidel Castro DÃ­az-Balart, who had been treated by a group of doctors for several months due to deep depression, took his life this morning,"",externalCuba's official newspaper Granma reported - little more than a year after the death of his father. State television said he had been receiving medical treatment as an outpatient in recent months, following a hospital stay. Fidelito's work for the Cuban regime came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart had taken his own life after suffering with deep depression which doctors had been treating him for over several months, state TV said. As much as the death itself may shock ordinary Cubans, it was those unexpected circumstances which caught them by surprise. As the personal lives of members of the Castro family are generally kept away from the public eye, almost no-one will have known he suffered mental health issues prior to the announcement of his death. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? At the time of his death, he was a scientific adviser for the Cuban Council of State and he served as vice president of Cuba's Academy of Sciences. He headed the island's nuclear programme from 1980 to 1992, before it was suspended after the Soviet Union's collapse. He was married to MarÃ­a Victoria Barreiro and had three children from his previous marriage - Fidel Antonio Castro Smirnov, Mirta MarÃ­a Castro Smirnova and JosÂ­Ã© RaÃºl Castro Smirnov. Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart (centre) attends a ceremony with his father's ashes in an urn in December 2016, days after the elder Fidel's funeral Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart poses with socialite Paris Hilton during the Habanos Festival in Havana in 2015 Fidel Castro DÃ­az-Balart was born in 1949, during his father's brief first marriage to Mirta DÃ­az-Balart, the daughter of a prominent pre-revolution politician. His father went on to overthrow the US-backed dictator, Fulgencio Batista, in 1959 - when his mother's family fled the island and went to Florida. Riding motorbikes with Che Guevara's son Who was Fidel Castro? His parents divorced and ""Fidelito"" spent some of his early years in the US before his father managed to bring him back to Cuba. This history explains why some of his close maternal relatives are among the most committed critics of the Cuban government - such as his cousin, Mario DÃ­az-Balart, a US congressman. Fidelito himself was loyal to the ideals of the Cuban revolution, but was said in recent years to have grown weary - both of living in his father's shadow and having been sidelined from Cuban decision-making on energy resources, said reports. His ideas for developing renewable energy on the island were not incorporated into state policy, an academic colleague, Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, told Reuters. ""I imagine that was disappointing for him,"" Mr Benjamin-Alvarado said. The TV announcement said his funeral would be planned by his family, but no further details were given. His father,Fidel Castro, a revolutionary figure and one of the world's longest serving political leaders, died aged 90 in 2016.

377 Carillion workers to lose jobs,"Nearly 380 workers at Carillion are being made redundant, but the body in charge of liquidating the business said it had saved 919 jobs. The Official Receiver said that most of the people who have kept their posts are being transferred on existing or similar terms to new companies that are taking over Carillion's contracts. However, it said that ""despite best efforts"" it was unable to secure 377 roles. Carillion went bust on 15 January. The Official Receiver said employees whose jobs have been safeguarded worked on infrastructure, central and local government projects, as well as on construction contracts. A spokesperson for the Official Receiver, said: ""I recognise that this will be a worrying time for all those affected, their families and local communities. I would like to thank all staff for their professionalism throughout the liquidation. ""I am expecting many employees working on other Carillion contracts to transfer in the coming weeks and we are continuing to keep the workforce updated as these arrangements are finalised."" Hospital cost may rise due to Carillion collapse Carillion had employed 43,000 people, including around 20,000 in the UK. Since it collapsed last month, a number of companies have said they will take over contracts and projects that they had previously worked on with the now defunct construction and services business. Kier Group had been part of a joint venture with Carillion and French business Eiffage on the High Speed 2 rail project. Kier and Eiffage are now partners on the scheme and are taking on 51 Carillion employees.

Bid to end civil partnership 'inequality',"Tim Loughton MP says civil partnerships for all is a matter of fairness A Tory MP has launched a bid to allow heterosexual couples in England and Wales to form civil partnerships in the same way as gay couples. Tim Loughton said it was ""not fair"" that opposite sex couples have ""the single option of marriage"". He also called for mothers' names to be included on marriage certificates and for all still births to be formally registered. The government is backing Mr Loughton's Private Members Bill. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was time both parents' names were included on marriage certificates. ""The current legislation which only allows for fathers' names is completely outdated and does not reflect modern Britain,"" she said. Are civil partnerships under threat? 'Why we want a civil partnership' The Home Office says it has been considering options for updating the marriage entry and working with stakeholders, including the Church of England and Church in Wales, to develop plans for this possible reform. But Mr Loughton has been forced to water down his proposals on civil partnerships - to promise a review of the current laws rather than a straightforward commitment to allow straight couples to form civil partnerships. This could result in equality being achieved by scrapping civil partnerships for everyone. But Mr Loughton is confident ministers will be persuaded to back his position after they have carried out their review. He said his Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which received an unopposed second reading, would ""correct an unintended, but glaring inequality"". Civil partnerships in England and Wales were introduced in 2004 as an initial step on the road to legalising gay marriage. Demand then fell after gay marriage was legalised in England and Wales in March 2014, and in Scotland in December 2014. But some straight couples who do not want a traditional marriage have argued there is now inequality in the law as they do not have the choice of a civil partnership. Legal and financial protection for both parties in the event of the relationship ending It is free of the religious connotations of marriage Some object to marriage as an institution and its associations with property and patriarchy Mr Loughton argued that offering opposite sex couples the chance to form a civil partnership could improve family stability and give partners legal protection if either one of them dies. Civil partnership ruling faces challenge 'Keep sex abuse dad's name off my wedding certificate' He said there are 3.2 million cohabiting opposite sex couples in England and Wales, but many shun traditional marriage because they view it as having establishment, religious and patriarchal connotations, as well as being ""rather expensive"". Many family law solicitors have written to the MP in support of his campaign ""because they see the fall out"" when partnerships breakdown. ""We need to find new ways for the state to recognise committed relationships and give children stability,"" he said, adding that all that would be required to rectify the situation would be a one line amendment to the 2004 bill. There were just over a thousand civil partnerships formed in the UK in 2015, according to House of Commons library research. By contrast, between 29 March 2014 and 30 June 2015, there were 7,366 marriages formed between same sex couples in England and Wales. But Mr Loughton said the ""conversion rate"" of gay people in civil partnerships opting to get married was thought to be about 14%. Conservative MP Edward Leigh asked if co-habiting sisters could also be covered by the proposed legislation - but Mr Loughton rejected the call, saying it would make the measure ""even more complicated"". Labour shadow minister Karen Lee said her party fully supported Mr Loughton's bill, but argued that scrapping civil partnerships would be a ""step backwards"" for those that do not want to marry. Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan lost their case for heterosexual civil partnerships in the Court of Appeal in February 2017 The UK government has previously said it did not intend to consult further on the future of civil partnerships or to change the law after two reviews, but Mr Loughton's bill is set to herald a fresh look at the issue. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are proud that we introduced marriage for same-sex couples and that they are finally able to celebrate their relationship in the way other couples have done for centuries. ""It is right that we evaluate the demand for civil partnerships before we make changes to the law. ""We continue to keep this under review and are assessing the demand for civil partnerships amongst both same-sex and opposite sex couples."" The issue made the headlines when a heterosexual couple who want to enter a civil partnership instead of getting married were granted the right to take their case to the Supreme Court, which is due to make a ruling on it mid-May. Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, from west London, argue the government's position is ""incompatible with equality law"" and there is still ""everything to fight for"".

British Transport Police said the 33-year-old from Derby was arrested earlier and questioned by officers. Ten fire crews were needed to bring the fire under controlafter it broke out at about 06:30 GMT on 12 January. Nottinghamshire Police said the woman had been released under investigation while inquiries continued. East Midlands Trains confirmed the fire caused ""significant damage"" to the station, part of which remains closed. Smoke filled the foyer at the station after the fire broke out Prior to the fire, whichstarted in a set of women's toiletson the new side of the station, the main entrance to the stationhad recently been refurbished in a multi-million pound projectbetween Network Rail, Nottingham City Council, East Midlands Trains and the Rail Heritage Trust. Last month, Bryn Coleman, an incident commander with Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, saidthe fire could have been contained more easily had sprinklers been fitted. He told the BBC the damage ""would have been less"" and could have avoided the closure of the railway station had they been in place. Most of the fire damage was to the new Southern Concourse part of the station All trains going in and out of Nottingham were cancelled on the day of the fire, but the station reopened at 04:45 on 13 January and was running a ""near to normal"" service by the following day.

"Brexit minister in civil service apologySteve Baker says he has the ""highest regard"" for officials amid row over comments on independence.1han hour agoUK Politics","A Brexit minister has apologised in Parliament for comments he made about the independence of the civil service. Steve Baker said he had been told Treasury officials were deliberately trying to influence policy in favour of staying in the EU customs union. Charles Grant, an EU policy expert said to have been the source of the claims, has since denied telling Mr Baker this. Mr Baker told MPs he now accepted this and insisted that he had the ""highest regard"" for the civil service. Calls to publish Brexit study rejected Fox: End obsession with Europe What are the UK's Brexit trade options? In a short speech in the Commons before proceedings began on Friday, Mr Baker said he wanted to set the record straight. ""As I explained yesterday (Thursday) I considered what I understood to be the suggestion being put to me as implausible because of the long standing and well regarded impartiality of the civil service,"" he said. After Mr Baker's claims emerged on Thursday, Mr Grant, the Centre for European Reform think tank chief, issued a statement. He said he recalled telling the minister at an event at the Conservative Party conference that he was aware of Treasury research showing the economic costs of leaving the customs union outweighed the benefits of striking free trade deals. But he added: ""I did not say or imply that the Treasury had deliberately developed a model to show that all non-customs union options were bad, with the intention to influence policy."" An audio recording of Mr Grant's lunch at the Tory conference hassince been published online,external. In his apology, Mr Baker said: ""In the context of that audio I accept that I should have corrected or dismissed the premise of my Hon Friend's question. ""I have apologised to Charles Grant who is an honest and trustworthy man. ""As I have put on record many times I have the highest regard for our hard-working civil servants. I am grateful for this early opportunity to correct the record, and I apologise to the House."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street said it was ""the right thing to do"" for Mr Baker to have made a ""heartfelt"" apology for his comments, adding: ""We consider this matter closed."" Theresa May's spokesman said the prime minister had not personally spoken to Mr Baker about the row but No 10 officials did have a word with him after the recording of Mr Grant's lunch emerged. The row was sparked by Commons exchanges on Thursday at Brexit questions. Prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg asked Mr Baker to confirm if he had heard Mr Grant that ""officials in the Treasury have deliberately developed a model to show that all options other than staying in the customs union were bad and that officials intended to use this to influence policy"". In response, Mr Baker said he was ""sorry to say"" that Mr Rees-Mogg's account was ""essentially correct"", adding: ""At the time I considered it implausible because my direct experience is that civil servants are extraordinarily careful to uphold the impartiality of the civil service."" Mr Baker, a leading backbench Eurosceptic before his promotion to a ministerial post, was challenged by opposition MPs as he delivered his answer to Mr Rees-Mogg, prompting him to add: ""I didn't say it was correct. I said the account that was put to me is correct. ""It was put to me, I considered it an extraordinary allegation, I still consider it an extraordinary allegation."" Following Mr Baker's apology, Mr Rees-Mogg is continuing to insist that the Treasury has questions to answer over its stance on the customs union. Allow Twitter content?

Men wanted over grandmother's murder,"Greater Manchester Police has released CCTV images and an e-fit of two suspects Police investigating the unsolved murder of an 87-year-old woman who was repeatedly beaten during a burglary have released images of two suspects. Eileen Blane was thrown to the floor and had her wedding ring taken from her finger during the raid in Stretford, Greater Manchester, in February 2017. She spent eight weeks in hospital and died the day after she was discharged. Greater Manchester Police has made a fresh appeal for information on the first anniversary of her death. The force has released CCTV images and an e-fit of two men officers are searching for, while a Â£50,000 reward remains on offer for information leading to a conviction. A third man, not pictured, is also thought to have been involved. Eileen Blane suffered three cracked ribs, a damaged vertebrae and severe bruising Det Insp John Mulvihill said: ""I implore anyone who recognises these men to get in touch, or if you believe this is you please contact us immediately. It is vital these three men are eliminated from our inquiries. ""Even the smallest piece of information could be crucial."" Det Insp Mulvihill said there had been three ""key sightings"" of three men throughout the day Mrs Blane was attacked. They were seen in Chatsworth Road, a short walk from the victim's home, in the Co-Op store on Barton Road and on Castleton Avenue. The suspects are described as white and aged in their 20s, and wearing dark-hooded clothing at the time. Eileen Blane, seen here with her late husband, had worn her gold wedding ring for 63 years Mrs Blane pictured on her wedding day Mrs Blane's son, John Blane, previously told the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow how his mother had answered a knock at the back door, thinking it was the window cleaner. The suspect pushed into the house and punched Mrs Blane in the face. During an interview, she told police: ""He just wouldn't stop hitting me. I just asked him to stop but he wouldn't. He said he wanted gold. It was just a nightmare."" While the attacker searched upstairs, Mrs Blane managed to escape and alerted her neighbours, who called the police. She suffered three cracked ribs, a damaged vertebrae and severe bruising.

Holyrood halts use of plastic straws,"Parliamentary corporate body member Kezia Dugdale with straw campaigner Kate Forbes The Scottish Parliament has stopped using plastic drinking straws in its own cafes, bar and canteen. Up until the end of 2017, Holyrood's catering outlets were using about 4,000 plastic straws each year. However amid rising concern about single-use plastics, paper straws are now being provided instead. Kezia Dugdale, a member of Holyrood's corporate body management group, said the move was ""part of a bigger picture"" to protect the environment. A growing range of organisations and institutions have begun withdrawing plastic straws from use amid concerns about plastic being found on beaches and in the sea. Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes has been runninga campaign,external, backed by the Marine Conservations Society, aiming for a ""plastic straw free Scotland"". Holyrood has now got on board, having already switched to fully compostable cups and lids for takeaway coffees and compostable food boxes and single-use cutlery. Ms Dugdale said the move to scrap plastic straws was ""a no brainer"". She said: ""When staff approached our supplier at the start of the year for an alternative to plastic, we discovered they could just as easily provide paper straws for pretty much the same cost. ""These are pretty small changes to make, but it's part of a bigger picture in thinking about our actions and protecting our environment."" Ms Forbes said it was important her campaign also had an impact closer to home. She said: ""I give full credit to the catering team and Sir Paul Grice, chief executive, for their rapid response to my letter asking them to consider ditching plastic straws. ""If those who need straws ask for one, it will be available as its vital that these changes do not cause difficulty to those who need a straw for medical reasons.

Negligence payouts 'harming NHS services',"Health leaders have written to Justice Secretary David Gauke urging him to reform the payout system for negligence claims against the NHS in England. They say costs are spiralling, ""unsustainable"" and diverting vast amounts from frontline care. The NHS Confederation, the British Medical Association and medical lawyers are among the signatories. The Ministry of Justice has asked the advisory body the Civil Justice Council to look at ways to limit payments. The annual cost of claims is said to have almost doubled since 2010. According to the letter, the NHS in England spent Â£1.7bn on clinical negligence claims last year. The letter says: ""The rising cost of clinical negligence is unsustainable and means that vast amounts of resource which could be used more effectively have to be diverted elsewhere. ""We fully accept that there must be reasonable compensation for patients harmed through clinical negligence, but this needs to be balanced against society's ability to pay. ""This is money that could be spent on frontline care. Given the wider pressures on the healthcare system, the rising cost of clinical negligence is already having an impact on what the NHS can provide."" The letter - coordinated by the NHS Confederation - has also been signed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Family Doctors Association, Medical Protection Society, Medical Defence Union and the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland. It says reforms by the government to the claims system have made things worse. Decades-old blunders cost NHS millions Litigation 'threatening NHS finances' The calculation used to work out how much a victim of negligence should receive upfront to cover a lifetime of care was changed last year so the NHS had to make higher lump sum payments. The letter says total liabilities over future years if all claims in England arising from past incidents are successful would amount to a ""staggering"" Â£65bn. The Ministry of Justice said it had set out proposals for a ""fairer way"" of setting payout levels. A spokesperson said: ""All personal injury victims should of course be fully compensated, but the costs involved should also be proportionate.""

Brexit minister in civil service apology,"A Brexit minister has apologised in Parliament for comments he made about the independence of the civil service. Steve Baker said he had been told Treasury officials were deliberately trying to influence policy in favour of staying in the EU customs union. Charles Grant, an EU policy expert said to have been the source of the claims, has since denied telling Mr Baker this. Mr Baker told MPs he now accepted this and insisted that he had the ""highest regard"" for the civil service. Calls to publish Brexit study rejected Fox: End obsession with Europe What are the UK's Brexit trade options? In a short speech in the Commons before proceedings began on Friday, Mr Baker said he wanted to set the record straight. ""As I explained yesterday (Thursday) I considered what I understood to be the suggestion being put to me as implausible because of the long standing and well regarded impartiality of the civil service,"" he said. After Mr Baker's claims emerged on Thursday, Mr Grant, the Centre for European Reform think tank chief, issued a statement. He said he recalled telling the minister at an event at the Conservative Party conference that he was aware of Treasury research showing the economic costs of leaving the customs union outweighed the benefits of striking free trade deals. But he added: ""I did not say or imply that the Treasury had deliberately developed a model to show that all non-customs union options were bad, with the intention to influence policy."" An audio recording of Mr Grant's lunch at the Tory conference hassince been published online,external. In his apology, Mr Baker said: ""In the context of that audio I accept that I should have corrected or dismissed the premise of my Hon Friend's question. ""I have apologised to Charles Grant who is an honest and trustworthy man. ""As I have put on record many times I have the highest regard for our hard-working civil servants. I am grateful for this early opportunity to correct the record, and I apologise to the House."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street said it was ""the right thing to do"" for Mr Baker to have made a ""heartfelt"" apology for his comments, adding: ""We consider this matter closed."" Theresa May's spokesman said the prime minister had not personally spoken to Mr Baker about the row but No 10 officials did have a word with him after the recording of Mr Grant's lunch emerged. The row was sparked by Commons exchanges on Thursday at Brexit questions. Prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg asked Mr Baker to confirm if he had heard Mr Grant that ""officials in the Treasury have deliberately developed a model to show that all options other than staying in the customs union were bad and that officials intended to use this to influence policy"". In response, Mr Baker said he was ""sorry to say"" that Mr Rees-Mogg's account was ""essentially correct"", adding: ""At the time I considered it implausible because my direct experience is that civil servants are extraordinarily careful to uphold the impartiality of the civil service."" Mr Baker, a leading backbench Eurosceptic before his promotion to a ministerial post, was challenged by opposition MPs as he delivered his answer to Mr Rees-Mogg, prompting him to add: ""I didn't say it was correct. I said the account that was put to me is correct. ""It was put to me, I considered it an extraordinary allegation, I still consider it an extraordinary allegation."" Following Mr Baker's apology, Mr Rees-Mogg is continuing to insist that the Treasury has questions to answer over its stance on the customs union. Allow Twitter content?

FBI memo 'not aimed at Russia inquiry',"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation US President Donald Trump has accused top officials of politicising FBI and justice department investigations to damage his Republican party. Later on Friday, he is expected to approve the release of a memo that is thought to suggest the FBI abused its powers to spy on one of his aides. Controversy over the memo has railed for days in US politics and the two main parties are divided on it. Democrats say the document is aimed at derailing investigations into Mr Trump. They portray the memo, commissioned by the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, as an attempt to undermine a federal inquiry into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election campaign. However, another top Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, played down the potential impact of the memo's publication on the inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He said Congress had a duty to see surveillance powers were used correctly. Meet the cast in the drama to end all dramas Political time bomb or rumour mill? Mr Trump tweeted,external: ""The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans."" The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, was nominated to the post by Mr Trump after the president dismissed his predecessor, James Comey. Last week the agency's deputy director, Andrew McCabe, resigned. Mr Trump had repeatedly accused him of political bias but the White House said the president was not involved in the decision. Approved by the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, the document reportedly accuses the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and justice department of misleading a judge in March of last year while seeking to extend a surveillance warrant against Carter Page. The memo is said to argue the FBI and justice department did not tell the judge that some of their justification for the warrant relied on a much-disputed Trump dossier. Compiled by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, that dossier was financed in part through the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. Unnamed sources told Reuters news agency the Republican memo was misleading because all the dossier excerpts used in the FBI warrant application were independently confirmed by US intelligence. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Carter Page, 46, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, visited Russia several times in 2016.He adamantly denies allegations in the Trump dossier that he served as an intermediarybetween Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Devin Nunes, 44, has long been pursuing President Trump's claims that he was put under surveillance by the Obama administration - so much so thatthe congressman was dubbed ""Inspector Clouseau"" by a fellow Republican,external, Sen Lindsey Graham, in March. Rod Rosenstein, 53, was appointed deputy attorney general last April.He is said by the New York Times to have been involved at various points in authorising applications for the surveillance,external.President Trump questioned his loyalties,externalin December, CNN reports. House Speaker Ryan denied the memo was an indictment of the FBI and justice department. ""It does not impugn the Mueller investigation, or the deputy attorney general,"" he added. He said it was job of his chamber to ""conduct oversight over the executive branch if abuses were made"". Another House Republican who read the memo, Jeff Duncan, predicted it would shake the FBI ""down to its core"". It would, he tweeted, show ""Americans just how the agency was weaponized"" by the Obama administration and Democrats to ""target political adversaries"". Allow Twitter content?

Several Republican lawmakers are opposed to releasing the memo. John Thune, who is the party's number three in the Senate, said FBI objections should be heeded. Senators Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins also voiced unease. Senator Jeff Flake teamed up with a Democrat, Chris Coons, to issued a joint statement. It said releasing the memo ""risks undermining US intelligence-gathering efforts, politicizing Congress' oversight role and eroding confidence in our institutions of government"". Congressional Democratic leaders called on Thursday for Mr Nunes' immediate removal as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff accused Republicans of having amended the memo after it was approved. However, an unnamed Republican aide said the amendments were grammatical changes and ""minor edits"", including two tweaks requested by the FBI and by Democrats. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words It has voiced ""grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". The justice department, which oversees the FBI, has warned the memo's release could jeopardise intelligence-gathering and damage trust between the agency and lawmakers. Pressure has mounted on the FBI, which is the subject of a forthcoming inspector general report. Its deputy director, Andrew McCabe, resigned on Tuesday. He had been repeatedly accused of political bias by President Trump. James Comey, who led the FBI at the time of the 2016 election and who was sacked by the new president, suggested the agency was being subjected to a witch hunt by ""weasels and liars"". While President Trump is expected to approve the memo's release, the exact method for publishing it is ""still being figured out"", the Associated Press news agency reports. As president, Mr Trump has the power to declassify the document himself and either release it or hand it to Congress to release.

Online estate agent in row over sales claimPurplebricks refutes a claim that it only sells about half of properties listed by customers.1h40 minutes agoBusiness,"Online estate agency Purplebricks has defended its business after critical comments by analysts. On Thursday, stockbrokers Jefferies issued a research note questioning its claim it sold more than three quarters of homes listed with it. Jefferies said Purplebricks' sales success rate was just over 51% and near the middle of the pack of its study of 7,000 agents. But Purplebricks said it sold 78% of homes listed. Purplebricks charges a flat fee rather than a percentage of the sale price and uses a mix of online and local agents. The company's latest results, published in December, reported that its average revenue per UK customer was Â£1,138. Jefferies called selling with Purplebricks a ""Â£1,000 coin toss"", saying that, unlike traditional agents, its customers had to pay the fee regardless of whether the property sold. The brokers said the business model had not been sufficiently tested and that its shares were priced ""for perfection"". The note from Jefferies said: ""Purplebricks does not disclose how many homes it sells. Our research sample found that it had sold 51.6% of the homes listed in November 2016 within 10 months, a similar success rate to the overall market, but below the company's claim of 88% [made in an interview on the BBC's Moneybox programme]. ""Our concern is that the group has expanded quickly across three continents before the model has been proven and therefore that the shares are priced for perfection. Our research is not able to replicate the views on selling success expressed by the company."" In a statement, Purplebricks said: ""Purplebricks firmly refutes the criticism in the research note of its revenue recognition policy and stands behind both the fully audited results and the accounting policy itself."" It added that the estimated completion rate in the Jefferies research note was based on one month's data and did not cover deals that have yet to be included on the Land Registry. The company said its most recently published sales conversion rate was 78%, which it said ""more accurately reflects its sales performance"". Shares in Purplebricks fell 7% on Thursday, and dropped a further 3% on Friday to about 440p. However, this is still well above the valuation given in the Jefferies note, which said the true value of the shares was between 94-158p. Purplebricks, which operates in Australia as well as the UK and is moving into the US, has come in for criticism in the past. The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a number of complaints about its marketing.

There were 12,130 offences reported in England and Wales in 2016-17, compared with 3,819 in 2006-07, said the Office for National Statistics. Andy Connolly, from Survivors UK, said victims were beginning to feel they would be believed but there was still a ""massive wall of silence"". A2015 survey,externalestimated about 96% of offences against males go unreported. Mr Connolly, chief executive of male rape and sexual abuse charity Survivors UK, said: ""We do know of men who come forward and they just meet comments like 'men can't get raped, they can't be sexually abused' and are treated with disbelief that it is even a thing that happens to men."" The figures, given to the BBC after a request, show that reports of sexual assaults against males went from 2,687 to 7,610 (+183%) and rape reports rose from 1,132 to 4,520 (+299%) between 2006-07 and 2016-17. Over the same period, reports of sexual assaults against females rose from 21,128 to 38,186 (+80.7%) and rape reports went from 12,599 to 36,639 (+190%). Allegations did not necessarily take place in the year they were reported and therefore the increase has been attributed to a rise in the number of historic allegations being made to police.

""The police were initially very aggressive in their approach to everything,"" he said ""It wasn't caring about how I felt at the time and that I was going through a lot.""

""Historically, perhaps, we did not recognise the signs, certainly of male victims,"" he said. ""[But] we have come a long way...and anyone wanting to come forward will be listened to and dealt with in a non-judgemental way and, most importantly, will be believed."" Mr Connolly said that research by Survivors UK had found the average time it takes for a victim to come forward is 26 years. He said he believed factors including the Jimmy Savile and football abuse scandals and the recent allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, which he denies, had led to an increase in confidence in the authorities. ""[Reponses] range from the perfect, brilliant responses, where men are treated as respectfully and as well as you would hope anyone would be, male or female, to the other extreme where people are treated with complete disbelief,"" he said. ""It can be very patchy though and we do hear of lots of very excellent people who do deal with it as they should.""

Relief as 955 trapped miners are freed,"A rescued miner gestures out a bus window All 955 workers from a gold mine in South Africa have been safely brought back to the surface. They had been trapped underground since a power cut struck on Wednesday night, and back-up generators failed to work. ""Everybody's out,"" said James Wellsted, a spokesman for the operating firm Sibanye-Stillwater. He said there were ""cases of dehydration and high blood pressure but nothing serious"", and the mine would re-open on Monday. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in South Africa says there were scenes of  jubilation as the miners were brought to the surface in the morning. Through the night, members of the local community and other workers had kept vigil outside the mine shaft, praying for the miners' safe return. The human cost of South Africa's mining industry The illegal gold fuelling gang battles in South Africa South Africa is a leading gold producer, but safety in the industry is often questioned. The Beatrix mine is in Welkom town, about 290km (180 miles) south-west of Johannesburg. It is owned by Sibanye-Stillwater mining firm. It has 23 levels, going down to 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) below ground. ""My children couldn't sleep,"" says Nontuthu Zelo Ngcai, a relative of a miner. She says worried family members called her through the night. The accident is thought to have occurred when a storm knocked over an electricity pylon close to the site, triggering a huge power cut. But on Friday morning electricity was finally restored to a lift, enabling the workers' release. ""It was stressful, there was not enough ventilation,"" said mineworker Mike Khonto. ""Thankfully our management managed to send us food and water."" They are being taken for food and showers upon their release, before having medical health checks. Power has now been restored at the site Anxious family members had gathered along the road to the mine but were kept back by security forces. Mr Wellsted said there was ""no indication so far that anyone has been in distress"" but it had been a ""traumatic experience"". Trade union officials had previously said they feared that the lives of the miners were at risk. They say this accident has highlighted the low safety standards in parts of the industry.

What is the 'transition' phase?,"There is lots of talk about a Brexit ""transition"" period at the moment. Here's what you need to know: It's what is expected to happen straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union on 29 March, 2019. The plan is for a time-limited period (of approximately two years) before the eventual permanent arrangements for UK-EU relations  - which have yet to be agreed - kick in. Theresa May has said the transition period, which the UK side tends to refer to as an ""implementation phase"", will allow businesses time to prepare for the new arrangements, and avoid disrupting holiday-makers and things like international security measures. However, the two sides have different ideas about what it should look like. We don't exactly know yet, because this is what is about to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. But we do know what the two sides want. The EU, whichpublished its demands,externalearlier this week, says the transition should not extend beyond 31 December 2020, 21 months after Brexit day. It wants the UK to continue to follow its rules during this time - but not be involved in making decisions. The UK says businesses should not have to adapt twice to new rules and regulations - suggesting it agrees on a largely ""status quo"" arrangement. It has said free movement of people, goods and money can continue, and that it will still be subject to European Court of Justice rulings. The two sides will negotiate on what the transition period will look like But Brexit Secretary David Davis also wants a ""right to object"" to new EU laws it doesn't agree with, and has predicted an ""argument"" with the other side about this. Another potential sticking point comes on citizens' rights - in particular EU nationals who move to the UK during the transition period. Do they get treated the same as if they had arrived while the UK was in the EU? The EU says yes, the UK no. The UK also wants to be able to strike trade deals with other countries - which it cannot do as an EU member - although these cannot come into force until the transition ends. The EU has not objected to this. May to fight EU transition residency plan That is what some Brexiteers are worried about. They say that if the UK continues to follow EU rules and regulations it will have left ""in name only"". Prominent Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg fears the UK will become a ""vassal state"" of the EU - subject to its rules without any say over how they are made. This is one of the reasons the prime minister has come under pressure in recent weeks. Mrs May tried to address this during her trip to China, telling reporters: ""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on... we're leaving the European Union. ""There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made."" Why is there talk about threats to Theresa May's job? That's when the UK will adopt its new relationship with the European Union. Given the talk of a ""business as usual"" transition period, this could be when Brexit begins to feel like Brexit. But we don't yet know what this will feel like - because the UK and the EU have not started discussing their ""future partnership"" yet. That will happen once the transition negotiations have been completed.

Apple sells fewer phones but profits riseThe price of the iPhone X compensates for a dip in handset sales during the last three months of 2017.5h5 hours agoBusiness,"The new iPhone X started selling in November Apple sold slightly fewer iPhones in the final three months of 2017 than it did the year before, but higher prices compensated for the dip. The firm reported a record $20bn (Â£14bn) in quarterly profits, driven by strong growth in Japan and Europe. The results were the first official glimpse of sales figures for Apple's expensive iPhone X. Chief executive Tim Cook said demand for the product, which starts at about $1,000, had surpassed expectations. Quarterly sales at the firm climbed by 13% year-on-year to a record $88.3bn. After an initial fall, Apple shares climbed more than 3% in after-hours trade. Apple released the iPhone X in November, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the device. And while the overall number of iPhones sold in the period slipped by 1% year-on-year to 77.3 million, the iPhone X had been the top-selling Apple handset  every week since its launch,  Mr Cook said. However the tech giant also issued a weaker-than-expected sales forecast for coming months, which appears to reinforce investor concerns that demand for Apple products may be dimming. Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco Last year Apple launched three new iPhones, but one was not like the others. The iPhone X was the main event, the talk of the town. In contrast, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus felt obsolete before Tim Cook had even finished his presentation. Investors were worried that the presence of the iPhone X would put off people buying the cheaper iPhones. And, given the X started at $999, those people may decide not to buy an iPhone at all. And that appears to be basically what happened. Apple sold marginally fewer iPhones compared with this time last year (though the company blamed that on a shorter accounting period compared with the same time in 2016). With the average selling price going up by around $100, to $796, it means Apple may be selling fewer iPhones, but it is making more from each one. Apple investors will be seeing it like this: selling fewer iPhones but dramatically upping the price is certainly one way to solve that ever-present supply chain headache. So, a timid quarter by Apple's unparalleled standards. But by no means a problem. Mr Cook said he was not over-concerned by the dip in handset sales,  adding that the 1.3 billion active Apple devices around the world provided a strong customer base for the firm's services businesses, which include Apple Pay. Analyst Carolina Milanesi, of California-based Creative Strategies,tweeted,externalthat ""1.3 billion users most of whom are extremely engaged with their devices is why the services numbers will be more and more interesting going forward"". Apple has been under a cloud afterrevealing that it deliberately slowed batteries in older phones, prompting investigations in several countries. It has since apologised, offering customers cheaper batteries and other modifications, though analysts have said that could reduce replacement purchases, potentially affecting the firm's bottom line. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at technology consultancy Counterpoint, said while Apple's opening quarter was ""fantastic"" for its new devices, it may struggle to keep sales levels up. ""Because of the higher prices, it will be a challenge to keep those volumes going,"" Mr Fieldhack said. He added the firm's performance in China, India and other emerging markets would also be crucial to future growth. Apple has struggled to lure customers away from several rivals in China, the world's largest smartphone market, as it competes against more affordable devices. It faces similar challenges in India, where the firm currently has just 2% market share . Growing its Indian customer base will be important for future sales, Mr Fieldhack said. iPhone X launch sees overnight queues Apple shares surge as iPhone X launches Apple iPhone X: The internet reacts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Ministers 'too late' on child online safetyThe charity condemns the government for not implementing proposals to protect children online.6h6 hours agoUK,"A children's charity has criticised the government for failing to implement proposals to make young people safer online - 10 years after they were made in a government-commissioned report. The NSPCC says 11 of the 38 proposals were ignored and seven were partially implemented - four are now out of date. It says a mandatory code to regulate social media and tackle online grooming is now required. Ministers say they are working to make the UK the safest place to be online. Internet 'not designed for children' Tech firms must protect children online Children at 'significant' social media risk The recommendations were made following the 2008 ""Safer Children in a Digital World"" review which was commissioned by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown and led by clinical psychologist Prof Tanya Byron. The Home Office has begun the process of creating a voluntary code to regulate websites, as part of its Internet Safety Strategy. However, the NSPCC said this move was recommended in 2008 and it was now ""too little, too late"". Instead, it wants the code to be mandatory, backed up by an independent regulator with fining powers. Features would include safe accounts for under-18s, extra protections like grooming alerts, and child endangerment reports to be published by social networks. Prof Byron, an NSPCC trustee and clinical psychologist, said the government was ""playing catch-up"". ""The internet is absolutely ubiquitous in children's lives today, and it is much too late for a voluntary code for social networks. ""The internet strategy must absolutely create a legally enforceable safety code to force social networks to keep children safe. ""The online world moves too fast for government to drag its feet for another decade."" The report comes days afterthe NSPCC revealed there had been more than 1,300 grooming offencesin the first six months since the ""sexual communication with a child"" offence came into force. Almost two-thirds of the cases took place on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Prof Byron said: ""Social media companies have been left to mark their own homework, they haven't done it. ""We need specific rules so the social media companies are held to account and fined if they don't stick to those rules around child protection."" She added that the issue was ""too important for us to wait any longer"". Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: ""It's simply wrong that the government has allowed social networks to mark their own homework for the past decade, and that their new strategy would let that continue. ""It's impossible to fathom how much harm has been done over those years in terms of online sexual abuse, hate speech, violent and harmful content and cyber bullying. ""Government must seize the opportunity to right this wrong in its Internet Safety Strategy and bring in a mandatory rulebook for social networks to protect children now and in the future."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said social media companies had to take further action to reduce the risks their platforms posed, particularly to children. She added: ""We are considering all options to make this happen - including changes to the law where necessary. ""We are working with industry, schools and parents to make sure there are robust protections in place.""

May under pressure over Brexit position,"This video can not be played PM: The UK will not have to choose between EU deal and one with the rest of the world. Theresa May is coming under increasing pressure to set out where she stands on Britain's future trade agreements. Speaking at the end of a trade visit to China, the PM said Britain would not face a choice between a free trade deal with the EU after Brexit and striking deals with the rest of the world. It comes as she has faced criticism from Eurosceptic Tory MPs that she is heading for a ""Brexit in name only"". Full negotiations on the UK's 2019 exit are to resume on Monday. Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet his EU counterpart Michel Barnier in London on Monday for the first time this year, with officials from both sides continuing technical discussions during the week.

During the prime minister's three-day visit to China, Downing Street said more than Â£9bn of business deals were signed and it agreed to a joint investment and trade review as the ""first step"" to an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal with the world's second largest economy. What the EU really wants from the UK Kuenssberg: PM returns from China to Brexit tensions May hails 'first step' to China trade deal However, Mrs May has faced growing criticism from MPs, including many in her own party, who have called for her to be more specific about her priorities on UK's future trade arrangements with the EU. Inan interview with Bloomberg News,external, Liam Fox, who was with Mrs May in China, said the UK cannot be involved in any customs union with the EU following Brexit. Number 10 said the international trade secretary was speaking for the government - but also said the details of future arrangements with Brussels were a matter for negotiation. ""It is fair to say the prime minister has an open mind when it comes to these negotiations,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. Theresa May and her husband Philip in Shanghai By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent While Theresa May has been away - successfully signing trade deals -  I have been assessing the battles she faces on the home front, within her own party. What is most striking is that some who supported her have, at the very least, become wobblier. One ex-minister said he felt ""badly let down"". She has been accused of blocking, not delivering, radical change. A former supporter questioned her lack of decisiveness: ""She has more reviews than a film critic would produce in a lifetime."" A Remainer who despises Boris Johnson wondered if - to coin a phrase - the foreign secretary's ""bad leadership would be better than no leadership"". Council candidates fear poor results in London's May elections and think this could be a trigger for the PM to go. And a Conservative-supporting business leader felt - though he didn't advocate it - that her opponents ""will pull the pin from the grenade"". Downing Street believes the feeding frenzy of speculation will abate when more progress is made on EU withdrawal. But they are aware of the challenges at home as well as abroad. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said she had already spelled out what she wants from the deal and did not believe the UK would have to choose between Europe and the rest of the world. ""I don't believe that those are the alternatives,"" she said. ""What the British people voted for is for us to take back control of our money, our borders and our laws and that's exactly what we are going to do. ""We also want to ensure that we can trade across borders."" By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst, BBC Monitoring Mainland Chinese media have praised Theresa May's 31 January-2 February visit from start to finish. Official broadcaster CCTV says that the nickname media have given her - ""Auntie May"" - shows that she has become ""one of the family"" and newspapers have heralded her trip as showing that Sino-UK ties signal new heights for bilateral cultural exchanges, and post-Brexit trade deals. They have also given a nod to Mrs May for, reportedly, not raising human rights issues in Hong Kong during her stay. Nationalist newspaper Global Timescommends the UK prime minister,externalfor ""not making any comment contrary to the goals of her China trip"", saying ""the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere"". Independent Hong Kong and Taiwanese media have been critical of the Prime Minister for not raising the contentious issue of pro-democracy protests. Publications including influential paper South China Morning Postquote former British governor Chris Patten,external, who said the Hong Kong dialogue was ""critical"" to granting assurances that developing ties with the mainland won't come at Hong Kong's expense. The prime minister has come under pressure from Eurosceptics worried about potential concessions by the UK in the Brexit talks. Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested Britain's relationship with the EU would change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit. However, cabinet members - including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - have warned the UK will lose the main advantages of Brexit if it remains bound by trade rules of the single market and customs union. They have called for the prime minister to be clearer about her own position. She told the BBC her goal in upcoming talks with Europe was to strike a deal that ""is going to be good for trade between the UK and EU and good for jobs in Britain"". This video can not be played Theresa May: I am not a quitter She added: ""It means a free trade agreement with the EU. We are now starting to negotiate that free trade agreement with the EU."" She has repeatedly said Brexit will mean leaving the single market and customs union. Asked again about her own future as prime minister, Mrs May said: ""I'm not a quitter. I'm in this because there is a job to be done here and that's delivering for the British people and doing that in a way that ensures the future prosperity of our country.""

Doctors hail prostate cancer advance,"Scans of the prostate can show if there is a cancerous growth The biggest leap in diagnosing prostate cancer ""in decades"" has been made using new scanning equipment, say doctors and campaigners. Using advanced MRI nearly doubles the number of aggressive tumours that are caught. And the trial on 576 men,published in the Lancet,external, showed more than a quarter could be spared invasive biopsies, which can lead to severe side-effects. The NHS isalready reviewing,externalwhether the scans can be introduced widely. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, and yet testing for it is far from perfect. If men have high prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the blood, they go for a biopsy. Twelve needles then take random samples from the whole of the prostate. It can miss a cancer that is there, fail to spot whether it is aggressive, and cause side-effects including bleeding, serious infections and erectile dysfunction. ""Taking a random biopsy from the breast would not be accepted, but we accept that in prostate,"" said Dr Hashim Ahmed, a consultant and one of the researchers. Around 100,000 to 120,000 men go through this every year in the UK. The trial, at 11 hospitals in the UK, used multi-parametric MRI on men with high PSA levels. It showed 27% of the men did not need a biopsy at all. This video can not be played Dr Hashim Ahmed describes on Radio 4's Today a new breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis And 93% of aggressive cancers were detected by using the MRI scan to guide the biopsy compared with just 48% when the biopsy was done at random. Dr Ahmed, who works at University College London Hospitals, told the BBC News website: ""This is a significant step-change in the way we diagnose prostate cancer. ""We have to look at the long-term survival, but in my opinion by improving the detection of important cancers that are currently missed we could see a considerable impact. ""But that will need to be evaluated in future studies, and we may have to wait 10 to 15 years."" Chris first noticed the symptoms at the theatre a decade ago, when he needed to go to the toilet repeatedly. Doctors found his prostate was enlarged. In May last year, Chris needed to see his doctor again, as he was feeling tired a lot of the time. Prostate cancer was suspected, and he was offered an MRI scan as part of the trial. He says: ""I'd heard from a friend that a prostate biopsy could be extremely painful and uncomfortable, so was pleased to know that I wouldn't be sent for one unless the doctors were confident I needed it."" In the end, he still needed a biopsy, and he was diagnosed with a cancer that had not spread out of the tumour. He is now considering what to do about treatment. Angela Culhane, the chief executive at Prostate Cancer UK, described the current system of testing as ""notoriously imperfect"". She added: ""This is the biggest leap forward in prostate cancer diagnosis in decades."" The study, led by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, is already being considered by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It will decide whether the NHS can afford multi-parametric MRI for prostate cancer. Each scan costs between Â£350 and Â£450 pounds per patient - so introducing them for all patients across the UK would have a bill around the Â£40m mark. But each biopsy costs the NHS Â£450 so reducing the number would deliver savings. Catching aggressive cancers earlier could also deliver savings as could not treating patients with very low-risk cancers. A full cost-effectiveness analysis is being carried out. Prof Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the study was ""very important"" and ""provides ground breaking data"". The chairman of the British Society of Urogenital Radiology, Dr Philip Haslam, said: ""Today's findings represent a huge leap forward in prostate cancer diagnosis."" However, he warned the biggest issue could be the number of scanners and training people to interpret the results. Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

PM returns from China to Brexit tensions,"This video can not be played In full: Theresa May on Brexit tensions and China Theresa May believes hertrip to Chinahas made her slogan ""Global Britain"" come alive. Hands shaken, businesses going home with new deals in their pockets that she says will bring jobs to the UK. But she simply refused to accept that her next round of deal-making with the EU will require a choice between a closely-bound relationship with Brussels or a more dramatic break. She told me she did not see those as alternatives and insisted she has spelled out what she really wants from the deal. Mrs May said: ""We will be out there ensuring the deal we get delivers on what the British people want. That's what this is about and I know what the British people want as well is good jobs for themselves and their children, and that's why it is important for me to be here in China where businesses have been signing deals."" Her comments will do little to dispel thetension at homewhere there are growing calls for her to be more specific about her ambition. With disagreement in cabinet and from top to bottom in the Conservative party over the direction to take, Theresa May seems not ready yet to have the argument over which way to go, in public at least. The prime minister also made it plain she has no intention of walking away from her post any time soon.

What is the Brexit 'transition' phase?,"There is lots of talk about a Brexit ""transition"" period at the moment. Here's what you need to know: It's what is expected to happen straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union on 29 March, 2019. The plan is for a time-limited period (of approximately two years) before the eventual permanent arrangements for UK-EU relations  - which have yet to be agreed - kick in. Theresa May has said the transition period, which the UK side tends to refer to as an ""implementation phase"", will allow businesses time to prepare for the new arrangements, and avoid disrupting holiday-makers and things like international security measures. However, the two sides have different ideas about what it should look like. We don't exactly know yet, because this is what is about to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. But we do know what the two sides want. The EU, whichpublished its demands,externalearlier this week, says the transition should not extend beyond 31 December 2020, 21 months after Brexit day. It wants the UK to continue to follow its rules during this time - but not be involved in making decisions. The UK says businesses should not have to adapt twice to new rules and regulations - suggesting it agrees on a largely ""status quo"" arrangement. It has said free movement of people, goods and money can continue, and that it will still be subject to European Court of Justice rulings. The two sides will negotiate on what the transition period will look like But Brexit Secretary David Davis also wants a ""right to object"" to new EU laws it doesn't agree with, and has predicted an ""argument"" with the other side about this. Another potential sticking point comes on citizens' rights - in particular EU nationals who move to the UK during the transition period. Do they get treated the same as if they had arrived while the UK was in the EU? The EU says yes, the UK no. The UK also wants to be able to strike trade deals with other countries - which it cannot do as an EU member - although these cannot come into force until the transition ends. The EU has not objected to this. May to fight EU transition residency plan That is what some Brexiteers are worried about. They say that if the UK continues to follow EU rules and regulations it will have left ""in name only"". Prominent Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg fears the UK will become a ""vassal state"" of the EU - subject to its rules without any say over how they are made. This is one of the reasons the prime minister has come under pressure in recent weeks. Mrs May tried to address this during her trip to China, telling reporters: ""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on... we're leaving the European Union. ""There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made."" Why is there talk about threats to Theresa May's job? That's when the UK will adopt its new relationship with the European Union. Given the talk of a ""business as usual"" transition period, this could be when Brexit begins to feel like Brexit. But we don't yet know what this will feel like - because the UK and the EU have not started discussing their ""future partnership"" yet. That will happen once the transition negotiations have been completed.

Air strike cripples Syrian cave hospital,"Five missiles managed to blast through the rock protecting the cave hospital A hospital built under 20m (60 feet) of rock in a rebel-held part of central Syria has been wrecked by a powerful air strike, medical sources say. They say the hospital in Hama province - regarded as one of the best protected in the country - was put out of service by Thursday's strike. No casualties are reported but aid workers say it is the worst in a wave of attacks against hospitals in Syria. Meanwhile the UN says aid is no longer getting through to besieged areas. It is not clear who carried out the latest strike, but Syrian government warplanes or those of its ally Russia have been stepping up attacks in rebel-held areas. Both Syria and Russia have consistently denied targeting civilians. Russia thwarts drone attack on Syria base Syria hospitals 'targeted by attacks' 'Why is there a war in Syria? The Al Maghara cave hospital in the town of Kafr Zita was hit by five missiles in Thursday's strike, says the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), an international coalition of medical charities. ""It's widely believed to be the most secure hospital in Syria,"" UOSSM spokesman Avi D'Souza told the BBC. Damage to the facility appeared to be extensive Mr D'Souza said the reason there were no deaths seemed to be that staff and patients were evacuated to a safe room when they heard incoming jets. The group says the facility - which serves a population of 50,000 people and performs about 150 major surgery procedures a month - suffered extensive damage. Causing such damage is only possible through advanced weapons, such as bunker-buster missiles, the UOSSM added. ""This is the most serious attack in a larger campaign against hospitals,"" Mr D'Souza said. The group recorded 14 strikes against medical facilities in Syria in January alone. Turkish ground troops have joined the Syrian conflict Also on Thursday, the United Nations' Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Syria warned that diplomatic efforts to get aid into the country had become ""totally impotent"". ""The last convoy to a besieged area was at the end of November,"" said Jan Egeland. ""We need an end to the fighting and we need to have Russia, Turkey and Iran again get de-escalation."" Conditions are at their worst since 2015, he said. Aid convoys must be approved by the Syrian government and armed groups have to offer security guarantees. As Syrian government and Russian forces have continued to pound rebel targets, Turkey last month launched a ground operation against Kurdish militia - which it regards as terrorists - in northern Syria. The Kurdish group targeted - the YPG - is active in the Afrin region across from Turkey's border. The militia forms a crucial part of a US-backed alliance battling Islamic State (IS) jihadists in Syria.

Reports of sex offences against men rise,"12,130 sexual offences against males were reported in 2016-17 Reports of sexual offences against men and boys have more than tripled in the past decade, figures show. There were 12,130 offences reported in England and Wales in 2016-17, compared with 3,819 in 2006-07, said the Office for National Statistics. Andy Connolly, from Survivors UK, said victims were beginning to feel they would be believed but there was still a ""massive wall of silence"". A2015 survey,externalestimated about 96% of offences against males go unreported. Mr Connolly, chief executive of male rape and sexual abuse charity Survivors UK, said: ""We do know of men who come forward and they just meet comments like 'men can't get raped, they can't be sexually abused' and are treated with disbelief that it is even a thing that happens to men."" The figures, given to the BBC after a request, show that reports of sexual assaults against males went from 2,687 to 7,610 (+183%) and rape reports rose from 1,132 to 4,520 (+299%) between 2006-07 and 2016-17. Over the same period, reports of sexual assaults against females rose from 21,128 to 38,186 (+80.7%) and rape reports went from 12,599 to 36,639 (+190%). Allegations did not necessarily take place in the year they were reported and therefore the increase has been attributed to a rise in the number of historic allegations being made to police. In West Yorkshire, The Blast Project said more than 80 boys and young men had been referred to their service in the past 12 months because they were either being sexually exploited or at risk of being abused. Jack - not his real name - said he had been abused by older males after he came out as gay when he was 13. He said that over a period of 18 months he was groomed and abused by more than 15 men but when he tried to speak to police he was told he was ""a waste of time and resources"". ""The police were initially very aggressive in their approach to everything,"" he said ""It wasn't caring about how I felt at the time and that I was going through a lot."" Phil Mitchell, from The Blast Project in Leeds, said it had received 80 referrals in the last year Phil Mitchell, from The Blast Project, said when Jack had come forward he had been made to feel responsible for what had happened. ""He was trafficked, kidnapped, raped,"" he said. ""Sadly there were professionals telling Jack 'this is your fault. You are looking for the abuse. You are making this happen'. ""Jack was not looking for abuse, Jack was looking for love and acceptance."" Det Supt Darren Minton, of the West Yorkshire Police Safeguarding Central Governance Unit, said the force had invested ""heavily"" in training around the issue. ""Historically, perhaps, we did not recognise the signs, certainly of male victims,"" he said. ""[But] we have come a long way...and anyone wanting to come forward will be listened to and dealt with in a non-judgemental way and, most importantly, will be believed."" Mr Connolly said that research by Survivors UK had found the average time it takes for a victim to come forward is 26 years. He said he believed factors including the Jimmy Savile and football abuse scandals and the recent allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, which he denies, had led to an increase in confidence in the authorities. ""[Reponses] range from the perfect, brilliant responses, where men are treated as respectfully and as well as you would hope anyone would be, male or female, to the other extreme where people are treated with complete disbelief,"" he said. ""It can be very patchy though and we do hear of lots of very excellent people who do deal with it as they should."" He said Survivors UK, which deals with over 18s, provided online support to about 1,500 men and face-to-face help to about 200 men each year, and that the waiting time for counselling was now nine to 12 months.

Five migrants shot in huge Calais brawlA mass brawl between Afghan and Eritrean migrants has left at least five fighting for their lives.7m7 minutes agoEurope,"A man gets medical help from rescue workers after clashes in Calais, northern France At least five migrants have been shot during a mass brawl between Afghans and Eritreans in the French port city of Calais, local officials say. A 37-year-old Afghan man is suspected of firing shots at a queue for food handouts. Four Eritreans aged between 16 to 18 are in a critical condition. Hundreds of migrants have converged on the area in an attempt to cross the Channel to the UK. A sprawling camp known as the ""Jungle"" was dismantled near Calais in 2016. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the violence had reached a new level and accused gangs that try to smuggle migrants to the UK of instigating the violence. This is the worst outbreak of violence between migrants in Calais for months, and the use of firearms is a worrying escalation of the tensions, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports. The cause is not yet clear but an initial fight on the city's southern outskirts broke out on Thursday afternoon, where migrants had been queuing for food handouts. Around 100 Eritreans and some 30 Afghans were caught up in the violence, which lasted almost two hours after the shots were fired. The four critically injured were shot in the neck, chest, abdomen and spine, AFP news agency reported. A group of migrants pictured with sticks during the clashes A second melee erupted shortly afterwards at an industrial site around 5km (three miles) away, when between 150 and 200 Eritreans armed with iron rods and sticks clashed with about 20 Afghans, the local prefecture said. Later in the afternoon further violence broke out at a food distribution point in an area of Calais not far from the site of the old ""Jungle"" camp. Security forces were sent to the area and there were no reports of incidents during the night. In total, 22 people were injured, including some with stab wounds, AFP added. WATCH: Child refugees hope to leave France for UK Visiting Calais, Mr Collomb added: ""There's been an escalation of violence that has become unbearable for both the people of Calais and the migrants"". The government would take control of food distribution, currently done by charities, with those groups working in association with authorities, he said. Though the""Jungle"" camp was demolished in 2016, hundreds of migrants are still living rough in the nearby woods, hoping to reach the UK. Many are young men. This video can not be played Violence broke out near the old ""Jungle"" camp Local charities put the number of such migrants living in Calais at around 800, while the authorities say there are between 550 and 600. Mr Collomb urged migrants not to head to Calais if they wanted to try to get to the UK, saying their attempts from there - often trying to hide themselves in lorries - would be unsuccessful. What next after the Jungle? The Calais ""Jungle"" became the French symbol of the European migrant crisis, and some 7,000 people - most from the Middle East and Africa - were living there before the area was cleared. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Theresa Maysigned a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais. This video can not be played The migrants living where the Calais Jungle once stood Mr Macron has said that France will not allow a new migrant camp to be set up in Calais, and French police have been accused of brutality by some activists. He is expected to unveil a new migrant policy next month, which will include speeding up the application process for asylum seekers and faster removal of those who fail to be accepted.

Security forces were sent to the area and there were no reports of incidents during the night. In total, 22 people were injured, including some with stab wounds, AFP added. WATCH: Child refugees hope to leave France for UK Visiting Calais, Mr Collomb added: ""There's been an escalation of violence that has become unbearable for both the people of Calais and the migrants"". The government would take control of food distribution, currently done by charities, with those groups working in association with authorities, he said. Though the""Jungle"" camp was demolished in 2016, hundreds of migrants are still living rough in the nearby woods, hoping to reach the UK. Many are young men. This video can not be played Violence broke out near the old ""Jungle"" camp Local charities put the number of such migrants living in Calais at around 800, while the authorities say there are between 550 and 600. Mr Collomb urged migrants not to head to Calais if they wanted to try to get to the UK, saying their attempts from there - often trying to hide themselves in lorries - would be unsuccessful. What next after the Jungle? The Calais ""Jungle"" became the French symbol of the European migrant crisis, and some 7,000 people - most from the Middle East and Africa - were living there before the area was cleared. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Theresa Maysigned a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais. This video can not be played The migrants living where the Calais Jungle once stood Mr Macron has said that France will not allow a new migrant camp to be set up in Calais, and French police have been accused of brutality by some activists. He is expected to unveil a new migrant policy next month, which will include speeding up the application process for asylum seekers and faster removal of those who fail to be accepted. Charities and some of the president's allies have accused the government of taking a hard line on immigration. Could Calais Jungle grow back? Video, 00:01:43Could Calais Jungle grow back?

Lasers 'transform' prostate treatment,"This video can not be played Professor Mark Emberton explains on Radio 4's Today the significance of new cancer treatment Surgeons have described a new treatment for early stage prostate cancer as ""truly transformative"". The approach, tested across Europe, uses lasers and a drug made from deep sea bacteria to eliminate tumours, but without causing severe side effects. Trials on 413 men - published in The Lancet Oncology - showed nearly half of them had no remaining trace of cancer. Lifelong impotence and incontinence are often the price of treating prostate cancer with surgery or radiotherapy. Up to nine-in-10 patients develop erectile problems,externaland up to a fifth struggle to control their bladders. That is why many men with an early stage tumour choose to ""wait and see"" and have treatment only when it starts growing aggressively. ""This changes everything,"" said Prof Mark Emberton, who tested the technique at University College London. The new treatment uses a drug, made from bacteria that live in the almost total darkness of the seafloor and which become toxic only when exposed to light. Ten fibre optic lasers are inserted through the perineum - the gap between the anus and the testes - and into the cancerous prostate gland. When the red laser is switched on, it activates the drug to kill the cancer and leaves the healthy prostate behind. The trial - at 47 hospitals across Europe - showed 49% of patients went into complete remission. And during the follow-up, only 6% of patients needed to have the prostate removed, compared with 30% of patients that did not have the new therapy. Crucially, the impact on sexual activity and urination lasted no more than three months. No men had significant side effects after two years. Gerald Capon, 68 and from West Sussex, told the BBC: ""I'm totally cured and free of the cancer. ""I feel incredibly lucky that I was accepted for the trial... I feel that my life ahead is worry free."" He was out of hospital the day after the treatment. Patient Gerald Capon says he feels incredibly lucky Prof Emberton said the technology could be as significant for men as the move from removing the whole breast to just the lump in women with breast cancer. He said: ""Traditionally the decision to have treatment has always been a balance of benefits and harms. ""The harms have always been the side effects - urinary incontinence and sexual difficulties in the majority of men. ""To have a new treatment now that we can administer, to men who are eligible, that is virtually free of those side effects, is truly transformative."" More than 46,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK each year. The tumours tend to grow slowly, but still around 11,000 men die from the disease. However, the new treatment is not yet available for patients. It will be assessed by regulators at the beginning of next year. Other therapies to kill prostate cancers, such as very focused ultrasound - known as focal Hifu - have a lower risk of side effects. But these treatments are not universally available. Dr Matthew Hobbs, from the charity Prostate Cancer UK, said the technology could help men who face the conundrum of whether or not to have treatment. ""Focal therapy treatments like this one have the potential to offer a middle ground option for some men with cancer that has not spread outside the prostate,"" he said. He said the next challenge would be to find out which patients should still wait and see, which ones should have this type of therapy, and which should have more invasive treatments. ""Until we know the answer to this question, it is important that these results do not lead to the over-treatment of men with low risk cancer, or the under treatment of men at higher risk."" The technology was developed at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel alongside Steba Biotech. FollowJames on Twitter,external.

Doctors hail prostate cancer test advance,"Scans of the prostate can show if there is a cancerous growth The biggest leap in diagnosing prostate cancer ""in decades"" has been made using new scanning equipment, say doctors and campaigners. Using advanced MRI nearly doubles the number of aggressive tumours that are caught. And the trial on 576 men,published in the Lancet,external, showed more than a quarter could be spared invasive biopsies, which can lead to severe side-effects. The NHS isalready reviewing,externalwhether the scans can be introduced widely. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, and yet testing for it is far from perfect. If men have high prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the blood, they go for a biopsy. Twelve needles then take random samples from the whole of the prostate. It can miss a cancer that is there, fail to spot whether it is aggressive, and cause side-effects including bleeding, serious infections and erectile dysfunction. ""Taking a random biopsy from the breast would not be accepted, but we accept that in prostate,"" said Dr Hashim Ahmed, a consultant and one of the researchers. Around 100,000 to 120,000 men go through this every year in the UK. The trial, at 11 hospitals in the UK, used multi-parametric MRI on men with high PSA levels. It showed 27% of the men did not need a biopsy at all. This video can not be played Dr Hashim Ahmed describes on Radio 4's Today a new breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis And 93% of aggressive cancers were detected by using the MRI scan to guide the biopsy compared with just 48% when the biopsy was done at random. Dr Ahmed, who works at University College London Hospitals, told the BBC News website: ""This is a significant step-change in the way we diagnose prostate cancer. ""We have to look at the long-term survival, but in my opinion by improving the detection of important cancers that are currently missed we could see a considerable impact. ""But that will need to be evaluated in future studies, and we may have to wait 10 to 15 years."" Chris first noticed the symptoms at the theatre a decade ago, when he needed to go to the toilet repeatedly. Doctors found his prostate was enlarged. In May last year, Chris needed to see his doctor again, as he was feeling tired a lot of the time. Prostate cancer was suspected, and he was offered an MRI scan as part of the trial. He says: ""I'd heard from a friend that a prostate biopsy could be extremely painful and uncomfortable, so was pleased to know that I wouldn't be sent for one unless the doctors were confident I needed it."" In the end, he still needed a biopsy, and he was diagnosed with a cancer that had not spread out of the tumour. He is now considering what to do about treatment. Angela Culhane, the chief executive at Prostate Cancer UK, described the current system of testing as ""notoriously imperfect"". She added: ""This is the biggest leap forward in prostate cancer diagnosis in decades."" The study, led by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, is already being considered by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It will decide whether the NHS can afford multi-parametric MRI for prostate cancer. Each scan costs between Â£350 and Â£450 pounds per patient - so introducing them for all patients across the UK would have a bill around the Â£40m mark. But each biopsy costs the NHS Â£450 so reducing the number would deliver savings. Catching aggressive cancers earlier could also deliver savings as could not treating patients with very low-risk cancers. A full cost-effectiveness analysis is being carried out. Prof Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the study was ""very important"" and ""provides ground breaking data"". The chairman of the British Society of Urogenital Radiology, Dr Philip Haslam, said: ""Today's findings represent a huge leap forward in prostate cancer diagnosis."" However, he warned the biggest issue could be the number of scanners and training people to interpret the results. Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

NSPCC calls for 'catch-up' on online safety,"A children's charity has criticised the government for failing to implement proposals to make young people safer online - 10 years after they were made in a government-commissioned report. The NSPCC says 11 of the 38 proposals were ignored and seven were partially implemented - four are now out of date. It says a mandatory code to regulate social media and tackle online grooming is now required. Ministers say they are working to make the UK the safest place to be online. Internet 'not designed for children' Tech firms must protect children online Children at 'significant' social media risk The recommendations were made following the 2008 ""Safer Children in a Digital World"" review which was commissioned by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown and led by clinical psychologist Prof Tanya Byron. The Home Office has begun the process of creating a voluntary code to regulate websites, as part of its Internet Safety Strategy. However, the NSPCC said this move was recommended in 2008 and it was now ""too little, too late"". Instead, it wants the code to be mandatory, backed up by an independent regulator with fining powers. Features would include safe accounts for under-18s, extra protections like grooming alerts, and child endangerment reports to be published by social networks. Prof Byron, an NSPCC trustee and clinical psychologist, said the government was ""playing catch-up"". ""The internet is absolutely ubiquitous in children's lives today, and it is much too late for a voluntary code for social networks. ""The internet strategy must absolutely create a legally enforceable safety code to force social networks to keep children safe. ""The online world moves too fast for government to drag its feet for another decade."" The report comes days afterthe NSPCC revealed there had been more than 1,300 grooming offencesin the first six months since the ""sexual communication with a child"" offence came into force. Almost two-thirds of the cases took place on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Prof Byron said: ""Social media companies have been left to mark their own homework, they haven't done it. ""We need specific rules so the social media companies are held to account and fined if they don't stick to those rules around child protection."" She added that the issue was ""too important for us to wait any longer"". Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: ""It's simply wrong that the government has allowed social networks to mark their own homework for the past decade, and that their new strategy would let that continue. ""It's impossible to fathom how much harm has been done over those years in terms of online sexual abuse, hate speech, violent and harmful content and cyber bullying. ""Government must seize the opportunity to right this wrong in its Internet Safety Strategy and bring in a mandatory rulebook for social networks to protect children now and in the future."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said social media companies had to take further action to reduce the risks their platforms posed, particularly to children. She added: ""We are considering all options to make this happen - including changes to the law where necessary. ""We are working with industry, schools and parents to make sure there are robust protections in place.""

Apple sells fewer phones but profits riseThe price of the iPhone X compensates for a dip in handset sales during the last three months of 2017.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"The new iPhone X started selling in November Apple sold slightly fewer iPhones in the final three months of 2017 than it did the year before, but higher prices compensated for the dip. The firm reported a record $20bn (Â£14bn) in quarterly profits, driven by strong growth in Japan and Europe. The results were the first official glimpse of sales figures for Apple's expensive iPhone X. Chief executive Tim Cook said demand for the product, which starts at about $1,000, had surpassed expectations. Quarterly sales at the firm climbed by 13% year-on-year to a record $88.3bn. After an initial fall, Apple shares climbed more than 3% in after-hours trade. Apple released the iPhone X in November, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the device. And while the overall number of iPhones sold in the period slipped by 1% year-on-year to 77.3 million, the iPhone X had been the top-selling Apple handset  every week since its launch,  Mr Cook said. However the tech giant also issued a weaker-than-expected sales forecast for coming months, which appears to reinforce investor concerns that demand for Apple products may be dimming. Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco Last year Apple launched three new iPhones, but one was not like the others. The iPhone X was the main event, the talk of the town. In contrast, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus felt obsolete before Tim Cook had even finished his presentation. Investors were worried that the presence of the iPhone X would put off people buying the cheaper iPhones. And, given the X started at $999, those people may decide not to buy an iPhone at all. And that appears to be basically what happened. Apple sold marginally fewer iPhones compared with this time last year (though the company blamed that on a shorter accounting period compared with the same time in 2016). With the average selling price going up by around $100, to $796, it means Apple may be selling fewer iPhones, but it is making more from each one. Apple investors will be seeing it like this: selling fewer iPhones but dramatically upping the price is certainly one way to solve that ever-present supply chain headache. So, a timid quarter by Apple's unparalleled standards. But by no means a problem. Mr Cook said he was not over-concerned by the dip in handset sales,  adding that the 1.3 billion active Apple devices around the world provided a strong customer base for the firm's services businesses, which include Apple Pay. Analyst Carolina Milanesi, of California-based Creative Strategies,tweeted,externalthat ""1.3 billion users most of whom are extremely engaged with their devices is why the services numbers will be more and more interesting going forward"". Apple has been under a cloud afterrevealing that it deliberately slowed batteries in older phones, prompting investigations in several countries. It has since apologised, offering customers cheaper batteries and other modifications, though analysts have said that could reduce replacement purchases, potentially affecting the firm's bottom line. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at technology consultancy Counterpoint, said while Apple's opening quarter was ""fantastic"" for its new devices, it may struggle to keep sales levels up. ""Because of the higher prices, it will be a challenge to keep those volumes going,"" Mr Fieldhack said. He added the firm's performance in China, India and other emerging markets would also be crucial to future growth. Apple has struggled to lure customers away from several rivals in China, the world's largest smartphone market, as it competes against more affordable devices. It faces similar challenges in India, where the firm currently has just 2% market share . Growing its Indian customer base will be important for future sales, Mr Fieldhack said. iPhone X launch sees overnight queues Apple shares surge as iPhone X launches Apple iPhone X: The internet reacts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Rescue begins of 955 trapped miners,"A rescued miner gestures out a bus window All 955 workers from a gold mine in South Africa have been safely brought back to the surface. They had been trapped underground since a power cut struck on Wednesday night, and back-up generators failed to work. ""Everybody's out,"" said James Wellsted, a spokesman for the operating firm Sibanye-Stillwater. He said there were ""cases of dehydration and high blood pressure but nothing serious"", and the mine would re-open on Monday. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in South Africa says there were scenes of  jubilation as the miners were brought to the surface in the morning. Through the night, members of the local community and other workers had kept vigil outside the mine shaft, praying for the miners' safe return. The human cost of South Africa's mining industry The illegal gold fuelling gang battles in South Africa South Africa is a leading gold producer, but safety in the industry is often questioned. The Beatrix mine is in Welkom town, about 290km (180 miles) south-west of Johannesburg. It is owned by Sibanye-Stillwater mining firm. It has 23 levels, going down to 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) below ground. ""My children couldn't sleep,"" says Nontuthu Zelo Ngcai, a relative of a miner. She says worried family members called her through the night. The accident is thought to have occurred when a storm knocked over an electricity pylon close to the site, triggering a huge power cut. But on Friday morning electricity was finally restored to a lift, enabling the workers' release. ""It was stressful, there was not enough ventilation,"" said mineworker Mike Khonto. ""Thankfully our management managed to send us food and water."" They are being taken for food and showers upon their release, before having medical health checks. Power has now been restored at the site Anxious family members had gathered along the road to the mine but were kept back by security forces. Mr Wellsted said there was ""no indication so far that anyone has been in distress"" but it had been a ""traumatic experience"". Trade union officials had previously said they feared that the lives of the miners were at risk. They say this accident has highlighted the low safety standards in parts of the industry. More than 80 fatalities were recorded in South African mines in 2017. The human cost of SA's mining industry.

Man guilty of Finsbury Park mosque murder,"This video can not be played CCTV showed Darren Osborne's movements before and during the attack A man who drove a van into a crowd of Muslims near a London mosque has been found guilty of murder. Darren Osborne, 48, ploughed into people in Finsbury Park in June last year, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others. Osborne, from Cardiff, was also found guilty of attempted murder and is due to be sentenced on Friday. Prosecutors said they were ""clear throughout that this was a terrorist attack"". The jury took an hour to return the verdict at Woolwich Crown Court after a nine day trial. What led Finsbury Park attacker to kill? Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Darren Osborne planned and carried out this attack because of his hatred of Muslims. He must now face the consequences of his actions."" Darren Osborne was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, at Woolwich Crown Court Cdr Dean Haydon from the Metropolitan Police said: ""Osborne's evil and cowardly actions meant a family has tragically lost a husband, father and grandfather."" Some of those injured ""could suffer from health issues for the rest of their lives"", he added. Jurors heard the area outside the Muslim Welfare House had been busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers on 19 June. Mr Ali had collapsed at the roadside in the minutes before the attack. Several of those who went to help him said he was alive and conscious in the moments before being struck by the van. Makram Ali, 51, was killed in the attack Osborne drove the van into the crowd at about 00:15. Jurors were told the van only stopped when it hit some bollards. He then got out of the van and ran towards the crowd. This video can not be played CCTV shows the moments before a van hit a crowd near Finsbury Park mosque Police later found a letter in the van written by Osborne, referring to Muslim people as ""rapists"" and ""feral"". He also wrote that Muslim men were ""preying on our children"". The trial heard Osborne became ""obsessed"" with Muslims in the weeks leading up to the attack, having watched the BBC drama Three Girls, about the Rochdale grooming scandal. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent In just a few weeks, Darren Osborne went from a troubled, angry and unpredictably violent alcoholic to a killer driven by ideology. The rapid radicalisation - the way he became fixated on the idea that Muslims in Britain were some kind of nation within a nation, is one of the most shocking parts of this awful crime. The sources of that radicalisation, including his obsession with a television programme about the Rochdale abuse scandal, show how difficult it is to predict who will become a danger to society. But the fact that he smiled contentedly after he had run over and killed Makram Ali proved to the jury that his motive was ideological. Osborne is not the first terrorist to have radicalised so quickly. In 2014, a young man who was groomed by Islamists went through a similarly rapid change. The speed at which these men and others went from a change of mindset to planning an attack is one of the issues that most concerns the security services. Osborne told the court he had originally hired the van to kill Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at a march he was due to attend. He said it ""would have been even better"" if London Mayor Sadiq Khan had been present, adding: ""It would have been like winning the lottery."" Responding to the verdict, Mr Corbyn - who is MP for the area where the attack took place - said it was ""a hate-filled attack that... shocked us all"". ""I was proud of how, in the wake of this terrible event, we all came together to reject hate and embrace hope, and that is the kind of country we live in,"" he added. A statement from his partner Sarah Andrews, read out in court, said he seemed ""brainwashed"" and ""totally obsessed"". Ms Andrews - who had been in a relationship with Mr Osborne for about 20 years and with whom she had four children - described him as a ""loner and a functioning alcoholic"" with an ""unpredictable temperament"". Osborne started following Tommy Robinson, one of the founders of the English Defence League (EDL), and other far-right leaders on social media, in the fortnight before the attack. Mr Robinson sent him a group email saying: ""There is a nation within a nation forming beneath the surface of the UK. It is a nation built on hatred, on violence and on Islam."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack Cdr Haydon said the investigation had the ""full weight"" of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command behind it. He warned that online material had played a ""significant role"" in how Osborne was radicalised and ""brainwashed"". If Osborne's aim had been to ""create divisions and hate between communities"", then he had ""failed"", he said. ""The response [of those involved], and the overwhelmingly positive reaction my officers and teams have witnessed since, highlights how far from reality Osborne's sick and twisted views really are,"" he added. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) welcomed the verdict, but added: ""We cannot be complacent and regard this as a one-off terrorist incident."" Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB, said: ""The scenes we witnessed last summer were the most violent manifestation of Islamophobia yet in our country. ""The case tells us that we must all exercise caution when tempted to stigmatise any group of people, regardless of colour, creed or community."" Khalid Oumar, a trustee of the mosque and founder of the Finsbury Park Attack victims' voice forum, praised the strength of the community, adding: ""The scars will stay with them forever, but the community is determined to go about daily life without fear and to stand together against victimisation and violence.""

Prostate cancer 'third biggest killer',"This video can not be played 'I didn't want to be a statistic' The number of men dying from prostate cancer has overtaken female deaths from breast cancer for the first time in the UK, figures show. An ageing population means more men are developing and dying from the disease. Prostate Cancer UK says advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are paying off, and increased funding could benefit prostate cancer. The biggest cancer killers in the UK remain lung and bowel cancer, with prostate now in third place. The latest figures from 2015 show there were 11,819 deaths from prostate cancer compared with 11,442 from breast cancer. Although deaths from prostate cancer have been rising over the past 10 years or so, the mortality rate or the proportion of men dying from the disease has fallen - by 6% - between 2010 and 2015. For breast cancer the mortality rate has come down by 10%, meaning deaths in women are declining more quickly. Gary Pettit works in the City of London Gary Pettit was 43 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, five years ago, after a routine medical through work. He had no symptoms - only an abnormally high PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test, which led to further tests and biopsies. Within weeks, he had a seven-hour operation at the Royal Marsden in London to remove the cancer. ""I'm a lucky boy. I stored my sperm before the op and now we've got a little seven-month-old miracle baby, called Teddy. I can't say how lucky I've been."" Gary says recovering from the surgery took quite a while and there were some side-effects which he is still getting used to - but he is clear of cancer and keen to raise awareness among other men. ""It is still a taboo subject with men. They get shy and embarrassed, but it's so important to get checked out."" Men 'dangerously ignorant' of prostate Lasers 'transform' prostate treatment Test could aid prostate cancer treatment Angela Culhane, chief executive of the charity Prostate Cancer UK, said the disease currently received half the funding and half the research that is devoted to breast cancer. She said developing better diagnostic tests that could be used as part of a nationwide screening programme would be a priority. At present, there is no single, reliable test for prostate cancer - the PSA test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used. Men with prostate cancer can also live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment because the disease often progresses very slowly. There can be fewsymptoms of prostate cancer,externalin the early stages, and because of its location most symptoms are linked to urination: needing to urinate more often, especially at night needing to run to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate weak urine flow or taking a long time while urinating feeling your bladder has not emptied fully Men with male relatives who have had prostate cancer, black men and men over 50 are at higher risk of getting the disease. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK Ms Culhane said: ""It's incredibly encouraging to see the tremendous progress that has been made in breast cancer over recent years. ""The introduction of precision medicine, a screening programme and a weighty research boost has no doubt played an important role in reducing the number of women who die from the disease. ""The good news is that many of these developments could be applied to prostate cancer and we're confident that with the right funding, we can dramatically reduce deaths within the next decade."" Michael Chapman, director of information and involvement at Cancer Research UK, said: ""The number of men getting and dying from prostate cancer is increasing mostly because of population growth and because we are living longer. ""We're dedicated to improving diagnosis and treatments for all cancers which is why we're investing in research to help develop more treatments to give more people more time this World Cancer Day on Sunday.""

"Fidel Castro's son 'takes own life'Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart, known as 'Fidelito', has been found dead in Cuba.1h34 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean","""Fidelito"" (right) lived in his famous father's shadow The 68-year-old son of Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro has killed himself in Havana, according to Cuban state media. Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart was found on Thursday morning and is said to have suffered from depression. The first-born son of the late president was nicknamed ""Fidelito"", or Little Fidel, after his father. He was a nuclear physicist, trained by the former Soviet Union. ""Fidel Castro DÃ­az-Balart, who had been treated by a group of doctors for several months due to deep depression, took his life this morning,"",externalCuba's official newspaper Granma reported - little more than a year after the death of his father. State television said he had been receiving medical treatment as an outpatient in recent months, following a hospital stay. Fidelito's work for the Cuban regime came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart had taken his own life after suffering with deep depression which doctors had been treating him for over several months, state TV said. As much as the death itself may shock ordinary Cubans, it was those unexpected circumstances which caught them by surprise. As the personal lives of members of the Castro family are generally kept away from the public eye, almost no-one will have known he suffered mental health issues prior to the announcement of his death. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? At the time of his death, he was a scientific adviser for the Cuban Council of State and he served as vice president of Cuba's Academy of Sciences. He headed the island's nuclear programme from 1980 to 1992, before it was suspended after the Soviet Union's collapse. He was married to MarÃ­a Victoria Barreiro and had three children from his previous marriage - Fidel Antonio Castro Smirnov, Mirta MarÃ­a Castro Smirnova and JosÂ­Ã© RaÃºl Castro Smirnov. Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart (centre) attends a ceremony with his father's ashes in an urn in December 2016, days after the elder Fidel's funeral Fidel Ãngel Castro DÃ­az-Balart poses with socialite Paris Hilton during the Habanos Festival in Havana in 2015 Fidel Castro DÃ­az-Balart was born in 1949, during his father's brief first marriage to Mirta DÃ­az-Balart, the daughter of a prominent pre-revolution politician. His father went on to overthrow the US-backed dictator, Fulgencio Batista, in 1959 - when his mother's family fled the island and went to Florida. Riding motorbikes with Che Guevara's son Who was Fidel Castro? His parents divorced and ""Fidelito"" spent some of his early years in the US before his father managed to bring him back to Cuba. This history explains why some of his close maternal relatives are among the most committed critics of the Cuban government - such as his cousin, Mario DÃ­az-Balart, a US congressman. Fidelito himself was loyal to the ideals of the Cuban revolution, but was said in recent years to have grown weary - both of living in his father's shadow and having been sidelined from Cuban decision-making on energy resources, said reports. His ideas for developing renewable energy on the island were not incorporated into state policy, an academic colleague, Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, told Reuters. ""I imagine that was disappointing for him,"" Mr Benjamin-Alvarado said. The TV announcement said his funeral would be planned by his family, but no further details were given. His father,Fidel Castro, a revolutionary figure and one of the world's longest serving political leaders, died aged 90 in 2016.

"Patients 'sent home to no heat or light'A lack of home checks means some patients are stuck in an endless cycle of hospital readmissions, the British Red Cross says.8h8 hours agoHealth","Frail and vulnerable patients are being trapped in an ""endless cycle"" of going in and out of hospitals in England, the British Red Cross is warning. The charity said the pressure on the NHS meant hospitals were rushing some patients home before they were ready and without adequate checks being made. It said its staff had found patients in distressing situations, sent back to homes with no heating or lighting. Hospitals are meant to coordinate care for frail patients on discharge. But the Red Cross said that simply was not happening because of the lack of community services available from councils and the NHS. It meant there were growing numbers of patients being readmitted soon after leaving hospital because they were getting no help, the charity said. It pointed to a report last year that suggested the number of readmissions within 30 days of being dischargedhad risen by nearly a quarter in the past four years. The study - based on Freedom of Information responses from hospitals - suggested close to one in 20 admissions was likely to be a repeat admission. The charity said it wanted to see automatic home checks for every frail patient on discharge.

Its report highlighted a number of cases, including: a woman who had been in hospital for two months sent home with no help and a fridge full of mouldy food frail patients with conditions such as broken hips being returned to homes where the gas or electricity had been cut off during their hospital stay a man on crutches taken home by ambulance at 23:00 and left in the car park outside his home The charity said the lack of support patients received increased the risk of falls in particular. Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson said his teams had first-hand experience of the problems being encountered as they provided support to about 300,000 people across the UK after being discharged from hospital. He said: ""The NHS is rightly a source of national pride, but despite the best efforts of hardworking doctors and nurses we know many of our hospitals remain under serious pressure this winter. ""When the system is strained, all too often it is frail, older people who live alone that are falling into crisis in the gap between hospital and home."" His comments come on the day the NHS in England released figures showing the pressure hospitals are under. They showed bed-occupancy rates were once again at unsafe levels across the NHS. Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society of Acute Medicine, which represents doctors looking after patients brought in as an emergency, said staff were becoming ""increasingly anxious"" about the pressures they were working under. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said what the Red Cross had documented should not be happening. ""We expect local authorities to work closely with the NHS to ensure people are treated in the most appropriate setting and when they are discharged from hospital they have a care plan in place."" The Local Government Association called it a ""telling"" report and said a lack of funding was impacting on the ability of councils to provide care.

Fully funding IVF 'would improve safety',"Full government funding for IVF treatment would reduce the risk of harm to mothers and babies and save the NHS money, health experts have said. It would help lower cases of women who have more than one embryo transferred into the uterus, which can cause risky multiple pregnancies, their study says. Multiple pregnancies are the ""greatest avoidable risk of IVF"", it says. The Department of Health said the NHS should be offering IVF for all patients who meet existing criteria. Multiple pregnancies are the most common adverse outcome of IVF treatment.  They can happen when more than one embryo is transferred into the uterus. This procedure is often carried out to reduce costs for patients who pay for their own treatment, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) report said. Multiple pregnancies are associated with a six-fold increase in the risk of pre-term birth - a leading cause of infant mortality and long-term mental and physical disabilities - as well as increased risks to mothers, such as pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and haemorrhage following birth. But despite the risks of them occurring, double embryo transfer during IVF treatment continues. The RCOG paper found that almost one in five IVF deliveries in the UK in 2011 involved a multiple birth. Sweden has similar live birth rates but a high proportion of single embryo transfer, but during the same period the multiple birth rate was 4.9%. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend government funding for three full IVF cycles. However, the recommendations are not binding and it is up to local NHS providers to decide what to offer. The RCOG said there was a ""postcode lottery"" for funding across the country and six out of 10 IVF cycles in the UK were funded by patients themselves. It said it was still widely believed by patients and health professionals that the success rate of IVF treatment was higher following the transfer of two embryos than with one embryo. But the college said studies had shown that in women with a good prognosis, single embryo transfer is comparable to that of two embryos and with a significantly lower risk of multiple pregnancy. It called for the a national commissioning policy to remove the current variation in IVF funding. Mr Tarek El-Toukhy, consultant gynaecologist and specialist in reproductive medicine and surgery, and lead author of RCOG's report, said: ""The health and financial burden it places on women, families and the NHS cannot be overstated. ""To ensure rates of multiple births remain low, there is little doubt that the single most important factor that could enhance the acceptance of single embryo transfer among patients and practitioners is appropriate funding for IVF treatment."" Keith Reed, chief executive of the Twins and Multiple Births Association, said healthcare organisations needed to ""step up their efforts to address the risks associated with multiple birth pregnancy"". ""There is a growing body of evidence that good care and following multiple birth guidance during maternity reduces the poor outcomes and need for neonatal care which put pressure on NHS services."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""As this report itself highlights, we have made great progress in improving patient safety by lowering the national multiple birth rate in IVF from 24% in 2009 to 11% today. ""We know fertility problems can have a serious and lasting impact on familiesâand the government has been clear that the NHS should provide access to IVF for all patients that meet the criteria set out in NICE guidance.""
