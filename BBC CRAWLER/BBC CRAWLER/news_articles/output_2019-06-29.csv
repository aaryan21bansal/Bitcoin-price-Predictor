'Those of us who are blessed must pay more tax',"Liesel Pritzker Simmons and husband Ian Simmons run an investment firm focussing on social enterprises Liesel Pritzker Simmons is fabulously wealthy. But this member of one of America's richest families is also uneasy about it. ""It's time for us who are blessed with unusual financial success or luck to contribute more to our common good and common future,"" she told the BBC. ""The best way that we in this fortunate bubble can contribute is that we want to be taxed more."" Ms Pritzker Simmons accepts it's a rather unorthodox view. Butthis week she, and 17 other super-rich individuals, set out their reasons in an open letter,external. America's economic and social ills have created a crisis for the young, the poor, and the environment, they said. We don't have all the answers, but we can help: Impose a wealth tax on us - it's our moral and patriotic duty to hand over a bigger slice of our fortunes. With her husband Ian, an heir to a family fortune himself, they discussed going public with people they knew held similar concerns. Investor George Soros, Facebook's co-founder Chris Hughes, and Disney heiress Abigail Disney, were among those signing up. ""There could have been more"", Mr Simmons said. ""We just wanted to pull in enough names to get the conversation going."" They are not wedded to a particular proposal, but one suggestion was this: Add a tax of two cents per dollar on assets after a $50m exemption, and one cent per dollar tax on assets above $1bn. It would generate nearly $3tn in revenue over ten years, they said. Newspaper columnists and Twitter's angry brigade came out in force to criticise and mock this ""billionaires club with a conscience"" and bunch of privileged misguided do-gooders. ""This is an uncomfortable conversation. We recognise that,"" said Ms Pritzker Simmons, whose family built their fortune on the Hyatt hotel group. She's no desire to become a campaigning figurehead. Nor are any of them after a ""pat on the back"". Anyway, she's had her share of headlines already, starting as a celebrated child actor in the Oscar-nominated A Little Princess and then as the daughter to Harrison Ford's US President in Air Force One. (A young Jodie Foster, he called her). There was then a bitter court battle in which she successfully sued the family estate over her inheritance, reportedly securing $500m. Now 35 years old, she describes herself as ""quite a private person"", running an investment firm with her husband that focuses on social and environmental enterprises. So why go public now? The idea of a wealth tax is gaining credence in the Democratic Party, and with the presidential debates underway it was felt now was the time to intervene. Ms Pritzker Simmons said: ""We just wanted to go on the record and say: please don't be timid about tax reform because you're afraid that this class of people is going to get upset. ""There's a healthy group of us who absolutely are in favour of it [a wealth tax], and we wanted to make that really clear to politicians and future politicians, as well as the American people."" US super-rich call for wealth tax US economy under Trump: Is it the greatest in history? In recent years, members of the mega-rich class have individually voiced worries about the wealth imbalance, including Warren Buffett. But the signatories hope their letter will prompt a group momentum. Already the Swiss-born US-based billionaire Hansjoerg Wyss has added his name to the letter, and the property and insurance magnate Eli Broadhas written of his support.,external But they are not going unchallenged. Conservative US television talk show host Laura Ingraham was among the first out the blocks with a tweet that summed up the counter-view of many. ""If these billionaires think they pay too little in taxes, why not just send more money to the IRS? Or are they not smart enough to figure that out?"" she tweeted her near-three million followers. That misses the point, says Mr Simmons, 44. Writing a cheque to the Treasury is just philanthropy, and you can't address the challenges facing society based on the whim of rich people giving money away. A young Liesel Matthews (her stage name) with Air Force One co-stars Harrison Ford and Wendy Crewson ""I don't think philanthropy is going to fix systemic wealth inequality, and nor do most economists who study inequality,"" he said. He's not dismissing philanthropy. He and his wife do their bit. ""But the good intentions of the few are not a substitute for good rules for everyone. Having a few of us write a few more cheques to the Treasury is not going to create universal childcare or take a revolutionary approach to the climate crisis or retire student debt."" Nor do they want the extra money ring-fenced for specific projects. ""It's up to our government - that's what tax is for,"" Ms Pritzker Simmons said. ""There are things that I personally care about, but [ring-fencing] betrays the purpose of a tax that benefits everybody."" She's convinced they're tapping into a new mood among voters: ""We've watched a couple of generations of trickle-down economics, and it's not working. There is a change in mood, but it's based on solid data that shows things are not working."" Donald Trump - who once proposed a one-off wealth tax to tackle America's debt - points to Wall Street's record-breaking stock markets as evidence things are, in fact, working. ""It's not a very compelling argument to the half of Americans who have absolutely no exposure to the stock market,"" she said. She says voters - Republican and Democrat - are increasingly demanding action, which is why people who say Congress would never pass a wealth tax are wrong. And while the rich can hide or undervalue assets, that's not an argument for doing nothing. As she puts it: ""Are you really going to leave 50 cents on the table because you can't get the dollar."" America's top tier is not going to suffer after paying a bit more into the system, she said. ""We will continue to have an incredibly fortunate life. If this [a wealth tax] is considered a hardship, then I think we're pretty lucky.""

US and China agree to restart trade talks,"This video can not be played Trump on China, including a change of US policy on the tech giant Huawei The US and China have agreed to resume trade talks, easing a long row that has contributed to a global economic slowdown. US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping reached agreement at the G20 summit in Japan. Mr Trump also said he would allow US companies to continue to sell to the Chinese tech giant Huawei, in a move seen as a significant concession. Mr Trump had threatened additional trade sanctions on China. However, after the meeting on the sidelines of the main G20 summit in Osaka, he confirmed that the US would not be adding tariffs on $300bn (Â£236bn) worth of Chinese imports. He also said he would continue to negotiate with Beijing ""for the time being"". A quick guide to the US-China trade war Who loses out in the US-China trade war? G20 summit: UK calls for global climate action And at a subsequent press conference, the US president declared that US technology companies could again sell to China's Huawei - effectively reversing a ban imposed last month by the US commerce department. President Trump has positioned his trade talks with Xi Jinping as a win for the US - but he may have also given Beijing exactly what it wants on Huawei. It is still not clear whether what Mr Trump has announced is a complete reversal - but if it is, it would be a significant concession by the US on a company that Washington has said is a threat to national security. The resumption of talks and pressing the pause button on more tariffs will be seen in the short term as positive for markets and American businesses. Those have already complained about the cost of further tariffs saying that if they had gone ahead - American consumers would have ended up paying something like $12bn more in higher prices Chinese businesses have been suffering too - the trade war has hit investment plans, business confidence, and exports in the world's second largest economy. But pressing pause doesn't mean the trade war is over. Tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods are still in place. And the two sides still have much to agree on. Washington wants Beijing to fundamentally change the way China's economy has grown over the past four decades - get rid of subsidies to state owned companies, open up the domestic market and most importantly, hold China to account if it fails to deliver on any of these commitments. But Beijing has already publicly said that it won't budge on issues of principle or bow to US pressure. How the two sides close that gap will be the real test of any trade truce. For now - it is a positive thing that they're talking again. But talking can only take you so far. This video can not be played Who really pays in a tariff war? The US and China have been fighting a damaging trade war over the past year. Mr Trump accused China of stealing intellectual property and forcing US firms to share trade secrets in order to do business in China, which in turn said US demands for business reform were unreasonable. The feud escalated in the months leading up to the summit, after talks between the two countries collapsed in May. The truce signals a pause in hostilities rather than a resolution of the dispute, which has caused market turbulence and hit global growth. Mr Trump said his meeting with Mr Xi was ""excellent, as good as it was going to be,"" adding: ""We discussed a lot of things and we're right back on track and we'll see what happens."" China's state news agency Xinhua quoted Mr Xi as saying: ""China and the US have highly integrated interests and extensive co-operation areas and they should not fall into so-called traps of conflict and confrontation."" This video can not be played Trade war squeezes California's wine country Washington has publicly said the firm's technology poses a national security risk, although Mr Trump has also linked the issue to the trade dispute. How damaging is the Huawei row? US Huawei supplier resumes some shipments Last month, the US banned Huawei from buying US goods without a licence - including from Google, which is crucial to many of its products. The ban could cost the firm $30bn (Â£24bn) in revenue this year. This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Some analysts see the ban as an attempt by the US to contain a powerful Chinese firm. Mr Trump's decision to allow US companies to continue to sell to Huawei ""where there's no great national security problem"" could be a substantial concession, although exactly how this will play out remains unclear. Mr Trump said the Huawei situation would be dealt with ""at the very end"" of trade talks. The G20 family photo - with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman central The next summit is due to be held in Saudi Arabia in November 2020. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has continued to face questions in Osaka over the murder in Istanbul last year of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the matter is likely to rumble on. All you need to know about Khashoggi's death The UK's Theresa May and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan are among those still pressing the issue, although Mr Trump says ""no-one blames"" the crown prince.

The Proclaimers on the heat... and funeral songs,"The Proclaimers: 'Older songs have more impact' The Proclaimers opened up Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage on Saturday, with a mass singalong to hits like (I'm Gonna Be) 500 Miles and Letter From America. The set came 32 years after brothers Charlie and Craig Reid last played the stage, shortly after releasing their first album, and they had a few more hits up their sleeve this time round. Song like Let's Get Married and Sunshine on Leith have become staples at weddings and funerals respectively; and they got a new generation of fans when I'm On My Way featured in the first Shrek film. The band sat down with the BBC to share their Glastonbury memories, and their dream line-up for next year's 50th anniversary. BBC Glastonbury: Official site Vampire Weekend heat up Glastonbury Stormzy tears up the stage on day one Behind the scenes of the Pyramid Stage Glastonbury: Freya Ridings' crowd-surfing fantasy How hot is it out on that stage today? Charlie: When we went on, the sun was just about overhead. We got a slight breeze about 20 minutes in, which helped a little. But it is blimmin' hot out there. You were the first act on the Pyramid Stage after Stormzy. How does that feel? Charlie: What an honour. A cultural game-changer, followed by The Proclaimers on Saturday morning! We actually played Glastonbury in 1987 on the Pyramid Stage, so to come back all these years later, is absolutely fantastic. What was the festival like back then? Craig: We'd never experienced anything other than playing in clubs - so that was the biggest stage we'd played. But we were 25 then, and you know no fear at that age. Mind you, there was a much smaller crowd that time. The band played a hit-packed 50-minute set on Saturday morning You played Let's Get Married followed by Sunshine on Leith, which are classic wedding and funeral songs. What does it mean to you to have written songs that soundtrack those pivotal moments in people's lives? Charlie: It's interesting -  Sunshine On Leith has become one ofthefuneral songs in Scotland. I don't think it beats Angels by Robbie, but a lot of funerals play Sunshine on Leith. Craig: I'll be honest, if you've been around a long time, a lot of people have a lot of years to hear your songs, maybe even from childhood, and they take on new meanings and memories down the years. So I think older songs have more impact. You opened with Angry Cyclist, which came out last year.  Does the new stuff go down as well as the classics? Charlie: We're really proud of that song and proud of the album, so I think it merits its place in the set - even a short one like this. You keep getting introduced to new generations through films like Shrek and Sunshine on Leith. Did you notice a difference in the audience after those came out? Charlie: Yes! The audience got somewhat younger! The combination of that and playing festivals - you can replenish your audience by young people seeing you. Then hopefully on the next theatre tour, some of them will come along. It's helped us greatly. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Your film Sunshine on Leith has unexpectedly become the first in a trilogy of musicals by Dexter Fletcher, who went on to direct Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocket Man. Did you have any idea that would be where he ended up? Charlie: He's always struck me as a winner, Dexter. Even from when he was a kid, he has that sort of Essex jaunty thing. You get stories back from film sets, and everyone was really positive on Sunshine On Leith, and the director has something to do with that. So when I heard he was tidying up the Queen thing [after original director Brian Singer left mid-production], I thought, 'Yeah, he'll gee everybody up.' He's a heck of a talent and I'm delighted at how successful he's become. And I'm glad that we're one of the first thing he worked on. Sunshine on Leith was a musical based on The Proclaimers' songs If someone came up and said we wanted to put on a Dexter Fletcher festival, let's call it DexFest, with you, Queen and Elton John on the same bill, would you be up for it? Craig: Definitely up for it, but we'd demand the biggest dressing room. Even bigger than Elton? Craig: No chance of that. We don't have enough hats. Elton needs more room than we do. Next year is Glastonbury's 50th anniversary. If you got to choose the bill, who would you book to headline? Charlie: Maybe some that aren't around any more. I'd always have The Clash, The Who and, God almighty, if they were around, I'd have the Small Faces as well. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Sir Elton criticises Putin's LGBT 'hypocrisy',"Sir Elton said reference to his husband, David Furnish, were cut from the movie Rocketman in Russia Sir Elton John has written an open letter to Vladimir Putin accusing him of ""hypocrisy"" over his claims Russia has ""no problems"" with gay people. The singer said he was ""deeply upset"" by the Russian president's commentsin an interview,externalin the Financial Times. Sir Elton saidhis film Rocketman was edited in Russiato remove references to his husband David Furnish and their family. Russia has denied censorship. He previously criticised Mr Putinfor a ""ridiculous"" attitude to gay rights. In the interview, published on Friday, Mr Putin attacked liberalism and, speaking of the LGBT community, said: ""God forbid, let them live as they wish."" But he added: ""Some things do appear excessive to us... They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles. ""Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population."" In posts on social media, Sir Elton said: ""I strongly disagree with your view that pursuing policies that embrace multicultural and sexual diversity are obsolete in our societies.""

Sir Elton said Russian distributors ""chose to heavily censor"" Rocketman ""by removing all references to my finding true happiness through my 25-year relationship with David and the raising of my two beautiful sons"". ""This feels like hypocrisy to me,"" Sir Elton said. ""I am proud to live in a part of the world where our governments have evolved to recognise the universal human right to love whoever we want."" The right to marry has brought him and his husband ""tremendous comfort and happiness"", he said. Is Putin right? Is liberalism really obsolete? Liberalism has 'become obsolete' - Putin Russia detains several LGBT activists Smuggling the Pride flag into Russia Court blasts Russia 'gay propaganda' law Russia's culture ministry has previously denied censoring the biopic Rocketman - which was released earlier this year - but said movies were expected to comply with laws on ""paedophilia, ethnic and religious hatred and pornography"". The country introduced a law banning ""gay propaganda"" in 2013, prompting criticism from the European Court of Human Rights that it was discriminatory and encouraged homophobia. Sir Elton told the BBC in 2015he wanted to meet Mr Putinto discuss LGBT rights, criticising what he called the president's ""ridiculous"" attitude. In the interview with the Financial Times, Mr Putin said that liberalism was ""obsolete"" because it had come into conflict with the interests of the majority of the population and with traditional values. He added: ""I am not trying to insult anyone, because we have been condemned for our alleged homophobia as it is. But we have no problems with LGBT persons.""

Queen speaks of 'great affection' for Scotland,"This video can not be played The Queen: ""It [Holyrood] must also be a place to listen a place to hear views that inevitably may differ quite considerably."" The Queen has spoken of her ""great affection for Scotland"" while marking Holyrood's 20th anniversary. A ceremony took place two decades on from the Scottish Parliament taking on its legal powers. The Queen told MSPs that she ""fondly remembered"" opening the parliament, and said that it ""continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the monarch that MSPs were ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". The Queen, who was accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, spoke to each of Holyrood's party leaders personally as well as addressing them in the debating chamber. The ceremony also featured performances of music, poetry and song celebrating Scottish culture. Look back on the royal visit on Holyrood Live Holyrood quiz: 20 questions for 20 years The birth of a parliament The modern parliament was set up two years after Scotland voted overwhelmingly fordevolution in a referendum in 1997.It initially sat at the General Assembly in Edinburgh before moving to its Â£431m purpose-built home at Holyrood in 2004. The Queen was last in the landmark building in July 2016, marking the opening of the fifth session of the parliament. She told MSPs that it was with ""great pleasure"" that she had been present at each stage of the parliament's lifetime, ""including on landmark occasions such as today"". She said: ""Twenty years on, this chamber continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life, as an important forum to engage and unite diverse communities and also a home for passionate debate and discussion. ""Through new initiatives you continue to strive to be responsive and accountable to the people you serve, and to engage and involve those who might not otherwise participate in political debate."" Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders responded to the Queen's speech The Queen also said it was her ""sincere hope"" that MSPs would ""work tirelessly to improve people's lives and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad"". In response, Ms Sturgeon said the parliament may only be 20 years old, but ""has long come of age"". She said there had been times in the early years when ""the sense of challenge possibly outweighed the sense of optimism"", but said the hopes expressed for Holyrood in 1999 ""to a great extent have been vindicated"". And she said that while politics can seem ""more divided than ever"", parties ""can maintain our commitment to working together in the common good"", saying even political opponents are ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". Other party leaders also addressed the special occasion, with Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson saying that Holyrood was ""knitted into the fabric of our society"", adding that ""there is consensus that as a process, devolution has made our country stronger"". Young people who were born on the day the devolved parliament was convened on 1 July 1999 were also part of the celebrations. The so-called ""1 July babies"" were also an integral part of the 10th anniversary celebrations in 2009. Presiding Officer Ken Maintosh told them that ""you carry with you all our dreams, all our ambitions and all our hopes for the future"". Young people born on the day the parliament was reconvened were part of the celebrations at Holyrood The Queen was preceded into the chamber by the mace and Crown of Scotland, while a fanfare was played by the brass ensemble from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The ceremony included performances by the National Youth Choir of Scotland, singer Karen Matheson and a band fronted by folk musician Phil Cunningham. Scots Makar Jackie Kay performed a poem about the lifetime of the parliament titled ""The Long View"", which included sections in Gaelic and British Sign Language. And the monarch was piped out of the chamber by MSP Stuart McMillan, with members then joining in to sing ""A Man's a Man for a' That"" by Robert Burns. The Queen signed the parliament's guest book and was presented with a bouquet of flowers by 13-year-old Ewan Carmichael, before she was driven back across the road to Holyrood Palace.

The Jeremy Corbyn Story,"He remains in the saddle but not everyone thinks he is heading in the right direction Jeremy Corbyn's election in September 2015 as Labour leader, at the age of 66, counted as one of the biggest upsets in British political history. His re-election to the post almost a year later was not such a surprise but could prove even more momentous in terms of Labour's direction in the coming years and the future course of British politics. Seeing off the challenge of Owen Smith, who had the backing of the majority of Labour MPs, has made Mr Corbyn, for the time being at least, seemingly unassailable and increased the likelihood that he will lead the opposition into the next general election - scheduled for 2020. If that is the case, Mr Corbyn will be a highly influential figure during one of the most important political periods of the past 50 years - as the clock ticks down to the UK's exit from the EU following the Brexit referendum vote. To his critics, he is almost a caricature of the archetypal ""bearded leftie"", an unelectable throwback to the dark days of the 1980s, when Labour valued ideological purity more than winning power. But to his army of supporters he is the only honest man left in politics, someone who can inspire a new generation of activists, and make them believe that there is an alternative to the neo-liberal Thatcherite consensus that has let them down so badly. The veteran Labour politician says politics is about fighting for causes one believes in A fixture on the British left for more than 40 years, he has been an almost ever-present figure at demos and marches, a joiner of committees, a champion of controversial causes, a tireless pamphleteer, handy with a megaphone. But not even his most ardent admirers would have had him down as a future leader of Her Majesty's opposition. And not just because he believes in the abolition of the Monarchy. Corbyn's brand of left-wing politics was meant to have been consigned to the dustbin of history by New Labour. He belongs to what had been a dwindling band of MPs, which also includes Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, who held fast to their socialist principles as their party marched moved right - and into power - under Tony Blair. At the start of the 2015 leadership contest, after scraping on to the ballot paper at the last minute, thanks to charity nominations from Labour MPs who wanted a token left-wing candidate to ""broaden the debate"", heexplained to The Guardian,externalwhy he had decided to run. ""Well, Diane and John have done it before, so it was my turn."" Asked if he had taken some persuading, he replied: ""Yeah. I have never held any appointed office, so in that sense it's unusual, but if I can promote some causes and debate by doing this, then good. That's why I'm doing it."" He added: ""At my age I'm not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?"" Jeremy Corbyn was greeted by rapturous crowds during his 2015 victory Laura Alvarez, Mr Corbyn's third wife, applauds his first victory That view was quickly revised as Corbynmania took hold. Something about the Islington North MP struck a chord with Labour leadership voters in a way that his three younger, more polished, more careerist, rivals patently did not. Despite, or perhaps because, of his unassuming, low-key style, he seemed able to inspire people who had lost faith in Labour during the Blair/Brown years and bring hope to young activists fired up by his anti-austerity message. His entry into the contest also prompted a surge in people - many from the left of the existing Labour membership - joining the party or paying Â£3 to become registered supporters. His perceived integrity and lifelong commitment to the socialist cause made him an attractive option to many left-wing voters jaded by the spin and soundbites of the Westminster political classes. Over the course of a year or so since becoming leader he has become something of a cult figure - ironic for someone who always insisted he didn't do personality politics and had never tried to cultivate a following among MPs. Instead of amusing anecdotes about youthful indiscretions, or tales of climbing Westminster's greasy pole, his political biography is dominated by the list of the causes he has championed and committees he has served on. He once confessed he had never smoked cannabis - practically unheard of in the left-wing circles he grew up in, but the mark of a man who is known for his austere, almost ascetic, approach to life. His frugality is legendary. He usually has the lowest expenses claims of any MP. ""Well, I don't spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don't have a car,"" he told The Guardian. Asked what his favourite biscuit was during a Mumsnet Q&A , he answered: ""I'm totally anti-sugar on health grounds, so eat very few biscuits, but if forced to accept one, it's always a pleasure to have a shortbread."" Jeremy Bernard Corbyn had an impeccable middle-class upbringing. He spent his early years in the picturesque Wiltshire village of Kington St Michael. When he was seven, the family moved to a seven-bedroomed manor house in the hamlet of Pave Lane, in Shropshire. The youngest of four boys, he enjoyed an idyllic childhood in what he himself has called a rural ""Tory shire"". Corbyn has won Beard of the Year no less than four times Personal life:Lives with third wife. Has three sons from earlier marriage. Food and drink:A vegetarian who rarely drinks alcohol. According to The Guardian, his favourite restaurant is Gaby's diner in London's West End, where he likes to eat hummus after taking part in demonstrations in Trafalgar Square. Hobbies:Running, cycling, cricket and Arsenal football club. According to the Financial Times: ""He loves making jam with fruit grown on his allotment, belongs to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cheese and is a borderline trainspotter."" He does not own a car. He is known for having an unusual hobby - an interest in the history and design of manhole covers. Culture:A lover of the works of Irish poet WB Yeats. His favourite novelist is said to be the late Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, whose most famous work, Things Fall Apart, is about the tensions between colonialism and traditional societies. He is a fluent Spanish speaker and enjoys Latin American literature. His favourite films are said to be The Great Gatsby and Casablanca. His brother Piers, now a meteorologist known for denying climate change is a product of human activity, has described the Corbyn boys as ""country bumpkins"". Corbyn disagrees with his brother on climate change but they remain close. They both learned their politics at the family dinner table, where left-wing causes and social justice were a frequent topic of debate. Their maths teacher mother Naomi and electrical engineer father David were peace campaigners who met at a London rally for supporters of Spain's Republicans in the fight against Franco's fascists. Piers, who would go on to be a well-known squatters leader in 1960s London, was even further to the left than Jeremy. Both boys joined the local Wrekin Labour Party and the Young Socialists while still at school. Corbyn had begun his education at the fee-paying preparatory school, Castle House, in Newport, before moving into the state sector, after passing his 11-plus. He was one of only two Labour-supporting boys at Adams Grammar School, in Newport, when his class held a mock election in 1964. In an interview with The Sun, his friend Bob Mallett recalls Corbyn being jeered by his right-wing schoolmates: ""Jeremy was the Labour candidate and I his campaign manager because at a middle-class boarding grammar school in leafy Shropshire, there weren't many socialists. We were trounced."" Corbyn left Adams with two A levels, both at grade E, and an enduring hatred of selective education. ""It was an illegal war and therefore [Tony Blair] has to explain to that. Is he going to be tried for it? I don't know. Could he be tried for it? Possibly,"" on the Iraq war. ""Are super-rich people actually happy with being super-rich? I would want the super rich to pay properly their share of the needs of the rest of the community,"" on Channel 4 News. ""He was a fascinating figure who observed a great deal and from whom we can learn a great deal,"" on Karl Marx to the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""Without exception, the majority electricity, gas, water and railway infrastructures of Britain were built through public investment since the end of WW2 and were all privatised at knockdown prices for the benefit of greedy asset-strippers by the Thatcher and Major-led Tory governments,"" in his column for the Morning Star newspaper. ""Some people say to me, are we still worried about Hiroshima. My reply is that the weapons were used specifically against civilians and while 'fireworks' compared to what is now available, killed and have killed for the past 59 years. Nuclear weapons have saved no lives, killed thousands and maimed many more and impoverished the poor nations who have them,"" on his website. ""I started wearing a beard when I was 19 and living in Jamaica; they called me 'Mr Beardman,'"" on winning the Beard Liberation Front's Beard of the Year award in 2002. He reportedly split up with his second wife Claudia after she insisted on sending their son Ben - now a football coach with Premier League Watford - to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, in Barnet, instead of an Islington comprehensive. After leaving school, Corbyn spent two years in Jamaica, with Voluntary Service Overseas, something he has described as an ""amazing"" experience. Back in the UK he threw himself into trade union activism, initially with now long defunct National Union of Tailors and Garment Makers. The late Tony Benn was a key influence on Corbyn's politics He started a course in Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic but left after a series of arguments with his tutors over the curriculum. ""He probably knew more than them,"" Piers told The Sun. A successful career as a trade union organiser followed, with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) and then the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE). But his real passion was for Labour Party politics - and in 1974 he was elected to Haringey District Council, in North London. In the same year he married fellow Labour councillor, Jane Chapman, a university lecturer. Chapman says she married Corbyn for his ""honesty"" and ""principles"" but she soon grew weary of his intense focus on politics. ""Politics became our life. He was out most evenings because when we weren't at meetings he would go to the Labour headquarters, and do photocopying - in those days you couldn't print because there were no computers,'she told The Mail on Sunday,external. ""Jeremy is a saintly figure of enormous personal integrity. He is a man who lives his life according to his beliefs,"" former Labour MP Chris Mullin, speaking to Panorama. ""If Jeremy Corbyn becomes leader it won't be a defeat like 1983 or 2015 at the next election. It will mean rout, possibly annihilation"",former Labour leader and prime minister Tony Blair,external. ""The showbiz glitz of New Labour temporarily hid the hole where the heart of Labour was supposed to be. Now the 'Corbynites' (whoever expected to use that phrase?) are trying to hide that hole behind some old banners and a bloke with a beard,""left-wing commentator Mick Hume,external. ""There is something inherently virtuous about him, and that is a quality that can rally the support of a lot of people, and most importantly, a lot of young people,""singer and activist Charlotte Church,external(pictured). ""While most of his chums have all moderated their views, dumped their corduroy jackets and grey suits, shaved their beards and quietly cancelled their CND subscriptions, [he] has hardly changed a bit; he is the Fidel Castro of London N1,"" Telegraph journalist Robert Hardman. They shared a love of animals, they had a tabby cat called Harold Wilson, and enjoyed camping holidays together in Europe on Corbyn's motorbike. But fun was in short supply at home, recalls Chapman, who remains in touch with Corbyn and backed his leadership bid. During their five years together he never once took her dinner, she told The Mail, preferring instead to ""grab a can of beans and eat it straight from the can"" to save time. In 1987, Corbyn married Claudia Bracchita, a Chilean exile, with whom he had three sons. The youngest, Tommy, was born while Corbyn was lecturing NUPE members elsewhere in the same hospital. Twenty-five-year-old Seb has been helping out on his father's leadership campaign. Corbyn is a long standing supporter of Irish Republicanism The couple separated in 1999, but remained on good terms. Corbyn got married for a third time last year, to his long term partner Laura Alvarez, a 46-year-old Mexican fair trade coffee importer. In the bitter internal warfare that split Labour in the late 1970s and early eighties, Corbyn was firmly on the side of the quasi-Marxist hard left. A Labour man to his fingertips - he was no Militant ""entryist"" trying to infiltrate the party by stealth - he nevertheless found common cause with former Trotskyists such as Ted Knight, and joined them in their battle to push the party to the left. He became a disciple of Tony Benn, sharing his mentor's brand of democractic socialism, with its belief in worker controlled industries and state planning of the economy, as well as Benn's commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament and a united Ireland. Here is just a small selection of the campaigns Jeremy Corbyn has been involved with over the past 50 years. Nuclear disarmament:Joined CND as a schoolboy in 1966 Irish Republicanism:Organised Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' visit to the Commons in 1983. Once employed Irish Republican dissident Ronan Bennett as a member of staff at Westminster Miners' strike:Invited striking miners into Commons gallery in 1985 who were expelled for shouting ""Coal not Dole"" Anti-Apartheid:serving on the National Executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was arrested in 1984 for protesting outside South Africa House Palestinian solidarity:A member of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and campaigns regularly against the conflict in Gaza Miscarriages of justice:Worked on on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, who were eventually found to be have been wrongly convicted of IRA bombings in England in the mid-1970s Animal rights:Joined the League Against Cruel Sports at school, became a vegetarian at 20, after working on a pig farm Iraq war:Chaired the Stop the War coalition Gay rights:Spoke out in 1983 on a ""No socialism without gay liberation"" platform and continued to campaign for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender rights Corbyn was never seen as a great orator like Benn, or a firebrand like miners' leader Arthur Scargill, but he worked tirelessly behind the scenes, his trousers stained with purple ink from the copying machines that produced the pamphlets and newspapers that were the lifeblood of the British Left in the pre-internet era. He ran the London Labour Briefing newspaper, which helped propel Ken Livingstone to power on the Greater London Council. He was elected to Parliament in 1983, to represent his home patch of Islington North, a seat he has held ever since and where he has increased his majority from 5,600 to 21,000, and as a back benchers was by most accounts a popular and hard-working MP. The Bennite faction that Corbyn belonged to was already in retreat, following their leader's failure to capture the deputy leadership of the party in 1981. After fighting and losing the 1983 election on arguably the most left-wing manifesto it had ever put before the British public, with its commitment to renationalising the utilities just privatised by the Thatcher government, pulling out of the EU, nuclear disarmament and the creation of a ""national investment bank"" to create jobs, Labour began the painful process of ""modernisation"" that led to the birth of New Labour. And Corbyn would spend the next 32 years on the backbenches fighting a rearguard action against his party's abandonment of the radical policies and values contained in the '83 manifesto in the name of electability, under Neil Kinnock, John Smith and, most notably, Tony Blair. Corbyn has suggested Tony Blair should face a war crimes trial Corbyn might have hailed from the same North London district as Blair and entered Parliament in the same year but that is where the similarity ended. He abhorred Blair's embrace of free market economics and did his best to be a thorn in the younger man's side throughout his time in Downing Street, although Blair's large majorities ensured the damage was barely noticeable. He would always vote with his conscience, rather than be dictated to by the party whips. It earned him the accolade of being Labour's most rebellious MP, defying the party managers more than 500 times. It also meant he and his allies became increasingly isolated, with their views and interventions ignored by the mainstream media and most of their colleagues on the Labour benches. Blair's dire warnings that Labour would face ""annihilation"" if it elected Corbyn during the leadership contest were met by Corbyn with a suggestion that his predecessor as Labour leader should probably face trial for war crimes over his role in the Iraq war. Corbyn has been a stalwart of the British left for more than 40 years Campaigning for a united Ireland in 1984 Corbyn and his comrades - unlike their modernising colleagues they would use the term without irony - routinely attached themselves to any cause that felt like it would strike a blow against British and American ""imperialism"" or the Israeli state. Internationalist in outlook, they would proclaim solidarity with socialist campaigns and governments in places like Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador and attack US policies that, in Corbyn's view, enslaved the Latin American world. He incurred the wrath of the Labour leadership early on his career when he invited two former IRA prisoners to speak at Westminster, two weeks after the Brighton bomb that had nearly killed Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet. Later on it would be his willingness to share platforms with representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah that would put him at the centre of controversy. When challenged, he insists he does not share their views but that peace will never be achieved without talking to all sides. He may have been largely sidelined in the House of Commons, respected but too much of a known quantity to have an impact, but Corbyn's stature and profile outside Parliament continued to grow. He chaired the Stop the War Coalition and became a leading figure in the anti-austerity movement, which began to attract large crowds of young activists eager for something to believe in and to take the fight to then Prime Minister David Cameron. Still, no one gave Corbyn a prayer when he entered the contest to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader, with bookmakers offering a price of 200-1. Mr Corbyn's relationship with the media has been a turbulent one His elevation to rock star status, among the crowds who flocked to his leadership campaign meetings, must have been as much of a shock to Corbyn as it was to his opponents, but he never showed it. He carried on, just as he always had, railing against inequality, talking about hope, promising to renationalise industries, tax the rich and scrap Trident, and wearing the same white, open-necked shirt with pens sticking out of the top pocket. Only now people were listening. The Labour leader has sought to bring a new approach to Prime Minister's Questions During that leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn is understood to have rejected pleas from some supporters for him to stand aside, having made his point and injected new life into Labour's left, to leave the field clear for a younger candidate who might have more electoral appeal. He appeared determined to make a go of the leadership. Many ""moderate"" shadow cabinet members returned to the backbenches rather than serve under him but he was able to put together a top team that reflected a broad range of opinion within the party. He sought to bring a new approach to leadership, adopting a less confrontational and more conversational tone at Prime Minister's Questions and generally refraining from either sound bites or photo opportunities - to the exasperation of what his supporters call the ""mainstream media"" and the derision of some commentators. The coalition behind Mr Corbyn held together for nine months, despite growing discontent among Labour MPs who had never wanted him as leader and could not accept either his style of leadership or his policies. The EU referendum brought things to a head. Corbyn, who had been a Eurosceptic as a backbencher, was accused of mounting a half-hearted campaign to keep Britain in the EU and of not appearing to care too much that his side had lost. Labour MPs, some of whom had been plotting to topple Corbyn at some point, saw this as the chance to make their move to try and force him to stand down, amid fears they would be wiped out at a snap election they expected to follow the referendum with him as leader. Owen Smith said his rival was unelectable but Mr Corbyn trounced him at the polls He faced a mass walkout from the shadow cabinet and then a vote of no confidence, which he lost by 172 votes to 40, as Labour MPs - enemies and previously loyal shadow ministers alike - urged him to quit. He refused to budge, pointing to the huge mandate he had received from Labour members and arguing that he had done better than many had expected in the electoral tests he had faced since becoming leader. MPs selected Owen Smith, a former member of his shadow cabinet who claimed to share the same left wing values, to take him on in another leadership election. The Labour leader continued to draw in crowds that other politicians can only dream of But critics joked that his endorsement by UB40 showed he was stuck in the 1980s So Jeremy Corbyn, the reluctant leader who had to be persuaded to stand in 2015, now found himself fighting to hold on to a position he never expected to hold, this time as favourite rather than as outsider. And, back on the campaign trail among his own supporters, he seemed to rather enjoy himself. As was the case a year earlier, thousands of people flocked to hear Mr Corbyn speak at rallies across the country  - 10,000 turned up at a single event in Liverpool - as he sought to tap directly into grassroots support for his message as a counterweight to the perceived hostility of the ""mainstream media"". In an unconventional campaign which saw him endorsed by UB40 but vilified by JK Rowling, the only genuine moment of discomfort came during ""traingate"" - when his claims that a train was so ""ram-packed"" that he had to sit on the floor came into question after Virgin Trains released footage showing him passing empty seats. Mr Corbyn's re-election has strengthened his position, with signs some of his critics are willing to serve under him again despite their differences. But it remains to be seen whether his commitment to reach out to his opponents and focus squarely on winning the next election will act as springboard to a new phase of his leadership or prove only a temporary respite in what some have said is an existential battle for control of the party.

We will all be watching India v England tomorrow."" Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib: ""We fight really well, the boys gave 100% but in the end we missed an opportunity to win the match. Credit to Pakistan, they controlled their nerves. ""We missed again. You can face a lot of these situations, we are working harder and harder. The matches we have lost, we have improved. ""It was bad luck [when I went for 18 in an over]. Hamid Hassan was injured, it was very difficult for Pakistan to chase that total on a turning wicket. It was the turning point.

"Queen speaks of 'great affection' for ScotlandAt a ceremony marking Holyrood's 20th anniversary, she said she ""fondly remembered"" opening the parliament.Scotland","This video can not be played The Queen: ""It [Holyrood] must also be a place to listen a place to hear views that inevitably may differ quite considerably."" The Queen has spoken of her ""great affection for Scotland"" while marking Holyrood's 20th anniversary. A ceremony took place two decades on from the Scottish Parliament taking on its legal powers. The Queen told MSPs that she ""fondly remembered"" opening the parliament, and said that it ""continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the monarch that MSPs were ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". The Queen, who was accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, spoke to each of Holyrood's party leaders personally as well as addressing them in the debating chamber. The ceremony also featured performances of music, poetry and song celebrating Scottish culture. Look back on the royal visit on Holyrood Live Holyrood quiz: 20 questions for 20 years The birth of a parliament The modern parliament was set up two years after Scotland voted overwhelmingly fordevolution in a referendum in 1997.It initially sat at the General Assembly in Edinburgh before moving to its Â£431m purpose-built home at Holyrood in 2004. The Queen was last in the landmark building in July 2016, marking the opening of the fifth session of the parliament. She told MSPs that it was with ""great pleasure"" that she had been present at each stage of the parliament's lifetime, ""including on landmark occasions such as today"". She said: ""Twenty years on, this chamber continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life, as an important forum to engage and unite diverse communities and also a home for passionate debate and discussion. ""Through new initiatives you continue to strive to be responsive and accountable to the people you serve, and to engage and involve those who might not otherwise participate in political debate."" Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders responded to the Queen's speech The Queen also said it was her ""sincere hope"" that MSPs would ""work tirelessly to improve people's lives and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad"". In response, Ms Sturgeon said the parliament may only be 20 years old, but ""has long come of age"". She said there had been times in the early years when ""the sense of challenge possibly outweighed the sense of optimism"", but said the hopes expressed for Holyrood in 1999 ""to a great extent have been vindicated"". And she said that while politics can seem ""more divided than ever"", parties ""can maintain our commitment to working together in the common good"", saying even political opponents are ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". Other party leaders also addressed the special occasion, with Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson saying that Holyrood was ""knitted into the fabric of our society"", adding that ""there is consensus that as a process, devolution has made our country stronger"". Young people who were born on the day the devolved parliament was convened on 1 July 1999 were also part of the celebrations. The so-called ""1 July babies"" were also an integral part of the 10th anniversary celebrations in 2009. Presiding Officer Ken Maintosh told them that ""you carry with you all our dreams, all our ambitions and all our hopes for the future"". Young people born on the day the parliament was reconvened were part of the celebrations at Holyrood The Queen was preceded into the chamber by the mace and Crown of Scotland, while a fanfare was played by the brass ensemble from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The ceremony included performances by the National Youth Choir of Scotland, singer Karen Matheson and a band fronted by folk musician Phil Cunningham. Scots Makar Jackie Kay performed a poem about the lifetime of the parliament titled ""The Long View"", which included sections in Gaelic and British Sign Language. And the monarch was piped out of the chamber by MSP Stuart McMillan, with members then joining in to sing ""A Man's a Man for a' That"" by Robert Burns. The Queen signed the parliament's guest book and was presented with a bouquet of flowers by 13-year-old Ewan Carmichael, before she was driven back across the road to Holyrood Palace.

Germany to return Nazi-stolen painting to Florence,"This video can not be played Where has this Nazi art gone? Germany says it will return a painting stolen by Nazi troops from the Uffizi Gallery in the Italian city of Florence in 1943. Vase of Flowers, estimated to be worth millions of euros, has been in the hands of a German family. In January Uffizi head Eike Schmidt said Germany had a ""moral duty"" to help bring it back to the museum. Dutch master Jan van Huysum painted the still life and it was first displayed in Florence in 1824. The Nazi art hoard that shocked the world 'Indiana Jones of art' strikes again 'We should give back art looted by the Nazis' German troops stole the work as they retreated north during World War Two. The painting resurfaced in 1991 following German reunification, but efforts to return it failed. The unidentified family had demanded up to â¬2m for the painting, reports said, while the German authorities had cited a statute of limitations on crimes more than 30 years old that it said prevented it from intervening. But after Mr Eiche's call for the painting's return, the German government contacted the descendants of the Nazi soldier who took it. The Uffizi Gallery head said Germany had a ""moral duty"" to return the stolen work The authorities said the painting had not been looted as part of organised Nazi persecution but had simply been stolen. This, lawyers argued, meant that the soldier who took it could not be seen as its owner and did not have the right to bequeath it to anyone, Die Zeit newspaper reported. Lawyers for the family meanwhile argued that the soldier had simply bought it at a market to have something nice to send to his wife, whose home had been bombed. No details of the agreement reached between the German government and the family have been released. According to the gallery, Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany originally bought the work at the start of the 19th Century. It was on display for over a century alongside works by other Dutch masters but was evacuated to a nearby village when Italy joined the war in 1940. German troops then seized it with other paintings as they moved north in 1943 following the Allied invasion of Italy. A black and white photo of Vase of Flowers has been hanging in the gallery - inscribed with the word ""stolen"" in English, German and Italian - during the wait for the original's return. Mr Schmidt - himself German - has called on Germany to abolish the statute of limitations on works stolen by the Nazis so all looted art can return to its ""legitimate owners"".

'Car payments are ruining our lives',"Mandy Quinn says more thorough affordability checks are needed ""Some nights are sleepless nights. I'm totally stressed out about it, I can't stop thinking about it."" Attempting to keep up with car finance payments is having a huge impact on Mandy Quinn's family. ""It's changed our lives, it's ruining our lives and that's the honest truth of it."" Complaints about car finance have increased sharply in the past year, according to figures seen by Money Box, and Mandy feels that her family should never have been put in the position they now find themselves in. Her 23-year-old daughter, Victoria, was sold a second hand Audi A1 on a five-year hire purchase deal in early 2017. Victoria put down Â£300 as a deposit and has to pay Â£329 a month for five years. As a first year university student with a part-time job she'd originally gone out looking for a much smaller - and less expensive - car to help her get to and from lectures. But she was persuaded to buy the Audi, which will end up costing her more than Â£20,000. Mandy says her other daughter, Natasha, also took out car finance and was told to bring in three pay slips to prove she could afford the repayments. But Mandy says there was nothing like that, what's known as an affordability assessment, for Victoria. Hire Purchase (HP): The total cost of the car is spread equally over each month of the deal, with the vehicle owned outright afterwards Personal Contract Purchase (PCP): Typically customers pay slightly less each month, but they have to hand the car back or pay a ""balloon"" payment of thousands of pounds at the end of an agreed period if they want to buy it outright With Victoria having recently lost her job, Mandy and her husband have been stepping in to help meet the payments. But they say they simply can't afford to anymore. In just a few short sentences Mandy Quinn has summed up the impact that trying to meet car finance repayments is having on her family. Victoria's now missed two payments in a row and has been told she now owes the car finance company, with other charges, more than Â£700. Mandy says Victoria's now being chased for the debt with multiple text messages and letters every week. ""Victoria is really embarrassed. She can see it's impacting on us,"" Mandy says. ""I think she was just silly, but I would have hoped that some kind of safeguarding procedures would have been in place to stop this happening to families [and] causing so much distress. ""I would have hoped she would have had to produced some kind of payslip, or a bank statement or something but there was nothing. It just seemed [wrong] to me she could go there and she could walk out of there with a Â£21,000 car - because my daughter's got nothing to prove she could afford those repayments."" TheFinancial Ombudsman Service,externalhas given figures to Money Box which show the number of complaints it has had about hire purchase products, the majority of which it says relate to car finance, has increased sharply in the past year. In 2017-18 there were 5,805, but last year that figure jumped by more than half to 8,943. The type of things people were complaining about were the quality of the car, not even knowing what type of finance they're on, and being sold cars on finance plans they can't afford. Â£45.9bn was borrowed in 2018 for car finance 91.2% of all new cars were bought using finance 2.9 million cars were financed by members of the Finance and Leasing Association Source: Finance and Leasing Association, 2018 annual report Stuart Masson, editor of thecarexpert.co.uk, says those numbers are the tip of the iceberg. ""The complaints that make it all the way to the Financial Ombudsman Service are a small number. But that's because most people don't get that far if they have a problem. Generally the first step is to call the finance company to be told 'bad luck, you still owe us the money'."" The Financial Conduct Authority, the watchdog responsible for regulating the car finance industry, introduced new guidelines in November 2018 after expressing concern some lenders weren't ""complying with FCA rules on assessing creditworthiness, including affordability"". That's an issue that is key to Mandy's question about how her daughter was able to sign up to a car finance plan for more than Â£20,000 without being asked to provide any evidence she could actually afford the repayments. ""She [Victoria] should never ever have been sold that, or offered a car like that. She should have been given [an affordability] test to prove she could afford it, but the company didn't do it. ""I think it's criminal, the impact it's had on the family, my daughter, it's outrageous."" Adrian Dally, head of motor finance for industry body the Finance and Leasing Association, says the overall numbers [of complaints] are ""very small compared with size of motor finance market"". ""Even if you assumed that most of the complaints were attributable to motor finance and all were upheld, it would equate to no more than one in every thousand agreements. But we are not complacent, hence all the new guidance produced for members and the development of a motor finance apprenticeship standard that was designed to ensure that training is embedded at every entry point to the industry.""

Who loses out in the US-China trade war?,"US President Donald Trump with China's top trade official, Vice Premier Liu He The US-China trade war has escalated in recent days, with both countries announcing new tariffs on each other's goods. US President Donald Trump has said repeatedly that China will pay these taxes, even though his economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, on Sunday admitted that US firms pay the tariffs on any goods brought in from China. So is Mr Trump wrong when he says the trade war is good for the US, and generating billions of dollars for the US Treasury? And who will lose most as the conflict escalates? US importers, not Chinese firms, pay the tariffs in the form of taxes to the US government, confirms Christophe Bondy, a lawyer at Cooley LLP. Mr Bondy, who was senior counsel to the Canadian government during the Canada-EU free trade agreement negotiations, says it is likely that these additional costs are then simply passed on to US consumers in the form of higher prices. ""They [the tariffs] have a strongly disruptive effect on supply chains,"" he said. China remains America's top trading partner, with exports rising 7% last year. However, trade flows to the US slipped 9% in the first quarter of 2019, suggesting the trade war is starting to bite. Despite this, Dr Meredith Crowley, a trade expert at the University of Cambridge, says there is no evidence that Chinese firms have cut their prices in a bid to keep US firms buying. ""Some exporters of highly substitutable goods have just dropped out of the market as US firms have started importing from elsewhere. Their margins are too thin and tariffs are clearly hurting them. ""I suspect those selling highly differentiated goods have not reduced their prices, possibly because US importers rely on them too much."" Last year Coca-Cola raised its prices in the US in response to higher import costs According to two academic studies published in March, American businesses and consumers paid almost the entire cost of US trade tariffs imposed on imports from China and elsewhere last year. Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University calculated,externalthat duties imposed on a wide range of imports, from steel to washing machines, cost US firms and consumers $3bn (Â£2.3bn) a month in additional tax costs. It also identified a further $1.4bn in losses linked to depressed demand. The second paper,external, penned by among others, Pinelopi Goldberg, the World Bank's chief economist, also found that consumers and US companies were paying most of the costs of the tariffs. According to its analysis, after taking into account the retaliation by other countries, the biggest victims of Trump's trade wars were farmers and blue-collar workers in areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election. Mr Trump has said US firms that import from China should look elsewhere - perhaps to Vietnam - or better still buy their goods from American manufacturers. But Mr Bondy says it is not so simple. ""It takes a long time for productivity and value chains to be reoriented and that all comes at a cost. ""Take the steel tariffs the US imposed last year - it is not like all of a sudden there are hundreds of new factories being built in the US."" China is also a manufacturing powerhouse, dwarfing its nearest rivals, which makes it hard to replace it in global supply chains. President Obama placed a steep tariff of 35% on Chinese tyres There is little evidence to suggest they have, say both Dr Crowley and Mr Bondy. In 2009, President Obama placed a steep tariff of 35% on Chinese tyres, citing a surge in imports that was costing US jobs. However,research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics,externalin 2012 found the cost to American consumers from higher tyre prices was around $1.1bn in 2011. Although about 1,200 manufacturing jobs were saved, it said, the additional money US consumers spent reduced their spending on other retail goods, ""indirectly lowering employment in the retail industry"". ""Adding further to the loss column, China retaliated by imposing antidumping duties on US exports of chicken parts, costing that industry around $1bn in sales,"" it said. The one example usually given to defend tariffs is US President Ronald Reagan's decision to impose steep duties on Japanese motorcycles in 1983. The move is credited as saving struggling US bike-maker Harley Davidson from a surge of foreign competition. But some have argued it was the company's own efforts - including modernising its factories and building better engines - that really drove its turnaround. Tariffs in the 80s were credited with saving Harley Davidson Dr Crowley says the duties may draw China back to the negotiating table, but she does not expect them to offer radical compromises. ""Yes they are having more of a growth slowdown, and they export more to the US than vice versa, so they will suffer more from a trade war. ""But they are not really interested in changing their laws, and even if they did, do they really have the legal culture to enforce it?"" Mr Bondy thinks Mr Trump's tariffs threats are more about whipping up his voter base and making headlines. ""Tariffs are easier to understand than the painstaking work of negotiating common sets of rules on things like the behaviour of state-owned entities, protection of intellectual property, fair access to markets and baseline protections for workers and the environment.""

UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight planThe hurried procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers Â£85m.,"The freight plan aims to take the pressure of the crossing from Dover to France Transport companies are being asked to bid to provide extra freight capacity to be used in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The hurried ferry procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers more than Â£85m. That included Â£34m in a settlement and legal fees with Eurotunnel - which said it was not considered for the contract. The government said it would not be committing to buying extra capacity but would have options to do so if needed. ""The Department for Transport is putting in place a freight capacity framework agreement that will provide government departments with the ability to secure freight capacity for our critical supply chains as and when required,"" a spokesman said. ""This framework does not commit the government to purchasing or reserving any freight capacity, but it does provide a flexible list of operators and options for the provision of the capacity that can be drawn upon if needed."" The government had previously awarded Seaborne Freight, DFDS and Brittany Ferries contracts worth more than Â£100m - all of which were eventually cancelled. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling faced calls to resign after he was forced to axe a Â£13.8m contract with Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships or trading history. All three previous contracts - intended to offer extra capacity and relieve potential congestion at ports like Dover - had been awarded without a full public tender process and prompted legal action from Eurotunnel. No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried Government pays Â£33m over Brexit ferry case Government warned over Brexit ferry payout The government also had to pay more than Â£51m to cancel agreements with DFDS and Brittany Ferries when the UK asked the EU for an extension to the withdrawal process meaning it did not leave as planned on 29 March. This time, the Department for Transport is pursuing an open process, inviting bids from all ""suitably qualified freight operators"". Andrew Dean, a former government lawyer who is now director of public law at Clifford Chance, said: ""The department has played a straight bat, having opted to follow a relatively low-risk procurement approach that is open to suppliers from across the EU and beyond."" BBC business correspondent Joe Miller said that Eurotunnel would be able to bid this time around, as the notice invites applications ""regardless of transport mode"", as long as they offer ""roll-on, roll-off capacity"" for lorries. Seaborne Freight confirmed it would not be bidding again, while Britanny Ferries said it would ""carefully consider"" what capacity it could offer the government.

But he added: ""Some things do appear excessive to us... They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles. ""Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population.""

Queen speaks of 'great affection' for ScotlandThe address to MSPs was part of a ceremony marking 20 years of the Scottish Parliament.Scotland,"This video can not be played The Queen: ""It [Holyrood] must also be a place to listen a place to hear views that inevitably may differ quite considerably."" The Queen has spoken of her ""great affection for Scotland"" while marking Holyrood's 20th anniversary. A ceremony took place two decades on from the Scottish Parliament taking on its legal powers. The Queen told MSPs that she ""fondly remembered"" opening the parliament, and said that it ""continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the monarch that MSPs were ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". The Queen, who was accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, spoke to each of Holyrood's party leaders personally as well as addressing them in the debating chamber. The ceremony also featured performances of music, poetry and song celebrating Scottish culture. Look back on the royal visit on Holyrood Live Holyrood quiz: 20 questions for 20 years The birth of a parliament The modern parliament was set up two years after Scotland voted overwhelmingly fordevolution in a referendum in 1997.It initially sat at the General Assembly in Edinburgh before moving to its Â£431m purpose-built home at Holyrood in 2004. The Queen was last in the landmark building in July 2016, marking the opening of the fifth session of the parliament. She told MSPs that it was with ""great pleasure"" that she had been present at each stage of the parliament's lifetime, ""including on landmark occasions such as today"". She said: ""Twenty years on, this chamber continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life, as an important forum to engage and unite diverse communities and also a home for passionate debate and discussion. ""Through new initiatives you continue to strive to be responsive and accountable to the people you serve, and to engage and involve those who might not otherwise participate in political debate."" Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders responded to the Queen's speech The Queen also said it was her ""sincere hope"" that MSPs would ""work tirelessly to improve people's lives and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad"". In response, Ms Sturgeon said the parliament may only be 20 years old, but ""has long come of age"". She said there had been times in the early years when ""the sense of challenge possibly outweighed the sense of optimism"", but said the hopes expressed for Holyrood in 1999 ""to a great extent have been vindicated"". And she said that while politics can seem ""more divided than ever"", parties ""can maintain our commitment to working together in the common good"", saying even political opponents are ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". Other party leaders also addressed the special occasion, with Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson saying that Holyrood was ""knitted into the fabric of our society"", adding that ""there is consensus that as a process, devolution has made our country stronger"". Young people who were born on the day the devolved parliament was convened on 1 July 1999 were also part of the celebrations. The so-called ""1 July babies"" were also an integral part of the 10th anniversary celebrations in 2009. Presiding Officer Ken Maintosh told them that ""you carry with you all our dreams, all our ambitions and all our hopes for the future"". Young people born on the day the parliament was reconvened were part of the celebrations at Holyrood The Queen was preceded into the chamber by the mace and Crown of Scotland, while a fanfare was played by the brass ensemble from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The ceremony included performances by the National Youth Choir of Scotland, singer Karen Matheson and a band fronted by folk musician Phil Cunningham. Scots Makar Jackie Kay performed a poem about the lifetime of the parliament titled ""The Long View"", which included sections in Gaelic and British Sign Language. And the monarch was piped out of the chamber by MSP Stuart McMillan, with members then joining in to sing ""A Man's a Man for a' That"" by Robert Burns. The Queen signed the parliament's guest book and was presented with a bouquet of flowers by 13-year-old Ewan Carmichael, before she was driven back across the road to Holyrood Palace.

UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight planThe hurried procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers Â£85m.Business,"The freight plan aims to take the pressure of the crossing from Dover to France Transport companies are being asked to bid to provide extra freight capacity to be used in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The hurried ferry procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers more than Â£85m. That included Â£34m in a settlement and legal fees with Eurotunnel - which said it was not considered for the contract. The government said it would not be committing to buying extra capacity but would have options to do so if needed. ""The Department for Transport is putting in place a freight capacity framework agreement that will provide government departments with the ability to secure freight capacity for our critical supply chains as and when required,"" a spokesman said. ""This framework does not commit the government to purchasing or reserving any freight capacity, but it does provide a flexible list of operators and options for the provision of the capacity that can be drawn upon if needed."" The government had previously awarded Seaborne Freight, DFDS and Brittany Ferries contracts worth more than Â£100m - all of which were eventually cancelled. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling faced calls to resign after he was forced to axe a Â£13.8m contract with Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships or trading history. All three previous contracts - intended to offer extra capacity and relieve potential congestion at ports like Dover - had been awarded without a full public tender process and prompted legal action from Eurotunnel. No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried Government pays Â£33m over Brexit ferry case Government warned over Brexit ferry payout The government also had to pay more than Â£51m to cancel agreements with DFDS and Brittany Ferries when the UK asked the EU for an extension to the withdrawal process meaning it did not leave as planned on 29 March. This time, the Department for Transport is pursuing an open process, inviting bids from all ""suitably qualified freight operators"". Andrew Dean, a former government lawyer who is now director of public law at Clifford Chance, said: ""The department has played a straight bat, having opted to follow a relatively low-risk procurement approach that is open to suppliers from across the EU and beyond."" BBC business correspondent Joe Miller said that Eurotunnel would be able to bid this time around, as the notice invites applications ""regardless of transport mode"", as long as they offer ""roll-on, roll-off capacity"" for lorries. Seaborne Freight confirmed it would not be bidding again, while Britanny Ferries said it would ""carefully consider"" what capacity it could offer the government.

"" Nicola Sturgeon thanks the Queen for her support of the parliament In her response, Nicola Sturgeon recalled the ""optimism"" for the Scottish Parliament when it was created, but also spoke about the ""scale of the challenge"" MSPs faced then.

Ms Sturgeon added: ""Although this parliament is only 20 years young, it has long come of age.""

But he added: ""Some things do appear excessive to us... They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles. ""Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population.""

In a Facebook post, it said it had ""no new information to share regarding baby India"". But according to Tom Rawlings, the director of Georgia's Division of Family and Children Services, there is no shortage of families willing to adopt her.

The move is a major concession to China and US companies, which opposed the ban when it was introduced in May.

LiveLivePakistan face AfghanistanPakistan face Afghanistan at Headingley knowing they can leapfrog England in the race for a World Cup semi-final place if they win.BBC Sport,"Pakistan go above England in World Cup table Imad Wasim stars with unbeaten 49 as Pakistan win with two balls to spare Afghanistan posted 227-9 thanks to stubborn middle order Afghan and Najibullah both make 42 Shaheen impresses once again, taking four wickets - including two in two balls Callum Matthews Right, we'll leave it there for today. You can read Amy Lofthouse's report from Headingleyhere. You can follow New Zealand's chase of 244 against Australiahere. We'll see you tomorrow morning for England v India. Just a reminder, that win means Pakistan leapfrog England into fourth place and the final semi-final slot. England face the prospect of having to beat India and New Zealand in their final two games to qualify. In the end, after a disastrous Gulbadin Naib over that went for 18, Pakistan creeped over the line with two balls left. Haris Sohail, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Imad Wasim all got reprieves via such average fielding and poor umpiring. Mohammad Hafeez and Haris Sohail shared 40 before Hafeez tamely hit to backward point. Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam then shared 72 but both fell quickly to leave Pakistan 81-3. Mujeeb Ur Rahman trapped Fakhar Zaman lbw off the second ball of Pakistan's reply. Wahab Riaz's yorker dismissed Hamid Hassan for one as Afghanistan limped to 227-9 off their 50 overs. Najibullah Zadran played well for his 42 before he became Shaheen Afridi's third wicket. Rahmat Shah fell tamely before Asghar Afghan and Ikram Ali Khil shared 64 for the fourth-wicket but both fall quickly to fell Afghanistan 125-5. Captain Gulbadin Naib and Rahmat Shah got Afghanistan off to a decent start before Gulbadin was given out caught behind on review. Hashmatullah Shahidi was out next ball to give Shaheen Afridi two in two. Right, let's run through the best moments from that thriller. Mel JonesEx-Australia batter on BBC Test Match Special Hamid Hassan played in Afghanistan's first ever game, their first World Cup win and again today. Him being injured made a massive difference. They will learn from this. Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed:""Thank you all the fans, they cheered every ball. It is a great win for us on not an easy pitch. ""We know it was not an easy target. Their bowlers used the conditions very well. Everyone chipped in, it was good team work. ""We all know that it is not easy to win our last four games, we go match by match. We will all be watching India v England tomorrow."" Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib: ""We fight really well, the boys gave 100% but in the end we missed an opportunity to win the match. Credit to Pakistan, they controlled their nerves. ""We missed again. You can face a lot of these situations, we are working harder and harder. The matches we have lost, we have improved. ""It was bad luck [when I went for 18 in an over]. Hamid Hassan was injured, it was very difficult for Pakistan to chase that total on a turning wicket. It was the turning point. ""We didn't score enough, including myself. To win these sort of matches we need someone to get 80, 90,100."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Councils 'to make Â£1bn' from parking charges,"Councils in England could make a record surplus of Â£1bn from parking charges and penalties this year, a study says. An analysis of budgets commissioned by the RAC Foundation found authorities expect to make a total surplus of Â£913m from parking activities in 2019-20. But it found the amount made in the last three years was underestimated. Councils point out surplus money from parking must be spent on local transport. Westminster council had the largest estimated surplus of Â£72.1m. This was followed by five other London councils - Kensington and Chelsea (Â£36m), Camden (Â£28.3m), Islington (Â£25.9m), Wandsworth (Â£25.9m) and Hammersmith and Fulham (Â£25.6m). The study examined budget figures provided by councils to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Of the 343 councils in the study, 278 said they expected to record a surplus from parking for the current financial year. Driver amasses Â£32,000 in parking fines Grace period granted for pizza pick-ups UK parking spaces to be made 'app ready' Some 65 councils said they were preparing to break even or incur a loss, the research said. The highest budgeted surplus outside of London was Brighton and Hove (Â£24m) in seventh place, with other authorities in the top 20 including Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (Â£13.7m), Bristol (Â£12.5m), and Birmingham (Â£12.4m). RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding described Â£1bn as ""quite a windfall from a service that is intended to be all about managing traffic"". Martin Tett, a spokesman for the Local Government Association, said councils were ""on the side of motorists"" but must ""strike a balance"" when setting parking policy to ensure ""there are spaces available for residents, high streets are kept vibrant and traffic is kept moving"". He added any income raised through on-street parking charges was spent ""on running parking services"", while surplus was ""only spent on essential transport projects"" such as solvingthe roads repair backlog.

Red Sox and Yankees set for London games,"This video can not be played How to explain Yankees-Red Sox rivalry to foreigners 2019 MLB London Series Dates:29-30 JuneVenue:London Stadium Coverage:Streamed live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website The so-called 'Big Four' American sports are huge across the pond, but their popularity is also growing on British soil. More than 275,000 fans attended one of the four NFL or NBA games London has hosted since October 2018, alongside sports stars, music artists and other famous faces. Inspired by the success of basketball and American football, Major League Baseball is hoping to make its mark with its European debut in London this weekend. Here's all you need to know before baseball's British arrival this weekend. Will the United Kingdom take to baseball? Clay and dirt for the baseball field have also been imported from the US An intrinsic part of American culture, baseball is now aiming to convince a European audience of its merit with a blockbuster fixture. The upcoming fixtures between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox will see the biggest and oldest rivalry in US sport played out in front of more than 130,000 fans over the two days at London Stadium. In 1920, the Red Sox soldBabe Ruth,one of the sport's greatest ever players, to the Yankees in what has since become known as 'The Curse of the Bambino'. The trade sparked an 86-year drought between 1918 to 2004 in which the Red Sox failed to win the World Series. The Red Sox entered this week on a six-game winning streak, while the Yankees have 10 wins in the last 11 games, the most recent coming on Tuesday against the Toronto Blue Jays, in which the Yankeesset a Major League Baseball recordby hitting a home run in 28 consecutive games. This video can not be played MLB London: Why the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry is so big Tickets sold out almost instantly, despite inflated costs compared to equivalent fixtures at the Yankee Stadium or Fenway Park. Secondary ticket seller StubHub said it is the ""best-selling game(s) of the 2019 regular season"", with general manager Jill Krimmel adding fans from 44 American states and 27 different countries had bought tickets. But fear not if you're not one of the lucky ticket holders, as both Saturday and Sunday's historic meetings between the two sides will be streamed live on theBBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app. Saturday's game starts at 18:00 BST while Sunday's game begins at 15:00 BST. West Ham's 66,000-seater stadium has been transformed into a ball park for the weekend The NFL has held annual regular season games in the capital since 2007. Similarly, the NBA has maintained a British presence since 2011. So, why is 'America's pastime' late to the party? ""The NFL and the NBA have done a very good job and have been here for a long time, so they are already established in this market,""MLB director of growth and strategy for EMEA Kelhem Salter said.,external ""We're very much looking for ways to differentiate ourselves and to stand out, but also to represent our sport and our league in a way that speaks for our values. ""So the relevance and the cultural positioning that MLB has in the UK and Europe provides a real opportunity for us to create a different proposition."" Looking for the rules of baseball?

Queen marks 20 years of the Scottish Parliament,"This video can not be played The Queen: ""It [Holyrood] must also be a place to listen a place to hear views that inevitably may differ quite considerably."" The Queen has spoken of her ""great affection for Scotland"" while marking Holyrood's 20th anniversary. A ceremony took place two decades on from the Scottish Parliament taking on its legal powers. The Queen told MSPs that she ""fondly remembered"" opening the parliament, and said that it ""continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the monarch that MSPs were ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". The Queen, who was accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, spoke to each of Holyrood's party leaders personally as well as addressing them in the debating chamber. The ceremony also featured performances of music, poetry and song celebrating Scottish culture. Look back on the royal visit on Holyrood Live Holyrood quiz: 20 questions for 20 years The birth of a parliament The modern parliament was set up two years after Scotland voted overwhelmingly fordevolution in a referendum in 1997.It initially sat at the General Assembly in Edinburgh before moving to its Â£431m purpose-built home at Holyrood in 2004. The Queen was last in the landmark building in July 2016, marking the opening of the fifth session of the parliament. She told MSPs that it was with ""great pleasure"" that she had been present at each stage of the parliament's lifetime, ""including on landmark occasions such as today"". She said: ""Twenty years on, this chamber continues to be at the centre of Scottish public life, as an important forum to engage and unite diverse communities and also a home for passionate debate and discussion. ""Through new initiatives you continue to strive to be responsive and accountable to the people you serve, and to engage and involve those who might not otherwise participate in political debate."" Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders responded to the Queen's speech The Queen also said it was her ""sincere hope"" that MSPs would ""work tirelessly to improve people's lives and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad"". In response, Ms Sturgeon said the parliament may only be 20 years old, but ""has long come of age"". She said there had been times in the early years when ""the sense of challenge possibly outweighed the sense of optimism"", but said the hopes expressed for Holyrood in 1999 ""to a great extent have been vindicated"". And she said that while politics can seem ""more divided than ever"", parties ""can maintain our commitment to working together in the common good"", saying even political opponents are ""united by our desire to do our best for the people"". Other party leaders also addressed the special occasion, with Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson saying that Holyrood was ""knitted into the fabric of our society"", adding that ""there is consensus that as a process, devolution has made our country stronger"". Young people who were born on the day the devolved parliament was convened on 1 July 1999 were also part of the celebrations. The so-called ""1 July babies"" were also an integral part of the 10th anniversary celebrations in 2009. Presiding Officer Ken Maintosh told them that ""you carry with you all our dreams, all our ambitions and all our hopes for the future"". Young people born on the day the parliament was reconvened were part of the celebrations at Holyrood The Queen was preceded into the chamber by the mace and Crown of Scotland, while a fanfare was played by the brass ensemble from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The ceremony included performances by the National Youth Choir of Scotland, singer Karen Matheson and a band fronted by folk musician Phil Cunningham. Scots Makar Jackie Kay performed a poem about the lifetime of the parliament titled ""The Long View"", which included sections in Gaelic and British Sign Language. And the monarch was piped out of the chamber by MSP Stuart McMillan, with members then joining in to sing ""A Man's a Man for a' That"" by Robert Burns. The Queen signed the parliament's guest book and was presented with a bouquet of flowers by 13-year-old Ewan Carmichael, before she was driven back across the road to Holyrood Palace.

North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis,"Most children receive basic education, though some are forced to drop out of school early After decades in the political wilderness, North Korea has spent the past year in a flurry of diplomatic activity. But talks with the US, China and South Korea have so far focused entirely on trade and denuclearisation. North Korea's woeful human rights record is one topic that is yet to come up - and it's likely to remain that way. The UN says North Koreans live under ""systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations"". Here are just some of the issues: Isolated from the rest of the world, North Korea has been ruled by the Kim family for three generations, and its citizens are required to show complete devotion to the family and its current leader, Kim Jong-un. The state controls everything, and actively spies on its citizens using a vast surveillance and informer network. The economy is also strictly controlled and the government funnels money into its nuclear and missile programme despite widespread shortages of food, fuel and other basic necessities. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), told the BBC that North Korea has only been able to develop an expensive nuclear programme because it is a totalitarian state, and it's done so by ""taking food out of the stomachs of hungry North Koreans"". North Korea's media is arguably the most tightly controlled in the world.Reporters without Borders (RSF) ranks it last in its World Press Freedom Index.,external North Koreans get all their news, entertainment and information from state media, which unfailingly praises the leadership. According to RSF, citizens can be sent to prison for viewing, reading or listening to content provided by international media outlets. The Korean Central News Agency is the world's main media window on North Korea Mobile phones are more common than they used to be, but making an overseas phone call doesn't come easy. ""You would have to get a Chinese cell phone on the black market, drive to the Chinese border and then even along the way state agents may stop you,"" Arnold Fang, a researcher from Amnesty International, explained to the BBC. Internet access is available for the elite few in the capital, Pyongyang, who lead relatively comfortable lives. Others may have restricted access. The country has its own very basic intranet - a closed network which certain people are allowed to use. But most North Koreans will likely never go online. What the North Korean internet really looks like North Korea error opens door to fake Twitter account Surfing the internet in North Korea 'A steady stream of propaganda' The constitution promises a ""right to faith"" and there are Buddhists, Shamanists and followers of Chondoism - a native Korean religion - North Korea. State-controlled churches also exist. But Mr Fang says this is all largely for show. ""In reality, there is no freedom of religion. Everyone is indoctrinated to treat the Kim family almost as something to worship."" A 2014 UN report said Christians face ""persecution and severe punishments"" if they practiced their religion outside state-controlled churches.,external North Korea also takes a dim view on foreign missionaries. Among its most famous detainees was Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American evangelist who ran Christian tours to North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in 2013 for ""anti-government"" crimes. He was released in 2014 on health grounds. ""North Korea has been said to be the world's biggest open prison camp,"" said Mr Adams. ""I don't think that's unfair."" According to a report by the US State Department, there are between 80,000 and 120,000 people in prison in the North.,external This satellite image shows a North Korean prison camp that has extensive facilities People can be jailed for almost anything, activists say, with crimes ranging from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect. Reality Check: North Korea's secretive prison system North Korea's secret slave gangs What's it like to live in North Korea? People convicted of political crimes are often sent to brutal labour camps, which involve physical work such as mining and logging. Amnesty has described the prison camps as ""harsh beyond endurance"". Detainees face torture and beatings by guards, and women are left especially vulnerable to sexual coercion and abuse. Not all those in prison have actually committed crimes. North Korea practices collective punishment, so if one member of a family is found guilty it's possible that their whole family gets punished. North Korea makes liberal use of the death penalty and has been known to conduct public executions. Foreign nationals in North Korea have been arrested and detained for extended periods of time - often kept as prisoners for political reasons and used as diplomatic pawns at opportune moments. 22-year-old Otto Warmbier (C) had travelled to North Korea as a tourist in 2016 Three US citizens, who were jailed for anti-state activities and placed in labour camps, were freed from North Korean prison as a gesture of goodwillahead of the US-North Korea leadership summit in 2018. But US student Otto Warmbier was not so lucky. Mr Warmbierwas arrested in 2016 for stealing a propaganda sign.He was released after 17 months in detention on health grounds, but was seriously ill - he died days after returning home. His parents, who believe he had been tortured, sued North Korea over his death. Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? North Korea tourism: A dangerous gamble? Six South Korean prisoners are still believed to be in detention. North Korea has also admitted to kidnapping at least 13 Japanese citizens in the 1970s, who they used to train their spies in the Japanese language and customs. Among other noted kidnappings were a famous South Korean actress and her ex-husband, a film director, who were taken in the 1970s. They were forced to make films for the state but later managed to escape. Actress kidnapped by North Korea dies A significant majority of North Koreans undertake unpaid labour at some point in their lives, according to a HRW report.,external Former students who defected from North Korea told HRW that their schools forced them to work for free on farms twice a year - at ploughing and harvest time - for one month at a time. Some North American detainees, who have now been released, recalled being forced to work on a farm while detained North Korea also sends hundreds of thousands of people to work overseas as low-cost labour - with many of them essentially working under slave-like conditions. It has sent workers to places like China, Kuwait and Qatar - though most countries have stopped renewing work visas to North Koreans to comply with UN sanctions. However, reports have emerged that North Koreans are still working in some places despite sanctions. This video can not be played Panorama went undercover to reveal secret work gangs. ""Many overseas workers live in a monitored dormitory where there is no freedom of movement, rendering them essentially prisoners,"" said Mr Adams. A large percentage of workers' salaries are usually seized by the state - a huge source of income for the country. Discrimination against women very much exists, but ""there isn't a way to measure inequality in the North like how you measure the wage gap between males and females"", says Mr Fang. Some North Korean women say that sexual harassment is rife in the military Though North Korea presents itself as nominally equal society, women are said to be deprived of education and job opportunities. Rape and no periods in North Korea's army North Korean begs China not to deport wife and young son ""Women are really vulnerable - sexual violence exists but if someone assaults them they have no-one to complain to,"" says Mr Adams. Reports are also rampant of women facing torture, rape and other sexual abuses while held in detention facilities - and of widespread sexual abuse in the military. Children in North Korea do receive education, though some have to drop out of school early to help their families survive economically, according to Mr Fang. This 2004 photo shows a North Korean boy eating vitamin and mineral-enriched food supplied by the United Nations World Food Programme The school curriculum is ""dominated by the country's political agenda, restricting their knowledge from a very early age"". According to Unicef, 200,000 North Korean children are suffering from acute malnutrition,external- of which 60,000 would have become ""severely malnourished"". North Korea routinely rejects criticism of its rights records - it has said its citizens ""feel proud of the world's most advantageous human rights system"" - and points the finger at the flaws of other countries. But Mr Adams of HRW says the topic of human rights in North Korea is ""a bottomless pit"". ""Everyone's looking out for their own interests. No-one's looking out for the interests of North Korea's citizens"". Rape and no periods in North Korea's army How I fled North Korea.

London Bridge coroner 'not critical' of police,"The coroner at the London Bridge inquests said he was ""not convinced"" MI5 and police missed any opportunities that would have prevented the attack. The inquests into the deaths of the eight victims ended with chief coroner of England and Wales Mark Lucraft concluding they were unlawfully killed. He said he would not be criticising MI5 and the police in his conclusions. But Mr Lucraft did criticise the lack of barriers on the bridge - a ""particularly vulnerable"" location. The attack, in June 2017, happened only two and half months after the Westminster Bridge attack. Mr Lucraft said the lack of barriers showed ""weaknesses in systems for assessing the need for such measures... and implementing them promptly"". The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, Sebastien Belanger, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden But some victims' friends and families remain critical of the police. Philippe Pigeard, whose 26-year-old son Alexandre Pigeard was killed, also pointed to the lack of barriers, saying: ""I think this attack could have been prevented."" Speaking after the inquest concluded, he said there were ""a lot of missed opportunities"" to neutralise at least one of the attackers who was known to be dangerous. Christine Delcros, who was severely injured and lost her boyfriend, Xavier Thomas, in the attack highlighted a ""catalogue of failings"". Ms Delcros said it was ""staggering"" that Butt, a ""well known extremist"", was allowed to work within the London Transport network, and that ""opportunities to identify all the attackers and disrupt their activities did not occur"". Chaos and killings: 10 minutes at London Bridge Victims of the London Bridge attack The partygoer who turned into a killer Mr Pigeard also paid tribute to nurse Helen Kennett, who came to his son's aid. Ms Kennett, who was out to celebrate her birthday,was stabbed in the neckas she tried to help. Standing next to Ms Kennett outside court, Mr Pigeard said: ""I want to thank so much Helen for her courage. ""She came to help my son who was bleeding to death. She was stabbed too in a few seconds."" Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu disputed claims that opportunities were lost. Citing the coroner's findings, Mr Basu said: ""Even those closest to the attackers, and we have heard from them during the inquest, knew nothing of their murderous plans."" He said it will ""never be possible to stop every plot"". This video can not be played Philippe Pigeard believes the attack in which his son Alexandre was killed could have been stopped Summing up evidence earlier, the coroner had said the family of attacker Khuram Butt were not ""convincing witnesses"" in court. He said each of Butt's family members ""accepted that they should now have done more at the time"" and that they all ""knew something of his extreme views"". Four of Butt's family gave evidence during the inquest at the Old Bailey: his widow Zahrah Rehman, brother-in-law Usman Darr, brother Saad Butt, and sister Haleema Butt. Khuram Butt, 27, was the ringleader of the three attackers Mr Lucraft said he could understand the pressures on Saad Butt - whose daughter had been killed in an accident. But he said: ""It seems to me that on the basis of what he accepted he did know of his brother and the worrying views he was espousing, he did very little, if anything, to accurately monitor his brother's movements."" Earlier in the inquest Butt's widow,Ms Rehman, told the courthis actions were ""disgusting"" and their children would never know where his grave was. She said she would not grieve for his death and also denied prior knowledge of her husband's plot - although she said she had been worried he wanted to go to Syria. The coroner praised police officers, medics and members of the public who rushed to help on the night of the attack despite the danger. PC Charlie Guenigault, 27, was off duty when he took on the three attackers alongside British Transport Police PC Wayne Marques and Spanish banker Ignacio Echeverria. He said: ""In my head I just see all three of them standing in front of me, knives in hand and fake vests on and that look of, 'We're going to kill you,' basically that sort of anger in their eyes."" This video can not be played Anton Sobanski was driving the number 43 across London Bridge when the attack happened PC Guenigault, who was awarded the George Medal, said he ""played dead"" after being stabbed in the head. Ringleader Butt, 27, alongside Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before getting out and stabbing people in and around Borough Market. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed. Another 48 people were injured. The three attackers were shot dead by police less than 10 minutes after the rampage began.

"Councils 'to make Â£1bn' from parking chargesEnglish councils could have a record surplus from parking charges and penalties this year, a study says.UK","Councils in England could make a record surplus of Â£1bn from parking charges and penalties this year, a study says. An analysis of budgets commissioned by the RAC Foundation found authorities expect to make a total surplus of Â£913m from parking activities in 2019-20. But it found the amount made in the last three years was underestimated. Councils point out surplus money from parking must be spent on local transport. Westminster council had the largest estimated surplus of Â£72.1m. This was followed by five other London councils - Kensington and Chelsea (Â£36m), Camden (Â£28.3m), Islington (Â£25.9m), Wandsworth (Â£25.9m) and Hammersmith and Fulham (Â£25.6m). The study examined budget figures provided by councils to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Of the 343 councils in the study, 278 said they expected to record a surplus from parking for the current financial year. Driver amasses Â£32,000 in parking fines Grace period granted for pizza pick-ups UK parking spaces to be made 'app ready' Some 65 councils said they were preparing to break even or incur a loss, the research said. The highest budgeted surplus outside of London was Brighton and Hove (Â£24m) in seventh place, with other authorities in the top 20 including Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (Â£13.7m), Bristol (Â£12.5m), and Birmingham (Â£12.4m). RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding described Â£1bn as ""quite a windfall from a service that is intended to be all about managing traffic"". Martin Tett, a spokesman for the Local Government Association, said councils were ""on the side of motorists"" but must ""strike a balance"" when setting parking policy to ensure ""there are spaces available for residents, high streets are kept vibrant and traffic is kept moving"". He added any income raised through on-street parking charges was spent ""on running parking services"", while surplus was ""only spent on essential transport projects"" such as solvingthe roads repair backlog.

Partygoer who became a killer,"As a teenager, Khuram Butt - the ringleader of the London Bridge terror attack - was a cannabis-smoking ""wannabe bad man"" who regularly indulged in petty crime. As an adult, he retained all of those habits - even as he attacked others for being ""bad"" Muslims. Those closest to him paint a picture of an easily-influenced man given to obsessions. It was that obsessive nature which led him to Islamic extremism and, ultimately, to murder. Details of his life emergedduring the inquest into those deaths,external. Although coroner Mark Lucraft said none of the members of Butt's family who gave evidence was a ""convincing witness"", their accounts reveal a controlling man with a history of violence, who lived a life of contradictions. Born in Jhelum, Pakistan, on 20 April 1990, Khuram Butt had two older siblings, brother Saad and sister Haleema. His father ran a furniture business and while his family members were practising Muslims, they were not particularly religious. They arrived in the UK in 1998 on a visitors' visa when Butt was eight. All three of the children attended schools in Forest Gate and Stratford in east London, with Butt doing well in his end of school exams - he gained 11 GCSEs. The family attempted to claim asylum, which was initially refused. But in 2004 - following the death of his father from a heart attack - Butt was given indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He worked as a cashier at a pizza takeaway after school, before getting a job in the stockroom at Topshop on London's Oxford Street. He received his first police caution at 18 for fraudulently using a friend's payment card on public transport. From his teenage years Butt went clubbing, smoked drugs, indulged in casual sex and was described as a ""wannabe gangster"". In 2009 he became an office assistant at a removals firm. But despite being in full-time employment, later working in a number of KFC takeaways, the life of petty crime still appealed. In December 2010, when he was 20, he received a second caution for common assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a scuffle with a security guard at a shopping centre. Two year's later, Butt's sister married. At the wedding he met a man named Hashim Rehman, whose uncle had worked with his father. Afterwards Butt began to be more observant. He spent time with him, reading Islamic literature and praying five times a day. He also ended a relationship with his then girlfriend because she refused to convert to Islam. Mr Rehman told police that rediscovering religion changed Butt, initially making him a softer and more humble man. Butt went on to ask Mr Rehman for his sister Zahrah's hand, and they were married on 25 December. Brother of London Bridge killer 'sorry' London attacker's widow 'will not grieve' Initially, his newly found fervour for Islam was seen as a good thing. He began staying in and attended his mosque more regularly. But the inquest heard his religious devotion began tipping into an increasingly extreme version of Islam. On their wedding day, Butt insisted his new wife should wear a burqa and sat her behind a wooden screen so she could only be seen by him. His brother later took the screen down. After returning from their honeymoon in Pakistan, Butt moved Ms Rehman into the home he shared with his mother, brother and sister-in-law. His brother, Saad, said that Butt insisted his new wife wore a full-face veil and gloves inside the house. ""I think that says it all. He was the sort of person who did everything 100%,"" Mr Butt told the inquest. ""Random sexual encounters, lots of girlfriends, drug taking and now that he has gone into Islam he wants to do it 100%."" Saad said this was one of a series of things his brother did that made him ""uncomfortable"". Butt would also get angry with his sister, he said, if she came to visit without wearing a headscarf, and asked for videos of him dancing at her wedding to be deleted. In September 2014, he and his wife moved into a small one-bedroom flat in Barking, east London. Once there, Butt put up a curtain pole in their hallway so that male visitors couldn't see his wife. ""With his friends he was 100% strict,"" his wife told the inquest. ""I was not allowed to see them and they were not allowed to see me."" Instead she would prepare and cook meals for the gatherings he would regularly hold, before spending the rest of the night in their bedroom watching television on her laptop. Inside the flat Butt shared with his wife and two children Ms Rehman said for a time she and their son, born in 2014, were his sole focus - but he soon became intensely focused on the war in Syria. His manager at KFC said they also noticed a marked change in his behaviour and appearance at work. Butt began to shave his head and grew a beard. A colleague said around this time they had a discussion about themurder of soldier Lee Rigbyand Butt told them it was ""an eye for an eye"". His wife became aware that he was associating withhate preacher Anjem Choudarytowards the end of 2014. She said she warned him to ""stay away from people like that"" but told the inquest Butt was stubborn and would never do what people asked of him. Ms Rehman said her husband met Choudary at a dawah stall (a public display promoting Islam) in Stratford or nearby East Ham. After that initial meeting Butt would listen to Choudary's speeches on YouTube, and he hosted him at his home on at least one occasion. A friend said Butt was ""energised"" in Choudary's company and described him as being ""like a lion out of a cage"". Yet despite his new obsession with religion, Butt still dabbled in drug use and petty crime. His brother-in-law described him as ""very impressionable"". In September 2015 another brother-in-law, Usman Darr, reported Butt to the anti-terrorist hotline after he defended the Islamic State group's execution of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death in a cage. Butt already had an ""anger problem"", Ms Rehman said. Soon, he began starting fights with other Muslims who he believed were not ""true"" followers of Islam. Butt and his wife had a ""massive"" argument in late 2015 when he decided he wanted a second wife and she left him for a month. London Bridge attacker 'energised' by Choudary Police 'unaware' London Bridge attacker reported It was at this time that The Jihadis Next Door aired on Channel 4. The documentary filmed a number of British extremists meeting across the country and included scenes showing Butt and others confronting police officers in London's Regent's Park. Ms Rehman told the inquest she first became aware of the programme when she watched it at her parents' house. Butt hadn't told her anything about the programme or being filmed. The inquest heard that between 2015 and 2017 Butt expressed strong anti-Western views, shared videos of beheadings on WhatsApp, and was expelled from a mosque. He became increasingly angry, Saad told the inquest, over ""foreign policy, the wars, the injustices overseas"". He said that after several disagreements Butt stopped talking to his family about Syria. They thought he had changed his way of thinking - but he was secretly plotting an attack similar to those inManchesterandWestminster Bridge. ""In that sense he lived a double life,"" his brother added. In May 2016, Butt began to work for London Underground as a customer service assistant Just a couple of months later, Ms Rehman's family confiscated the couple's passports after Butt paid for flights to Turkey. She told her parents she suspected he wanted to take them and their infant son to Syria to join the Islamic State group and so her father destroyed the documents. In May 2016, Butt began to work for London Underground as a customer service assistant. His wife and family were delighted with his new job, but within weeks he started claiming sick pay after complaining his work-issued boots were damaging his feet. His wife told the inquest: ""It wasn't a genuine sickness - he just did not want to work."" Butt privately told his brother-in-law that he could not do the job because ""in the summer there are too many naked women walking around"". His employers later terminated his contract after deciding he had failed his probation. It was around this time he began coming home smelling of cannabis again. His wife said Butt began to attend the Ummah Fitness Centre while he was on sick leave. The gym was run by Sajeel Shahid and his partner, Sophie Rahman, who was the headteacher of the Ad-Deen Primary School in Ilford, a large commuter town to the east of London. Butt was asked by the couple to teach the Koran to children at the school - despite his criminal cautions, his appearance on The Jihadis Next Door, his lack of references and background checks. He began teaching a group of about six or seven children aged between seven and nine for two hours every afternoon. The schoolchanged its name before closing in 2017,external. Rachid Redouane, Youssef Zaghba and Butt outside the Ummah Fitness Centre In May 2017, just weeks before he launched his murderous attack, Butt and his wife had another child. By this point, his wife said, he simply wasn't interested in her or their growing family. Just minutes after she had given birth to their daughter he announced he was leaving the hospital ""to go the gym"" - where, it later emerged, he was meeting his fellow London Bridge attackers. Although Ms Rehman repeatedly asked him to spend more time at home with her and their children, her pleas fell on deaf ears. On Saturday 3 June 2017, Butt left their home for the last time. He left without kissing or saying goodbye to either of his children. Eight people were killed that evening. This account is told according to evidence given at the inquests into the deaths of the eight people killed, which began in May 2019.

A riot that changed millions of lives,"Tensions rose on the street after the raid When half a dozen police officers raided a Mafia-run gay bar on a hot New York night 50 years ago, little did they know their actions would spark a movement that reshaped the lives of generations to come. Mark didn't throw a brick that night. And he didn't confront a policeman. But he had something that was perhaps as potent as any projectile - he had chalk. It was handed to him with instructions by his friend Marty as chaos unfolded outside the Stonewall Inn, the police being pelted with coins and bottles. The homeless teenager set off up the street to scribble three words on the pavement. Then he did the same on a brick wall further up the road. Three words. ""Tomorrow night Stonewall"" That simple message written by Mark was an attempt by Marty Robinson to spread the word, to ensure that a spontaneous act of defiance was transformed into something bigger. An hour earlier, the police had raided the bar in Greenwich Village for the second time that week, but this time on a Friday night at 1am when it was packed. About 200 customers - lesbians, gay men, transgender people, runaway teenagers and drag queens - were thrown out on to Christopher Street. A crowd turned on the officers who retreated inside for their safety. Gay people were used to running from the police, but this time they were the ones on the advance and the men in uniform on the retreat. The gay rights movement didn't start that night but it was invigorated by what happened in the hours and days after the first coin was thrown. And all the strides made since, like marriage equality and a more accepting society, owe something to the youths who fought the police and the activists who organised afterwards. Stonewall has been described as the Rosa Parks moment for gay rights. And just as Ms Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama to a white man had the effect of animating the civil rights movement 14 years before, so Stonewall electrified the push for gay equality. In 1960s America, gays and lesbians were effectively outlaws, living in secrecy and fear. They were labelled insane by doctors, immoral by religious leaders, unemployable by the government, predatory by TV broadcasts and criminal by police. So what was it that made them suddenly fight back on the night of 27 June 1969? At the time of the uprising, consensual sexual relations between men or between women were illegal in every US state except Illinois. Gay people could not work for the federal government or the military, and coming out would deny you a licence in many professions including law and medicine. The laws in New York state were particularly punitive despite - or perhaps partly in response to - a growing number of gay men and women moving to New York City from across the US. Thousands were arrested each year in the city for ''crimes against nature"", solicitation or lewd behaviour. Some had their names published in newspapers, which meant they lost their jobs. Even what you wore was policed - fewer than three pieces of clothing deemed appropriate to your gender could put you in handcuffs. There was a huge amount of anger because gay people had no political power to prevent this, says William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School. ""It was like a keg of dynamite waiting to ignite."" Young gay men and women didn't want to write letters to councillors to enact change or sign petitions, he says. Instead, they took their cue from the anti-war movement, from black power and those pushing for women's liberation. Their strategy was simple. ""Go to the streets and make trouble. Attack, attack, attack."" The Stonewall Inn, a week after the uprising and in 2009 There was no refuge for them in bars or nightclubs. The local liquor laws in New York City were interpreted in a way that meant serving alcohol to gays and lesbians could close down any licensed premises because that made the venue ""disorderly"". Dancing with someone from the same sex could be interpreted as a ""lewd"" offence. A crackdown on the city's gay bars began in the early 1960s. The Mafia stepped in to run many of them, charging more for watered down drinks and paying off the authorities. Despite this exploitation by the Mob, patrons of the Stonewall Inn regarded it as a sanctuary, a rare place for self-expression and affection. Uniquely, it had a dancefloor. As the raids increased in frequency in the summer of 1969, with a mayoral election looming, the Stonewall became an obvious target. It was run by criminals and it sold alcohol without a licence. There were also rumours the Mafia was blackmailing its wealthy customers. But as the police closed in, they had no idea what they were walking into - the sense of injustice was palpable, not just from the recent raids but a number of vigilante attacks. On the hottest night of the summer, all this tinderbox needed was a spark. About six officers - including those who led the NYPD's public morals division - walked across Christopher Street and went into the bar, where undercover colleagues were already inside. The lights came up, the music stopped and the police instructed people to show their IDs as they left. Ejected patrons spilled out on to the street. At first the atmosphere was festive, says Robert Bryan, who was 23 at the time. He arrived on the scene soon after the raid. ""There was laughing and joking. People were coming out of the bar striking poses and bowing."" According to reports, some of the lesbian customers were harassed and bullied by male police officers inside the bar. Then the mood outside changed when a lesbian who came out of the bar was handled roughly by police as they tried to put her in a car. And what began with cents and quarters being hurled at police, soon became stones and bottles. Activist Marsha P Johnson, pictured here a year later, is held up as a Stonewall hero for her role in the uprising As the police retreated inside, they began grabbing people and beating them, says Bryan, who aimed a kick at one officer before running away with another policeman in vain pursuit. When he returned, the police were trapped inside the building and - they later revealed - fearing for their lives. They were only a handful in number and by now several hundreds of protesters had gathered outside. A rubbish bin was hurled at the window and lighter fluid used to ignite projectiles. A parking meter was uprooted and used as a battering ram on the front door. ""It was just this emotional, adrenaline-crazed moment, completely irrational,"" says Bryan. There was a mob spirit, he says, and he felt like he was in a dreamlike state, acting without restraint. ""God knows I would never have kicked a policeman if I were alone.  We were finally fighting back and it was exhilarating."" Riot police arrived to rescue their colleagues but the violence went on before it eventually subsided. At least one police officer was treated in hospital for a head wound and 13 demonstrators were arrested. People gathered to celebrate outside the bar in the days afterwards That battle was over but some of those present knew nothing would be the same again. The following night saw a larger crowd - helped partly, perhaps, by Robinson's chalk but also a leafleting campaign during the day. It was more violent and police took a more muscular approach, using tear gas. Rubbish cans were set on fire and thrown at them. The protests continued for another four nights, particularly violent on the Wednesday. But the question on many minds when the uprising ended was - what next? When Martha Shelley, 25, climbed on top of a water fountain in a park near Stonewall exactly one month after the riot, she feared for her life. But she had an important message to tell the crowd of a few hundred - come out of the shadows and ""walk in the sunshine"". ""It was scary,"" she says, now aged 75 and looking back to that day. ""I was in Harlem when MLK was shot and it went up in flames. I was aware that I could get shot."" At her urging, and after a stirring speech from Marty Robinson, they had all marched to Stonewall Inn, some wearing lavender-coloured sashes, holding hands and chanting ""Gay Power!"" Once there, she told the crowd to disperse as she feared more violence. This was the first time gay people had openly marched in New York, demanding equality. There had been an annual picket in Philadelphia in front of Independence Hall for a few years, led by the Mattachine Society, the first major gay rights organisation. But that was a courteous affair, says Shelley. ""I went to Philadelphia. Women had to wear dresses. I hated it from the bottom of my heart. We walked around with our signs and the tourists were looking at us like we were something out of the zoo as they ate their ice cream. I thought 'This isn't me, it's fake.'"" An annual picket was held on 4 July in Philadelphia. This photo is part of a Stonewall exhibition at New York Public Library Before Stonewall, the activists wanted to fit into society and not rock the boat. But after the uprising, polite requests for change turned into angry demands. The rally organised by Shelley and Robinson does not get the same billing in the history books as the big gay rights march the following year, which has become known as the first Pride march. But it was hugely significant. The first, courageous step had been taken. You might also like: How a red ribbon conquered the world 'Stonewall gave me new gay role models',external The impact of Stonewall on the UK,external This new mood was best embodied in what became the most important driving force to emerge from Stonewall - the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). It was formed within weeks, and was as much a loose alliance of groups as a single entity. The name was a nod to the National Liberation Front fighting the US in Vietnam. When it was suggested at a meeting, Shelley was so enthusiastic she banged her hand hard on her beer bottle, drawing blood. ""The riots would've done nothing if we hadn't organised afterwards,"" she says. The GLF only lasted a few years but burned brightly in that time, with a gamut of issues to fight. ""Control over your own body was primary,"" says Shelley. ""That includes sexual liberation, freedom from the draft, women's reproductive rights, freedom to take drugs without being imprisoned for it, and economic freedom."" And anti-racism, she adds - all those freedoms had to apply to everyone, regardless of race, religion, or citizenship status. Martha Shelley produced and sold Come Out! The GLF made alliances with some of the leading insurgent groups of the time, like the Black Panthers. Its members organised the first Pride march and set up a newspaper called Come Out! which Shelley sold on the street. GLF meetings were chaotic and there were deep disagreements over the best way forward. But its creation marked the start of a new era, leading to a wave of new activist groups like the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and the radical lesbian group Lavender Menace of which Shelley was a founder member. A year later there was a GLF in London and the movement became a global one. There are now thousands of Pride events around the world. But it had humble beginnings - it was over dinner with three friends soon after Stonewall that the idea of a more radical march demanding rights came about, says Ellen Broidy. Christopher Street Liberation Day, exactly one year after Stonewall, began at Greenwich Village and went 51 blocks up Sixth Avenue to Central Park. Reports at the time estimated between 3,000 and 15,000 people took part. The most exciting thing about it was the number of people who joined along the route, says Broidy. ""The core message was 'We're here. We're queer, get used to it.' But I sensed it was more than that. It was about reaching out and playing our part in the revolution. ""I don't think any of us were marching for the right to serve in the military or to get married."" It was less about legal change and more about overturning the systems of oppression, she says. The annual march was not called Pride until years later Some people took self-defence classes, so certain were they of violence. But there wasn't any. Other US cities soon did the same and London had its first two years later. ""It was natural and necessary,"" says Broidy. ""If it hadn't happened first in New York in 1970, it would have happened in London or in Madrid or in Mexico City."" Today, the political message is still there but Pride is more a celebration of gay culture, with music and corporate sponsors. Broidy thinks something has been lost in the process. ""I think it's much more powerful without the floats and without Citibank and American Airlines. Yes, it's a sign of progress but in a distinctly capitalist market."" After that first Pride march, the speed of progress went up a notch. In the decade that followed, the federal exclusions on gays and lesbians were lifted, and the medical profession reversed its long-held belief that homosexuals needed psychiatric treatment. Harvey Milk became one of the first openly gay elected officials in the US, in 1977 in San Francisco. Two years later, about 100,000 people took part in a national march on Washington - probably at that point the biggest gathering of gay people in history. Many of the anti-sodomy laws were struck down in the 1980s, making homosexuality effectively legal, although it was decades before gay marriage became a federally-recognised right in 2015. The legal progress was matched by a change in attitudes - three-quarters of Americans are today accepting of gay relations. In 2019, there are still battles to fight - gay people can still be fired from their jobs in many states. And campaigners say the Trump administration is taking the country backwards again by rolling back some of their hard-fought freedoms. But the arrival of the first openly gay candidate for president suggests the general direction of travel is still one way. Perhaps the biggest sign of progress is that it's Pete Buttigieg's unusual surname and his Norwegian language skills that seem to provoke more curiosity than his sexuality. No one fighting the police that night or marching on the streets could have predicted the strides made since. It's therefore worth reflecting on how much came out of that police raid on a Mafia bar, says David Carter, author of Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution, which is regarded as the definitive account of what happened. ""It's very unexpected and very rare in human history that something that's a totally spontaneous act changed the course of human history for the better."" The National March On Washington filled the famous mall It wasn't the first gay uprising against the police -as the LA Times recently recalled, the police were pelted with donuts,external10 years earlier - but it was the most consequential. ""It went from being microscopic in size to a mass movement - that's the historical significance of Stonewall,"" says Carter. But it has a deeper meaning too, he thinks. ""These moments take on inspirational meaning so in terms of US history it's when MLK was giving his 'I have a dream' speech at the Lincoln Memorial. It's the Marines raising the flag over Iwo Jima."" But unlike the other famous stories, the story of Stonewall is not taught in many schools. It is, however, remembered in other ways - in film, book and even in heritage. In 2016, the area around Stonewall was designated a national monument, and last week, the New York Police Department apologised for the raid. So what happened to Mark Segal, the teenager handed the chalk by his friend Marty? When the Stonewall was raided, he had only been in New York for six weeks and was staying at the YMCA for $6 a night. Defiance was nothing new to him - his first act of rebellion was as a young Jewish boy refusing to sing Onward Christian Soldiers at school in Philadelphia. His grandmother had taken him to his first civil rights rally when he was 13. And outside Stonewall that night, he thought: ""We are fighting for our rights, just as women, African Americans and others had throughout history."" The police that night were a symbol, he says. ""They were the synagogue, the family I couldn't tell, the reason I had to leave the city I loved to move to New York. They represented religion, the media, the government. All the people that shoved us away."" Segal (on right) campaigning with the Gay Liberation Front in 1970, a year after the uprising But Stonewall wasn't just a fight, it was a spirit and it gave him a purpose, he says. He vowed to spend the rest of his life on a new vocation. It took him first to the GLF where he helped run their youth outreach. And he also took on another mission - to make gay people as visible as possible to mainstream America. He did this through a strategy of public disruption. Or, as they were known, ""zaps"". In 1973, he crashed the CBS primetime news show hosted by broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and watched by 60 million people, holding a placard saying: ""Gays protest CBS prejudice"". Segal crashed a Nixon fundraiser in 1972 He went on to launch a gay newspaper in Philadelphia and become a pioneer in gay journalism, and his work on equality earned him an audience with President Barack Obama. Before he was given that piece of chalk 50 years ago, as a penniless teenager, he could never have imagined the path ahead - in the country or in his own life. ""I wouldn't have known I would one day be dancing with my husband in the White House. So what I would say to someone who's young and thinking of coming out is 'Dream big'.""
