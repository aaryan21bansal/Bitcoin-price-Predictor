Pink diamond fetches world record price,"The diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink Legacy A rare pink diamond has fetched 50.3m Swiss francs ($50m; Â£38.5m) at auction, a record price per carat. Pink Legacy, weighing in at just under 19 carats, was bought by US brand Harry Winston at auction in Geneva. The price of around $2.6m per carat marked a world record for a pink diamond, according to the Europe head of auction house Christie's. It had been valued at between $30-$50m before sale, and was bought after only five minutes of bidding. The diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink Legacy. Would you buy a synthetic diamond? Can you spot a laboratory-made diamond? Once owned by the Oppenheimer family, who formerly ran the De Beers mining company, the diamond was referred to as ""one of the world's greatest diamonds"" by Christie's international head of jewellery, Rahul Kadakia. ""You may see this colour in a pink diamond of less than one carat,"" Mr Kadakia said,external. ""But this is almost 19 carats and it's as pink as can be. It's unbelievable."" The diamond sold after five minutes of bidding It was graded as ""fancy vivid"" - the highest level of colour intensity. The rectangular-cut stone was found in a South African mine around 100 years ago and has likely not been altered since it was first cut in 1920, Christie's said. Finding a fancy vivid pink diamond larger than 10 carats is virtually unheard of, the auction house said. Pink Star diamond sets new world record Diamond fetches $33.7m at auction Earrings sold for world record $57.4m The auction price of the Pink Legacy diamond, sold at Christie's annual Magnificent Jewels auction, beat the previous record price-per-carat. In November 2017,an 8.41-carat pink diamond sold for $17,768,041 (Â£11,438,714) in Hong Kong- more than $2.1m (Â£1.8m) a carat.

Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' By Dave Lee, BBC News, Paradise, northern California It's five days since the Camp Fire destroyed this town. Power lines are strewn across the streets, cars melted into their driveways. A California license plate in the ashes of Paradise There are clues to the panic that must have swept through what was a charming town. A garden table, with food-serving tongs at the ready - both now fused together by the extreme heat. In nearby Chico, on the site of a fairground, impressive emergency planning is in action: last night's shift of firefighters sleep in a warehouse, while today's get their briefings. But being prepared for the worst doesn't make it any less traumatic. This is a county in shock - at lives, homes and livelihoods lost. And the knowledge that, in California, this will happen again. Convoys of fire engines could be seen rumbling through the charred ruins of the town on Tuesday, Reuters news agency reports, as crews headed out to fight the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. Workers used chainsaws to clear downed power lines and other obstacles from the streets. Animals caught in wildfire destruction The photos not from the California fires Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly At least 6,607 residences have been destroyed in the county along with 1,032 commercial and other structures. ""Thirty percent [containment] is kind of where we're getting close to rounding the corner,"" said Cal Fire spokeswoman Erica Bain. This video can not be played Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes ""When we're in the 30s and 40s, they're getting a good handle on it. By the end of this week I'd like to see that number up to 40, maybe 45."" Another Cal Fire representative, Scott McLean, said firefighters were now more optimistic because of changing weather conditions. Officials warn that finding human remains could take weeks. It was expected that 150 search-and-recovery personnel would arrive on Tuesday to reinforce 13 coroner-led recovery teams in the fire zone, Reuters reports. Three portable morgue teams have been requested from the US military along with a ""disaster mortuary"" crew, cadaver dog units to locate human remains and three groups of forensic anthropologists. Many victims in Paradise are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would have found evacuating more difficult. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal.""

Flybe 'up for sale' after profit warning,"Flybe has put itself up for sale, just weeks after issuing a profit warning. The Exeter-based regional airline's board confirmed it was ""in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale of the company"". Flybe said it was also reviewing other ""strategic options"", including cutting more flights in the face of challenges. A spokesman for the airline said there was no threat to tickets and flights that had already been purchased as a result of the review. Last month,the airline warnedfull-year losses would be Â£22m, blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs. Flybe shares sink on profit warning Flybe promises overhaul after Â£20m loss Latest results, published on Wednesday, show that pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 September fell by 54% to Â£7.4m, on revenues down by 2.4% to Â£419.2m. The airline's shares have fallen by almost 75% since September. The Exeter-based airline is now valued at about Â£25m, far below the Â£215m it was valued at when it floated on the stock exchange in 2010. However, following the announcement of the review, shares leapt by 37%. Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, told the BBC Flybe had ""suffered from weaker consumer demand, which is typical for operators of regional airports and have also blamed Brexit uncertainty and a weaker pound unsurprisingly"". He says that ""the usual suspects"" are in the frame as potential buyers of the regional airline. ""I saw a hint of Stobart Group, the owner of Southend Airport, as a possible rescuer. BA, historically of course, had a share [in Flybe] and sold it. So we are looking for more details."" Stobart Group and BA-owner IAG refused to comment. In a series of tweets the British Airline Pilots' Association said Flybe's 2,300 ""talented, committed"" staff in the UK would be ""very worried to hear... that their company is up for sale"". Balpa said it believed Flybe was ""fundamentally a sound airline"" and that it would scrutinise any offers for the firm to ensure jobs were protected. It also said it expected to be consulted by Flybe and potential bidders over any future plans they had for the airline and its employees. Allow Twitter content?

Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe. It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from a costly IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs. Last month, Flybe's chief executive, Christine Ourmieres-Widener, said it was reviewing ""further capacity and cost-saving measures"". ""Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs,"" she said at the time. Flybe says its decision to put itself up for sale is due to the ""current challenges"" it faces - higher fuel prices, uncertain demand and a weaker pound. In truth, those problems are just the icing on the cake. The sale is in reality the culmination of a series of management missteps over the last decade as the company struggled to find a profitable niche. It was squeezed from below by smaller, more nimble rivals, and from above by the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair. Flybe has tried new aircraft - Embraer jets that eventually had to be got rid of at immense cost - and new routes - forays away from its regional base to Heathrow and London City airports -  without ever finding the magic formula that would let it survive as an independent airline. All the while, cash has flowed out the door. Today's half-year results show a net outflow of more than Â£30m, leaving the company with just Â£52.4m in cash reserves. The accounts show that credit card acquirers, vital trade partners for airlines, are asking for more security. They also reveal departures of senior management: Vincent Hodder, head of strategy, and Peter Hauptvogel, the chief information officer, have recently left. All these management mistakes have been funded by Flybe's long-suffering shareholders. It floated in 2010 at 295p a share and raised Â£150m from investors in 2014. The shares currently trade at 11p.

Lilly Singh to take a break from YouTube,"Lilly Singh has gone from videos of tying turbans to global stardom on YouTube in a few years YouTuber Lilly Singh, also known as Superwoman, has announced she is taking a break from the video platform. The Canadian-born content creator is stepping away from YouTube after eight years for her mental health. She promised fans she will ""be back happier and healthier"" after her time off. A prolific and popular YouTuber, Ms Singh has over 14 million subscribers on her channels and is among the platform's highest earning stars. 'Superwoman' Lilly Singh at UN General Assembly The rise and rise of Lilly Singh ""I am mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted,"" she said,externalin a video posted on Monday night. The comedian and actress said she was struggling with burnout after posting nonstop videos since 2010. Ms Singh said she is not ""particularly proud"" with some of recent content and needs time to reflect the kinds of videos she wants to create. YouTuber Lilly Singh generously gives fans cash for rent, exams and food ""The thing about YouTube is, in all of its glory, it kind of is a machine and it makes creators believe that we have to pump out content consistently even at the cost of our health and our life and our mental happiness,"" she said. Ms Singh said she is not permanently leaving the platform and  is not sure of how long she will be away. ""I'm not making any rules. This might be a one week break, this might be a one month break - I have no idea,"" she said. The 30-year-old comedian and actress began her YouTube channel in 2010.

Border officer smuggled drugs and guns,"(L-R) Simon Pellett, David Baker and Alex Howard will be sentenced on Friday A corrupt UK border officer has been found guilty of attempting to smuggle firearms and drugs into the country. Simon Pellett, from Dover, was on duty when he was arrested by French officers in October last year. Jurors at Isleworth Crown Court heard he was caught with holdalls containing eight pistols, two revolvers, ammunition, and heroin and cocaine with a combined street value of Â£3.4m. Pellett, 37, will be sentenced on Friday alongside two accomplices. Det Ch Insp Sam Cailes, from the Met Police, described it as a ""significant haul of weapons"". She said: ""You would rarely see a haul of weapons this large. You've got a mixture of firearms here, with Class A drugs. ""It's very unusual to have all of those commodities together in one seizure."" These items were loaded on to an unmarked Border Force van driven by Simon Pellett The arrests were made following a joint investigation involving the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and French police. The NCA had placed a listening device in the work van Pellett collected from his office in Folkestone before he got on a Channel Tunnel shuttle service. He was recorded making arrangements to meet other members of the crime group in Loon Plage, between Calais and Dunkirk. Pellett met Alex Howard, 35, from Sittingbourne, and David Baker, 55, from Eltham, for a handover in a supermarket car park. The two men had just placed three holdalls in the back of his van when French officers moved in to arrest them. The firearms included self-loading and machine pistols, revolvers and silencers. There was also ammunition for a submachine gun. French police discovered the drugs and weapons after a joint investigation with the National Crime Agency and Met Police A spokesman for the NCA said investigators believe Pellett would have been paid about Â£20,000 for the smuggling run. All three men were extradited from France back to the UK for trial. On Monday, Pellett and Baker were found guilty of attempting to import firearms, heroin and cocaine. Pellett was also found guilty of misconduct in a public office. On Tuesday morning, Howard was found guilty of drug importation charges but cleared of the firearms charge.

Trump mocks French leader after visitThe US president attacks Emmanuel Macron on Twitter after an awkward Armistice Day visit.Europe,"Donald Trump (right) kept his powder dry when he met Mr Macron (left) in Paris US President Donald Trump has gone on Twitter to mock his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, after an awkward Armistice Day visit. He attacked Mr Macron over nationalism, plans for a European army, French tariffs on US wine imports, and the French leader's popularity rating. Mr Macron had urged world leaders to reject nationalism, describing it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". Some observers interpreted the remarks as a thinly-veiled attack on Mr Trump. Did the French army mock Donald Trump? Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat Armistice Day commemorations in France ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" Mr Macron said, in a speech to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War One. This video can not be played Paulette Monier (C) met the leaders on WW1 Armistice Day Mr Trump's relations with European and fellow Nato leaders have long been strained. German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to Mr Macron's defence on Tuesday, echoing his call for a ""real European army"". By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris As the French might well ask: quelle mouche a piquÃ© Donald Trump? What fly has bitten the US president? Why is he suddenly on an anti-France tirade? The answer - presumably - is that he resents being the butt of Emmanuel Macron's speechifying. The French leader went on one of his rhetorical flights at Sunday's armistice ceremony, and his main target (aka Potus) was sitting right in front of him. Macron sought in his address to draw a distinction between patriotism (good) and nationalism (bad). Patriotism was what inspired the self-sacrifice of the First World War. Nationalism, he implied, is what inspires Donald Trump. Trump disputes this as a false dichotomy. He thinks nationalism and patriotism are essentially the same, and in his tweet he turns the tables on Macron by saying that the French as a people are actually nationalist, and should be proud of it. Words mean what we choose them to mean. Patriotism is for Macron a good word because in his mind patriots fight for values, not for ""my country right or wrong"". Trump, presumably, thinks that is pious hogwash. Speaking at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 11 November,Mr Macron called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"", saying: ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible."" He called nationalism ""a betrayal of patriotism"". Far from frowning on nationalism, the US president appeared on Tuesday to hold France up as an example for nationalists to emulate.

"MP 'lied to avoid speeding prosecution'Fiona Onasanya returned paperwork saying a ""Russian man"" was driving when her car was clocked speeding.Cambridgeshire","Fiona Onasanya denies perverting the course of justice A Labour MP plotted with her brother to evade a speeding prosecution, a court has heard. Fiona Onasanya claimed a Russian man was behind the wheel when her Nissan Micra was clocked doing 41mph in a 30mph zone in July last year, jurors at the Old Bailey were told. Ms Onasanya, 35, denies one count of perverting the course of justice. Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said the MP and her brother Festus Onasanya had ""acted jointly in telling lies"". The court was told Ms Onasanya, who is the MP for Peterborough, was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) after her car was clocked by a speed camera in Thorney, near Peterborough, on 24 July last year. She returned the paperwork naming Aleks Antipow as the driver, jurors heard. Latest news from the East of England Mr Jeremy said Mr Antipow was the previous tenant of a property that Ms Onasanya and her brother had rented in Cambridge. The court heard that Mr Antipow was at home in Russia at the time of the incident and had never driven the MP's car.

""The two of them were acting jointly in telling lies in order to prevent the prosecution of the true driver,"" he said.

MP 'lied to avoid speeding prosecution',"Fiona Onasanya denies perverting the course of justice A Labour MP plotted with her brother to evade a speeding prosecution, a court has heard. Fiona Onasanya claimed a Russian man was behind the wheel when her Nissan Micra was clocked doing 41mph in a 30mph zone in July last year, jurors at the Old Bailey were told.

Madeleine McCann search funding extended,"Madeleine McCann was three when she went missing in 2007 Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received a further Â£150,000 in government funding. Madeleine was three when she was last seen while on holiday with her parents in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May 2007. The Metropolitan Police launched its inquiry in 2011 after a Portuguese investigation failed to make headway. A total of Â£11.75m has been spent on Operation Grange to date. The new funding is for the six-month period until 31 March next year. Detectives have been applying to the Home Office every six months for a grant to continue their work. They said last year thata ""critical line of inquiry"" was still being pursued. Father describes 'terror' of Madeleine case McCanns mark 10 years without Madeleine Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have pledged never to give up the search for their daughter, who vanished from the family's holiday apartment while they were dining at a restaurant nearby. The Met Police carried out searches in the resort in 2014. On the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance in May last year, police said some 40,000 documents had been reviewed and more than 600 individuals had been investigated.

LiveBrexit negotiations latest10 minutes ago10 minutes ago Recap: UK and EU officials agree draft text of Brexit agreementRecap: UK and EU officials agree draft text of Brexit agreement19 minutes ago Which cabinet ministers are on board?Which cabinet ministers are on board?20 minutes ago MPs react to draft Brexit dealMPs react to draft Brexit deal,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sky News Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable says former Prime Minister David Cameron ""opened a can of worms"" that can't easily be closed when he called the referendum in 2016. Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so."" He said she had shown courage and character but that does not avoid the fact she made a terrible decision to set a series of red lines that could not be met.  Allow Twitter content?

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Pink diamond fetches world record priceThe Pink Legacy diamond sold for 50.3 million Swiss Francs ($50m), a world record price per carat.Europe","The diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink Legacy A rare pink diamond has fetched 50.3m Swiss francs ($50m; Â£38.5m) at auction, a record price per carat. Pink Legacy, weighing in at just under 19 carats, was bought by US brand Harry Winston at auction in Geneva. The price of around $2.6m per carat marked a world record for a pink diamond, according to the Europe head of auction house Christie's. It had been valued at between $30-$50m before sale, and was bought after only five minutes of bidding. The diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink Legacy. Would you buy a synthetic diamond? Can you spot a laboratory-made diamond? Once owned by the Oppenheimer family, who formerly ran the De Beers mining company, the diamond was referred to as ""one of the world's greatest diamonds"" by Christie's international head of jewellery, Rahul Kadakia. ""You may see this colour in a pink diamond of less than one carat,"" Mr Kadakia said,external. ""But this is almost 19 carats and it's as pink as can be. It's unbelievable."" The diamond sold after five minutes of bidding It was graded as ""fancy vivid"" - the highest level of colour intensity. The rectangular-cut stone was found in a South African mine around 100 years ago and has likely not been altered since it was first cut in 1920, Christie's said. Finding a fancy vivid pink diamond larger than 10 carats is virtually unheard of, the auction house said. Pink Star diamond sets new world record Diamond fetches $33.7m at auction Earrings sold for world record $57.4m The auction price of the Pink Legacy diamond, sold at Christie's annual Magnificent Jewels auction, beat the previous record price-per-carat. In November 2017,an 8.41-carat pink diamond sold for $17,768,041 (Â£11,438,714) in Hong Kong- more than $2.1m (Â£1.8m) a carat.

Winds whip California's deadliest wildfire,"This video can not be played California wildfires continue to rage Strong winds have been fuelling California's deadly fires as search-and-rescue teams begin the grim task of searching for bodies among the ashes. Winds of up to 40mph (64km/h) are expected throughout Tuesday in the state's south, where the Woolsey Fire is threatening some 57,000 homes. Firefighters in the north are still battling the Camp Fire, which has left at least 42 people dead. Meanwhile, two new fires began in the south on Monday. They started within minutes of each other. The smaller of the two has since been put out, news agency Reuters reports. Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' In the north, the Camp Fire, which has destroyed more than 7,600 homes, surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster to become the deadliest in California's history after 13 more bodies were found, bringing the total killed to 42. The earlier tragedy left 31 dead. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for, with coroner-led search teams preparing to comb the largely incinerated town of Paradise on Tuesday. Three portable morgues, specialist dog units, forensic anthropologists and a ""disaster mortuary"" have been requested to help with the operation, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters on Monday. Further south, the Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu, a favourite with the rich and famous - bringing the state-wide death toll to 44. Around 9,000 firefighters have been tackling the fires, with 16 other states sending crew and resources to help. Many of the town's 26,000 residents have had their homes devastated More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California. US President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. Authorities are investigating the cause of the wildfires. Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in a nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate overnight. Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she was first woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. This video can not be played Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes She described the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"" and said she did not know if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened. ""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme. ""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised -  I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it."" Animals caught in wildfire destruction The photos not from the California fires Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Many of the victims are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them. The fire has burned around 125,000 acres (50,500 hectares) and is about 30% contained, fire officials said. The separate Woolsey Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed nearly 94,000 acres and destroyed around 435 buildings, officials said. It is around 35% contained, up slightly from earlier in the day. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is reportedly about 90% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Kim K dedicates award to firefighters Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. The experts who start fires to study them Why can't California control its wildfires? Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Have you been affected by the wildfires?

Melania calls for White House aide's firing,"Mira Ricardel (left) and Melania Trump (right) US First Lady Melania Trump has called for a top national security aide to President Donald Trump to be fired. The first lady feuded with Mira Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, during her tour of Africa in October, US media report. ""It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House,"" her spokeswoman said. The White House and the National Security Council has yet to comment. The statement came as US media reported that Mr Trump was considering a shake up in the White House West Wing, and may be considering removing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. As deputy national security adviser, Mrs Ricardel has served under National Security Advisor John Bolton on the powerful National Security Council for the past seven months. In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour Mrs Ricardel (right) attended a Diwali candle lighting with Mr Trump moments before the first lady's condemnation According to US media reports, Mrs Trump and Mrs Ricardel fell out during the first lady's trip to Africa last month and quarrelled over seating arrangements on her plane. During her trip there, Mrs Trump told ABC in a rare interview that there are people in the White House who she does not trust. She said she gives the president ""my honest advice and honest opinions and then he does what he wants to do"". Analysis byAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The long knives are out at the White House. Behind-the-scenes machinations and off-the-record backstabbing are nothing new in this administration, of course. Practically since inauguration various factions have been vying for political supremacy in the West Wing. What's different this time around is that the office of First Lady Melania Trump decided to attack a member of the White House staff on the record and in no uncertain terms. Presidential spouses do have a long history of involving themselves in White House staffing issues. Nancy Reagan, for instance,had an ongoing feud with Chief of Staff Donald Regan.,externalHillary Clinton frequently sparred with White House aides. It's the kind of thing that never spills quite so openly into view, however. With the mid-term elections now in the rear-view mirror, the situation in the Trump White House appears to be coming to a head. The biggest face-off appears to be between two key power centres, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Advisor John Bolton. Everything else, including the situation with Mrs Trump, is cascading from that. It's a situation that seems difficult to sustain. These are the small tremors of a staffing earthquake to come. The Wall Street Journal had earlier on Tuesday reported that Mrs Trump's team believed Mrs Ricardel was behind some of the ""negative stories"" about Mrs Trump and her staff. The newspaper also reported that she repeatedly clashed with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis over ""staffing decisions and policy differences"". Mrs Trump's statement, released through her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, came hours after she issued a separate statement denying reports of clashes with Mr Kelly, her husband's chief of staff. ""Mrs Trump has a very positive relationship with Chief Kelly and there have never been any issues between the two,"" Mrs Grisham said. As the news broke, Mr Trump posted a photo on Twitter of Mrs Ricardel accompanying him at a Diwali ceremony. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK imams join calls for Asia Bibi asylum,"Three British imams have joined calls for the UK to offer asylum to Asia Bibi, the Pakistani Christian woman recently acquitted of blasphemy. It comes after former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and other politicians, urged the government to help her. Ms Bibi was freed last week after eight years on death row, sparking violent protests in Pakistan from Islamists. Her husbandhas said the family is in dangerand has pleaded for asylum from the UK, US or Canada. Prominent British Muslims, including three imams - Qari Asim, Mamadou Bocoum and Dr Usama Hasan - havewritten a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid,externalasking him ""to make a clear and proactive statement that Britain would welcome a request for sanctuary here"". Pakistan's 'historic' Asia Bibi ruling  Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? The letter, also signed by MPs from across the political divide, goes on: ""We are confident that action to ensure Asia Bibi and her family are safe would be very widely welcomed by most people in Britain, across every faith in our society. ""If there are intolerant fringe voices who would object, they must be robustly challenged, not indulged."" The head of government agency the Commission for Countering Extremism also said granting Ms Bibi asylum was ""right thing to do"". Sara Khan said: ""This is an opportunity to send a clear message to extremists that our country will stand up for our values."" The mother-of-five was the first female non-Muslim charged under Pakistan's blasphemy laws. The laws carry a potential death sentence for anyone who insults Islam. Asia Bibi, sometimes known as Asia Noreen, was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours the previous year. Her lawyers have denied she ever did so. The court overturned her conviction on the grounds there was not enough evidence to support it. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety in Pakistan Pakistan has reached a deal with Islamists to try to stop her leaving the country to help calm the unrest which has broken out following her release. But to take the official route to asylum, the family would have to flee Pakistan and then make their request. Canada has saidtalks are under wayabout allowing her to go there. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent This public call from progressive Muslim community activists and thinkers, urging Mr Javid to come to Asia Bibi's aid, is a clear indication, if ever there needed to be one, that there is no such thing as a single ""community"" with a single point of view. Among the signatories are some of the most radical religious thinkers in the UK who have been, slowly, but surely, chipping away at conservative interpretations of Islam. Some of the signatories have spent time in prisons challenging convicted terrorists to drop their hostility to the UK. They and others - often quietly - seek to demolish the extremist world view that human rights - such as freedom of speech and choice in religion - are somehow incompatible with Islam. The fear that many of these thinkers have is that if the UK does not offer to protect Asia Bibi, then extremists will be emboldened to further spread their message. Boris Johnson was reportedin the Daily Mail,externalas saying ""we cannot allow the threat of violence to deter us from doing the right thing."" In a letter to the home secretary, he went on: ""I do not think it is a dignified position for the UK, given our historic links with Pakistan and the extent of our influence there, to look to others to do what we are allegedly nervous to do ourselves."" Conservative MP Rehman Chishti, who has spoken to Ms Bibi's husband and daughter, says her life is in ""grave danger"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have a moral obligation as the United Kingdom to give sanctuary to someone who's been persecuted for their faith."" Diane Dodds, DUP MEP for Northern Ireland,wrote on Twitter,externalthat the UK should ""grant asylum immediately"", calling on the home secretary to ""do the right thing"".

Dinnage named new Premier League boss,"Dinnage has worked for Discovery for the last 10 years Susanna Dinnage has been named as the new chief executive of the Premier League, replacing Richard Scudamore. Dinnage joins from media organisation Discovery, where she was the global president of the Animal Planet channel. Scudamore, 59, is stepping down next month after19 years at the helm. ""I am excited at the prospect of taking on this fantastic role. The Premier League means so much to so many people,"" said Dinnage, who will begin her new job early in 2019. ""It represents the pinnacle of professional sport and the opportunity to lead such a dynamic and inspirational organisation is a great privilege. ""With the support of clubs and the team, I look forward to extending the success of the league for many years to come."" What's on Dinnage's to-do list? Premier League clubs asked for Â£250,000 towards Scudamore's Â£5m bonus Dinnage will become just the third person to lead the Premier League, after Scudamore and his predecessor Rick Parry. Prior to joining Discovery in January 2009, Dinnage worked for 10 years at Channel Five and she started her career at MTV. ""We are very pleased to appoint such a capable leader to this important role,"" said Bruce Buck, Chelsea's chairman and chair of the Premier League's nominations committee. ""We had a very strong field, but Susanna was the outstanding choice given her track record in managing complex businesses through transformation and digital disruption. ""She is a leading figure in the broadcasting industry, a proven business executive and a great developer of people. She is ideally suited to the role and we are confident she will be able to take the Premier League on to new heights. ""Richard Scudamore, having provided exceptional stewardship for almost 20 years, will leave us at the end of the year in great shape and with an excellent executive team and board able to fully support Susanna."" Scudamore was the Premier League's executive chairman but the top-flight clubs had already agreed to split his role. The search for a non-executive chair will now begin, the league said. When she takes up her role in the new year, Susanna Dinnage will become the most senior female leader in the world's major professional sports leagues. And because of the commercial wealth, global popularity and cultural influence of the Premier League, arguably the most powerful figure in British sport. Although she is a Fulham season-ticket holder, Dinnage does not have experience within the football industry, and some traditional match-going fans will worry that the appointment of a media executive reinforces the sense that professional football is in thrall to television. But with sports audience habits shifting, a decrease in the value of the latest domestic TV rights deal, and new digital challengers emerging in the market, Dinnage's experience of tough negotiations at Discovery should also be useful. However, with the biggest clubs jostling for more of a share of overseas TV revenue, the task of emulating outgoing Richard Scudamore and keeping the cosmopolitan league's billionaire owners unified will be a challenging one. With Brexit looming, relations with the FA and the government will be priorities, along with the regulation of agents, and reviewing the sport's close relationship with the gambling industry. And after the recentcollapse of the sale of Wembleyto Shahid Khan, many in the game will hope that Dinnage also persuades the clubs to invest more of their wealth towards grassroots facilities and player welfare at academies.

Trump mocks French leader after visit,"Donald Trump (right) kept his powder dry when he met Mr Macron (left) in Paris US President Donald Trump has gone on Twitter to mock his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, after an awkward Armistice Day visit. He attacked Mr Macron over nationalism, plans for a European army, French tariffs on US wine imports, and the French leader's popularity rating. Mr Macron had urged world leaders to reject nationalism, describing it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". Some observers interpreted the remarks as a thinly-veiled attack on Mr Trump. Did the French army mock Donald Trump? Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat Armistice Day commemorations in France ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" Mr Macron said, in a speech to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War One. This video can not be played Paulette Monier (C) met the leaders on WW1 Armistice Day Mr Trump's relations with European and fellow Nato leaders have long been strained. German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to Mr Macron's defence on Tuesday, echoing his call for a ""real European army"". By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris As the French might well ask: quelle mouche a piquÃ© Donald Trump? What fly has bitten the US president? Why is he suddenly on an anti-France tirade? The answer - presumably - is that he resents being the butt of Emmanuel Macron's speechifying. The French leader went on one of his rhetorical flights at Sunday's armistice ceremony, and his main target (aka Potus) was sitting right in front of him. Macron sought in his address to draw a distinction between patriotism (good) and nationalism (bad). Patriotism was what inspired the self-sacrifice of the First World War. Nationalism, he implied, is what inspires Donald Trump. Trump disputes this as a false dichotomy. He thinks nationalism and patriotism are essentially the same, and in his tweet he turns the tables on Macron by saying that the French as a people are actually nationalist, and should be proud of it. Words mean what we choose them to mean. Patriotism is for Macron a good word because in his mind patriots fight for values, not for ""my country right or wrong"". Trump, presumably, thinks that is pious hogwash. Speaking at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 11 November,Mr Macron called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"", saying: ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible."" He called nationalism ""a betrayal of patriotism"". Far from frowning on nationalism, the US president appeared on Tuesday to hold France up as an example for nationalists to emulate.

"You can't copyright taste, EU court rules","The ruling will have implications for cheese producers across the EU The taste of a food cannot be protected by copyright, the EU's highest legal authority has ruled in a case involving a Dutch cheese. The European Court of Justice said the taste of food was too ""subjective and variable"" for it to meet the requirements for copyright protection. The court was asked to rule in the case of a spreadable cream cheese and herb dip, Heksenkaas, produced by Levola. Levola argued another cheese, Witte Wievenkaas, infringed its copyright. The firm claimed that Heksenkaas was a work protected by copyright; it asked the Dutch courts to insist Smilde, the producers of Witte Wievenkaas, cease the production and sale of its cheese. TheCourt of Justice of the European Unionwas asked by Netherlands' court of appeal to rule on whether the taste of a food could be protected under the Copyright Directive. In its judgement, the European court said that, in order to qualify for copyright, the taste of a food must be capable of being classified as a ""work"" and it had to meet two criteria: That it was an original intellectual creation That there was an ""expression"" of that creation that makes it ""identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity"" The court found that ""the taste of a food product cannot be identified with precision and objectivity"". It said it was ""identified essentially on the basis of taste sensations and experiences, which are subjective and variable"", citing age, food preferences and consumption habits as examples which could influence the taster. ""Accordingly, the court concludes that the taste of a food product cannot be classified as a 'work' and consequently is not eligible for copyright protection under the directive,"" it concluded. Heksenkaas was originally created in 2007 by a Dutch vegetable producer and sold to Levola in 2011. Smilde began producing Witte Wievenkaas in 2014 for a Dutch supermarket chain. This is not the first time the European Court of Justice has had to rule on food - and drink - produce: In July 2018, it decidedthe Kit Kat did not merit protected status, dealing a major blow to Nestle's lengthy legal battle to trademark the four-finger chocolate bar In June 2017, itruled plant-based foods such as tofu could not be branded with dairy-style terms In December 2017, it found against a Champagne lobbying group, saying a German discount store could label its product Champagner Sorbet because it contained 12% champagne.

Winds whip California's deadliest wildfireFirefighters are battling deadly blazes in the north and south of the US state.US & Canada,"This video can not be played California wildfires continue to rage Strong winds have been fuelling California's deadly fires as search-and-rescue teams begin the grim task of searching for bodies among the ashes. Winds of up to 40mph (64km/h) are expected throughout Tuesday in the state's south, where the Woolsey Fire is threatening some 57,000 homes. Firefighters in the north are still battling the Camp Fire, which has left at least 42 people dead. Meanwhile, two new fires began in the south on Monday. They started within minutes of each other. The smaller of the two has since been put out, news agency Reuters reports. Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' In the north, the Camp Fire, which has destroyed more than 7,600 homes, surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster to become the deadliest in California's history after 13 more bodies were found, bringing the total killed to 42. The earlier tragedy left 31 dead. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for, with coroner-led search teams preparing to comb the largely incinerated town of Paradise on Tuesday. Three portable morgues, specialist dog units, forensic anthropologists and a ""disaster mortuary"" have been requested to help with the operation, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters on Monday. Further south, the Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu, a favourite with the rich and famous - bringing the state-wide death toll to 44. Around 9,000 firefighters have been tackling the fires, with 16 other states sending crew and resources to help. Many of the town's 26,000 residents have had their homes devastated More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California. US President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. Authorities are investigating the cause of the wildfires. Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in a nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate overnight. Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she was first woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. This video can not be played Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes She described the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"" and said she did not know if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened. ""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme. ""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised -  I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it."" Animals caught in wildfire destruction The photos not from the California fires Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Many of the victims are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them. The fire has burned around 125,000 acres (50,500 hectares) and is about 30% contained, fire officials said. The separate Woolsey Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed nearly 94,000 acres and destroyed around 435 buildings, officials said. It is around 35% contained, up slightly from earlier in the day. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is reportedly about 90% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Kim K dedicates award to firefighters Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. The experts who start fires to study them Why can't California control its wildfires? Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Have you been affected by the wildfires?

Wages show fastest rise in almost a decade,"Wages rose at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in the three months to September,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.,external Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, rose by 3.2% - the biggest rise since the end of 2008 and up slightly on the previous quarter. However, the ONS warned that real wage growth was below the 2015 level. The unemployment total went up for the first time this year, rising by 21,000 in the same period to 1.38 million. Compared with a year ago and adjusting for inflation, average weekly earnings increased by 0.9%. That figure excludes bonuses. ""With faster wage growth and more subdued inflation, real earnings have picked up noticeably in the last few months,"" ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said. Firms 'struggling to recruit as overseas staff stay away' But Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says wages will ""struggle"" to accelerate much further. ""Flows of people out of self-employment and into employee roles have remained strong, ensuring that record-high job vacancies don't lead to spiralling wage growth,"" he said. The ONS noted that the decline in workers from eastern European countries was ""accelerating"", while there had been an ""uptick"" in British nationals in work. The unemployment rate went up to 4.1% from 4.0% in the period from July to September. Two reasons largely accounted for this - the rising population in the UK and an increase in the number of men out of work. ""Job creation since May has averaged just 2,900 a month. This slowdown in the number of new jobs opening up is likely to feed through into weaker consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC. Analysis by economics correspondent Andy Verity You might well have expected it to happen. The prospect of Brexit and the weak pound seems to have put off some migrants from coming to the UK to work, while others have decided to return to their country of origin. Now we have the strongest evidence so far of that trend - with the number of EU nationals working in the UK falling by 132,000 in the three months from July to September compared with the same period a year before. While migrant workers coming from the rest of the world grew by 34,000 there is still a net outflow of migrant workers. And it is particularly striking when you focus on the so-called EU 8 - Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Based on ONS calculations, the number of workers in the UK from those countries (as opposed to more recent joiners such as Bulgaria and Romania) are down 173,000 from the record high of 1.05 million two years ago. There has been a range of views on the latest wage growth and unemployment figures. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said that ""the benefits of a strong jobs market are paying off"". He added: ""With more people now in work then ever before and unemployment almost halving since 2010, we are delivering an economy that gives people the opportunity of a better future."" However, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for a rise in the minimum wage to Â£10 and added: ""Boosting pay packets must be a priority. ""Pay is rising at a snail's pace and wages aren't expected to return to their pre-crash value for at least another six years."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK's impending departure from the European Union had played a part in the rise in the number of people out of work. He said it suggested that ""the UK jobs market may be starting to falter under the weight of persistent Brexit uncertainty and chronic skills shortages"". The Recruitment and Employment Confederation highlighted what it said was a record number of job vacancies of 845,000 from August to October - the highest since comparable records began in 2001. Director of policy Tom Hadley said employers were ""continuing to experience fundamental challenges in finding the staff and skills that they need"". These skills shortages would ""further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work"", he added.

Trump mocks French leader after visitThe US president attacks Emmanuel Macron on Twitter after an awkward Armistice Day visit.,"Donald Trump (right) kept his powder dry when he met Mr Macron (left) in Paris US President Donald Trump has gone on Twitter to mock his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, after an awkward Armistice Day visit. He attacked Mr Macron over nationalism, plans for a European army, French tariffs on US wine imports, and the French leader's popularity rating. Mr Macron had urged world leaders to reject nationalism, describing it as a ""betrayal of patriotism"". Some observers interpreted the remarks as a thinly-veiled attack on Mr Trump. Did the French army mock Donald Trump? Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat Armistice Day commemorations in France ""By saying 'our interests first and never mind the others' you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has - its moral values,"" Mr Macron said, in a speech to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War One. This video can not be played Paulette Monier (C) met the leaders on WW1 Armistice Day Mr Trump's relations with European and fellow Nato leaders have long been strained. German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to Mr Macron's defence on Tuesday, echoing his call for a ""real European army"". By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris As the French might well ask: quelle mouche a piquÃ© Donald Trump? What fly has bitten the US president? Why is he suddenly on an anti-France tirade? The answer - presumably - is that he resents being the butt of Emmanuel Macron's speechifying. The French leader went on one of his rhetorical flights at Sunday's armistice ceremony, and his main target (aka Potus) was sitting right in front of him. Macron sought in his address to draw a distinction between patriotism (good) and nationalism (bad). Patriotism was what inspired the self-sacrifice of the First World War. Nationalism, he implied, is what inspires Donald Trump. Trump disputes this as a false dichotomy. He thinks nationalism and patriotism are essentially the same, and in his tweet he turns the tables on Macron by saying that the French as a people are actually nationalist, and should be proud of it. Words mean what we choose them to mean. Patriotism is for Macron a good word because in his mind patriots fight for values, not for ""my country right or wrong"". Trump, presumably, thinks that is pious hogwash. Speaking at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 11 November,Mr Macron called on fellow leaders to ""fight for peace"", saying: ""Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible."" He called nationalism ""a betrayal of patriotism"". Far from frowning on nationalism, the US president appeared on Tuesday to hold France up as an example for nationalists to emulate.

CNN sues Trump over reporter's suspension,"The White House accused Acosta of ""placing his hands"" on an intern during a news briefing CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the White House suspended the credentials of one of its senior journalists. Its chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, had his press ""hard pass"" revoked last week hours after he got into a testy exchange with Mr Trump. The network alleges this violates its and Acosta's constitutional rights. The lawsuit, filed in Washington DC on Tuesday, names the president and other senior aides as defendants. Among those named are Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who cited unacceptable conduct as grounds for the revocation of Acosta's pass. On Tuesday Ms Sanders said in a statement that Acosta is one of nearly 50 hard pass holders at the CNN network, adding that it was ""not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters"". The Acosta affair: An unpopular opinion White House suspends CNN reporter's access ""The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional,"" the statement read. This video can not be played 'That's enough, put down the mic' ""The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business."" In a Twitter thread after the incident, Ms Sanders accused Acosta of ""placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job"" - referring to a White House intern who had tried to get the microphone away from him during a news conference. Acosta strongly denied any wrongdoing, labelling the White House's accusation ""a lie"". This video can not be played Trump v Acosta The press secretary later shared a zoomed-in clip of the incident,external, which experts have suggested was doctored to alter its speed.

In the aftermath, the White House Correspondents' Association, which represents the press corps at the presidential residence, urged the administration to reverse the decision. ""We have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process,"" CNN said in a statement. ""While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone.

Kuenssberg: Deal within grasp,"Agreement is finally in Number 10's grasp. The text that's taken months of officials' blood, sweat and tears has been agreed, at least at a technical level. Now a paper's being drafted to present to the Cabinet tomorrow ready for the government's hoped-for next step - political approval from Theresa May's team, even though many of them have deep reservations. Live: Brexit agreement latest Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough Remember in the last 24 hours some of them have been warning privately that what's on the table is just not acceptable, and will never get through Parliament. Some even believe the prime minister ought to walk away. But the government machine is now cranking into action. With a text ready, their long-planned rollout can begin. If the Cabinet agrees the withdrawal agreement that might run to 500 pages, it will be published, in the next few days, along with what's described as the 'outline political declaration' - the skeleton of what our relationship will be like with the rest of the continent for years to come. Expect to see the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, pop up in Brussels to smile for the cameras alongside Michel Barnier. Then in a couple of weeks' time EU leaders will gather in Brussels, in theory, to give their approval. Then the action moves to Parliament where as things stand, no one knows quite what will happen. Of course that's only if Theresa May's plan comes off. Number 10's hope is that Cabinet will swallow their anxieties and come on board - contemplating the alternative of no deal might seem too politically awful to risk. But, as one senior source predicts, in the withdrawal agreement there will be ""plenty of scope for mischief and confusion"". The mechanism over the so-called ""backstop"" (for more on thatread here) is bound to be pored over and most likely complained about. There are all sorts of other issues that might be buried in the small print that could explode. It is possible, though it seems unlikely at this stage, that some ministers may walk over the terms that have been agreed. And it is very unlikely, but can't be completely ruled out, that the Cabinet might refuse to sign up. But for Theresa May the hope and the expectation for the next 24 hours is that the sighs of relief will be louder than the complaints.

Pienaar: May's big gamble,"They've agreed on a draft of an agreement, and this time Downing Street's ready to sell it to the Cabinet. Or at least try. The time for tinkering and bartering has run out. So by the time ministers gather around the Cabinet table tomorrow (Wednesday), Theresa May will know whether there'll be empty seats - left by resigning Brexiteers - when the time comes to start selling the plan to the party and to Parliament. Either way, it seems Theresa May has decided to bank the UK's gains in the Brexit talks, put the best possible gloss on the disappointments, and take her chances. She is taking a huge chance. She has no choice. The Cabinet is the first test - or obstacle - and probably both. The risk of resignations has been real and recognised. Brexit negotiations latest Brexit text 'agreed' in talks breakthrough A brief guide to where we are with Brexit But Parliament looks like the ultimate test. And for the life of me, I am unable, as things stand, to make the numbers add up to anything other than a government defeat. That's how it looks tonight, at any rate. The negotiations in Brussels have closed. The ""I""s have been dotted, the ""t""s crossed. But from all I've heard Brussels was holding firm on a crucial red line. EU negotiators - having agreed that the UK as a whole may enter a ""temporary"" customs territory with the EU to avoid the emergence of a hard Irish border - did not seem at all willing to shift their consistent position and sanction an escape clause for the UK to quit the arrangement at its own discretion whether the EU likes it or not. All week, Cabinet Brexiteers and like-minded Tory colleagues have been loudly demanding exactly that. As for the fear of a hard Irish border emerging, Brussels wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs and regulatory system ""unless and until"" there's a full blown free trade agreement. They still do. And they've argued the UK conceded that principle last December. Mrs May and the UK government has insisted, and still insists, they can't, won't and never will weaken the integrity of the UK. To the question: will Britain allow Northern Ireland to function under the full range of EU customs and market rules, while mainland Britain does not?, the answer is a very clear ""no"". The problem of finding an agreement has seemed intractable. Squaring the Cabinet without resignations may be hard, securing Parliamentary approval could be a political mission impossible. But Theresa May looks to have decided she has no option but to give it a try. How? Negotiators have been discussing the use of a regular review mechanism to judge the working of a ""temporary"" joint customs territory, should it be needed. The widespread assumption in Whitehall is that it would be; that the chances of striking a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU by December 2020 (the end of the Brexit transition) are close to negligible. The widespread assumption, is that those talks could endure maybe three years beyond that. The role of European Court judges in the process is sensitive to Brexiteers and the final settlement will be a key element of the plan. Chief Whip Julian Smith and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox in Downing Street Just another issue for the 58-year-old Government newbie, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, to analyse and explain to the satisfaction of his fellow Brexiteers. His stage presence and charisma took us all by surprise at the Conservative Party conference. His newfound importance must be a surprise even to himself. Will Mrs May may end up having to hard-sell the review mechanism for the ""backstop"", the fallback plan for a temporary UK and EU customs territory, as the looked-for opportunity to pull out altogether? That may be a fair bet, although the EU will not acknowledge the review to be any kind of sanctioned escape route from a system it says must be of indefinite duration, and to which both sides must be bound, except by mutual agreement. Of course, an independent sovereign state can walk away from any deal, any treaty, if it wishes. The UK would certainly be one after Brexit. But would the UK wish to build a reputation as an international deal-breaker, while it simultaneously tries to establish a new place and standing in the world as a global power?. In other words, Mrs May and her European counterparts would agree on a deal and then spin it in quite contradictory ways. It wouldn't be the first time. Remember the Good Friday Agreement? True, the EU prefers precision. Brexiteers seem to have been painting their own negotiating lines a deeper shade of red every day. But whoever said this would be easy? Actually, quite a lot of people inside and outside government said that. It seems they may have been mistaken. Or perhaps they were quoted out of context? The prime minister will surely also be able to claim the integrity of the United Kingdom remains sacred. The EU-side recognises that is another indelible red line. So some way of recognising the UK government's ultimate right to determine the status of Northern Ireland, while expressing the EU's requirement for harmonisation of customs and regulation on the island of Ireland would be needed. Time, perhaps for another piece of ""constructive ambiguity"", or maybe more accurately, contradictory spin. Sounds easy doesn't it? Of course not. Persuading the Cabinet, and Conservative MPs looks like a living nightmare. Who knows? Mrs May may defy the odds and somehow pull it off. No-one can rule that out. But the normal rules of politics - for what they're worth anymore - suggest success will be extraordinarily hard to achieve. The prime minister may not survive this test. A Cabinet insurrection might be contained. But even if it is, a Tory (and DUP) rebellion, followed by defeat in the Commons, could easily sink a Brexit plan and Mrs May along with it. Brexit talks could end in no deal at all, and the Commons could find a way to reject that outcome too, and open up a Pandora's Box of political turmoil: a fresh referendum, for example. Again, who knows? There's plenty of evidence that millions of people have turned away from the tortuous twists and turns of Brexit through sheer boredom, compounded by a perfectly understandable lack of understanding. Perhaps they're the lucky ones. The closer you look, the scarier it seems to get.

Brexit: Brief guide to where we are,"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

Petition to show Iceland ad on TV hits 670k,"Iceland's advert has had 13 million views on Facebook A petition to get Iceland's Christmas advert shown on TV has reached more than 670,000 signatures. The advert, which highlights the impact of palm oil on rainforests and orangutan, has gone viral. TV presenter James Corden shared the ad on Twitter where it's had 15 million views. Clearcast, the body which approves ads for TV, said it wasn't approved because it breached political advertising rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The advert, which was released on social media on Friday, didn't breach the rules because it was about the environment or palm oil. It wasn't approved because the advert was originally made by the environmental organisation Greenpeace. It comesdown to the law,external- political advertising isn't allowed on TV. In the case of the Iceland ad, Clearcast looked at the rule which says adverts breach the law if it is ""inserted by or on behalf of a body whose objects are wholly or mainly of a political nature"". Clearcast said Greenpeace had to show it wasn't a ""political advertiser"" before the ad could be approved - but wasn't able to do that. In a blogpost on Monday,external, Chris Mundy, managing director of Clearcast, said the body doesn't consider the message in the ad itself to be political. ""The case made by many of the people that have contacted us is that they feel it is wrong that the ad is considered political and that it makes important environmental points. However, for the reasons above, that is not the issue here."" Clearcast doesn't have the power to ban adverts. It just decides whether ads meet the rules set out in law. It's the job of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and communications regulator Ofcom to ban ads that fall foul of the rules. It's up to broadcasters - such as Channel 4 and ITV - to ensure the ads they put on their channels don't breach the law. As Clearcast explains: ""Broadcasters considered the Iceland ad as part of the clearance process and decided that it fell foul of the political advertiser rule meaning it may breach their obligations."" Huge. The ad has had three million views on Iceland's YouTube channel, 13 million views on its Facebook page and more than 90,000 retweets from its Twitter handle. A petition on change.org to ""release Iceland's banned Christmas advert on TV"" has more than 670,000 signatures. Krupali Cescau, head of planning at brand agency Amplify, says the advert speaks to the public's current attitude towards sustainability and climate change. She says the fact it's been released under the banner of it being ""banned"" has created even more publicity. ""If it had just gone straight on air it would have been great in terms of starting a conversation,"" she said. ""Actually, the fact that it's been released like this, as a banned advert, is riding the sentiment that is out there at the moment. ""Iceland's tripled the views it had from its 2017 ad just on YouTube, and the people you've got looking at it are now vocal advocates of a store they might never have considered before."" Iceland's Christmas advert has now been watched by millions The advert has gone so viral, some wondered whether this was Iceland's intention all along. Its managing director Richard Walker has told Radio 1 Newsbeat this wasn't the case. ""When we first found out it was going to be banned ten days ago, we were absolutely gutted. ""We thought we wouldn't have a Christmas campaign."" Iceland says it had made a deal with Greenpeace to run the advert without its branding in order to try and comply with broadcasting law. ""There's no reference to them in the ad because they are deemed to be political and therefore we needed to disassociate ourselves with them,"" says Richard. He says he stands by Iceland's description of the ad being ""banned"". ""I don't know what other word we'd use. They said we couldn't play it at all, they banned it.""

Kuenssberg: Delay or decision?,"What was ""a vital 48 hours to get this done"" has now morphed (again) into one of those days where it is not completely clear yet if Theresa May will actually try to get her Cabinet to decide anything on Tuesday, or delay a conclusion (again). Aswe reported, after last week's meeting, there were plenty of her allies insistent that something had to be signed off this week in order to get the hoped-for November deal, so that scary-sounding necessary no-deal plans don't have to be triggered. For once, the Cabinet seemed to have agreed on something, that a deal this month had to be the priority. Plainly therefore, if Number 10 felt they could get something signed off this week, then they would. Brexit talks in the endgame, says May One Cabinet source told me this morning ""this really does have to be the crunch time"" and suggested that the PM would have a carefully-orchestrated plan for tomorrow's meeting and ""won't leave anything to chance"". But as the day has worn on, the idea of there being an agreement on Tuesday has slipped away. The negotiators were locked in talks until nearly 3am but didn't get to a final version of that troublesome Irish backstop that the government seems to have felt ready to present. So the talks go on. And every day that there is discussion rather than decision the prospect of a November deal fades. As we discussed here last week that doesn't mean that all is lost, that we are staggering towards leaving without an agreement. A deal could still be done in December. In fact, the government has a hard deadline in law of the end of January. That's not desirable at all. But it is not impossible. For Number 10 therefore the plan is to keep going, to keep trying, to carry on trying to find a form of words that works, that would be more politically palatable. There is huge frustration in parts of the Tory Party and in Cabinet about this whole approach. Why does Number 10 believe there could suddenly be a better answer to the same set of problems? As one former minister said, ""two plus two is not suddenly going to equal five"". And at the top table there seems to be growing appetite for a change of approach. Three different members of the Cabinet have told the BBC that the PM has to ditch her plan. Carrying on like this, they suggest, is simply banging their collective heads against the same brick wall, because it will never get through Parliament. Some of them are even suggesting that the prime minister should consider walking away from the talks. One of them told me: ""The raw truth is there is a gap between what we can accept and what the EU is offering. ""She needs to change the dynamic and only the prime minister can do that. That might mean walking away, or saying this is our best and final offer."" Another said: ""She needs to say that there won't be a deal in order for them to move - she needs to play hardball."" Another senior minister said there is ""no political logic"" in carrying on with something that has a ""cat's chance in hell"" of getting through Parliament, calling for her to ""pivot"". Is it realistic to imagine that she might change tack? Well, certainly it's not straightforward after more than two years of deliberations. Is it likely? Theresa May is not the kind of politician who does much on impulse. And a senior member of the government told me recently it was crazy to think the prime minister could change tack at this late stage. But with a deal, or without a deal, there is risk whatever she decides - whenever, and however, she makes that final call.

What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Grenfell residents given conflicting advice999 operator told resident to stay put 18 minutes after fire brigade's decision to evacuate.UK,"A Grenfell Tower resident was told to remain in their flat, despite the fire brigade having ordered everyone to evacuate 15 minutes earlier.

Bisto owner plans Brexit stockpilePremier Foods is to stockpile raw materials ahead of Brexit as fears grow over gridlock at UK ports.BusinessComments,"Premier Foods wants to keep making its wide range of products whatever happens with Brexit Premier Foods has said it intends to stockpile raw materials in the run-up to Brexit as fears grow over gridlock at UK ports. The firm, which owns Bisto, Oxo and Mr Kipling, said it was taking steps ""in the absence of certainty over the arrangements for the UK's departure from the EU"". Premier Foods said it expected to spend up to Â£10m on the preparations. It also hopes to sell its Ambrosia custard and creamed rice business. It said it was having ""discussions with third parties regarding the potential disposal"" of the brand, as well as the factory in Devon where the products are made. Premier Foods said it had seen lower sales of custard products because of the hot summer and had reduced its promotional investment in the brand. The company's shares were up more than 2% in Tuesday morning trading. ""The group shortly intends to start a process of building stocks of raw materials to protect the company against the risk of delays at ports,"" Premier Foods said. The firm said this had the potential to cause ""an adverse movement of up to Â£10m in working capital"", but it hoped to compensate for that outlay in the next financial year. My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Brexit stockpiling: No room at warehouse Premier Foods said that ""like all businesses"", it had spent several months planning on ""a range of scenarios subject to the nature of any Brexit deal that is reached"". ""As part of this, Premier Foods have a cross-functional team in place which continues to keep the possible implications to our business under review,"" it added. ""This is purely a precautionary measure as Premier Foods, like all companies, ensures it's prepared for any Brexit scenario."" Meanwhile, chief executive Gavin Darby has said he will step down at the end of January. He said he would be leaving on the sixth anniversary of his joining Premier Foods. Mr Darby's announcement of his imminent departure comes almost four months after he survived a bid to oust him at the company's annual meeting. Activist hedge fund Oasis Management, the firm's second-largest shareholder, had called for him to resign, a call supported by 41% of shareholders. Premier Foods has been under fire over a number of issues, including its failure to lift its share price above the 65p-a-share bid offered by US condiment giant McCormick in 2016. However, the firm's first-half results have shown a 14% profit rise. Adjusted pre-tax profit was Â£30.2m, up from Â£26.4m in the same period a year earlier.

California's deadliest wildfire kills 42,"This video can not be played California wildfires continue to rage Thirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the US state's deadliest wildfire to 42, officials say. The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state. At least 228 people are missing as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk. The fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for. Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town 'Three minutes separated me from death' Five myths about wildfires In the south of the state, other wildfires are menacing lives and property. The Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people, damaging beach resorts, including Malibu. More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California. President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate. Many of the town's 26,000 residents have had their homes devastated Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she had first been woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. Describing the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"", she said she had not known if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened. Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu ""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme. ""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised -  I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it."" Animals caught in wildfire destruction Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Many of the victims are believed to be elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Cadaver dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials say. The separate Woolsey Fire started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials say. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Kim K dedicates award to firefighters Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40 million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited And then there is climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs and less reliable rainfall. The experts who start fires to study them Why can't California control its wildfires? Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Thousands of firefighters, some from across the US, have been brought in to help battle the blazes. California wildfires continue to rage.

Reality Check: Crunch time?,"The Irish foreign minister spoke to chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier ahead of an EU meeting ""Clearly this is a very important week for Brexit negotiations,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Monday after a meeting of EU ministers. ""But the issues aren't new."" It was a sentence he could have uttered almost every week for the past few months. So why is this any different? It's because the EU and UK negotiating teams really do appear to be quite close now to a deal on a withdrawal agreement. But the last few points are always the most difficult to resolve and the politics remain highly unpredictable. If there is to be a special EU summit to finalise a Brexit withdrawal deal before the end of this month, then agreement at official level needs to happen in the next couple of days. Not only does an agreement have to pass muster within Theresa May's cabinet, it also needs to be sent to the capitals of the other 27 EU member states for line-by-line perusal. At the moment, the negotiations are taking place in what's been called ""The Tunnel"" in Brussels - meaning that little information is being passed on, to ensure that little information leaks out. But every country is going to want to take several days to make sure they can accept any final text. In particular, there are legal issues to overcome relating to the terms on which any temporary UK customs union with the EU could be brought to an end. EU countries will also want to ensure that a temporary customs union doesn't give the UK an unfair trading advantage. In other words, it is not just in London that searching questions will be asked. Please upgrade your browser If it doesn't prove possible to get a tentative deal finalised in the next couple of days, that's not the end of the story. Attention will then shift to the next date in the diary - a regular EU summit scheduled to take place in mid-December. On both sides, though, there are warnings that there will be a price to pay if negotiations last much longer. A lot more money will soon have to be spent - by both governments and businesses - to put contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit into practice. Until any withdrawal agreement is turned into a legally binding treaty, everyone will have to get ready for no deal, just in case. And that will take time and money. That's one of the reasons why the UK government is keen to get a withdrawal agreement approved by Parliament as soon as possible - ideally before Christmas. The numbers in the House of Commons, though, are too close to call. As for ratification on the EU side, the European Parliament says it will need six to eight weeks to complete the process. And it plans to vote on the issue in mid-March, just a couple of weeks before the UK is due to leave. And what if the negotiations run into the sand and even by the time the December summit takes place there is no text for EU leaders to approve? In those circumstances, Christmas might not be the season of goodwill for those directly involved in the negotiations. But the next key date is 21 January. If there is no agreement by then, the UK government will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps it plans to take. Whether or how MPs would be able to have a meaningful say in the process at that stage, possibly even trying to delay or stop Brexit, is the subject of considerable political debate. But after the end of January it would probably be too late to get a withdrawal agreement ratified before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The government would not only have to win a ""meaningful vote"" on its deal with the EU in Parliament, it would also have to pass legislation giving the withdrawal agreement effect in UK law. One possibility is that the two-year Article 50 period (named after Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out the terms on which a member state leaves the EU) could be extended. In theory, that could happen if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agree. But the government has already said it has no intention of asking for an extension of Article 50 and other countries would certainly not want to agree to anything open-ended - a few weeks at most, unless UK politics takes a sudden and unexpected turn. That is a reminder that there is, of course, an alternative timeline. If parliament did vote against a deal brought forward by the prime minister, the UK would be faced with several alternatives. Either it could accelerate contingency plans and leave with no deal at all. Or it could change course and request an extension of Article 50 to allow for one of several possible options: Parliament could instruct the government to go back to Brussels to renegotiate. A general election could be called. Another Brexit referendum could take place. It's all uncharted territory and that is why the next few days feel so critical. We've been talking about the cliche of the Article 50 clock ticking for more than 18 months. But the sound that you can hear is the ticking getting louder.

Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Martin Goodman's Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18. For years Lee wrote only simple comics, focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns and aimed at young readers. Aged 40, he decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong. In 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel, and the golden age of comic books began. Black Panther (portrayed in film by actor Chadwick Boseman, right) was one of the first black mainstream superheroes in America Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was the first black superhero featured in a mainstream US comic. Other characters he created include the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and others achieved cult status in their own right. In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.

Migrants found on 'stolen' fishing boat,"The vessel entered the Port of Dover off the Kent coast shortly after midnight A French fishing boat thought to have been stolen was stopped in UK waters with 17 suspected migrants on board. The craft, based in Boulogne, entered the Port of Dover without notifying authorities shortly after midnight. Authorities were alerted, and a patrol, accompanied by a lifeboat because of rough conditions, was launched. Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke said the ""brazen attempt to break into Britain"" showed the ""extreme lengths these desperate people will go to"". ""This latest incident underlines why we need to significantly boost our borders budget - and increase the number of vessels patrolling the whole border,"" he said. ""This is a growing problem - and the Home Office must not turn a blind eye."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Fourteen men and three minors, all of whom presented themselves as Iranian, were found on board. ""The Home Office will progress their cases in accordance with the immigration rules and the three minors have been referred to social services."" The Maritime and Coastguard Agency confirmed it had assisted Border Force officers with an incident. Former coastguard Andy Roberts told BBC South East those on board ""didn't seem to have much nautical knowledge at all"". He said: ""They had just crossed the busiest thoroughfare for shipping in the world. ""They have also come into the busiest roll-on roll-off ferry port in Europe. ""Not only do they put themselves at risk, they put other people in the Dover Strait and at the entrance to the harbour at risk."" On Monday, a report suggestedstaff shortages at southern sea portscould be exploited to gain entry into the UK.

No 'flushable' wipes pass water firms' tests,"Many parents carry wipes for convenient cleaning All wet wipes sold as ""flushable"" in the UK have so far failed the water industry's disintegration tests, the BBC has found. Water companies say wet wipes don't break down and are causing blockages which cost millions to put right. Manufacturers insist their test is adequate and say sewer blockages are caused by people putting non-flushable wipes down the toilet. Wet wipes are sold for everything from make-up removal to surface cleaning. Most importantly when it comes to flushability, they're available as moist toilet tissue. The government has said it isworking with manufacturers and water companies,externalto develop a product that does not contain plastic and can be safely flushed. Wet wipes could face wipe-out This video can not be played How to break your wet-wipe addiction The sticking point comes over what you count as ""flushable"". Wet wipes will flush - in that they will disappear down the U-bend of your toilet. The problem is what happens to them next. Wet wipes are behindup to 80% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to water  companies. They say it costs Â£100m a year to deal with them. Skips full of wipes are caught by the filters at water treatment works and end up in landfill. From their treatment sites across the North West, United Utilities collect around 12,000 tonnes of wipes and other rubbish every year. Wet wipes causing a blockage at a house on the outskirts of Manchester Tony Griffiths, from United Utilities, said: ""It's extremely frustrating. The amount of money that gets spent on dealing with blockages and disposing of this material could be reinvested in our ageing infrastructure."" He added: ""If we're not spending all this money, we could actually work to reduce customer bills."" Monster fatberg unveiled at London museum Wet wipes cause play area closure Superbugs 'spread by hospital wet wipes' Some in the water industry are losing patience. Matt Wheeldon, a director at Wessex Water, has been pushing for action to prevent wipes being labelled as flushable. He said: ""I think they're a complete scourge on our society. ""Whoever came up with the bad idea didn't think about the impact they're going to have on the environment."" He added that it was ""technically illegal to put anything down the toilet that's going to block up the sewer"". ""Despite what the label says, these wipes definitely shouldn't be flushed down the toilet,"" agrees Natalie Fee, founder of campaign organisation City to Sea. She points out that most manufacturers specify that so-called flushable wipes should only be flushed ""one at a time"". ""Manufacturers clearly know this is a problem. We need to start seeing them change what they say [on the packaging]. It can be confusing for consumers,"" she told BBC News. Meanwhile, wipes which escape the filters have an even greater environmental impact, ending up in rivers and on beaches. The wipes contain tiny plastic fibres which go on to harm fish and other marine life as the fibres are released and ingested, sometimes with deadly consequences. In addition, the plastic fibres might then go on to be consumed by other animals potentially entering the human food chain. This video can not be played Wet wipes clogging up London sewers Thames21 is an environmental charity which organises clear-ups of wet wipes from the banks of the Thames. In the first six months of 2018, volunteers picked up around 120,000 wet wipes from one stretch of the riverbank near Hammersmith Bridge. AJ McConville, from the charity, said: ""The wet wipes are changing the shape of the foreshore. ""What seems to be happening is that wet wipes are getting snagged on something, and then they will slow down the water around them by creating turbulence, and by doing that they therefore attract even more wet wipes and more sediment to accumulate around them."" Wet wipes on the riverbed of the Thames at low tide Manufacturers have made efforts to improve the packaging of non-flushable wipes, making the ""do not flush"" logo larger and more prominent. But it is the wipes marked ""flushable"" where there is disagreement. Scientists at WRC, a water-testing laboratory in Swindon, carry out tests on wet wipes to assess their ability to disintegrate when they are flushed into the sewers. They put wipes into conical flasks full of water and rotate them on a shaking platform - which they believe mimics the turbulence of water conditions in a sewer. Using this technique, they have found that none of the wipes marked ""flushable"" which are currently available for sale in the UK pass the test. There is hope on the horizon though. They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market. The manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly. Some water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it didn't realistically reflect what happened in the sewers. There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as 'flushable' But the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked ""flushable"" weren't the problem. Last year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard. But these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.

"Wages show fastest rise in almost a decadeWages rise at the fastest pace since 2008 but unemployment edges higher, official figures show.BusinessComments","Wages rose at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in the three months to September,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.,external Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, rose by 3.2% - the biggest rise since the end of 2008 and up slightly on the previous quarter. However, the ONS warned that real wage growth was below the 2015 level. The unemployment total went up for the first time this year, rising by 21,000 in the same period to 1.38 million. Compared with a year ago and adjusting for inflation, average weekly earnings increased by 0.9%. That figure excludes bonuses. ""With faster wage growth and more subdued inflation, real earnings have picked up noticeably in the last few months,"" ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said. Firms 'struggling to recruit as overseas staff stay away' But Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says wages will ""struggle"" to accelerate much further. ""Flows of people out of self-employment and into employee roles have remained strong, ensuring that record-high job vacancies don't lead to spiralling wage growth,"" he said. The ONS noted that the decline in workers from eastern European countries was ""accelerating"", while there had been an ""uptick"" in British nationals in work. The unemployment rate went up to 4.1% from 4.0% in the period from July to September. Two reasons largely accounted for this - the rising population in the UK and an increase in the number of men out of work. ""Job creation since May has averaged just 2,900 a month. This slowdown in the number of new jobs opening up is likely to feed through into weaker consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC. Analysis by economics correspondent Andy Verity You might well have expected it to happen. The prospect of Brexit and the weak pound seems to have put off some migrants from coming to the UK to work, while others have decided to return to their country of origin. Now we have the strongest evidence so far of that trend - with the number of EU nationals working in the UK falling by 132,000 in the three months from July to September compared with the same period a year before. While migrant workers coming from the rest of the world grew by 34,000 there is still a net outflow of migrant workers. And it is particularly striking when you focus on the so-called EU 8 - Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Based on ONS calculations, the number of workers in the UK from those countries (as opposed to more recent joiners such as Bulgaria and Romania) are down 173,000 from the record high of 1.05 million two years ago. There has been a range of views on the latest wage growth and unemployment figures. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said that ""the benefits of a strong jobs market are paying off"". He added: ""With more people now in work then ever before and unemployment almost halving since 2010, we are delivering an economy that gives people the opportunity of a better future."" However, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for a rise in the minimum wage to Â£10 and added: ""Boosting pay packets must be a priority. ""Pay is rising at a snail's pace and wages aren't expected to return to their pre-crash value for at least another six years."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK's impending departure from the European Union had played a part in the rise in the number of people out of work. He said it suggested that ""the UK jobs market may be starting to falter under the weight of persistent Brexit uncertainty and chronic skills shortages"". The Recruitment and Employment Confederation highlighted what it said was a record number of job vacancies of 845,000 from August to October - the highest since comparable records began in 2001. Director of policy Tom Hadley said employers were ""continuing to experience fundamental challenges in finding the staff and skills that they need"". These skills shortages would ""further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work"", he added.

When fake news turns fatal," Warning: Graphic content On 23 June 2018, a series of horrifying images began to circulate on Facebook. One showed a baby with open machete wounds across his head and jaw. Another – viewed more than 11,000 times – showed a man’s skull hacked open. There were pictures of homes burnt to the ground, bloodied corpses dumped in mass graves, and children murdered in their beds. The Facebook users who posted the images claimed they showed a massacre underway in the Gashish district of Plateau State, Nigeria. Fulani Muslims, they said, were killing Christians from the region’s Berom ethnic minority. A massacre did happen in Gashish that weekend. Somewhere between 86 and 238 Berom people were killed between 22 and 24 June, according to estimates made by the police and by local community leaders. But some of the most incendiary images circulating at the time had nothing to do with the violence in Gashish. The image of the baby, which was shared with a call for God to “wipe out the entire generation of the killers of this innocent child”, had first appeared on Facebook months earlier. The video in which the man’s head was cut open did not even come from Nigeria, it was recorded in Congo-Brazzaville nearly a thousand miles away, in 2012. Photo of a mutilated baby that went viral on 23 and 24 June 2018 But the truth didn’t matter. The images landed in the Facebook feeds of young Berom men in the city of Jos, hours to the north of the rural district where the massacre was happening. Some of the Facebook posts suggested that the killings were happening right there in Jos, or that the inhabitants of the city were about to be attacked. Few stopped to question the claims, or to check the origin of the graphic pictures that were spreading from phone to phone. “As soon as we saw those images, we wanted to just strangle any Fulani man standing next to us,” one Berom youth leader told the BBC. “Who would not, if they saw their brother being killed?” The images helped to ignite a blaze of fear, anger, and calls for retribution against the Fulani – a blaze that was about to engulf a husband and father called Ali Alhaji Muhammed. Photo of Ali Alhaji Muhammed Ali was a potato seller from Jos, a city of around a million people. On 24 June he went to a town called Mangu to meet some customers. It was a journey he’d made hundreds of times. He left shortly after morning prayers and expected to be back in time for dinner with his wives Umma and Amina and his 15 children. On his way home in a shared taxi, Ali found the road blocked by a wall of burning tyres. A mob of Berom men armed with knives and machetes were interrogating drivers, looking for Fulani Muslims. Ali was dragged from his car along with another male passenger. His charred remains were found three days later near the edge of the Jos-Abuja highway. His body was so badly mutilated his wives refused to see it. Ali was one of 11 men who were pulled out of their cars and killed on 24 June. Some were set alight. Others were hacked to death with machetes. Days later, their bodies were still being discovered across the city, dumped in ditches, behind houses and along the roadsides. Many were burnt beyond recognition. One of the vehicles destroyed on 24 June 2018 in Jos Hostility between the Fulani and the Berom predates the rise of Facebook. But the police and the army in Plateau State are convinced that the graphic imagery and misinformation circulating on the platform on 23 June and 24 June contributed to the reprisals. “It was the pictures, the supposed pictures that emanated from the attack [in Gashish],” said Tyopev Terna Matthias, public relations officer for the Plateau State police. “Jos South was not under attack. But because of those images they saw, the next day, roads were blocked. People died. Vehicles were burned. So many people died.” It was not the first time Matthias had seen incendiary posts on social media followed by violence in the towns and villages of Plateau State. “Fake news on Facebook is killing people,” he said. Because of those images roads were blocked. People died. Fake news on Facebook is killing people In the US, Asia, and Europe, Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role in the circulation of “fake news”. But what happens when viral misinformation is allowed to spread through areas of Africa that are already in the midst of ethnic violence? And what is Facebook doing to ensure its platform is not being used to disseminate lies, spread fear, and foment hatred in Nigeria’s troubled heartland? “Next stop: Lagos!” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted to his account in August 2016. It was his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa and he was excited, he said. Who wouldn't be? Some 53 million mobile internet users are forecast to come online in Nigeria over the next seven years: a lot for a company that partly  measures its success on user growth. When Zuckerberg touched down in Lagos, there were 16 million monthly Facebook users in Nigeria. Today, just two years later, there are 24 million. But more users means more content, and a lot of that content, according to the police in Plateau State, is false, misleading, and dangerous. Facebook is aware of the problem, and claims to be addressing it. “Nigeria is important to us,” said Akua Gyekye, the company’s public policy manager for Anglophone West Africa, in a recent statement. “We are committed to taking our responsibility seriously in tackling the spread of false news.” Facebook told the BBC that it is pursuing a “multi-pronged approach” to combating the spread of misinformation in Nigeria. “As well as reports from our community, we’re using machine learning tools to help find and remove inappropriate content, are investing in local partnerships, and continue to engage with Nigerian civil society, NGOs, academics and policy makers.” At the centre of Facebook’s efforts is a scheme that it calls the “third-party fact-checking programme”. The programme is part of a worldwide approach that Facebook has already rolled out in 17 other countries. In Nigeria, the programme launched in October and the third parties are the French news agency AFP and the non-profit organisation Africa Check.  Their fact checkers will review stories that have been picked up by Facebook’s automated system for detecting false information. The system includes posts that have been flagged as false or misleading by other Facebook users. “We know there is no silver bullet,” said the Facebook spokesperson, Akua Gyekye, “but once a fact checker rates a piece of content as false, we are able to reduce its future views by an average of 80%” The statistic sounds impressive. But BBC Africa Eye dug deeper into Facebook’s fact-checking initiative in Nigeria, talking to insiders and experts in the field. And when we got into the detail the picture looked rather different. So far, Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partners, AFP and Africa Check, have committed just four people full-time in Nigeria to analysing and debunking false news, on a platform that is used by 24 million Nigerians every month. Alexios Mantzarlis, director at the International Fact-Checking Network – the body that accredits fact-checking agencies – told us that an individual fact checker might be able to complete “between 20 and 100 individual fact checks” per month. But in Nigeria, where reliable public data is hard to find, the process is often slower. Another source working for one of Facebook’s fact-checking partners, who asked not to be named, said that fact checkers sometimes debunk just five stories in a week. “They are just dipping their toes in the water,” said Gbenga Sesan, a Nigerian digital rights activist who has met Facebook representatives to discuss the company's expansion in Nigeria. “At the end of the day, these are business people and they want to make more money,” he said. Julie Owono, the Cameroonian director of Internet Without Borders, a digital activist group, believes that Facebook’s plans are not commensurate with the scale of the problem. “There’s a dis-proportionality between the threat and the effort put in place,” she said. “Four fact checkers?... It’s scary.” More worrying still is that none of the four fact-checkers deployed full-time by Facebook’s partners in Nigeria speaks Hausa, a language spoken by millions in the country. Facebook told the BBC that their Nigerian fact checking partners “support Hausa.” The company later clarified this means the fact-checking teams can receive support from Hausa speakers in their network when required. The BBC analysed more than 50 recent posts written in Hausa that contain hate speech or false information – and some of them are horrifying. One post, for example, contains a photo of a person slumped on the ground, their skin burnt and peeling. The Hausa text reads: “This is John Okafor [an Igbo name] who tried to smoke weed using pages from the Qur’an and got burnt, instantly.” In fact, the photograph was taken after a horrific assault on a woman accused of witchcraft in Lagos in 2014. She was reportedly burned alive and later died of her wounds. But the facts didn’t matter to the person who created this post, and didn’t register with the people who liked it. What they saw was a story about a Christian – an ethnically Igbo Christian – displaying contempt for Islam, the predominant faith of Hausa-speaking Nigerians. It is the kind of story that, in a region already torn by ethnic and religious violence, can have dangerous consequences. A Nigerian Facebook user browsing “Anything you do in the world is better when you’re with your friends,” Mark Zuckerberg said in a 2011 interview with the BBC, back in the early days of Facebook’s global expansion. “Bringing those kind of experiences to people in all these different places is really cool.” Seven years on, Facebook’s optimism has been tempered by criticism of its role in electoral controversies in the US and the UK, and by allegations that the platform is being used to spread divisive rhetoric and false information from Cameroon to Myanmar. “Fake news is not our friend,” said an advert promoted by the company earlier this year. In a statement to the BBC, Facebook said any suggestion that they “are not fighting abuse on Facebook in Nigeria is misleading”. “We know we have a responsibility to keep people safe and prevent the spread of misinformation and continue to work hard to fight any abuse,” the company said. But misinformation and graphic imagery continue to circulate on the platform. We sent Facebook the video of the man’s head split open – the clip that was filmed years ago in Congo-Brazzaville, but which spread across Plateau State in the hours of the reprisal attacks in June this year. Facebook immediately removed the post, saying that it violated its policy on violence and graphic content. But a quick search of Facebook the following day revealed the same distressing film in other posts, still circulating and still accompanied by the false claim that it showed a massacre in Nigeria. Since it was first uploaded to Facebook in 2012, the video has been used to whip up fear all over the continent. One user claimed it showed an attack in Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Republic of Congo. Another said it showed a Boko Haram atrocity in northern Cameroon. Where will this video appear next? And to what ends will it be deployed? Few organisations have a better understanding of the impact of “fake news” in Nigeria than the police in Plateau State. They told the BBC they were constantly monitoring Facebook for “fake information and fictitious pictures”. Plateau is where the Gashish massacres happened back in June, and where Ali lost his life in the reprisal attacks that followed. “We surf Facebook as much as possible,” said spokesman Tyopev Terna Matthias, sitting at his desk in the crumbling police headquarters, which is surrounded by bomb-proof concrete bollards. Matthias has a team of 10 officers monitoring the platform for false information, he said, split between his personal office and a separate communications department. And for these men, the burden does not end with monitoring. Matthias recalled a recent incident in which someone called the police, alarmed by a Facebook post saying that men were on their way to attack his village. Vehicles loaded with officers were deployed to the village, where they waited for two days before concluding that the post was false. That had happened many times, Matthias said, but the police could not risk ignoring the threats that circulated on Facebook: “Villages in Plateau are under constant attack,” he said. “So when we get this information, we take it seriously. Then we discover it's fake. It wears us down.” Villages in Plateau are under constant attack. So when we get this information, we take it seriously. Then we discover it's fake In order to prevent panics like this, which drain the resources of a police force that is already over-stretched, Matthias’s men use Facebook to debunk false information whenever they find it on the platform. At times of crisis they even use their personal accounts to quash the rumours, and they call on community leaders to do the same. But the sheer volume of misinformation circulating in Plateau State is overwhelming their efforts to counteract it. In addition to the roadblock attacks that cost Ali his life, Matthias can cite more than a dozen incidents when he believes false information on Facebook played a role in inciting murder, assault or civil unrest: a riot which damaged government property in late June 2018; a stampede in the streets of Jos following false claims of an attack; the killing of two Igbo men by a mob in September 2017. “It causes panic,” he said. “Fake news is doing a lot of damage to our society. We pray Facebook shall listen to us and do something fast.” Policeman guarding the police headquarters in Jos The Nigerian army in Plateau State shared Matthias’s view. Between September and October, they debunked seven false stories on Facebook. In addition to monitoring the platform, they hold regular meetings with local imams, pastors and politicians to raise awareness of the threat. “It’s a new realm of warfare,” said Major-General Augustine Agundu, the commander of a large peacekeeping operation in the state. “[Fake news] spirals before you know what’s happening. You have to spend a lot of effort to let people know that it is false.” Major Adam Umar, a senior information officer in the Nigerian army, said his team has set up a helpline for local people to report “fake news” and that the army is now using radio broadcasts to debunk false stories. “It’s turning one tribe against another, turning one religion against another,” he said, days after returning from a peacekeeping mission. “It has set a lot of communities backward.” It’s turning one tribe against another, turning one religion against another. It has set a lot of communities backward Umar witnessed the aftermath of the massacre in Gashish in June. He, too, believes that “fake photographs” on Facebook played a role in igniting the reprisal attacks in Jos. He also recalled a similar incident that occurred last year, when Igbo and Hausa men clashed following the spread of images purporting to show an attack in the east of the country. The country's fight against “fake news” on social media is not confined to individual police forces in Plateau State. In 2018, the Nigerian government announced a nationwide campaign to raise awareness about the problem. Lai Mohammed, Nigeria’s minister of communications, spoke at the launch of the initiative in June. “In a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country like ours,” he said, “fake news is a time bomb.” According to the Nigerian Communications Commission, more than 100 million people now use the internet in the country – triple the number of users in 2012. Millions more are expected to go online over the next few years, and Facebook is doing its part to help Nigerians connect. During Mark Zuckerberg's 2016 trip to Nigeria, Facebook rolled out its Free Basics service in partnership with Airtel Africa, a mobile phone network. The service gave users access to 80 pre-selected websites without having to pay for data. Among those sites was Facebook. For millions of young people in Nigeria, the platform has become an integral part of everyday life.  “It makes the world close,” said 18-year-old Denis Davou, who joined Facebook in 2015 and has 2,000 friends on the platform. “We tend to have friends around the world and we chat. We tend to know things about other countries, and they should also know about our country,” he said. “I log in every day and I have like 3,000 friends,” said 17-year-old Pam Finna, who lives in a suburb of Jos. Denis and Pam are sincere in their appreciation of Facebook, and their comments are in line with Zuckerberg’s stated aim of “connecting the world”. But Denis and Pam, like many Facebook users we spoke to, admitted that they had no idea how to report the upsetting or frightening images that appeared on their phones. They belong to the Berom ethnic minority group and often see posts that vilify their people. Jos residents Pam and Dennis with their friends They are not alone in this, many young Nigerians remain unsure how to identify “fake news” or report it. “Most people who post have no idea what they’re posting or reposting because they themselves are not media literate,” said Muhammad Bala, a professor of mass communications at Bayero University. “They don’t understand motives, they don’t understand intent, they don’t understand underflowing currents of other things.” This lack of basic media literacy leaves them vulnerable to the kind of dangerous misinformation that is seen by thousands on Facebook in this region. Facebook told the BBC it was addressing the issue of media literacy. The company said that, in addition to their fact-checking initiative and machine learning tools, it has recently launched an “online safety and digital literacy youth programme” with 140 Nigerian secondary schools. But again, there is a problem of scale. Nigeria has more than 54,000 secondary schools – to say nothing of the millions of Nigerian children who are not in school at all. “The owners of Facebook should be doing much more,” said Dr Sam Godongs, professor of political science at Jos University. “Social corporate responsibility is part of the ethics of doing business… If you allow fake news to keep generating and brewing hate, then you are invariably killing people.” In Nigeria, the lines between misinformation and hate speech are often blurred. What is clear is that, despite Facebook’s attempts to root out hate speech, and the efforts they are making to detect and remove false information, hundreds of inflammatory posts are slipping through the net. Some of these posts report real atrocities, but are couched in language designed to incite ethnic hatred. Others spread false reports of killings. Many contain half-truths –rumours and insinuations that spread from phone to phone in the villages of Nigeria’s Middle Belt, unnerving communities who are already frightened by the violence of recent years. One divisive figure operating in this murky terrain is Dr Idris Ahmed, who has been singled out by the Nigerian army as an online troublemaker. Photo of Idris Ahmed from one of his Facebook profiles Ahmed is a living example of the complexity of the problem facing Facebook. He is based in the UK and runs an organisation called Citizens United for Peace and Stability. He says he was born in Nigeria, has British nationality, and identifies as Fulani. But from the safety of a suburban house in Coventry, Ahmed is sowing fear in Plateau State. “We have seen the worst of Boko Haram,” he wrote on 3 October 2018, in a post shared more than 890 times. “However, we have never seen terrorists killing innocent fellow humans and deriving pleasure in eating them up! The Berom terrorists are in a class of their own. They are the worst savage barbarians Africa has ever produced. We must WIPE-OUT the Berom terrorists, by whatever means necessary.” The words “savage” and “barbarians” are shocking, but “terrorists” is the key term here. Ahmed has used it repeatedly when referring to the Berom, coupled with calls for them to be “wiped out”. By doing so, he couches his calls for annihilation in terms that suggest he is referring to violent political criminals and not to an entire ethnic group. He has called Berom people “terrorists” in at least nine Facebook posts this year. There is no nationally or internationally recognised Berom terror group. And while Berom people have committed killings during Plateau State’s crisis, the Berom people as a whole are not engaged in violence. Screenshot of Facebook post by Idris Ahmed on 3 October 2018 Some of Ahmed’s followers, however, echo the dehumanising language he uses to describe Berom people. A comment below one of his posts calls for the Berom to be “wiped out” and labels them “savage and barbarian”. Another reads: “Kudos for exposing these silent killers, hope the military would respond with fire and fury and reduced them to greasy spots!” Ahmed is not the only Facebook user to deploy divisive and violent language against Berom people. In the Hausa language, Facebook posts calling for the Berom to be “wiped out” are even more explicit. “Security forces must ignore Amnesty International and wipe out Biroms totally,” posted one Hausa user to his roughly 5,000 followers on 25 June. “They should go there with sophisticated weapons and kill all the humans, animals and even birds.” In September this year, Ahmed used Facebook to make an unsubstantiated claim about the death of a retired general. His post insinuated the army was involved in the killing, exacerbating an already tense situation. The Nigerian army was incensed. “We dare Dr Idris Ahmed to provide evidence to support his infantile claims,” wrote Texas Chukwu, the Nigerian army’s public relations director, in response to Ahmed’s post. He called Ahmed’s claims about the disappearance of the general “imbecilic” and “completely out of sync with reality”. Members of the Berom ethnic group in Jos have also expressed serious concerns about the impact of Ahmed's Facebook activity. “Idris is an element of destruction,” said Joshua Pwajok, a Berom youth leader who lives in Jos. “He has succeeded in building an army of hatred, an army among his people.” Sam Godongs, professor of political science at Jos University, reflecting on the overall issue of hate speech and “fake news”, fears that Facebook does not understand the seriousness of the situation. “Cumulatively this is responsible for genocide,” he said. “How I wish [Facebook] were aware of the gravity of what we are facing. And if they are aware, I am wondering why they are so inactive or insensitive. We are talking of human lives.” Facebook told the BBC it has teams which are “dedicated to preventing false news and polarisation from contributing to real world harm”, especially in countries where “it has life and death consequences”. The company said it is hiring new dedicated staff to address such issues around the world, but did not disclose any specific details regarding Nigeria. Facebook cannot claim to be unaware of Idris Ahmed. His account has been suspended twice, once in 2016 and again in 2017, only to be reinstated a few days later. BBC Africa Eye reported one of his posts about “wiping out” Berom “terrorists” to Facebook on 8 November. The company removed the post the following day and disabled Ahmed’s account for a third time. His second Facebook account however – which has more than 30,000 followers and on which he has also referred to “Berom terrorists” – remains active. Ahmed did not respond to the BBC's request for a formal comment in time for publication. In a phone conversation, he described the BBC's description of his Facebook account as “grotesque” and said it did not fairly reflect his character. “I will try to recover the [disabled] account, by making the Facebook administrators see sense,” he told his followers on 10 November. “Pray for our success,” he said. In October, the BBC visited the home of Umma and Amina, the widows of Ali, the potato seller who was killed at the roadblock in June. On the road into the village, at the place where Ali was dragged from his car, the tarmac was still blackened from the tyres that burned at the roadblock. There were several more spots like this, dotted around Jos South – fading reminders of the 11 men who were killed, and of that fact that, in central Nigeria, “fake news” can ignite real violence. At first glance, Ali’s home was a picture of domestic peace. A little girl was reading through a school textbook while her brother and sister chatted among themselves. Two younger children dashed inside to fetch something. Amina sat on a makeshift stool washing clothes in a large bowl, a baby strapped to her back. Umma, Ali’s first wife, crouched in the corner washing kitchen utensils. But the silence in the room made it clear that something was amiss. And when Umma started to talk about her husband of 20 years, she could not keep from crying. Ali's youngest wife Amina Wiping away tears with a pink head scarf, she recalled a kind, funny, and generous man. He loved children, she said, and in addition to his own he adopted two of his nephews after his brother died. When Ali went away on business, he always came home with biscuits for the kids. “He used to play with them so much,” Umma said, looking at the small faces huddled behind her. “If he was here, you won’t see these children around.” Umma and Amina were getting by with help from the local community, who were horrified by Ali’s death. They were slowly trying to piece their lives back together, in the hope of peace for their region. “You see that our child, that small one,” said Umma, glancing towards one of the young boys in the courtyard. “Every day he talks about it, saying ‘Mummy, I am going to buy a gun and shoot those who killed my father.” Built with Shorthand"

When fake news turns fatalVideoVideoFaking history and the fight for the truthVideoVideoKilled for seeking the truthMeeting Kosovo's clickbait merchantsVideoVideo," Warning: Graphic content On 23 June 2018, a series of horrifying images began to circulate on Facebook. One showed a baby with open machete wounds across his head and jaw. Another – viewed more than 11,000 times – showed a man’s skull hacked open. There were pictures of homes burnt to the ground, bloodied corpses dumped in mass graves, and children murdered in their beds. The Facebook users who posted the images claimed they showed a massacre underway in the Gashish district of Plateau State, Nigeria. Fulani Muslims, they said, were killing Christians from the region’s Berom ethnic minority. A massacre did happen in Gashish that weekend. Somewhere between 86 and 238 Berom people were killed between 22 and 24 June, according to estimates made by the police and by local community leaders. But some of the most incendiary images circulating at the time had nothing to do with the violence in Gashish. The image of the baby, which was shared with a call for God to “wipe out the entire generation of the killers of this innocent child”, had first appeared on Facebook months earlier. The video in which the man’s head was cut open did not even come from Nigeria, it was recorded in Congo-Brazzaville nearly a thousand miles away, in 2012. Photo of a mutilated baby that went viral on 23 and 24 June 2018 But the truth didn’t matter. The images landed in the Facebook feeds of young Berom men in the city of Jos, hours to the north of the rural district where the massacre was happening. Some of the Facebook posts suggested that the killings were happening right there in Jos, or that the inhabitants of the city were about to be attacked. Few stopped to question the claims, or to check the origin of the graphic pictures that were spreading from phone to phone. “As soon as we saw those images, we wanted to just strangle any Fulani man standing next to us,” one Berom youth leader told the BBC. “Who would not, if they saw their brother being killed?” The images helped to ignite a blaze of fear, anger, and calls for retribution against the Fulani – a blaze that was about to engulf a husband and father called Ali Alhaji Muhammed. Photo of Ali Alhaji Muhammed Ali was a potato seller from Jos, a city of around a million people. On 24 June he went to a town called Mangu to meet some customers. It was a journey he’d made hundreds of times. He left shortly after morning prayers and expected to be back in time for dinner with his wives Umma and Amina and his 15 children. On his way home in a shared taxi, Ali found the road blocked by a wall of burning tyres. A mob of Berom men armed with knives and machetes were interrogating drivers, looking for Fulani Muslims. Ali was dragged from his car along with another male passenger. His charred remains were found three days later near the edge of the Jos-Abuja highway. His body was so badly mutilated his wives refused to see it. Ali was one of 11 men who were pulled out of their cars and killed on 24 June. Some were set alight. Others were hacked to death with machetes. Days later, their bodies were still being discovered across the city, dumped in ditches, behind houses and along the roadsides. Many were burnt beyond recognition. One of the vehicles destroyed on 24 June 2018 in Jos Hostility between the Fulani and the Berom predates the rise of Facebook. But the police and the army in Plateau State are convinced that the graphic imagery and misinformation circulating on the platform on 23 June and 24 June contributed to the reprisals. “It was the pictures, the supposed pictures that emanated from the attack [in Gashish],” said Tyopev Terna Matthias, public relations officer for the Plateau State police. “Jos South was not under attack. But because of those images they saw, the next day, roads were blocked. People died. Vehicles were burned. So many people died.” It was not the first time Matthias had seen incendiary posts on social media followed by violence in the towns and villages of Plateau State. “Fake news on Facebook is killing people,” he said. Because of those images roads were blocked. People died. Fake news on Facebook is killing people In the US, Asia, and Europe, Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role in the circulation of “fake news”. But what happens when viral misinformation is allowed to spread through areas of Africa that are already in the midst of ethnic violence? And what is Facebook doing to ensure its platform is not being used to disseminate lies, spread fear, and foment hatred in Nigeria’s troubled heartland? “Next stop: Lagos!” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted to his account in August 2016. It was his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa and he was excited, he said. Who wouldn't be? Some 53 million mobile internet users are forecast to come online in Nigeria over the next seven years: a lot for a company that partly  measures its success on user growth. When Zuckerberg touched down in Lagos, there were 16 million monthly Facebook users in Nigeria. Today, just two years later, there are 24 million. But more users means more content, and a lot of that content, according to the police in Plateau State, is false, misleading, and dangerous. Facebook is aware of the problem, and claims to be addressing it. “Nigeria is important to us,” said Akua Gyekye, the company’s public policy manager for Anglophone West Africa, in a recent statement. “We are committed to taking our responsibility seriously in tackling the spread of false news.” Facebook told the BBC that it is pursuing a “multi-pronged approach” to combating the spread of misinformation in Nigeria. “As well as reports from our community, we’re using machine learning tools to help find and remove inappropriate content, are investing in local partnerships, and continue to engage with Nigerian civil society, NGOs, academics and policy makers.” At the centre of Facebook’s efforts is a scheme that it calls the “third-party fact-checking programme”. The programme is part of a worldwide approach that Facebook has already rolled out in 17 other countries. In Nigeria, the programme launched in October and the third parties are the French news agency AFP and the non-profit organisation Africa Check.  Their fact checkers will review stories that have been picked up by Facebook’s automated system for detecting false information. The system includes posts that have been flagged as false or misleading by other Facebook users. “We know there is no silver bullet,” said the Facebook spokesperson, Akua Gyekye, “but once a fact checker rates a piece of content as false, we are able to reduce its future views by an average of 80%” The statistic sounds impressive. But BBC Africa Eye dug deeper into Facebook’s fact-checking initiative in Nigeria, talking to insiders and experts in the field. And when we got into the detail the picture looked rather different. So far, Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partners, AFP and Africa Check, have committed just four people full-time in Nigeria to analysing and debunking false news, on a platform that is used by 24 million Nigerians every month. Alexios Mantzarlis, director at the International Fact-Checking Network – the body that accredits fact-checking agencies – told us that an individual fact checker might be able to complete “between 20 and 100 individual fact checks” per month. But in Nigeria, where reliable public data is hard to find, the process is often slower. Another source working for one of Facebook’s fact-checking partners, who asked not to be named, said that fact checkers sometimes debunk just five stories in a week. “They are just dipping their toes in the water,” said Gbenga Sesan, a Nigerian digital rights activist who has met Facebook representatives to discuss the company's expansion in Nigeria. “At the end of the day, these are business people and they want to make more money,” he said. Julie Owono, the Cameroonian director of Internet Without Borders, a digital activist group, believes that Facebook’s plans are not commensurate with the scale of the problem. “There’s a dis-proportionality between the threat and the effort put in place,” she said. “Four fact checkers?... It’s scary.” More worrying still is that none of the four fact-checkers deployed full-time by Facebook’s partners in Nigeria speaks Hausa, a language spoken by millions in the country. Facebook told the BBC that their Nigerian fact checking partners “support Hausa.” The company later clarified this means the fact-checking teams can receive support from Hausa speakers in their network when required. The BBC analysed more than 50 recent posts written in Hausa that contain hate speech or false information – and some of them are horrifying. One post, for example, contains a photo of a person slumped on the ground, their skin burnt and peeling. The Hausa text reads: “This is John Okafor [an Igbo name] who tried to smoke weed using pages from the Qur’an and got burnt, instantly.” In fact, the photograph was taken after a horrific assault on a woman accused of witchcraft in Lagos in 2014. She was reportedly burned alive and later died of her wounds. But the facts didn’t matter to the person who created this post, and didn’t register with the people who liked it. What they saw was a story about a Christian – an ethnically Igbo Christian – displaying contempt for Islam, the predominant faith of Hausa-speaking Nigerians. It is the kind of story that, in a region already torn by ethnic and religious violence, can have dangerous consequences.

During Mark Zuckerberg's 2016 trip to Nigeria, Facebook rolled out its Free Basics service in partnership with Airtel Africa, a mobile phone network. The service gave users access to 80 pre-selected websites without having to pay for data. Among those sites was Facebook. For millions of young people in Nigeria, the platform has become an integral part of everyday life.  “It makes the world close,” said 18-year-old Denis Davou, who joined Facebook in 2015 and has 2,000 friends on the platform. “We tend to have friends around the world and we chat. We tend to know things about other countries, and they should also know about our country,” he said. “I log in every day and I have like 3,000 friends,” said 17-year-old Pam Finna, who lives in a suburb of Jos. Denis and Pam are sincere in their appreciation of Facebook, and their comments are in line with Zuckerberg’s stated aim of “connecting the world”. But Denis and Pam, like many Facebook users we spoke to, admitted that they had no idea how to report the upsetting or frightening images that appeared on their phones. They belong to the Berom ethnic minority group and often see posts that vilify their people. Jos residents Pam and Dennis with their friends They are not alone in this, many young Nigerians remain unsure how to identify “fake news” or report it. “Most people who post have no idea what they’re posting or reposting because they themselves are not media literate,” said Muhammad Bala, a professor of mass communications at Bayero University. “They don’t understand motives, they don’t understand intent, they don’t understand underflowing currents of other things.” This lack of basic media literacy leaves them vulnerable to the kind of dangerous misinformation that is seen by thousands on Facebook in this region. Facebook told the BBC it was addressing the issue of media literacy. The company said that, in addition to their fact-checking initiative and machine learning tools, it has recently launched an “online safety and digital literacy youth programme” with 140 Nigerian secondary schools. But again, there is a problem of scale. Nigeria has more than 54,000 secondary schools – to say nothing of the millions of Nigerian children who are not in school at all. “The owners of Facebook should be doing much more,” said Dr Sam Godongs, professor of political science at Jos University. “Social corporate responsibility is part of the ethics of doing business… If you allow fake news to keep generating and brewing hate, then you are invariably killing people.” In Nigeria, the lines between misinformation and hate speech are often blurred. What is clear is that, despite Facebook’s attempts to root out hate speech, and the efforts they are making to detect and remove false information, hundreds of inflammatory posts are slipping through the net. Some of these posts report real atrocities, but are couched in language designed to incite ethnic hatred. Others spread false reports of killings. Many contain half-truths –rumours and insinuations that spread from phone to phone in the villages of Nigeria’s Middle Belt, unnerving communities who are already frightened by the violence of recent years. One divisive figure operating in this murky terrain is Dr Idris Ahmed, who has been singled out by the Nigerian army as an online troublemaker. Photo of Idris Ahmed from one of his Facebook profiles Ahmed is a living example of the complexity of the problem facing Facebook. He is based in the UK and runs an organisation called Citizens United for Peace and Stability. He says he was born in Nigeria, has British nationality, and identifies as Fulani. But from the safety of a suburban house in Coventry, Ahmed is sowing fear in Plateau State. “We have seen the worst of Boko Haram,” he wrote on 3 October 2018, in a post shared more than 890 times. “However, we have never seen terrorists killing innocent fellow humans and deriving pleasure in eating them up! The Berom terrorists are in a class of their own. They are the worst savage barbarians Africa has ever produced. We must WIPE-OUT the Berom terrorists, by whatever means necessary.” The words “savage” and “barbarians” are shocking, but “terrorists” is the key term here. Ahmed has used it repeatedly when referring to the Berom, coupled with calls for them to be “wiped out”. By doing so, he couches his calls for annihilation in terms that suggest he is referring to violent political criminals and not to an entire ethnic group. He has called Berom people “terrorists” in at least nine Facebook posts this year. There is no nationally or internationally recognised Berom terror group. And while Berom people have committed killings during Plateau State’s crisis, the Berom people as a whole are not engaged in violence. Screenshot of Facebook post by Idris Ahmed on 3 October 2018 Some of Ahmed’s followers, however, echo the dehumanising language he uses to describe Berom people. A comment below one of his posts calls for the Berom to be “wiped out” and labels them “savage and barbarian”. Another reads: “Kudos for exposing these silent killers, hope the military would respond with fire and fury and reduced them to greasy spots!” Ahmed is not the only Facebook user to deploy divisive and violent language against Berom people. In the Hausa language, Facebook posts calling for the Berom to be “wiped out” are even more explicit. “Security forces must ignore Amnesty International and wipe out Biroms totally,” posted one Hausa user to his roughly 5,000 followers on 25 June. “They should go there with sophisticated weapons and kill all the humans, animals and even birds.” In September this year, Ahmed used Facebook to make an unsubstantiated claim about the death of a retired general. His post insinuated the army was involved in the killing, exacerbating an already tense situation. The Nigerian army was incensed. “We dare Dr Idris Ahmed to provide evidence to support his infantile claims,” wrote Texas Chukwu, the Nigerian army’s public relations director, in response to Ahmed’s post. He called Ahmed’s claims about the disappearance of the general “imbecilic” and “completely out of sync with reality”. Members of the Berom ethnic group in Jos have also expressed serious concerns about the impact of Ahmed's Facebook activity. “Idris is an element of destruction,” said Joshua Pwajok, a Berom youth leader who lives in Jos. “He has succeeded in building an army of hatred, an army among his people.” Sam Godongs, professor of political science at Jos University, reflecting on the overall issue of hate speech and “fake news”, fears that Facebook does not understand the seriousness of the situation. “Cumulatively this is responsible for genocide,” he said. “How I wish [Facebook] were aware of the gravity of what we are facing. And if they are aware, I am wondering why they are so inactive or insensitive. We are talking of human lives.” Facebook told the BBC it has teams which are “dedicated to preventing false news and polarisation from contributing to real world harm”, especially in countries where “it has life and death consequences”. The company said it is hiring new dedicated staff to address such issues around the world, but did not disclose any specific details regarding Nigeria. Facebook cannot claim to be unaware of Idris Ahmed. His account has been suspended twice, once in 2016 and again in 2017, only to be reinstated a few days later. BBC Africa Eye reported one of his posts about “wiping out” Berom “terrorists” to Facebook on 8 November. The company removed the post the following day and disabled Ahmed’s account for a third time. His second Facebook account however – which has more than 30,000 followers and on which he has also referred to “Berom terrorists” – remains active. Ahmed did not respond to the BBC's request for a formal comment in time for publication. In a phone conversation, he described the BBC's description of his Facebook account as “grotesque” and said it did not fairly reflect his character. “I will try to recover the [disabled] account, by making the Facebook administrators see sense,” he told his followers on 10 November. “Pray for our success,” he said. In October, the BBC visited the home of Umma and Amina, the widows of Ali, the potato seller who was killed at the roadblock in June. On the road into the village, at the place where Ali was dragged from his car, the tarmac was still blackened from the tyres that burned at the roadblock. There were several more spots like this, dotted around Jos South – fading reminders of the 11 men who were killed, and of that fact that, in central Nigeria, “fake news” can ignite real violence. At first glance, Ali’s home was a picture of domestic peace. A little girl was reading through a school textbook while her brother and sister chatted among themselves. Two younger children dashed inside to fetch something. Amina sat on a makeshift stool washing clothes in a large bowl, a baby strapped to her back. Umma, Ali’s first wife, crouched in the corner washing kitchen utensils. But the silence in the room made it clear that something was amiss. And when Umma started to talk about her husband of 20 years, she could not keep from crying. Ali's youngest wife Amina Wiping away tears with a pink head scarf, she recalled a kind, funny, and generous man. He loved children, she said, and in addition to his own he adopted two of his nephews after his brother died. When Ali went away on business, he always came home with biscuits for the kids. “He used to play with them so much,” Umma said, looking at the small faces huddled behind her. “If he was here, you won’t see these children around.” Umma and Amina were getting by with help from the local community, who were horrified by Ali’s death. They were slowly trying to piece their lives back together, in the hope of peace for their region. “You see that our child, that small one,” said Umma, glancing towards one of the young boys in the courtyard. “Every day he talks about it, saying ‘Mummy, I am going to buy a gun and shoot those who killed my father.” Built with Shorthand"

Meeting Kosovo's clickbait merchantsVideoVideo,"One clickbait merchant chose to remain anonymous Two weeks ago, I was sitting in a dark bar in a small town an hour's drive from Kosovo's capital, Pristina. In front of me, a man was nervously hunched over, his face turned away from the camera. He was a fake news merchant and he agreed - eventually - to talk about how he earned his living. I first came to Kosovo over a year ago when researching a book about how power was changing in the digital age. I'd heard about shadowy Russian influence campaigns and militaries fighting warfare with information. But the people I met there showed me there was another, very simple reason why people sent false and sensationalist news to Western audiences. It was for the money - they share it because we click on it. Clickbait and ""fake news"" are terms sometimes used interchangeably to describe false or sensationalist material circulating on the web. On the frontline of India's WhatsApp fake news war Egypt sentences activist for 'spreading fake news' Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it A year ago, ""Burim"" showed me that misinformation was a flourishing industry. Some of what he described was political, far more of it was gore. ""Dog Groomer Who Kicked Dog till its Ribs Broke Remains Jail-Free"" was one story. ""Boy Comes out of Coma after 12 Years, Whispers Dark Secret to Parents [video]"" was another. Much of it was false. And while some of it looked like news, this was content for one reason alone: clicks. Making money from the internet means capturing audiences and the merchant I spoke to owned about a dozen Facebook pages, dedicated to anything from evangelical Christianity to holiday destinations. Whatever their theme, the audiences were huge: 90,000 likes; 240,000 likes; 26,000 likes. Burim could get his content to nearly a million pairs of eyeballs and he turned those clicks into ad revenue - both within the social media platform and on external sites. He earned about 600 euros (Â£520) a day. It's far more money than any of the legitimate jobs he could take would offer him. Carl Miller has documented the clickbait industry in Kosovo for BBC Click Since I met Burim, the tech giants have vowed to shut this industry down. Fake news is what Mark Zuckerberg calls his ""personal challenge"". In 2018, Facebook doubled its security team to 20,000 and closed down many groups and pages that shared clickbait, squeezing their content towards near invisibility. So, last month, I went back, this time with the BBC. I wanted to see if anything had changed and what Facebook's anti-fake news drive really looked like in the eyes of the people who peddled the stuff. ""The audience on that page is mainly UK,"" the man said, grinning, hunched over his phone so that the camera couldn't catch his face. It is difficult to tell exactly how large this illicit economy had become in the past. But Facebook's reforms, I heard again and again, have had some effect. Page after page had been shut down. Income had fallen from 600 euros a day to about 100. Spreading false news, then, has become less profitable - and possibly also less political. It has apparently morphed into celebrity hype, false stories of footballers breaking legs or lurid sexual gore. The content creators were sharing trivia, not Trump. However, although less profitable, the practice was still widespread. ""Forty per cent of Kosovan youth are doing this,"" one merchant told me. ""Thousands upon thousands,"" said another. And it's little wonder. 100 euros a day is still life-changing for someone, like him, who'd earned seven euros a day as a waiter before he started. The ""why"" was clear. In the face of Facebook's reforms, the bigger surprise was ""how"". There is another side to this fake news and clickbait industry that isn't visible to us. I learned that a network of closed groups exist, with memberships that can number from a few hundred to several thousand. To be part of such a closed group, you have to be invited. Gaz, a former clickbait merchant, explained how the industry worked But inside, it was clear that Facebook wasn't just the place where they harvested audiences. It was also where the fake news merchants themselves traded with each other. I saw Facebook pages with hundreds of thousands of likes traded for thousands of dollars. Others sold fake likes, or fake accounts, or offered advice on how to get around Facebook's enforcement. We even found a ""fake news starter pack"" for a beginner, complete with a collection of Facebook pages to gather an audience, along with websites to monetise your activity. This was a service sector economy for misinformation. It wasn't just Facebook that was innovating, the misinformation merchants were too. Some were specialised in growing pages and selling them on. Others would sell content, and more still concentrated on getting around Facebook's enforcement. Even within small groups, this was happening routinely and dozens of times a day. It was industrial-scale gaming of Facebook's policies and systems. Pristina is the capital of Kosovo - and apparently a hub for clickbait Around the world, there are thousands of people like those I spoke to. Usually young, male and digitally savvy, they are willing to share any content for the clicks. And in the chase for clicks online, the horrifying, shocking, exaggerated, or divisive wins out again and again. I've begun to reflect on this kind of fake news, of content exported to Western markets for profit, as something akin to poppy growing. It's a cash crop. It's no use to the people that make it. It doesn't do any good to the foreign markets that consume it. But it is - by far - the easiest and most accessible way of making money for some. If you want to stop it, you can't just burn the fields. You also need to give people something else to grow.

Call for UK ban on freakshakesAction on Sugar surveyed milkshakes on sale in the UK - one contained 39 teaspoons of sugar.HealthComments,"This video can not be played People in Manchester explain why ""freakshakes"" hold such appeal The campaign group Action on Sugar is demanding a ban on freakshakes and all milkshakes with more than 300 calories. It surveyed milkshakes sold in restaurants and fast food shops in the UK and found they contained ""grotesque levels of sugar and calories"". Freakshakes are milkshakes that also contain chocolates, sweets, cake, cream and sauce. The Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake came top of the survey with 39 teaspoons of sugar or 1,280 calories. That is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds. In terms of sugar, it is the equivalent of drinking more than five cans of cola. The British Heart Foundation calculates,externalan average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories. The researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult. They say that of the 46 products included in the survey with nutrition labelling available online, all would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugar per serving. Action on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, are calling for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus. The government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling. Public Health England (PHE) also has asugar reduction programmeas part of the government's childhood obesity plan. It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that. Action on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough. ""These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,"" he said. ""These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving."" Registered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was ""shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it"". She said it was ""time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products"". Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge."" Freakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media. The Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon. Toby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester. Both companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes. A Toby Carvery spokesperson added: ""We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes."" And a Harvester spokesperson said: ""We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests."" Action on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars. The top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour. A spokesperson for Muller said: ""We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste. That's why we introduced a Frijj zero added sugar range. ""Milk contains naturally occurring sugars in the form of lactose but we would stress that it is also a natural and nutrient rich product, containing essential nutrients such as protein, calcium and vitamins.""

'Small issues' stand in way of Brexit deal,"Ministers were being briefed individually on the draft agreement UK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement after months of negotiations. A cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week. A special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing. The PM has been meeting ministers in Downing Street for one-to-one talks on the draft agreement. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the agreement contained a UK-wide customs ""backstop"" aimed at preventing new border checks in Northern Ireland. There is no additional Northern Ireland-only backstop - but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added. This ""backstop"" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. Laura Kuenssberg: Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp Katya Adler: EU gives May space to 'spin' draft deal A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Pienaar: May's big gamble Thepound surged against the dollar and the eurofollowing the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans. The EU said it would ""take stock"" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were ""ongoing and have not concluded"". Leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a ""very, very hard sell"". But Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for ""a little bit of calm"" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday. Both the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal. The details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet. But it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like. The withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks. Some Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? Bisto owner plans Brexit stockpile The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. No 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to ""consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps"". Before they do so, they will be able to read relevant ""documentation"". By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and ""large parts"" of the single market. He told the BBC it was ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"" and he would vote against it. Mr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a ""vassal state"" with Northern Ireland ""being ruled from Dublin"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""given the shambolic nature of the negotiations, this is unlikely to be the good deal for the country."" Pro-EU Conservative MP Justine Greening said the agreement would leave the UK with less influence and undermine its credibility. Speaking at a rally calling for another EU referendum to be held, she said: ""Even if some people in my party can't see this is a bad deal, everyone else around this entire planet can."" At the rally, former minister Jo Johnson was interviewed by Match of the Day host Gary Lineker Former Transport Minister Jo Johnson told the audience at a packed Westminster Hall that cabinet ministers were ""looking deep into their consciences"" about whether to support the deal. Mr Johnson, who quit his ministerial role last week over Brexit policy, added: ""The whips are going to tighten the thumbscrews on all our colleagues across Parliament in all parties probably, so it is very hard to predict."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler Brussels is keeping schtum this evening. This doesn't mean that nothing's going on. Those in the know simply prefer to keep quiet at this sensitive stage. It seems what is being described to me as a ""mutual understanding"" has indeed been reached on a technical level between EU and UK Brexit negotiators. This is not yet a deal. All eyes are now on the UK cabinet. If ministers reject the draft, then it's back to the drawing board. If they approve it, then the 27 EU ambassadors scheduled to meet tomorrow may be told by the European Commission that decisive progress has been made in negotiations, meaning a Brexit summit could be convened with Theresa May, possibly in less than two weeks' time. First though, all 27 EU countries and the European Parliament will want to pore over the text. And that won't be with an uncritical eye. Meanwhile, following pressure from all sides of the Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the Irish backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement to MPs and take questions ahead of the final vote on any Brexit deal. MPs, he said, would get to see ""a full reasoned position statement laying out the government's both political and also legal position on the proposed withdrawal agreement"".

Snapshots from 'apocalypse' town,"Some residents who fled the town have described it as ""apocalyptic"" The town of Paradise in Butte County in northern California has been engulfed by the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. Thousands of the town's structures were completely destroyed in just a matter of hours as the blaze, named the Camp Fire, tore through the area. Before and after images across the community show the extent of its destruction. The wooded community, set close to the Sierra Nevada mountains, was particularly popular among retirees. The Ridgewood Mobile Home Park was among the areas almost completely flattened by the fire. The scenic park, which had 97 plots, was built decades ago Reports say some of its elderly residents remain missing The town's mayor has estimated that 80-90% of the town's neighbourhoods were destroyed in the fire. Some residents took to social media to share what little was left of their own homes upon their return. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Three minutes from death',"William Hart saw charred people and animals as he fled his home in California About 250,000 people have been forced to flee to avoid three major wildfires in California. Some of the evacuees have shared their stories with the BBC. When William Hart woke up on Friday morning, he didn't notice anything unusual until he opened his front door. ""I noticed there was a lot of smoke outside. We live in Paradise. Everyone has a chimney here - but when we saw black and brown smoke coming we knew it wasn't chimney smoke,"" he said. William Hart witnessed charred bodies He and his room mate decided to flee - but had to quickly decide what to take. William said his room mate grabbed her dead husband's ashes but then questioned herself: ""Why am I doing this? He's already burned."" Meanwhile, William took his camping bag. ""I'm not very materialistic so I don't have many things."" It was a close escape. William said when he turned around in his street there was ""no life left"" behind him. ""Three minutes separated me from death."" William documented his evacuation in a video he posted on Facebook - but found some of the footage too harrowing to post. This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" ""I deleted charred human bodies from my video and charred animals trying to flee. I think they were dogs. ""Cars had become metal and bones"". William says he's now in Jackson, California: ""I was trying to help but now I'm mentally done."" Joseph Metcalfe woke his children up around midnight on Thursday and told them they had to evacuate. ""We tried to make it an exciting adventure so as to not worry the kids too much but on our exit we drove past 30ft (9m) high flames and could clearly see the raging fires burning down the hills"" ""This was a whole different level. ""The fire carried no prejudice. ""It has really put into perspective the value of life and the things we own, as the wealthy and the struggling alike have to face new challenges of rebuilding their lives."" Mee Forbes (centre) and Anabel Lois (right) had to evacuate along with their family Anabel Lois, 15, and her mother Mee Forbes live just a few miles from the town of Paradise, California. When Mee realised the seriousness of the situation she rushed home to her family: ""I just wanted my family safe."" As the fire approached their house, the family packed up a few belongings and evacuated to the town of Chico - but the fire soon caught up with them, forcing them to move on to Redding. Anabel, 15, told the BBC that the situation ""is still frightening"" and that she is struggling to comprehend what has happened. She said: ""I don't think I am going to believe it until I go back [home]."" Mee agreed that ""it just doesn't seem real"". ""You see it on the news and you just don't think it'll happen to you. You don't feel like you would ever be affected. ""People have really stepped up to help us find a place to stay for a night. It is really nice to have family and friends that are able to reach out to us. We are very thankful for that. ""We don't have any idea [when we can go home], there are fires still burning in our area. We are just waiting to see if our home is still standing.

Animals caught in destruction,"Scores of people are missing across the state, as fast-moving fires continue to burn As deadly wildfires burn across California, communities are counting the toll in not just human losses, but in wildlife and household pets too. The National Fire Protection Association recommends that animal owners in at-risk areas have evacuation plans for animals in place, but because of how urgent some orders were, many were unable to return home for their pets and other animals. California wildfires reach grim milestone Residents have been using social media to spread images of their lost animals around the internet. Dedicated accounts, groups and hashtags have also been set up by online volunteers to help reunite pets with their owners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The wildfire season usually starts in summer and runs into early autumn there, but recent low humidity, dry conditions and warm fast-moving winds have created ideal conditions for blazes to spread. In Paradise, a town north of Sacramento, thousands of buildings have been destroyed and at least 29 people are known to have died, with more than 200 others still unaccounted for. Despite the widespread destruction, some pets have been recovered there alive, giving hope to survivors who are still missing theirs. Allow Twitter content?

'Cautious optimism' over Brexit talks,"Ministers were being briefed individually on the draft agreement UK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement after months of negotiations. A cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week. A special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing. The PM has been meeting ministers in Downing Street for one-to-one talks on the draft agreement. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the agreement contained a UK-wide customs ""backstop"" aimed at preventing new border checks in Northern Ireland. There is no additional Northern Ireland-only backstop - but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added. This ""backstop"" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. Laura Kuenssberg: Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp Katya Adler: EU gives May space to 'spin' draft deal A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Pienaar: May's big gamble Thepound surged against the dollar and the eurofollowing the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans. The EU said it would ""take stock"" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were ""ongoing and have not concluded"". Leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a ""very, very hard sell"". But Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for ""a little bit of calm"" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday. Both the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal. The details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet. But it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like. The withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks. Some Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? Bisto owner plans Brexit stockpile The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. No 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to ""consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps"". Before they do so, they will be able to read relevant ""documentation"". By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and ""large parts"" of the single market. He told the BBC it was ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"" and he would vote against it. Mr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a ""vassal state"" with Northern Ireland ""being ruled from Dublin"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""given the shambolic nature of the negotiations, this is unlikely to be the good deal for the country."" Pro-EU Conservative MP Justine Greening said the agreement would leave the UK with less influence and undermine its credibility. Speaking at a rally calling for another EU referendum to be held, she said: ""Even if some people in my party can't see this is a bad deal, everyone else around this entire planet can."" At the rally, former minister Jo Johnson was interviewed by Match of the Day host Gary Lineker Former Transport Minister Jo Johnson told the audience at a packed Westminster Hall that cabinet ministers were ""looking deep into their consciences"" about whether to support the deal. Mr Johnson, who quit his ministerial role last week over Brexit policy, added: ""The whips are going to tighten the thumbscrews on all our colleagues across Parliament in all parties probably, so it is very hard to predict."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler Brussels is keeping schtum this evening. This doesn't mean that nothing's going on. Those in the know simply prefer to keep quiet at this sensitive stage. It seems what is being described to me as a ""mutual understanding"" has indeed been reached on a technical level between EU and UK Brexit negotiators. This is not yet a deal. All eyes are now on the UK cabinet. If ministers reject the draft, then it's back to the drawing board. If they approve it, then the 27 EU ambassadors scheduled to meet tomorrow may be told by the European Commission that decisive progress has been made in negotiations, meaning a Brexit summit could be convened with Theresa May, possibly in less than two weeks' time. First though, all 27 EU countries and the European Parliament will want to pore over the text. And that won't be with an uncritical eye. Meanwhile, following pressure from all sides of the Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the Irish backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement to MPs and take questions ahead of the final vote on any Brexit deal. MPs, he said, would get to see ""a full reasoned position statement laying out the government's both political and also legal position on the proposed withdrawal agreement"".

Call for UK ban on freakshakes,"This video can not be played People in Manchester explain why ""freakshakes"" hold such appeal The campaign group Action on Sugar is demanding a ban on freakshakes and all milkshakes with more than 300 calories. It surveyed milkshakes sold in restaurants and fast food shops in the UK and found they contained ""grotesque levels of sugar and calories"". Freakshakes are milkshakes that also contain chocolates, sweets, cake, cream and sauce. The Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake came top of the survey with 39 teaspoons of sugar or 1,280 calories. That is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds. In terms of sugar, it is the equivalent of drinking more than five cans of cola. The British Heart Foundation calculates,externalan average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories. The researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult. They say that of the 46 products included in the survey with nutrition labelling available online, all would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugar per serving. Action on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, are calling for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus. The government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling. Public Health England (PHE) also has asugar reduction programmeas part of the government's childhood obesity plan. It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that. Action on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough. ""These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,"" he said. ""These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving."" Registered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was ""shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it"". She said it was ""time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products"". Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge."" Freakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media. The Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon. Toby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester. Both companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes. A Toby Carvery spokesperson added: ""We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes."" And a Harvester spokesperson said: ""We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests."" Action on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars. The top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour. A spokesperson for Muller said: ""We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste. That's why we introduced a Frijj zero added sugar range. ""Milk contains naturally occurring sugars in the form of lactose but we would stress that it is also a natural and nutrient rich product, containing essential nutrients such as protein, calcium and vitamins.""

Flushable wet wipes 'causing blockages',"Many parents carry wipes for convenient cleaning All wet wipes sold as ""flushable"" in the UK have so far failed the water industry's disintegration tests, the BBC has found. Water companies say wet wipes don't break down and are causing blockages which cost millions to put right. Manufacturers insist their test is adequate and say sewer blockages are caused by people putting non-flushable wipes down the toilet. Wet wipes are sold for everything from make-up removal to surface cleaning. Most importantly when it comes to flushability, they're available as moist toilet tissue. The government has said it isworking with manufacturers and water companies,externalto develop a product that does not contain plastic and can be safely flushed. Wet wipes could face wipe-out This video can not be played How to break your wet-wipe addiction The sticking point comes over what you count as ""flushable"". Wet wipes will flush - in that they will disappear down the U-bend of your toilet. The problem is what happens to them next. Wet wipes are behindup to 80% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to water  companies. They say it costs Â£100m a year to deal with them. Skips full of wipes are caught by the filters at water treatment works and end up in landfill. From their treatment sites across the North West, United Utilities collect around 12,000 tonnes of wipes and other rubbish every year. Wet wipes causing a blockage at a house on the outskirts of Manchester Tony Griffiths, from United Utilities, said: ""It's extremely frustrating. The amount of money that gets spent on dealing with blockages and disposing of this material could be reinvested in our ageing infrastructure."" He added: ""If we're not spending all this money, we could actually work to reduce customer bills."" Monster fatberg unveiled at London museum Wet wipes cause play area closure Superbugs 'spread by hospital wet wipes' Some in the water industry are losing patience. Matt Wheeldon, a director at Wessex Water, has been pushing for action to prevent wipes being labelled as flushable. He said: ""I think they're a complete scourge on our society. ""Whoever came up with the bad idea didn't think about the impact they're going to have on the environment."" He added that it was ""technically illegal to put anything down the toilet that's going to block up the sewer"". ""Despite what the label says, these wipes definitely shouldn't be flushed down the toilet,"" agrees Natalie Fee, founder of campaign organisation City to Sea. She points out that most manufacturers specify that so-called flushable wipes should only be flushed ""one at a time"". ""Manufacturers clearly know this is a problem. We need to start seeing them change what they say [on the packaging]. It can be confusing for consumers,"" she told BBC News. Meanwhile, wipes which escape the filters have an even greater environmental impact, ending up in rivers and on beaches. The wipes contain tiny plastic fibres which go on to harm fish and other marine life as the fibres are released and ingested, sometimes with deadly consequences. In addition, the plastic fibres might then go on to be consumed by other animals potentially entering the human food chain. This video can not be played Wet wipes clogging up London sewers Thames21 is an environmental charity which organises clear-ups of wet wipes from the banks of the Thames. In the first six months of 2018, volunteers picked up around 120,000 wet wipes from one stretch of the riverbank near Hammersmith Bridge. AJ McConville, from the charity, said: ""The wet wipes are changing the shape of the foreshore. ""What seems to be happening is that wet wipes are getting snagged on something, and then they will slow down the water around them by creating turbulence, and by doing that they therefore attract even more wet wipes and more sediment to accumulate around them."" Wet wipes on the riverbed of the Thames at low tide Manufacturers have made efforts to improve the packaging of non-flushable wipes, making the ""do not flush"" logo larger and more prominent. But it is the wipes marked ""flushable"" where there is disagreement. Scientists at WRC, a water-testing laboratory in Swindon, carry out tests on wet wipes to assess their ability to disintegrate when they are flushed into the sewers. They put wipes into conical flasks full of water and rotate them on a shaking platform - which they believe mimics the turbulence of water conditions in a sewer. Using this technique, they have found that none of the wipes marked ""flushable"" which are currently available for sale in the UK pass the test. There is hope on the horizon though. They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market. The manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly. Some water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it didn't realistically reflect what happened in the sewers. There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as 'flushable' But the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked ""flushable"" weren't the problem. Last year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard. But these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.

UK's worst online retailer named,"Homebase runs Britain's worst online shop, according to a survey by consumer group Which? The DIY chain's website was hard to navigate, offered poor value for money and was often not up to date on stock details, the survey found. SportsDirect.com, DorothyPerkins.com, and the rival DIY website from B&Q also came bottom of the heap in the survey. The most highly-rated shops were specialist retailers, led by LizEarle.com and RicherSounds.com. Which? said the popularity of smaller retailers' sites underlined the importance of offering a personal, convenient service that gave ""shoppers exactly what they want"". The group asked more than 10,000 Which? members to rate the most popular online shops based on experiences they had in the previous six months. Those surveyed were also asked to rate websites for experiences buying particular items and consider factors such as price, product range, deliveries, quality and the returns process. LizEarle.com got a rating of 94%, followed by four companies that got virtually the same score of 93%: RicherSounds.com, Rohan.co.uk, SeasaltCornwall.co.uk, and WexPhotoVideo.com. Beauty specialist LizEarle.com was praised for its natural ""high-quality products"", ""excellent service"" and ""good money-off offers"". The Liz Earle Beauty company was bought by pharmacy and health giant Walgreens Boots in 2015. The biggest major retailer to make the top 10 list of best websites was JohnLewis.com, placed sixth with a satisfaction score of 90%. Dyson.co.uk was seventh with 89%. Homebase.co.uk's satisfaction rating was 55%, followed by SportsDirect.com (61%), DorthyPerkins.com (61%), DIY.com (B&Q), (62%), WHSmith.co.uk (63%), and JDSports.co.uk (63%). Homebase, which is undergoing a restructuring that will involve 42 store closures, said in a statement: ""Customer feedback is really important to us, and we are working hard to make changes online to provide great service when customers shop with us."" SportsDirect.com received mixed customer feedback. One shopper complained about ""very poor quality"" products, but others praised its cheap prices. 'It has a fair range at good value,' one customer said. Which? said that the best performers were those that treated customers well and offered a more personalised service. Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine, said: ""The online shops with the happiest customers tend to be the ones that offer a personal service, quality items and deliver quickly and conveniently. ""Where the big players are lacking, either with poor service or confusing websites, smaller more specialised online retailers have seized the opportunity to make their mark and give shoppers exactly what they want."" Asked about online shopping generally, 68% of respondents said they did so because of convenience. Some 63% people said it was easier to find exactly what they wanted online and three in five (57%) also said they had more choice of products.

"Like, share, kill - when fake news turns fatal"," Warning: Graphic content On 23 June 2018, a series of horrifying images began to circulate on Facebook. One showed a baby with open machete wounds across his head and jaw. Another – viewed more than 11,000 times – showed a man’s skull hacked open. There were pictures of homes burnt to the ground, bloodied corpses dumped in mass graves, and children murdered in their beds. The Facebook users who posted the images claimed they showed a massacre underway in the Gashish district of Plateau State, Nigeria. Fulani Muslims, they said, were killing Christians from the region’s Berom ethnic minority. A massacre did happen in Gashish that weekend. Somewhere between 86 and 238 Berom people were killed between 22 and 24 June, according to estimates made by the police and by local community leaders. But some of the most incendiary images circulating at the time had nothing to do with the violence in Gashish. The image of the baby, which was shared with a call for God to “wipe out the entire generation of the killers of this innocent child”, had first appeared on Facebook months earlier. The video in which the man’s head was cut open did not even come from Nigeria, it was recorded in Congo-Brazzaville nearly a thousand miles away, in 2012. Photo of a mutilated baby that went viral on 23 and 24 June 2018 But the truth didn’t matter. The images landed in the Facebook feeds of young Berom men in the city of Jos, hours to the north of the rural district where the massacre was happening. Some of the Facebook posts suggested that the killings were happening right there in Jos, or that the inhabitants of the city were about to be attacked. Few stopped to question the claims, or to check the origin of the graphic pictures that were spreading from phone to phone. “As soon as we saw those images, we wanted to just strangle any Fulani man standing next to us,” one Berom youth leader told the BBC. “Who would not, if they saw their brother being killed?” The images helped to ignite a blaze of fear, anger, and calls for retribution against the Fulani – a blaze that was about to engulf a husband and father called Ali Alhaji Muhammed. Photo of Ali Alhaji Muhammed Ali was a potato seller from Jos, a city of around a million people. On 24 June he went to a town called Mangu to meet some customers. It was a journey he’d made hundreds of times. He left shortly after morning prayers and expected to be back in time for dinner with his wives Umma and Amina and his 15 children. On his way home in a shared taxi, Ali found the road blocked by a wall of burning tyres. A mob of Berom men armed with knives and machetes were interrogating drivers, looking for Fulani Muslims. Ali was dragged from his car along with another male passenger. His charred remains were found three days later near the edge of the Jos-Abuja highway. His body was so badly mutilated his wives refused to see it. Ali was one of 11 men who were pulled out of their cars and killed on 24 June. Some were set alight. Others were hacked to death with machetes. Days later, their bodies were still being discovered across the city, dumped in ditches, behind houses and along the roadsides. Many were burnt beyond recognition. One of the vehicles destroyed on 24 June 2018 in Jos Hostility between the Fulani and the Berom predates the rise of Facebook. But the police and the army in Plateau State are convinced that the graphic imagery and misinformation circulating on the platform on 23 June and 24 June contributed to the reprisals. “It was the pictures, the supposed pictures that emanated from the attack [in Gashish],” said Tyopev Terna Matthias, public relations officer for the Plateau State police. “Jos South was not under attack. But because of those images they saw, the next day, roads were blocked. People died. Vehicles were burned. So many people died.” It was not the first time Matthias had seen incendiary posts on social media followed by violence in the towns and villages of Plateau State. “Fake news on Facebook is killing people,” he said. Because of those images roads were blocked. People died. Fake news on Facebook is killing people In the US, Asia, and Europe, Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role in the circulation of “fake news”. But what happens when viral misinformation is allowed to spread through areas of Africa that are already in the midst of ethnic violence? And what is Facebook doing to ensure its platform is not being used to disseminate lies, spread fear, and foment hatred in Nigeria’s troubled heartland? “Next stop: Lagos!” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted to his account in August 2016. It was his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa and he was excited, he said. Who wouldn't be? Some 53 million mobile internet users are forecast to come online in Nigeria over the next seven years: a lot for a company that partly  measures its success on user growth. When Zuckerberg touched down in Lagos, there were 16 million monthly Facebook users in Nigeria. Today, just two years later, there are 24 million. But more users means more content, and a lot of that content, according to the police in Plateau State, is false, misleading, and dangerous. Facebook is aware of the problem, and claims to be addressing it. “Nigeria is important to us,” said Akua Gyekye, the company’s public policy manager for Anglophone West Africa, in a recent statement. “We are committed to taking our responsibility seriously in tackling the spread of false news.” Facebook told the BBC that it is pursuing a “multi-pronged approach” to combating the spread of misinformation in Nigeria. “As well as reports from our community, we’re using machine learning tools to help find and remove inappropriate content, are investing in local partnerships, and continue to engage with Nigerian civil society, NGOs, academics and policy makers.” At the centre of Facebook’s efforts is a scheme that it calls the “third-party fact-checking programme”. The programme is part of a worldwide approach that Facebook has already rolled out in 17 other countries. In Nigeria, the programme launched in October and the third parties are the French news agency AFP and the non-profit organisation Africa Check.  Their fact checkers will review stories that have been picked up by Facebook’s automated system for detecting false information. The system includes posts that have been flagged as false or misleading by other Facebook users. “We know there is no silver bullet,” said the Facebook spokesperson, Akua Gyekye, “but once a fact checker rates a piece of content as false, we are able to reduce its future views by an average of 80%” The statistic sounds impressive. But BBC Africa Eye dug deeper into Facebook’s fact-checking initiative in Nigeria, talking to insiders and experts in the field. And when we got into the detail the picture looked rather different. So far, Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partners, AFP and Africa Check, have committed just four people full-time in Nigeria to analysing and debunking false news, on a platform that is used by 24 million Nigerians every month. Alexios Mantzarlis, director at the International Fact-Checking Network – the body that accredits fact-checking agencies – told us that an individual fact checker might be able to complete “between 20 and 100 individual fact checks” per month. But in Nigeria, where reliable public data is hard to find, the process is often slower. Another source working for one of Facebook’s fact-checking partners, who asked not to be named, said that fact checkers sometimes debunk just five stories in a week. “They are just dipping their toes in the water,” said Gbenga Sesan, a Nigerian digital rights activist who has met Facebook representatives to discuss the company's expansion in Nigeria. “At the end of the day, these are business people and they want to make more money,” he said. Julie Owono, the Cameroonian director of Internet Without Borders, a digital activist group, believes that Facebook’s plans are not commensurate with the scale of the problem. “There’s a dis-proportionality between the threat and the effort put in place,” she said. “Four fact checkers?... It’s scary.” More worrying still is that none of the four fact-checkers deployed full-time by Facebook’s partners in Nigeria speaks Hausa, a language spoken by millions in the country. Facebook told the BBC that their Nigerian fact checking partners “support Hausa.” The company later clarified this means the fact-checking teams can receive support from Hausa speakers in their network when required. The BBC analysed more than 50 recent posts written in Hausa that contain hate speech or false information – and some of them are horrifying. One post, for example, contains a photo of a person slumped on the ground, their skin burnt and peeling. The Hausa text reads: “This is John Okafor [an Igbo name] who tried to smoke weed using pages from the Qur’an and got burnt, instantly.” In fact, the photograph was taken after a horrific assault on a woman accused of witchcraft in Lagos in 2014. She was reportedly burned alive and later died of her wounds. But the facts didn’t matter to the person who created this post, and didn’t register with the people who liked it. What they saw was a story about a Christian – an ethnically Igbo Christian – displaying contempt for Islam, the predominant faith of Hausa-speaking Nigerians. It is the kind of story that, in a region already torn by ethnic and religious violence, can have dangerous consequences. A Nigerian Facebook user browsing “Anything you do in the world is better when you’re with your friends,” Mark Zuckerberg said in a 2011 interview with the BBC, back in the early days of Facebook’s global expansion. “Bringing those kind of experiences to people in all these different places is really cool.” Seven years on, Facebook’s optimism has been tempered by criticism of its role in electoral controversies in the US and the UK, and by allegations that the platform is being used to spread divisive rhetoric and false information from Cameroon to Myanmar. “Fake news is not our friend,” said an advert promoted by the company earlier this year. In a statement to the BBC, Facebook said any suggestion that they “are not fighting abuse on Facebook in Nigeria is misleading”. “We know we have a responsibility to keep people safe and prevent the spread of misinformation and continue to work hard to fight any abuse,” the company said. But misinformation and graphic imagery continue to circulate on the platform. We sent Facebook the video of the man’s head split open – the clip that was filmed years ago in Congo-Brazzaville, but which spread across Plateau State in the hours of the reprisal attacks in June this year. Facebook immediately removed the post, saying that it violated its policy on violence and graphic content. But a quick search of Facebook the following day revealed the same distressing film in other posts, still circulating and still accompanied by the false claim that it showed a massacre in Nigeria. Since it was first uploaded to Facebook in 2012, the video has been used to whip up fear all over the continent. One user claimed it showed an attack in Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Republic of Congo. Another said it showed a Boko Haram atrocity in northern Cameroon. Where will this video appear next? And to what ends will it be deployed? Few organisations have a better understanding of the impact of “fake news” in Nigeria than the police in Plateau State. They told the BBC they were constantly monitoring Facebook for “fake information and fictitious pictures”. Plateau is where the Gashish massacres happened back in June, and where Ali lost his life in the reprisal attacks that followed. “We surf Facebook as much as possible,” said spokesman Tyopev Terna Matthias, sitting at his desk in the crumbling police headquarters, which is surrounded by bomb-proof concrete bollards. Matthias has a team of 10 officers monitoring the platform for false information, he said, split between his personal office and a separate communications department. And for these men, the burden does not end with monitoring. Matthias recalled a recent incident in which someone called the police, alarmed by a Facebook post saying that men were on their way to attack his village. Vehicles loaded with officers were deployed to the village, where they waited for two days before concluding that the post was false. That had happened many times, Matthias said, but the police could not risk ignoring the threats that circulated on Facebook: “Villages in Plateau are under constant attack,” he said. “So when we get this information, we take it seriously. Then we discover it's fake. It wears us down.” Villages in Plateau are under constant attack. So when we get this information, we take it seriously. Then we discover it's fake In order to prevent panics like this, which drain the resources of a police force that is already over-stretched, Matthias’s men use Facebook to debunk false information whenever they find it on the platform. At times of crisis they even use their personal accounts to quash the rumours, and they call on community leaders to do the same. But the sheer volume of misinformation circulating in Plateau State is overwhelming their efforts to counteract it. In addition to the roadblock attacks that cost Ali his life, Matthias can cite more than a dozen incidents when he believes false information on Facebook played a role in inciting murder, assault or civil unrest: a riot which damaged government property in late June 2018; a stampede in the streets of Jos following false claims of an attack; the killing of two Igbo men by a mob in September 2017. “It causes panic,” he said. “Fake news is doing a lot of damage to our society. We pray Facebook shall listen to us and do something fast.” Policeman guarding the police headquarters in Jos The Nigerian army in Plateau State shared Matthias’s view. Between September and October, they debunked seven false stories on Facebook. In addition to monitoring the platform, they hold regular meetings with local imams, pastors and politicians to raise awareness of the threat. “It’s a new realm of warfare,” said Major-General Augustine Agundu, the commander of a large peacekeeping operation in the state. “[Fake news] spirals before you know what’s happening. You have to spend a lot of effort to let people know that it is false.” Major Adam Umar, a senior information officer in the Nigerian army, said his team has set up a helpline for local people to report “fake news” and that the army is now using radio broadcasts to debunk false stories. “It’s turning one tribe against another, turning one religion against another,” he said, days after returning from a peacekeeping mission. “It has set a lot of communities backward.” It’s turning one tribe against another, turning one religion against another. It has set a lot of communities backward Umar witnessed the aftermath of the massacre in Gashish in June. He, too, believes that “fake photographs” on Facebook played a role in igniting the reprisal attacks in Jos. He also recalled a similar incident that occurred last year, when Igbo and Hausa men clashed following the spread of images purporting to show an attack in the east of the country. The country's fight against “fake news” on social media is not confined to individual police forces in Plateau State. In 2018, the Nigerian government announced a nationwide campaign to raise awareness about the problem. Lai Mohammed, Nigeria’s minister of communications, spoke at the launch of the initiative in June. “In a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country like ours,” he said, “fake news is a time bomb.” According to the Nigerian Communications Commission, more than 100 million people now use the internet in the country – triple the number of users in 2012. Millions more are expected to go online over the next few years, and Facebook is doing its part to help Nigerians connect. During Mark Zuckerberg's 2016 trip to Nigeria, Facebook rolled out its Free Basics service in partnership with Airtel Africa, a mobile phone network. The service gave users access to 80 pre-selected websites without having to pay for data. Among those sites was Facebook. For millions of young people in Nigeria, the platform has become an integral part of everyday life.  “It makes the world close,” said 18-year-old Denis Davou, who joined Facebook in 2015 and has 2,000 friends on the platform. “We tend to have friends around the world and we chat. We tend to know things about other countries, and they should also know about our country,” he said. “I log in every day and I have like 3,000 friends,” said 17-year-old Pam Finna, who lives in a suburb of Jos. Denis and Pam are sincere in their appreciation of Facebook, and their comments are in line with Zuckerberg’s stated aim of “connecting the world”. But Denis and Pam, like many Facebook users we spoke to, admitted that they had no idea how to report the upsetting or frightening images that appeared on their phones. They belong to the Berom ethnic minority group and often see posts that vilify their people. Jos residents Pam and Dennis with their friends They are not alone in this, many young Nigerians remain unsure how to identify “fake news” or report it. “Most people who post have no idea what they’re posting or reposting because they themselves are not media literate,” said Muhammad Bala, a professor of mass communications at Bayero University. “They don’t understand motives, they don’t understand intent, they don’t understand underflowing currents of other things.” This lack of basic media literacy leaves them vulnerable to the kind of dangerous misinformation that is seen by thousands on Facebook in this region. Facebook told the BBC it was addressing the issue of media literacy. The company said that, in addition to their fact-checking initiative and machine learning tools, it has recently launched an “online safety and digital literacy youth programme” with 140 Nigerian secondary schools. But again, there is a problem of scale. Nigeria has more than 54,000 secondary schools – to say nothing of the millions of Nigerian children who are not in school at all. “The owners of Facebook should be doing much more,” said Dr Sam Godongs, professor of political science at Jos University. “Social corporate responsibility is part of the ethics of doing business… If you allow fake news to keep generating and brewing hate, then you are invariably killing people.” In Nigeria, the lines between misinformation and hate speech are often blurred. What is clear is that, despite Facebook’s attempts to root out hate speech, and the efforts they are making to detect and remove false information, hundreds of inflammatory posts are slipping through the net. Some of these posts report real atrocities, but are couched in language designed to incite ethnic hatred. Others spread false reports of killings. Many contain half-truths –rumours and insinuations that spread from phone to phone in the villages of Nigeria’s Middle Belt, unnerving communities who are already frightened by the violence of recent years. One divisive figure operating in this murky terrain is Dr Idris Ahmed, who has been singled out by the Nigerian army as an online troublemaker. Photo of Idris Ahmed from one of his Facebook profiles Ahmed is a living example of the complexity of the problem facing Facebook. He is based in the UK and runs an organisation called Citizens United for Peace and Stability. He says he was born in Nigeria, has British nationality, and identifies as Fulani. But from the safety of a suburban house in Coventry, Ahmed is sowing fear in Plateau State. “We have seen the worst of Boko Haram,” he wrote on 3 October 2018, in a post shared more than 890 times. “However, we have never seen terrorists killing innocent fellow humans and deriving pleasure in eating them up! The Berom terrorists are in a class of their own. They are the worst savage barbarians Africa has ever produced. We must WIPE-OUT the Berom terrorists, by whatever means necessary.” The words “savage” and “barbarians” are shocking, but “terrorists” is the key term here. Ahmed has used it repeatedly when referring to the Berom, coupled with calls for them to be “wiped out”. By doing so, he couches his calls for annihilation in terms that suggest he is referring to violent political criminals and not to an entire ethnic group. He has called Berom people “terrorists” in at least nine Facebook posts this year. There is no nationally or internationally recognised Berom terror group. And while Berom people have committed killings during Plateau State’s crisis, the Berom people as a whole are not engaged in violence. Screenshot of Facebook post by Idris Ahmed on 3 October 2018 Some of Ahmed’s followers, however, echo the dehumanising language he uses to describe Berom people. A comment below one of his posts calls for the Berom to be “wiped out” and labels them “savage and barbarian”. Another reads: “Kudos for exposing these silent killers, hope the military would respond with fire and fury and reduced them to greasy spots!” Ahmed is not the only Facebook user to deploy divisive and violent language against Berom people. In the Hausa language, Facebook posts calling for the Berom to be “wiped out” are even more explicit. “Security forces must ignore Amnesty International and wipe out Biroms totally,” posted one Hausa user to his roughly 5,000 followers on 25 June. “They should go there with sophisticated weapons and kill all the humans, animals and even birds.” In September this year, Ahmed used Facebook to make an unsubstantiated claim about the death of a retired general. His post insinuated the army was involved in the killing, exacerbating an already tense situation. The Nigerian army was incensed. “We dare Dr Idris Ahmed to provide evidence to support his infantile claims,” wrote Texas Chukwu, the Nigerian army’s public relations director, in response to Ahmed’s post. He called Ahmed’s claims about the disappearance of the general “imbecilic” and “completely out of sync with reality”. Members of the Berom ethnic group in Jos have also expressed serious concerns about the impact of Ahmed's Facebook activity. “Idris is an element of destruction,” said Joshua Pwajok, a Berom youth leader who lives in Jos. “He has succeeded in building an army of hatred, an army among his people.” Sam Godongs, professor of political science at Jos University, reflecting on the overall issue of hate speech and “fake news”, fears that Facebook does not understand the seriousness of the situation. “Cumulatively this is responsible for genocide,” he said. “How I wish [Facebook] were aware of the gravity of what we are facing. And if they are aware, I am wondering why they are so inactive or insensitive. We are talking of human lives.” Facebook told the BBC it has teams which are “dedicated to preventing false news and polarisation from contributing to real world harm”, especially in countries where “it has life and death consequences”. The company said it is hiring new dedicated staff to address such issues around the world, but did not disclose any specific details regarding Nigeria. Facebook cannot claim to be unaware of Idris Ahmed. His account has been suspended twice, once in 2016 and again in 2017, only to be reinstated a few days later. BBC Africa Eye reported one of his posts about “wiping out” Berom “terrorists” to Facebook on 8 November. The company removed the post the following day and disabled Ahmed’s account for a third time. His second Facebook account however – which has more than 30,000 followers and on which he has also referred to “Berom terrorists” – remains active. Ahmed did not respond to the BBC's request for a formal comment in time for publication. In a phone conversation, he described the BBC's description of his Facebook account as “grotesque” and said it did not fairly reflect his character. “I will try to recover the [disabled] account, by making the Facebook administrators see sense,” he told his followers on 10 November. “Pray for our success,” he said. In October, the BBC visited the home of Umma and Amina, the widows of Ali, the potato seller who was killed at the roadblock in June. On the road into the village, at the place where Ali was dragged from his car, the tarmac was still blackened from the tyres that burned at the roadblock. There were several more spots like this, dotted around Jos South – fading reminders of the 11 men who were killed, and of that fact that, in central Nigeria, “fake news” can ignite real violence. At first glance, Ali’s home was a picture of domestic peace. A little girl was reading through a school textbook while her brother and sister chatted among themselves. Two younger children dashed inside to fetch something. Amina sat on a makeshift stool washing clothes in a large bowl, a baby strapped to her back. Umma, Ali’s first wife, crouched in the corner washing kitchen utensils. But the silence in the room made it clear that something was amiss. And when Umma started to talk about her husband of 20 years, she could not keep from crying. Ali's youngest wife Amina Wiping away tears with a pink head scarf, she recalled a kind, funny, and generous man. He loved children, she said, and in addition to his own he adopted two of his nephews after his brother died. When Ali went away on business, he always came home with biscuits for the kids. “He used to play with them so much,” Umma said, looking at the small faces huddled behind her. “If he was here, you won’t see these children around.” Umma and Amina were getting by with help from the local community, who were horrified by Ali’s death. They were slowly trying to piece their lives back together, in the hope of peace for their region. “You see that our child, that small one,” said Umma, glancing towards one of the young boys in the courtyard. “Every day he talks about it, saying ‘Mummy, I am going to buy a gun and shoot those who killed my father.” Built with Shorthand"
Meeting Kosovo's clickbait merchants,"One clickbait merchant chose to remain anonymous Two weeks ago, I was sitting in a dark bar in a small town an hour's drive from Kosovo's capital, Pristina. In front of me, a man was nervously hunched over, his face turned away from the camera. He was a fake news merchant and he agreed - eventually - to talk about how he earned his living. I first came to Kosovo over a year ago when researching a book about how power was changing in the digital age. I'd heard about shadowy Russian influence campaigns and militaries fighting warfare with information. But the people I met there showed me there was another, very simple reason why people sent false and sensationalist news to Western audiences. It was for the money - they share it because we click on it. Clickbait and ""fake news"" are terms sometimes used interchangeably to describe false or sensationalist material circulating on the web. On the frontline of India's WhatsApp fake news war Egypt sentences activist for 'spreading fake news' Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it A year ago, ""Burim"" showed me that misinformation was a flourishing industry. Some of what he described was political, far more of it was gore. ""Dog Groomer Who Kicked Dog till its Ribs Broke Remains Jail-Free"" was one story. ""Boy Comes out of Coma after 12 Years, Whispers Dark Secret to Parents [video]"" was another. Much of it was false. And while some of it looked like news, this was content for one reason alone: clicks. Making money from the internet means capturing audiences and the merchant I spoke to owned about a dozen Facebook pages, dedicated to anything from evangelical Christianity to holiday destinations. Whatever their theme, the audiences were huge: 90,000 likes; 240,000 likes; 26,000 likes. Burim could get his content to nearly a million pairs of eyeballs and he turned those clicks into ad revenue - both within the social media platform and on external sites. He earned about 600 euros (Â£520) a day. It's far more money than any of the legitimate jobs he could take would offer him. Carl Miller has documented the clickbait industry in Kosovo for BBC Click Since I met Burim, the tech giants have vowed to shut this industry down. Fake news is what Mark Zuckerberg calls his ""personal challenge"". In 2018, Facebook doubled its security team to 20,000 and closed down many groups and pages that shared clickbait, squeezing their content towards near invisibility. So, last month, I went back, this time with the BBC. I wanted to see if anything had changed and what Facebook's anti-fake news drive really looked like in the eyes of the people who peddled the stuff. ""The audience on that page is mainly UK,"" the man said, grinning, hunched over his phone so that the camera couldn't catch his face. It is difficult to tell exactly how large this illicit economy had become in the past. But Facebook's reforms, I heard again and again, have had some effect. Page after page had been shut down. Income had fallen from 600 euros a day to about 100. Spreading false news, then, has become less profitable - and possibly also less political. It has apparently morphed into celebrity hype, false stories of footballers breaking legs or lurid sexual gore. The content creators were sharing trivia, not Trump. However, although less profitable, the practice was still widespread. ""Forty per cent of Kosovan youth are doing this,"" one merchant told me. ""Thousands upon thousands,"" said another. And it's little wonder. 100 euros a day is still life-changing for someone, like him, who'd earned seven euros a day as a waiter before he started. The ""why"" was clear. In the face of Facebook's reforms, the bigger surprise was ""how"". There is another side to this fake news and clickbait industry that isn't visible to us. I learned that a network of closed groups exist, with memberships that can number from a few hundred to several thousand. To be part of such a closed group, you have to be invited. Gaz, a former clickbait merchant, explained how the industry worked But inside, it was clear that Facebook wasn't just the place where they harvested audiences. It was also where the fake news merchants themselves traded with each other. I saw Facebook pages with hundreds of thousands of likes traded for thousands of dollars. Others sold fake likes, or fake accounts, or offered advice on how to get around Facebook's enforcement. We even found a ""fake news starter pack"" for a beginner, complete with a collection of Facebook pages to gather an audience, along with websites to monetise your activity. This was a service sector economy for misinformation. It wasn't just Facebook that was innovating, the misinformation merchants were too. Some were specialised in growing pages and selling them on. Others would sell content, and more still concentrated on getting around Facebook's enforcement. Even within small groups, this was happening routinely and dozens of times a day. It was industrial-scale gaming of Facebook's policies and systems. Pristina is the capital of Kosovo - and apparently a hub for clickbait Around the world, there are thousands of people like those I spoke to. Usually young, male and digitally savvy, they are willing to share any content for the clicks. And in the chase for clicks online, the horrifying, shocking, exaggerated, or divisive wins out again and again. I've begun to reflect on this kind of fake news, of content exported to Western markets for profit, as something akin to poppy growing. It's a cash crop. It's no use to the people that make it. It doesn't do any good to the foreign markets that consume it. But it is - by far - the easiest and most accessible way of making money for some. If you want to stop it, you can't just burn the fields. You also need to give people something else to grow.

Heavy Gaza-Israel fire traded overnight,"Buildings in the southern Israeli town of Ashkelon were hit by rockets fired from Gaza Eight people have been killed in a flare-up of violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. More than 460 rockets have been fired into Israel by militants since Monday night, while Israeli aircraft have hit 160 militant targets in response. Seven Palestinians, several of them militants, died in the strikes on Gaza, while a Palestinian civilian was killed in a rocket attack in southern Israel. Later, Palestinian militant groups said Egypt had brokered a ceasefire. The military wing of Hamas, the Islamist movement that dominates Gaza, said it would ""abide by this declaration as long as the Zionist enemy commits to it"". A senior Israeli official appeared to confirm the report,external. Israeli media quoted the official as saying: ""Israel maintains its right to act. Requests from Hamas for a ceasefire came through four different mediators. ""Israel responded that the events on the ground will decide [how it proceeds]."" Life in the Gaza Strip Gaza protest image likened to famous painting The escalation began when an undercover Israeli special forces operation inside Gaza was exposed on Sunday. A Hamas commander was among seven militants killed in clashes, and an Israeli lieutenant-colonel in the undercover unit also died. Recently there had been signs that the UN and Egypt had made progress in an effort to secure a truce on the Gaza border, where more than 200 Palestinians have been killed in protests since March. The Israeli military has been accused of using excessive force against protesters, but has said its soldiers have only opened fire in self-defence or on potential attackers trying to infiltrate its territory. After a brief lull following Sunday night's violence, a barrage of rockets and mortars was launched towards Israel late on Monday, which Israeli medics said killed one person and injured 28. A bus, which had reportedly been carrying troops, was hit by an anti-tank missile in the Shaar Hanegev region,external, seriously wounding a male soldier. Allow Twitter content?

Overnight, a man was killed when a block of flats in Ashkelon was hit by a rocket. He was later identified as a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank who had been working in Israel. Eight other people were injured in the attack, including two women who the Israeli ambulance service said were in a serious condition. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out what it called a wide-scale attack against military targets belonging to the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups. Israeli aircraft struck the Hamas interior security headquarters in Gaza City It said they included Hamas's military intelligence headquarters in northern Gaza and ""a unique vessel"" in a harbour in the south of the territory. The building housing Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV was also bombed after being evacuated. The IDF said the outlet ""contributes to Hamas's military actions"". The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said seven people were killed and 26 others injured in the strikes. At least four of the dead were militants; two are said to have been farmers in northern Gaza.

This is one of the most serious rounds of fighting since Israel and Hamas fought a war in 2014. The IDF has warned it is prepared to ""dial up its response"" to the rocket fire, while Hamas's military wing said it was ready to ""expand the circle of fire"" against Israel. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said the escalation was ""extremely dangerous"" and that efforts were being made to pull Gaza ""back from the brink"". By Tom Bateman, BBC News, southern Israel This latest flare-up has shown again how swiftly the pendulum can swing from the brink of a longer-term truce to the brink of all-out conflict. For months there has been quiet yet intensive shuttle diplomacy brokered largely by Egyptian intelligence officials and Nickolay Mladenov. Hamas sought an easing of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza amid deteriorating economic and humanitarian conditions, while Israel wanted calm on the Gaza perimeter. Some limited results were starting to be delivered - literally, in the form of fuel for Gaza's power plant and $15m (Â£12m) in cash from Qatar, which was allowed into Gaza to help fund the salaries of unpaid Hamas civil servants. But the indirect process also came under attack from internal critics on both sides, who saw it as a sign of unnecessary compromise or weakness. The current escalation is likely to have strengthened those voices for now. Palestinians said they discovered an undercover Israeli unit in a civilian car about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip, east of Khan Younis, late on Sunday. A firefight ensued in which the Hamas commander was killed. Israel launched air strikes and opened fire with tanks on the area, witnesses said. Six other militants were killed as well as one of the Israeli special forces soldiers. Due to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission. Israel carried out air strikes when Sunday night's firefight erupted The IDF said, however, that the operation was ""not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security"". According to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence-gathering operation that went wrong. A spokesman for Hamas denounced Sunday's incident as a ""cowardly Israeli attack"". Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year. While Mr Abbas's umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it. Schools have been ordered to close in Israeli border communities as a precaution Israel, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006 in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants. Israel and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket fire from Gaza and Israeli air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence.

The wildfire season usually starts in summer and runs into early autumn there, but recent low humidity, dry conditions and warm fast-moving winds have created ideal conditions for blazes to spread. In Paradise, a town north of Sacramento, thousands of buildings have been destroyed and at least 29 people are known to have died, with more than 200 others still unaccounted for. Despite the widespread destruction, some pets have been recovered there alive, giving hope to survivors who are still missing theirs. Allow Twitter content?

Bisto owner plans Brexit stockpile,"Premier Foods wants to keep making its wide range of products whatever happens with Brexit Premier Foods has said it intends to stockpile raw materials in the run-up to Brexit as fears grow over gridlock at UK ports. The firm, which owns Bisto, Oxo and Mr Kipling, said it was taking steps ""in the absence of certainty over the arrangements for the UK's departure from the EU"". Premier Foods said it expected to spend up to Â£10m on the preparations. It also hopes to sell its Ambrosia custard and creamed rice business. It said it was having ""discussions with third parties regarding the potential disposal"" of the brand, as well as the factory in Devon where the products are made. Premier Foods said it had seen lower sales of custard products because of the hot summer and had reduced its promotional investment in the brand. The company's shares were up more than 2% in Tuesday morning trading. ""The group shortly intends to start a process of building stocks of raw materials to protect the company against the risk of delays at ports,"" Premier Foods said. The firm said this had the potential to cause ""an adverse movement of up to Â£10m in working capital"", but it hoped to compensate for that outlay in the next financial year. My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Brexit stockpiling: No room at warehouse Premier Foods said that ""like all businesses"", it had spent several months planning on ""a range of scenarios subject to the nature of any Brexit deal that is reached"". ""As part of this, Premier Foods have a cross-functional team in place which continues to keep the possible implications to our business under review,"" it added. ""This is purely a precautionary measure as Premier Foods, like all companies, ensures it's prepared for any Brexit scenario."" Meanwhile, chief executive Gavin Darby has said he will step down at the end of January. He said he would be leaving on the sixth anniversary of his joining Premier Foods. Mr Darby's announcement of his imminent departure comes almost four months after he survived a bid to oust him at the company's annual meeting. Activist hedge fund Oasis Management, the firm's second-largest shareholder, had called for him to resign, a call supported by 41% of shareholders. Premier Foods has been under fire over a number of issues, including its failure to lift its share price above the 65p-a-share bid offered by US condiment giant McCormick in 2016. However, the firm's first-half results have shown a 14% profit rise. Adjusted pre-tax profit was Â£30.2m, up from Â£26.4m in the same period a year earlier.

Australian guilty of deadly car rampage,"James Gargasoulas drove his car into pedestrians in Melbourne last year An Australian man has been found guilty of murdering six people and injuring 27 others in a vehicle attack in Melbourne. James Gargasoulas, 28, deliberately drove a stolen car into pedestrians along Bourke St in the city centre in January last year. He pleaded not guilty to the attack, but later admitted that he had carried it out. A jury convicted Gargasoulas after deliberating for less than an hour. The attack claimed the lives of Bhavita Patel, 33, Matthew Si, 33, Yosuke Kanno, 25, Jess Mudie, 22, Thalia Hakin, 10, and three-month-old Zachary Bryant. Relatives of the victims wiped away tears as the word ""guilty"" was read out 33 times in the Supreme Court of Victoria on Tuesday, local media reported. Last week,Bourke St was the scene of an unrelated stabbing attackthat left one victim dead and two others injured. The jury was shown graphic footage of Gargasoulas, also known by the name Dimitrious, carrying out the attack in the popular shopping area. Other footage showed him driving erratically beforehand, as dozens of bystanders watched on. This video can not be played Footage showed Gargasoulas driving erratically before the attack During the trial, Gargasoulas testified that he had received a premonition from God directing him to drive into pedestrians. When asked whether he knew he would kill people, he said: ""In a sense, yes."" 'Perfect little baby' among rampage victims The court heard he had exceeded speeds of 60km/h (37mph) during his rampage, and did not stop driving even when a pram became lodged in his windscreen. Gargasoulas had taken the drug ice, also known as crystal methamphetamine, in the month before the attack. Prosecutor Kerri Judd QC told the court: ""[It] is the clearest case of criminal liability that you will ever come across."" Defence lawyer Theo Alexander did not challenge the prosecution's case in his closing address. In a joint statement, relatives of five of the victims welcomed the guilty verdict. ""His callous actions on that day shattered the lives of the family and friends whose loved ones he stole,"" they said. A makeshift memorial last year featuring photos of victims Matthew Si and Jess Mudie ""The families of the victims are grateful to all those whose hard work secured today's outcome, and for the ongoing support they have received during this difficult time."" Gargasoulas will be sentenced at a later date. The state of Victoria toughened its bail lawsin response to the attack, after it was found that Gargasoulas had previously been released from custody against the wishes of police.

UK unemployment edges higher,"Wages rose at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in the three months to September,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.,external Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, rose by 3.2% - the biggest rise since the end of 2008 and up slightly on the previous quarter. However, the ONS warned that real wage growth was below the 2015 level. The unemployment total went up for the first time this year, rising by 21,000 in the same period to 1.38 million. Compared with a year ago and adjusting for inflation, average weekly earnings increased by 0.9%. That figure excludes bonuses. ""With faster wage growth and more subdued inflation, real earnings have picked up noticeably in the last few months,"" ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said. Firms 'struggling to recruit as overseas staff stay away' But Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says wages will ""struggle"" to accelerate much further. ""Flows of people out of self-employment and into employee roles have remained strong, ensuring that record-high job vacancies don't lead to spiralling wage growth,"" he said. The ONS noted that the decline in workers from eastern European countries was ""accelerating"", while there had been an ""uptick"" in British nationals in work. The unemployment rate went up to 4.1% from 4.0% in the period from July to September. Two reasons largely accounted for this - the rising population in the UK and an increase in the number of men out of work. ""Job creation since May has averaged just 2,900 a month. This slowdown in the number of new jobs opening up is likely to feed through into weaker consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC. Analysis by economics correspondent Andy Verity You might well have expected it to happen. The prospect of Brexit and the weak pound seems to have put off some migrants from coming to the UK to work, while others have decided to return to their country of origin. Now we have the strongest evidence so far of that trend - with the number of EU nationals working in the UK falling by 132,000 in the three months from July to September compared with the same period a year before. While migrant workers coming from the rest of the world grew by 34,000 there is still a net outflow of migrant workers. And it is particularly striking when you focus on the so-called EU 8 - Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Based on ONS calculations, the number of workers in the UK from those countries (as opposed to more recent joiners such as Bulgaria and Romania) are down 173,000 from the record high of 1.05 million two years ago. There has been a range of views on the latest wage growth and unemployment figures. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said that ""the benefits of a strong jobs market are paying off"". He added: ""With more people now in work then ever before and unemployment almost halving since 2010, we are delivering an economy that gives people the opportunity of a better future."" However, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for a rise in the minimum wage to Â£10 and added: ""Boosting pay packets must be a priority. ""Pay is rising at a snail's pace and wages aren't expected to return to their pre-crash value for at least another six years."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK's impending departure from the European Union had played a part in the rise in the number of people out of work. He said it suggested that ""the UK jobs market may be starting to falter under the weight of persistent Brexit uncertainty and chronic skills shortages"". The Recruitment and Employment Confederation highlighted what it said was a record number of job vacancies of 845,000 from August to October - the highest since comparable records began in 2001. Director of policy Tom Hadley said employers were ""continuing to experience fundamental challenges in finding the staff and skills that they need"". These skills shortages would ""further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work"", he added.

Badger culls have 'real but modest' effect,"Culling badgers has a ""modest"" effect in slowing the spread of TB say experts An independent scientific review has said that badger culling can have a ""modest"" effect in reducing cattle TB. But it adds that the policy would lead to more than 40,000 badgers being culled a year. The report says that such high levels of culling may not be publicly acceptable. The authors urge the government to accelerate the development of non-lethal controls, such as vaccination. The findings were published in a review led by Prof Sir Charles Godfray of Oxford University. But one expert said the report had little to say about the effectiveness of the current badger culls. The report was commissioned by Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in February. He asked an independent group of scientists to review Defra's strategy for controlling the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. According to Prof Godfray he was ""explicitly asked"" not to look at the effectiveness of the current culls. Instead Prof Godfray and his team drew on the results of the Randomised Badger Control Trials carried out between 1998 and 2007. This video can not be played The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s These showed that culling tended to increase TB in badgers because of increased movement. It did, however, find that a reduction of between 12% and 16% in the rate of new cases of cattle TB was theoretically possible, but with significant caveats: the culling had to be carried out over a large area with natural boundaries for between eight to twelve days each year for four years and that more than 70% of badgers had to be killed. Since culling began in 2013, scientists and campaigners have expressed concerns that the culls that have been rolled out by Defra have not been in accordance with the strict criteria set out by the expert group because they have proved too expensive or too difficult. They say that improperly conducted trials could actually increase cattle TB rates. But Prof Godfray notes that, in principle, culling is one of the tools ministers have at their disposal and it should be up to them whether its marginal benefit was worthwhile. Ministers lying about badger cull, say vets Has Defra shown badger culling works? 'Fake science used to back badger culls' Badger cull plan 'crazy scheme' ""We conclude that culling does have an effect on the disease. The phrase we use is 'a real but modest effect',"" he said. ""If nothing else is involved then one would obviously cull, because if one does not cull one is throwing away one of the tools. But of course there are many other factors involved."" Another argument Prof Godfray puts forward in favour of culling is that it makes affected farmers more amenable to carry out unpopular and costly disease control measures on their farms and in transporting their cattle. ""It is likely that the farming industry would be more willing to accept other interventions that could negatively affect dairy and beef profitability if they believed that the threat of transmission from badgers was being robustly addressed,"" he said. The report warns however that continued culling ""would not be acceptable to some (possibly large) sections of the public, and the costs of policing could be substantial"" and says that a shift away from culling is ""highly desirable"". Specifically, it emphasises the need for a proper evaluation of badger vaccination. Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test Prof Godfray's report also states that infections from cattle to cattle is higher than had been thought, possibly because the current so called skin test used to test for the disease is less reliable than experts once believed. It therefore urges that Defra adopts more sensitive tests. The farming minister welcomed the report and said that Defra would give its response by next summer. ''We welcome this review of the government's 25-year Bovine TB strategy and I extend my thanks to Sir Charles Godfray and his team for their hard work in producing the report. ""Sir Charles' report is an important contribution that will inform next steps in the strategy to achieve officially TB free status for England by 2038.'' Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said that the report had many good ideas but said nothing about the effectiveness of the current badger culls. ""The report contains little critical evaluation of whether the current farmer-led culls are effectively reducing cattle TB,"" she said. ""It reports results from the first two years of monitoring without mentioning any of the caveats included by the original authors. It makes no mention of more recent data, which have suggested incidence might be falling in two areas but rising in a third."" Prof Lord John Krebs from Oxford University, who led the Randomised Badger Control Trials, said that the report indicated that Defra and farmers need to do more if cattle TB is to be stamped out. ""Currently, much of the spread of TB in cattle arises from a combination of disappointingly low uptake of measures to prevent cattle coming into contact with badgers, trading of infected cattle, and the low sensitivity of the standard skin test for TB, which means that there is likely to be a hidden reservoir of infection in many cattle herds in high risk areas,"" he said. ""Unless the government and the farming industry tackle these problems now, TB will not be eradicated or controlled.""

Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Martin Goodman's Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18. For years Lee wrote only simple comics, focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns and aimed at young readers. Aged 40, he decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong. In 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel, and the golden age of comic books began. Black Panther (portrayed in film by actor Chadwick Boseman, right) was one of the first black mainstream superheroes in America Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was the first black superhero featured in a mainstream US comic. Other characters he created include the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and others achieved cult status in their own right. In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.

I'm a Celebrity line-up 2018 revealed,"Actor John Barrowman, football manager Harry Redknapp and X Factor runner-up Fleur East are heading to the jungle for this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! They are among 10 stars who will undertake challenges in the Australian jungle for up to three weeks. Noel Edmonds is also in the line-up,according to The Sun,external- though ITV would not confirm his involvement. The 2018 show kicks off on 18 November at 21:00 GMT. Holly Willoughby will co-host with Declan Donnelly, while Ant McPartlin takes a break from TV presenting. Speaking ahead of venturing into the jungle, Redknapp said he had never watched the programme before. ""There's nothing tougher than being a manager of a football team when things aren't going well,"" the 71-year-old said. ""You feel responsible, however many people support your team every week. The buck stops with you. You haven't got many friends when it's not going well as a football manager. ""So no, I don't think doing this will be tougher."" Singer Fleur East, runner-up on The X Factor in 2014, said she was terrified of the challenges she might face on Australia's Gold Coast. ""I am scared of everything you have in there and I am scared of all the trials,"" said the 31-year-old. Malique Thompson-Dwyer - aka Prince McQueen on Hollyoaks - also admitted to some trepidation.

Tory rebellion over betting machines,"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? The government is facing a rebellion over the timing of its crackdown on fixed-odds gambling machines. Ministers have promised to cut the machines' maximum stake from Â£100 to Â£2 in October 2019 - but some MPs are calling for it to happen sooner. More than 20 Conservatives have joined opposition politicians in trying to bring the change forward to April 2019. They backed an amendment to the Finance Bill, which was tabled on Monday evening. The government said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe. It has denied that MPs were led to believe the cut in the maximum stake would come into force in April - but the timing, announced in last month's Budget, has been criticised, with sports minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Pro-betting MPs more persuasive - Crouch 16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms In her resignation letter, Ms Crouch suggested MPs who supported the betting industry had been ""more persuasive in their arguments"" to senior ministers - and it was this that had convinced them to opt for the later date. Scheduling the change for October means it will happen at the same time as increases in the amount of tax charged to gambling firms who are based abroad but operate in the UK. The government says doing it this way means the public finances will not be hit by a fall in the amount of tax coming in. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate Â£1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and bring in taxes of Â£400m for the government. The Finance Bill is the legislation that puts the proposals outlined in the Budget into law. Senior Tories Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Justine Greening backed the amendment on Monday evening, along with four DUP MPs. Currently, people can bet as much as Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing. Labour's Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fixed-odds betting terminals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the MPs were trying to ""force the government into doing the right thing"". The Welsh Labour deputy leader said there was a ""very realistic chance"" that MPs would back bringing in the cut to April 2019 when they discuss the Finance Bill. ""There's a huge feeling in the House that this is the wrong decision and we need to implement it as a matter of urgency,"" she added. The government said it was making ""a significant change that will help stop extreme losses and protect the most vulnerable in our society"". The amendment will be voted on next week.

Britain's first specialist wound hub to open,"This video can not be played Specialist wound hub opens in Birmingham Terror attack victims and injured soldiers are among those set to benefit from Britain's first specialist wound research centre. Staff are developing new techniques to treat burns, with the goal of achieving scar-free healing within a generation. It will also give mental health support to those with physical injuries. The Centre for Conflict Wound Research at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital will be opened by the The Countess of Wessex later on Tuesday. The centre will work with people from the armed forces, and has been set up in partnership with the CASEVAC injured veterans club Led by charity The Scar Free Foundation, the centre will lead a national programme of clinical, psychological and scientific research. Latest news from the West Midlands It will also trial a new battle-ready transportable dressing. By BBC Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale Hundreds of British service personnel suffered life-changing injuries, such as the loss of limbs, while fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many are still living with the visible scars caused by battle. Now this centre is pioneering new techniques to help them recover. It includes the use of lasers to reduce the scarring on old wounds - such as amputations. The centre has also developed a new dressing that can be applied on the battlefield. In addition the dressing, which helps speed up healing and reduces scarring, could be used at the scene of traffic accidents and to treat burns victims of bomb or acid attacks. More than 480 patients, many of them injured veterans, will take part in research at the site over the next three years. Brendan Eley, chief executive of the Scar Free Foundation, said: ""The physical and emotional effects of scarring are serious and often life changing."" The centre has been set up in partnership with the University of Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, the Centre for Appearance Research at the University of the West of England, and the CASEVAC Club - made up of wounded veterans from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Brexit: Delay or decision?,"What was ""a vital 48 hours to get this done"" has now morphed (again) into one of those days where it is not completely clear yet if Theresa May will actually try to get her Cabinet to decide anything on Tuesday, or delay a conclusion (again). Aswe reported, after last week's meeting, there were plenty of her allies insistent that something had to be signed off this week in order to get the hoped-for November deal, so that scary-sounding necessary no-deal plans don't have to be triggered. For once, the Cabinet seemed to have agreed on something, that a deal this month had to be the priority. Plainly therefore, if Number 10 felt they could get something signed off this week, then they would. Brexit talks in the endgame, says May One Cabinet source told me this morning ""this really does have to be the crunch time"" and suggested that the PM would have a carefully-orchestrated plan for tomorrow's meeting and ""won't leave anything to chance"". But as the day has worn on, the idea of there being an agreement on Tuesday has slipped away. The negotiators were locked in talks until nearly 3am but didn't get to a final version of that troublesome Irish backstop that the government seems to have felt ready to present. So the talks go on. And every day that there is discussion rather than decision the prospect of a November deal fades. As we discussed here last week that doesn't mean that all is lost, that we are staggering towards leaving without an agreement. A deal could still be done in December. In fact, the government has a hard deadline in law of the end of January. That's not desirable at all. But it is not impossible. For Number 10 therefore the plan is to keep going, to keep trying, to carry on trying to find a form of words that works, that would be more politically palatable. There is huge frustration in parts of the Tory Party and in Cabinet about this whole approach. Why does Number 10 believe there could suddenly be a better answer to the same set of problems? As one former minister said, ""two plus two is not suddenly going to equal five"". And at the top table there seems to be growing appetite for a change of approach. Three different members of the Cabinet have told the BBC that the PM has to ditch her plan. Carrying on like this, they suggest, is simply banging their collective heads against the same brick wall, because it will never get through Parliament. Some of them are even suggesting that the prime minister should consider walking away from the talks. One of them told me: ""The raw truth is there is a gap between what we can accept and what the EU is offering. ""She needs to change the dynamic and only the prime minister can do that. That might mean walking away, or saying this is our best and final offer."" Another said: ""She needs to say that there won't be a deal in order for them to move - she needs to play hardball."" Another senior minister said there is ""no political logic"" in carrying on with something that has a ""cat's chance in hell"" of getting through Parliament, calling for her to ""pivot"". Is it realistic to imagine that she might change tack? Well, certainly it's not straightforward after more than two years of deliberations. Is it likely? Theresa May is not the kind of politician who does much on impulse. And a senior member of the government told me recently it was crazy to think the prime minister could change tack at this late stage. But with a deal, or without a deal, there is risk whatever she decides - whenever, and however, she makes that final call.

'Three minutes separated me from death',"William Hart saw charred people and animals as he fled his home in California About 250,000 people have been forced to flee to avoid three major wildfires in California. Some of the evacuees have shared their stories with the BBC. When William Hart woke up on Friday morning, he didn't notice anything unusual until he opened his front door. ""I noticed there was a lot of smoke outside. We live in Paradise. Everyone has a chimney here - but when we saw black and brown smoke coming we knew it wasn't chimney smoke,"" he said. William Hart witnessed charred bodies He and his room mate decided to flee - but had to quickly decide what to take. William said his room mate grabbed her dead husband's ashes but then questioned herself: ""Why am I doing this? He's already burned."" Meanwhile, William took his camping bag. ""I'm not very materialistic so I don't have many things."" It was a close escape. William said when he turned around in his street there was ""no life left"" behind him. ""Three minutes separated me from death."" William documented his evacuation in a video he posted on Facebook - but found some of the footage too harrowing to post. This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" ""I deleted charred human bodies from my video and charred animals trying to flee. I think they were dogs. ""Cars had become metal and bones"". William says he's now in Jackson, California: ""I was trying to help but now I'm mentally done."" Joseph Metcalfe woke his children up around midnight on Thursday and told them they had to evacuate. ""We tried to make it an exciting adventure so as to not worry the kids too much but on our exit we drove past 30ft (9m) high flames and could clearly see the raging fires burning down the hills"" ""This was a whole different level. ""The fire carried no prejudice. ""It has really put into perspective the value of life and the things we own, as the wealthy and the struggling alike have to face new challenges of rebuilding their lives."" Mee Forbes (centre) and Anabel Lois (right) had to evacuate along with their family Anabel Lois, 15, and her mother Mee Forbes live just a few miles from the town of Paradise, California. When Mee realised the seriousness of the situation she rushed home to her family: ""I just wanted my family safe."" As the fire approached their house, the family packed up a few belongings and evacuated to the town of Chico - but the fire soon caught up with them, forcing them to move on to Redding. Anabel, 15, told the BBC that the situation ""is still frightening"" and that she is struggling to comprehend what has happened. She said: ""I don't think I am going to believe it until I go back [home]."" Mee agreed that ""it just doesn't seem real"". ""You see it on the news and you just don't think it'll happen to you. You don't feel like you would ever be affected. ""People have really stepped up to help us find a place to stay for a night. It is really nice to have family and friends that are able to reach out to us. We are very thankful for that. ""We don't have any idea [when we can go home], there are fires still burning in our area. We are just waiting to see if our home is still standing.

Brexit 'judgement day' warning,"Theresa May returning to Downing Street on Monday Ministers have been told ""judgement day is coming"" over Brexit as the UK and EU strive for a deal within 48 hours. Officials are trying to hammer out an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by Wednesday to enable EU leaders to agree it by the end of the month. Downing Street said talks had gone on through the night but ""substantial issues"" still remained to be resolved. Amid growing pressure on the PM, one Tory said MPs will be ""judged at the bar of history"" if they back her plans. Mark Francois compared Mrs May's handling of the Brexit negotiations with the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in World War Two, complaining of ""one tactical defeat after another"". Ministers 'voiced Brexit plan doubts in July' MPs can stop no-deal Brexit, says Starmer Why May's Brexit deal may be impossible A growing number of Tory MPs are warning the prime minister that her Brexit plan will not be approved by Parliament while Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer has said MPs will not allow the UK to leave without a negotiated agreement and ""technically"" the whole process can be stopped. The uncertainty has been reflected on the financial markets,with sterling falling 1% against the dollar.before recovering slightly. Michel Barnier (right) is not in a position yet to recommend a special summit in November The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Negotiations are continuing on the so-called ""divorce"" agreement and an outline declaration on the two sides' future relationship. The next 48 hours are set to be critical in the process. Both sides want to schedule a special summit of EU leaders at the end of November to sign off the withdrawal deal but the EU says it will only agree to this if agreement can be reached on the issue of the Irish border. Time is running out to put the wheels in motion for the summit. EU member states need time to scrutinise any agreement before the gathering and the European Council's president Donald Tusk has reportedly said a deal must be reached by Wednesday evening at the latest. Following an update by their Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, EU officials played down talk of a breakthrough, saying ""intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet"". However, the Financial Times reported,externalthat Mr Barnier told EU diplomats that the text of an agreement was ""almost ready"" and everything hinged on whether Mrs May could muster enough political support in the UK. A November summit is a key staging post in trying to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. If the decision is pushed back to the next scheduled meeting in December, no-deal preparations will have to be ramped up significantly and the chances of getting it through the UK and EU parliaments will recede. Please upgrade your browser The negotiators have been burning the midnight oil in search of a deal. Talks continued to nearly 03:00 GMT on Monday and have since resumed in Brussels. The EU said key issues remained ""under discussion"", in particular over finding a solution to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Downing Street said some progress had been made but the proposed Irish backstop - a fallback arrangement for avoiding border checks, which would see the UK remain in a temporary customs arrangement - had not been agreed. Amid claims a special cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday to approve the deal had had to be postponed, No 10 said ministers would only be asked to approve the draft agreement when it was ready. Other sticking points include EU demands for a ""level-playing field"" in labour regulations and environmental standards during any temporary customs arrangement, so UK firms cannot undercut their European counterparts. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said it was a ""very important"" week for the Brexit process and the sooner the two sides bridged their differences the better. Penny Mordaunt said cabinet had a key role to play in the process Theresa May is coming under increasing pressure from both Brexiteers and Remainers. In his latest column for the Daily Telegraph, Boris Johnson called for a ""cabinet mutiny"" against the PM's proposal for the UK to sign up to EU rules in trade in goods without, he said, having any say in them. Mr Francois, the vice-chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said it was an open secret that five or six cabinet members were very unhappy with the PM's proposals and urged them to show ""moral courage"". ""It's been one tactical defeat after another,"" he said. ""Everyone of which has been followed by a retreat. And it all ends in one massive surrender right at the end."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the cabinet would be a ""check"" on whatever deal was agreed and suggested she could not support anything which did not respect the 2016 referendum result. ""Cabinet's job is to put something to Parliament that is going to deliver on the referendum result,"" she said. ""We need to work together as a Cabinet to do that."" Former education secretary Justine Greening, who backs another referendum on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU, said there was ""no chance"" of the PM's blueprint for future relations being approved by MPs. But Mrs May has received the support of one prominent Brexiteer in the cabinet. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said she was trying to get the ""very, very best deal"" for Britain. Brexit: Danger for May on all sides This video can not be played Gordon Brown: ""There will be a referendum at some point."" It's not only Conservative divisions which are on show over Brexit. Labour continues to struggle to read from the same script when it comes to another UK-wide vote. In an interview with a German magazine on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn said the public had already had their say and Brexit could not be stopped. He later told Channel 4 his priority was the UK's new relationship with Europe. Sir Keir Starmer, the party's Brexit spokesman, disagrees, pointing out that Labour members voted to keep all options open at their conference and Parliament would not allow the UK to leave without some form of agreement. This video can not be played ""All options are on the table"" if there is a no-deal Brexit, Keir Starmer tells Today And former prime minister Gordon Brown believes another referendum is inevitable at the some stage, although he will not predict when this might happen. In a speech to the Institute for Government in London on Monday, he claimed Brexit was now ""more divisive"" than either the Iraq War or the Miners Strike and  the door must be left open to the UK rejoining the EU one day. Referring to Mr Corbyn's remarks, he said. ""Jeremy always told me we should be bound by conference motions. He needs to look at the conference motion.""

Stolen dog found 300 miles from home,"Juan Mino was reunited with Kiara in Bangor more than a year after she was stolen from his garden in London An 11-year-old dog has been found nearly 300 miles from home more than a year after she was stolen. Pomeranian Kiara was taken from her garden in London in August 2017. But when two stray dogs wandered into Peter Daniel's house in Bangor, Gwynedd, he was able to find Kiara's owners Juan and Antoinette Mino via her microchip and reunite the family. Mrs Mino said she was ""so thankful"" her precious pooch had been found after she had given up hope. Mr Daniel said he spotted two dogs going through his bins on Saturday while he got ready to go to his work, before one of them - Kiara - walked into his house and made herself at home. Mourning dog waits for 80 days in road where owner died Dog trapped in engine during drive After he put out posts on lost dog groups on social media, Tess Jones volunteered to scan the dogs for microchips on Sunday - and while the other dog did not have one, Kiara's contained a phone number for her owners. ""They couldn't get their heads around it, I can't believe it myself,"" Mr Daniel said. ""While I was on the phone to the lady that owned the dog, her partner was getting in the car to drive the six or seven hours up here."" Kiara at home in London before she was stolen last year Co-operative worker Mr Daniel said when Mr Mino was reunited with Kiara, there was not a dry eye in the house. ""It was lovely,"" he said. ""I think we all shed a tear. Dogs are family members."" When Kiara was taken, Mr and Mrs Mino printed 500 lost dog posters, offered a reward and kept across lost dog agencies and councils. But after a year went by with two false alarms and no sign of Kiara, they gave up hope  - until this weekend. Finally reunited with her dog on Monday, Mrs Mino said she had spent more than a year haunted by thoughts of Kiara being abused or killed. ""I've just been crying for days, I am so thankful,"" she said. ""We are animal lovers and we have had dogs who have died before but with Kiara, we were always thinking 'what's happened to her? Was she ill-treated? Was she killed? Are they hitting her?' ""My husband was home when she was stolen and he always felt guilty. Peter Daniel with the other stray dog who he has now fostered ""It is so nice to have her back."" But alongside the celebrations, Kiara will need some tender loving care while she recovers. ""She came home in such a state, and she smells, apparently she was with another dog and they had been living rough for months."" Mrs Mino added Kiara's coat is in knots and she will have to be shaved by a vet, along with needing health checks and vaccinations. But Mr Daniel's life has also been changed after finding the dogs - as he is now fostering Kiara's stray friend with a view to permanently adopting the Jack Russell if its owners cannot be found. He described the weekend's events as a ""Christmas miracle"". Runaway dog found 400km from home The dogs stolen from their owners' homes On the case with the dog drone detectives.

"Israel-Gaza violence erupts after killingsGaza rocket barrage targets Israel, which responds with air strikes after militants die in covert op.Middle East","A bus in a kibbutz was set ablaze after being hit and an Israeli seriously wounded Violence has flared between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, a day after seven militants and an Israeli soldier were killed during an undercover Israeli operation in Gaza. Militants fired 300 rockets and mortars at Israel. One hit a bus, seriously injuring a soldier nearby. Israel responded with more than 70 strikes on what it said were targets belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Three Palestinians, two of them reportedly militants, were killed. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said nine Palestinians were injured. Meanwhile, Israeli medics said 10 people in Israel were injured. Israeli media later reported that a man was killed after a house was hit by a rocket in the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israeli Maj Gen Kamil Abu Rukun warned that Hamas ""has crossed a red line"" and Israel would ""continue to respond with an iron fist against all terrorist activity or rocket fire"""". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his visit to France for an urgent meeting with his security chiefs. A Hamas commander and an Israeli soldier were among the dead on Sunday. Palestinians said an Israeli unit travelling in a civilian vehicle had killed the Hamas commander. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli unit was about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel, when militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, stopped the car. The group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said the Israelis opened fire, killing a local commander, Nur Barakeh. Hamas commander Nur Barakeh's mother was seen at the morgue where his body was reportedly brought The incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. A gun battle erupted and Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire in the area, witnesses said. Six of the Palestinians killed belonged to Hamas and the seventh was a member of the militant Popular Resistance Committees, AFP news agency cited Palestinian officials as saying. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a member of the special unit involved was killed and another was lightly wounded. The Israeli soldiers were later flown back by helicopter. Due to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission. The IDF said, however, that the operation was ""not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security"". Israel carried out air strikes when Sunday night's firefight erupted The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says that according to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence-gathering operation that went wrong. The exposure of such an operation by Israeli special forces inside Gaza would be extremely rare, he says. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, denounced the incident as a ""cowardly Israeli attack"". IDF chief Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot said the Israeli unit had carried out ""a very meaningful operation to Israel's security"", without giving further details. The Israeli military said that immediately after the clashes, 17 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, three of which were shot down. Throughout Monday, some 300 rockets and mortars were launched towards Israel, dozens of which were intercepted while many landed in open spaces, according to the Israeli military.

Paramedics said an Israeli soldier was seriously injured when a projectile hit a bus he was standing near in the Shaar Hanegev region. Three people also suffered minor injuries from shrapnel in the town of Sderot. The Israeli military said aircraft and tanks bombed more than 70 Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza in retaliation, including militant compounds, observation posts, and rocket-launching squads. Israeli air strikes targeted the Hamas-run television station Al-Aqsa The building that houses the Hamas-run television station in Gaza, Al-Aqsa, was also struck, Palestinian officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military had warned that the property would be targeted, accusing the channel of broadcasting ""propaganda"", and staff had evacuated. Broadcasting reportedly resumed after a brief outage. Life in the Gaza Strip Gaza protest image likened to famous painting The IDF later said the military also hit Hamas's military intelligence headquarters. The health ministry in Gaza reported that three men were killed and nine other people were wounded in the Israeli strikes. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine militant group said two of the dead were its members. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov urged restraint from both sides. Allow Twitter content?

Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year. While Mr Abbas' umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it. Schools have been ordered to close in Israeli border communities as a precaution Israel, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006 in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants. Israel and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket-fire from Gaza and Israeli air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence. Sunday night's incident comes after apparent progress in an Egyptian- and UN-brokered process to mediate after a series of escalations between the two sides in recent months. More than 200 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March - most during weekly protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Israel has said its soldiers have only opened fire in self-defence or on potential attackers trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the protests. One Israeli soldier was killed on the Gaza-Israel border by a Palestinian sniper in July.
