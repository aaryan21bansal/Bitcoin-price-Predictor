PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy,"The UK has one of the largest defence budgets in the world The UK is to ""overhaul its approach to foreign policy"" as part of a government review, Downing Street has announced. No 10 says insights from internal and external experts will challenge ""traditional Whitehall assumptions"". The diplomatic service, tackling organised crime, the use of technology and the procurement of military supplies will all be looked at. The review will also seek ""innovative ways"" to promote UK interests while committing to spending targets. The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised that the UK would continue to spend 0.7% of gross national income on international aid. The party also said it would exceed the Nato target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defence. Is the UK toughening its stance with the US? The tough questions facing the UK and US Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? Boris Johnson's new government faces a number of foreign policy challenges including securing a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian recently predicted the two sides would ""rip each other apart"" during negotiations which are due tobegin on Monday. The UK is also hoping to secure a trade deal with the US but relations have been strained by the prime minister's decision to use Huawei to build the 5G network in the face of US opposition. The government is also keen to strengthen ties with China, but some of the prime minister's own MPs - including Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Tom Tugendhat - have cautioned against allowing Chinese companies' heavy involvement in projects such as the 5G network and HS2. Setting out details of the Integrated Review - first announced in December's Queen's Speech - Number 10 said Brexit presented ""new opportunities to define and strengthen Britain's place in the world"". Its remit, as set out by the government, is to: define the government's ambition for the UK's role in the world set out the way in which the UK will be a problem-solving and burden-sharing nation determine the capabilities needed for the next decade and beyond to pursue objectives and address threats identify the necessary reforms to government systems and structures to achieve these goals In a written statement,external, the prime minister said a cross-Whitehall team in the Cabinet Secretariat and a ""small taskforce"" in Number 10 will report to him and the National Security Council during the review. ""The review will be closely aligned with this year's Comprehensive Spending Review but will also look beyond it,"" he said in the statement. Experts ""beyond Whitehall"" in the UK and ""among our allies"" will be consulted, Mr Johnson said, and Parliament will be kept ""fully informed"". The review is expected to conclude later this year. The UK is seeking to negotiate a new trade deal with both the US and the EU The government says it will ""utilise expertise from both inside and outside government for the review, ensuring the UK's best foreign policy minds are feeding into its conclusions and offering constructive challenge to traditional Whitehall assumptions and thinking"". The UK's last full-scale security and defence review was completed in late 2015, before the UK voted to leave the EU. But Mr Tugendhat suggested it had been more than 20 years since a British government comprehensively reviewed its foreign policy objectives and the ""tools"" needed to achieve them. He told BBC Radio 4's Today it would premature to speculate on whether any ""rejigging"" of defence and aid priorities would result in cuts to manpower in any of the armed services. ""We all know that the fundamental decisive factor in battle, whether that is in sea, land or air, is people. It is basically draining the resources of your enemy and undermining their ability to fight,"" he said. ""That can be done in different ways - sometimes it is done by infantry soldiers... sometimes it is done by ships denying access to areas or protecting convoys and sometimes it is done by RAF pilots flying drones... All of these are different tools.""

EU ministers agree UK trade talks mandate,"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: UK needs to build Irish Sea checks infrastructure Ministers from the EU have approved their mandate for post-Brexit trade talks with the UK. The document,external- approved by the EU General Affairs Council on Tuesday - will be the basis for the negotiations, to be carried out by Michel Barnier. It says that EU standards should serve as ""a reference point"" in any future trade deal. Meanwhile, UK ministers have agreed the government's mandate for the negotiations, which begin on Monday. The final agreement is due to be published online and presented in Parliament on Thursday. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? EU warns UK over goods checks between NI and GB UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken What is a level playing field? The EU's mandate - a 46-page document - says that its ""envisaged agreement should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"". It says this should apply ""in the areas of state aid, competition, state-owned enterprises, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, relevant tax matters and other regulatory measures and practices in these areas"". EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to build a close, ambitious partnership with the UK"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc would not agree a deal ""at any price"". He warned there would be ""complex, demanding negotiations"" over a limited period of time, referring to the transition period that ends on 31 December. During this period, the UK continues to follow EU rules - including freedom of movement - and it is intended to allow time for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade agreement. Mr Barnier said: ""A short time, as chosen by the British government, not by us. ""In a very brief period, you can't do everything. We will do as much as we can under pressure of time."" Referring to the EU mandate document, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said: ""This is the blueprint that Michel Barnier will follow in the negotiations. ""We've learnt from experience these documents are very important because the EU will only accept a final outcome that is pretty similar to this starting point."" It is ""the roadmap for all the rows we're going to have over the next few months"", our correspondent added. Brexit: Will it be a Canadian or an Australian ending? What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? It is expected that ministers in the UK will commit to seekinga Canada-style agreementwith zero tariffs, a proposal Mr Johnson and his Europe adviser David Frosthave set out in speechesin recent weeks. But the push for a Canada-style deal could set up a clash with the EU after its chief negotiator Mr Barnier ruled out such an agreement. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will lead talks with the UK on future trade relations Mr Barnier has previously said the UK is too close in proximity to be permitted to compete with the other 27 member states on such terms. And Nathalie Loiseau, an MEP for French President Emmanuel Macron's La RÃ©publique En Marche! party, said that ""to my knowledge the UK is not Canada"", adding that the EU-UK relationship is ""very different"" from the one with Canada. Arriving at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels, Croatia's European Affairs minister Andreja Metelko-Zgombic said the EU would be willing to offer a ""substantial"" and ""ambitious"" partnership in trade talks. But Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok warned it will be ""very hard work"" and a ""tough road ahead"". And Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the prospect for a UK-EU free trade agreement will be ""damaged significantly"" if Britain did not build the infrastructure required for checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. The offer the EU was making to the UK was ""generous and fair"", he said. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the EU's proposals ""have been given a decidedly cool response from government sources"", who say the UK's priority is about control. He said the ""mood music"" from Number 10 was that the prime minister ""is quite prepared to walk away"" and use World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. When countries do not have free-trade agreements they use these terms. Under the WTO rules, each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering.

All supported the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. Following the meeting, the prime minister's spokesman said that agreeing the UK's negotiating mandate was a ""very smooth process"". ""The UK's primary objective in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021,"" the spokesman said. Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab What is the transition period? Mr Frost and his team will head to Brussels for the first round of negotiations on 2 March. One clash expected between the UK and EU is on fishing, with leading member states speaking regularly about wanting continued access to UK waters. In a speech in Greenwich, south-east London, earlier this month Mr Johnson announced that, once free of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, ""British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats"". But French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin signalled fishing would be a flash point when the two negotiating teams come together in London and Brussels over the coming months. ""The fishermen have the right to be protected, they know very well that if we sign a bad deal they will lose enormously,"" she told TV station France 2. The document also says that the UK should return ""unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin"". The passage is thought to refer to the Elgin Marbles, ancient Greek sculptures taken to Britain more than 200 years ago and now on display in the British Museum. Downing Street has insisted the future of the marbles is ""not up for discussion as part of our trade negotiations"". Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want?

Emma murder suspect jailed for girlfriend attackIain Packer was arrested just days after he featured in a BBC documentary on Emma Caldwell's murder.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Emma Caldwell's body was found in a wooded area more than 30 miles from Glasgow A suspect in one of Scotland's most high-profile murder investigations has been jailed for two years after physically attacking his ex-partner. Iain Packer was questioned by police over the death of Emma Caldwell. He featured in a BBC Disclosure programme last year, during which he denied killing Ms Caldwell in 2005 and insisted he was not a violent man. But just hours after the programme was broadcast, his ex-girlfriend told police he had physically attacked her. Two days later Packer was arrested and charged over the assault, which took place in November 2018. Last month he admitted pushing the woman on to a bed, putting his hands around her throat and choking her to the danger of her life. Packer also pled guilty at Airdrie Sheriff Court to charges of stalking and breaching a court order under which he was banned from contacting the woman. Sheriff Morag Shankland jailed Packer for a total of two years and imposed a five-year non-harassment order banning him from contacting his victim. The sheriff said it had been ""a very serious assault"" and that custody was the only appropriate sentence. However, she did not place Packer on the sex offenders register because there was no ""significant sexual element"" to the ""distressing"" messages he had sent to the woman. Emma Caldwell's body was found in May 2005 Ms Caldwell, 27, was a sex worker in Glasgow's red light district when she disappeared in April 2005. Five weeks later, her body was found in isolated woods near Roberton, almost 40 miles from Glasgow. She was naked and had been strangled. The murder investigation initially focused on four Turkish men, who were charged with Ms Caldwell's murder in August 2007. However, within a year, the case had collapsed and the men were released. During the investigation police interviewed hundreds of men who had been identified as regular users of sex workers, including Packer. He was one of Ms Caldwell's regular clients, and often took her and other sex workers to the same woods where her body was later found. Packer gave six statements to police between 2005 and 2007, but was not interviewed under caution as a suspect. In 2018, Packer was interviewed twice by investigative journalist Sam Poling for a BBC Disclosure documentary on the case. He denied killing Ms Caldwell and insisted that he had never been violent towards women. His former partner went to the police after watching the broadcast of the interview last year, and within days Packer had been charged with physically attacking her. During the court proceedings, it emerged that Packer also had previous convictions for domestic abuse towards former partners in 2007, 2008 and 2011. Defence lawyer Dale Hughes said Packer was sorry for the distress he had caused his victim, and that he was ""ashamed of himself"". By Sam Poling, BBC Scotland investigations correspondent For the best part of a year I investigated the murder of Emma Caldwell the police's botched inquiry into who had killed her, and a man whom I grew to believe was a prime suspect - Iain Packer. Packer was always emphatic in his denials to me. No, he hadn't killed Emma. No, he hadn't raped any of the women who'd claimed that he had. And no, he wasn't a violent man. Far from it, he told me. ""I've not been rough with any woman.  I've never hurt a woman in my life,"" he said. ""I can assure you I'm not a violent person."" We met many times, often over coffee. I wanted him to tell me his story and he seemed keen to oblige. I would investigate him, I said. That's fine, he replied, I have nothing to hide.

Disney boss Bob Iger steps down as chief executiveThe businessman is considered the most powerful man in Hollywood.Business,"Bob Iger has led Disney since 2005 Disney boss Bob Iger, who led the media company through several blockbuster acquisitions and the launch of a streaming network, is stepping down as chief executive. Disney said it had appointed Bob Chapek, who previously ran the company's parks and products division, to replace him. Mr Iger will remain Disney's executive chairman until the end of next year to direct ""creative endeavours"". The move came as a surprise. Mr Iger, who is considered by many to be the most powerful man in Hollywood, had served as chief executive since 2005. He has previously announced plans to retire only to push back his departure date. In a statement,externalon Tuesday, Mr Iger said it was the ""optimal time"" to begin to hand control of the company to a new leader. Disney recentlycompleted the acquisitionof Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox entertainment empire and launched theDisney+streaming channel late last year. Earlier, Mr Iger presided over the firm's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. ""The company has gotten larger and more complex just in the recent 12 months,"" Mr Iger said on a conference call on Tuesday. ""I felt that with the asset bases in place and with our strategy deployed I should be spending as much time as possible on the creative side of our business."" Remaining as executive chairman would ease the transition, he added. Mr Chapek oversaw the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort Mr Chapek, who joined Disney in 1993, will be the firm's seventh chief executive since it was formed in the 1920s. In his prior role, among other achievements, he oversaw the opening of Disney's park in Shanghai. ""His tremendous understanding of the breadth and depth of the Company and appreciation for the special connection between Disney and its consumers makes him the perfect choice,"" said Disney board member Susan Arnold. Shares in the firm fell 2% in after-hours trading after the news was announced. Mr Iger, who recently published a memoir, is much beloved by investors for his record steering the company to steady profits, despite upheaval in the television and movie industries. Disney claimed seven of the top 10 box office hits globally last year and the new streaming channel has already attracted more than 28 million paying customers. The firm's market value has increased five-fold during his tenure, Ms Arnold said. The firm is now worth about $230bn.

"Tesco bakeries overhaul puts 1,800 jobs at risk","Supermarket giant Tesco is set to cut more than 1,800 jobs as it makes changes to bakeries in larger stores. It said that 1,816 bakery staff were at risk of redundancy, with the changes taking place from May. The retailer said it would convert 58 of its bakeries so they will only finish pre-baked products on-site. Jason Tarry, the head of Tesco UK & Ireland, said it needed to ""adapt to changing customer demand"", with fewer people buying traditional loaves. The move comes as sales of bagels, wraps and flatbreads is increasing, according to Tesco. Bakeries at 257 sites will remain unchanged, with a further 201 still offering some products baked from scratch. Mr Tarry added: ""We know this will be very difficult for colleagues who are impacted, and our priority is to support them through this process. We hope that many will choose to stay with us in alternative roles."" The firm said it would have thousands of vacancies available across its stores between February and May. The main union representing Tesco staff, Usdaw, said the reports of job cuts were ""devastating"" for staff. Pauline Foulkes, its national officer, said many of those at risk were skilled workers. ""While we will do everything possible to maintain jobs or support impacted staff to redeploy into alternative roles, the reality is the opportunities to find suitable alternative skilled roles may be limited for these workers,"" she said.

Two jailed for killing reformed gangster,"Nedim Yasar became a mentor for young people after leaving a life of crime Nedim Yasar, a former gang leader who had turned his back on crime, was shot dead in Copenhagen just as a book about his life was published. The motive for the attack in November 2018 remains unknown. Now a court has found two men in their twenties guilty of his killing and jailed them for life. Alexander Findanis was convicted of firing the shots and his friend Martin Binni Svanberg was found guilty of driving the getaway car. A life sentence is rare in Denmark and the pair are likely to serve at least 16 years in jail. Both deny involvement in the attack and intend to appeal against the verdict. Police said they were satisfied the verdicts reflected the cold-blooded nature of the killing and relied on mobile phone evidence that pinpointed the pair as being in the vicinity around the time of the attack. Marie Louise Toksvig, who wrote her late colleague's life story, said it was a waste of three lives but she was very happy the court had made the decision that ""these two guys are the ones who did it"". The scene of the shooting following the book launch event in Copenhagen However, the men's lawyer, Mai-Brit Storm Thygesen, said the prosecution had agreed with the defence that no motive had been proved for the murder. Prosecutor Jens Povlsen said: ""You don't need a motive to convict someone, you just need the evidence."" Ms Storm Thygesen argued the evidence against the pair was weak.""Alexander Findanis was arrested almost a month after the killing and for that reason he was not able to recall what he did that night. From the [CCTV] video you cannot identify the face or anything,"" she told the BBC. Findanis, 25, was described as a member of the Satudarah motorcycle gang and Svanberg, 26, admitted driving in the area at the time of the killing. Yasar, 31, was shot dead moments after leaving the launch event for the book about his story Roots: A Gangster's Way Out. Marie Louise Toksvig's book detailed his journey into and away from gangland crime. Born in Turkey, he arrived in Denmark aged four and ran a notorious Copenhagen-based crime gang called Los Guerreros. Reformed gangster shot after book launch He eventually left the gang in 2012 when he found out he was to become a father and became a mentor for young people on local radio station Radio24syv. Toksvig told the BBC she had known Yasar for three or four years, by which time he had already left his gang and worked through an exit programme with a view to getting the basic education he had missed when he was young. Yasar's memoir Roots: A Gangster's Way Out was released in 2018 ""When I met him he was some steps on that bridge towards crossing over. And when he died he had almost crossed all the way over. He was in school wanting to get trained to work with helping young people like himself in the future,"" she told the BBC. ""Just over a year before he died, someone came to his door and tried to attack him with a knife. In his earlier days he would never have opened the door in the middle of the night without having a weapon in his hand. But when this happened he told me 'I'm just like you, I didn't suspect anything'.  That told him and me quite a lot about his transition."" This video can not be played What makes some fall into a life dominated by gangs, violence and loss? Daniel and Aliyah share their lives. Toksvig said she had attended the trial to find out why Nedim Yasar was murdered. Although there were rumours that the men had been sent to carry out the attack, she said there was still no definitive answer.

UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken,"Farming leaders have said it would be ""insane"" to sign a trade deal that allows the import of food that would be illegal to produce in the UK, such as chlorinated chicken. The National Farmers Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, said allowing these imports would be ""morally bankrupt"". The NFU called for rules on minimum standards for imports to be made law. Downing Street said food standards would be protected in any trade deal. At the NFU's annual conference on Tuesday, Ms Batters said: ""This isn't just about chlorinated chicken. This is about a wider principle. ""We must not tie the hands of British farmers to the highest rung of the standards ladder while waving through food imports which may not even reach the bottom rung."" She said: ""To sign up to a trade deal which results in opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt, it would be the work of the insane."" Ms Batters called for rules in the Agriculture Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, to ensure that food that would be illegal to produce here will not be imported. In countries such as the US, chicken is sometimes washed in chlorine or other chemicals to remove harmful bacteria. This practice was banned in the European Union in 1997 over food safety concerns. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The UK has long been a world leader in food safety and animal welfare and we will continue to uphold our high food safety standards in all future trade deals."" The EU will demand that the UK keeps its ban on chlorinated chicken as a requirement for a trade agreement with Brussels,the Guardian reported,external, citing documents it has seen. The move is to protect European meat exports, but it could prove to be a potential stumbling block in any deal with the US. Last month,US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saidthat the US wanted to agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK in 2020. New environment secretary George Eustice drew criticism on Sunday after refusing to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US under a new deal. But the EU believes that relying on chlorine at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards - such as dirty abattoirs. In 2020, the UK will be negotiating a trade deal with Brussels for when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. According to reports in the Guardian newspaper,external, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. Mr Eustice's predecessor,Theresa Villiers, had previously told the BBCthat the current European Union ban on chlorine-washed chicken would be carried over into UK legislation after Brexit.

Disney boss Bob Iger steps down as chief executive,"Bob Iger has led Disney since 2005 Disney boss Bob Iger, who led the media company through several blockbuster acquisitions and the launch of a streaming network, is stepping down as chief executive. Disney said it had appointed Bob Chapek, who previously ran the company's parks and products division, to replace him. Mr Iger will remain Disney's executive chairman until the end of next year to direct ""creative endeavours"". The move came as a surprise. Mr Iger, who is considered by many to be the most powerful man in Hollywood, had served as chief executive since 2005. He has previously announced plans to retire only to push back his departure date. In a statement,externalon Tuesday, Mr Iger said it was the ""optimal time"" to begin to hand control of the company to a new leader. Disney recentlycompleted the acquisitionof Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox entertainment empire and launched theDisney+streaming channel late last year. Earlier, Mr Iger presided over the firm's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. ""The company has gotten larger and more complex just in the recent 12 months,"" Mr Iger said on a conference call on Tuesday. ""I felt that with the asset bases in place and with our strategy deployed I should be spending as much time as possible on the creative side of our business."" Remaining as executive chairman would ease the transition, he added. Mr Chapek oversaw the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort Mr Chapek, who joined Disney in 1993, will be the firm's seventh chief executive since it was formed in the 1920s. In his prior role, among other achievements, he oversaw the opening of Disney's park in Shanghai. ""His tremendous understanding of the breadth and depth of the Company and appreciation for the special connection between Disney and its consumers makes him the perfect choice,"" said Disney board member Susan Arnold. Shares in the firm fell 2% in after-hours trading after the news was announced. Mr Iger, who recently published a memoir, is much beloved by investors for his record steering the company to steady profits, despite upheaval in the television and movie industries. Disney claimed seven of the top 10 box office hits globally last year and the new streaming channel has already attracted more than 28 million paying customers. The firm's market value has increased five-fold during his tenure, Ms Arnold said. The firm is now worth about $230bn.

"UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chickenFarmers say allowing food imports that would be illegal to produce in the UK would be ""morally bankrupt"".","Farming leaders have said it would be ""insane"" to sign a trade deal that allows the import of food that would be illegal to produce in the UK, such as chlorinated chicken. The National Farmers Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, said allowing these imports would be ""morally bankrupt"". The NFU called for rules on minimum standards for imports to be made law. Downing Street said food standards would be protected in any trade deal. At the NFU's annual conference on Tuesday, Ms Batters said: ""This isn't just about chlorinated chicken. This is about a wider principle. ""We must not tie the hands of British farmers to the highest rung of the standards ladder while waving through food imports which may not even reach the bottom rung."" She said: ""To sign up to a trade deal which results in opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt, it would be the work of the insane."" Ms Batters called for rules in the Agriculture Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, to ensure that food that would be illegal to produce here will not be imported. In countries such as the US, chicken is sometimes washed in chlorine or other chemicals to remove harmful bacteria. This practice was banned in the European Union in 1997 over food safety concerns. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The UK has long been a world leader in food safety and animal welfare and we will continue to uphold our high food safety standards in all future trade deals."" The EU will demand that the UK keeps its ban on chlorinated chicken as a requirement for a trade agreement with Brussels,the Guardian reported,external, citing documents it has seen. The move is to protect European meat exports, but it could prove to be a potential stumbling block in any deal with the US. Last month,US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saidthat the US wanted to agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK in 2020. New environment secretary George Eustice drew criticism on Sunday after refusing to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US under a new deal. But the EU believes that relying on chlorine at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards - such as dirty abattoirs. In 2020, the UK will be negotiating a trade deal with Brussels for when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. According to reports in the Guardian newspaper,external, the EU will demand that the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken as the price for a trade agreement with the bloc. Mr Eustice's predecessor,Theresa Villiers, had previously told the BBCthat the current European Union ban on chlorine-washed chicken would be carried over into UK legislation after Brexit.

'We all agree we'd never be able to buy a house',"Part ofLearn & revise Save to My Bitesize But do you know how much it would cost to live there? Does reality match up with the fantasy? According to the latestBBC Briefing, getting on the property ladder nowadays can be pretty difficult. We spoke to three young people about their dream accommodation vs where they can realistically live, and how they think the housing gap can be closed. This video can not be played The house of my dreams would be a penthouse, because Iâm not really that into houses. I like to be on the top floor of things so that I can see the cityscape, see the landscape. Iâm not very materialistic so it would just have the necessities. I think I would rent an apartment in the future with multiple people, rather than living by myself in a house because that just seems to be far too expensive. I spend most of my time in my room so I wouldnât need to have an upstairs and a downstairs. The topic of housing never comes up in conversations with my friends. We just all agree that weâd never be able to afford a house of our own, because the houses in London are very expensive. Even the house I live in now, Iâve lived in it since I was born, and the price of it has just gone up even though itâs kind of smallâ¦ so weâre very pessimistic when it comes to the topic of housing. Renting with people is easier than deciding whoâs paying how much of the mortgage, so I think renting is a better idea, especially long term because you can just break out whenever you need to. The house of my dreams would probably be a modern home, quite large, with a garage. In the future I think Iâll probably live in a larger home than I do now, probably one of the new ones. I do talk about housing with friends of mine, particularly friends of mine that are a wee bit older, and are closer to actually buying a home, or renting one permanently. I do see myself as buying a home at some point in the future but I think Iâm also hoping to rent a home. To change the housing situation in the UK, if I could look at it, I would build more homes but I do understand that it can stress the finances of the government. There are a lot of vacant homes in the UK, particularly in big cities such as London, Glasgow and Manchester, so I think by renting those homes out to people it could actually solve a lot of problems, or at least put a dent in it. The house of my dreams looks like a 3-4 bedroomed house, sustainable and in the countryside. Iâd also like to have a large kitchen-diner with an island in the middle, a big back garden and a garage. Me and my friends have grown up in the same area and we've recently seen a big increase in the prices of houses and the price of rent, so we're all quite concerned that in the future we wonât be able to afford to live in the area that we grew up in. I would love to buy a house first-time round. However, because of the costs, I feel like it will prove quite tricky because I would have to be paying rent but also saving up for a deposit to put onto a house. Iâd like to see more affordable houses so that people who are first-time buyers and young people are able to buy a house, and Iâd like to see more help and financial support for people to be able to get onto the property ladder, whether thatâs helping with tax or helping with deposits.

Ex-Para 'had central role in soldiers' murders',"The soldiers who died were, from left, Fusilier Dougald McCaughey, Fusilier John McCaig and Fusilier Joseph McCaig A former member of the Parachute Regiment was centrally involved in the killings of three off-duty soldiers almost 50 years ago, a BBC Spotlight investigation has established. The Scottish soldiers were John McCaig, 17; his brother, Joseph, 18, and Dougald McCaughey, 23. They were found shot dead in Ligoniel, north Belfast, on 10 March 1971. The Royal Highland Fusiliers had been drinking in a city centre pub when they were lured to their deaths by the IRA. The Spotlight investigation reveals that Paddy O'Kane, who had served seven years in the Parachute Regiment, shared a drink with the three Scots before taking them away to their deaths. Members of O'Kane's family and a former member of the IRA confirmed to Spotlight that O'Kane said he was involved in the killings. O'Kane, from north Belfast, joined the Parachute Regiment in 1957 and served in Cyprus and Jordan. A memorial stone marks the spot where the three soldiers were found on the outskirts of Belfast He was a member of the boxing team for 2 Para. When he left the Army in 1964, his duty was officially recorded as ""very good"". He is believed to have joined the Provisional IRA in 1969. Police identified him as a prime suspect almost immediately after the killings. The funeral for John and Joseph McCaig took place in Ayr He was seen drinking with the soldiers in a city centre pub by a work colleague. But O'Kane evaded arrest and went on the run in the Republic of Ireland where he remained very active in the IRA for at least another five years. Former IRA intelligence chief Kieran Conway knew O'Kane. He told Spotlight that O'Kane spoke openly about his role in the killings. Conway described the former Para as ""a psychopath"". ""I believe any man that could execute three young Scottish soldiers in that manner must have been a psychopath,"" he said. Separately, multiple sources confirmed to Spotlight that Paddy O'Kane was also a lead suspect for the Kingsmills massacre of January 1976, when 10 Protestant workmen were ordered off a minibus and shot dead by the IRA. O'Kane was listed as wanted for questioning about the Kingsmills killings for many years afterwards. He wasfirst refused an ""On-the-Run"" (OTR) letter in 2003,but in 2007 an OTR letter was approved, giving him confirmation that he was not wanted by any police force in the UK. O'Kane died two years later, in Shannon, County Clare, where he had lived since 1976. Paddy O'Kane was also wanted for questioning about the Kingsmills killings The bodies of the soldiers were discovered by a teenage girl. Three years ago, Brenda Kielty made her only recorded interview about that evening. ""They were just shot and dumped on top of each other. I didn't know whether it was three Protestants or three Catholics, but I never dreamt it was three soldiers,"" she said. ""There was nothing to indicate that it was three soldiers."" Ms Kielty, who died shortly after the interview, was then 14 years old, a little younger than the youngest of the victims, John McCaig. ""The wee boy had loads of freckles on his face. I actually put my hand on the wee boy's face and he was warm. He definitely wasn't cold like, he was warm,"" she said. The Spotlight investigation retraces the soldiers' last day. It scrutinises a longstanding rumour that women were used to lure the soldiers to their death in what was known as a ""honey trap"". It identifies three other men whom the police also suspected of involvement in the killings. One of those men told Spotlight that he ""vehemently denies any involvement"". As more emerges about the killings, there have been calls for a fresh inquest and a new investigation but police said that the clearest evidence has always been against O'Kane, who is now dead. Spotlight, The Killings of the Three Scottish Soldiers, is on Tuesday at 22:35 GMT on BBC 1 Northern Ireland.

CCTV captures Arena bomber seconds before blast,"Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena just seconds before he blew himself up Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi seconds before he blew himself up has been shown to jurors. The CCTV pictures showed him standing amid crowds of men, women and children 19 seconds before the fatal blast on 22 May 2017. Hashem Abedi, 22, is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of helping his brother plan the attack at the end of the Ariana Grande concert. He denies 22 murders, attempted murder, and conspiring to cause explosions. Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device packed with shrapnel as 359 people milled around the arena foyer at 22:31 BST - one minute after the concert ended. The suicide attack left 22 people dead and hundreds more injured, the jury was told. In the footage, the bomber was seen wearing a large Karrimor rucksack containing the device. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying his rucksack The court heard his body was recovered in four parts and was riddled with nuts, wire and metal parts after the blast.  He was identified by his DNA and fingerprints taken in 2012 when he was arrested for shoplifting. Forensic investigators later found more than 2,000 nuts at the scene. The Old Bailey heard all living casualties were moved out by 23:30 BST and 19 people were confirmed dead at the scene. The father of 15-year-old victim Megan Hurley remained with her body until after 01:00 BST, the court heard.

Donna Currie, 51, who was waiting in the foyer for her daughter and her friend, suffered multiple fractures to both legs and shrapnel wounds. She had previously sustained shrapnel injuries in the 1996 IRA bombing in Manchester and experienced extensive psychological trauma. The court heard that a 50-year-old woman, who suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, had also been caught up in the 1993 IRA bombings in Warrington. She had been waiting with a friend to collect their daughters when she was hurt at the arena. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria just over an hour before he detonated his bomb The court previously heard that Salman Abedi, 22, went to the arena days before the attack and watched music fans arrive for a Take That gig. He was seen looking at box office queues, a few yards from the spot where he detonated the bomb. The Old Bailey heard that on the day of the blast, he had arranged to send Â£460 to Libya. Later, he went out with his rucksack and took a Metrolink tram to Victoria Station in Manchester. While waiting for the tram, he made a call lasting just over four minutes to his family in Libya, the court heard. He then waited in the area of the arena for two hours before detonating his device. Jurors have heard that Hashem Abedi insists he is not an extremist and had no idea of his older brother's plans. He said he was in Libya with his family at the time of the attack. The trial continues. Salman Abedi gets in a lift to take him to the Arena foyer CCTV captures bomber at Arena days before attack Arena attacker 'encouraged teen to build a bomb' Arena attack brother insulted man after crash Arena attack brother's garden 'full of metal tins' Arena bomb parts 'bought by pair using mum's card' Arena attack sibling 'shocked' at murderous plot Arena attack brother used 'slaughter' email name Arena attack brother 'foiled in bid to buy acid' Arena attack brother 'equally guilty of murders' HM Courts & Tribunals Service LIVE: Power cut hits Manchester city centre Full list of ambulance A&E handover delays at Greater Manchester hospital trusts Council to draw down Â£17.6m exceptional financial support to balance books Bolton weather forecast: Cold and clear skies this weekend Bury weather forecast: Cold and dry weekend ahead Places where you can go to keep warm as temperatures plummet Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

MSPs set to back plans for free period productsLabour MSP Monica Lennon's bill now has the support of all parties following a government U-turn.Scotland politics,"MSPs have backed the principle of tackling period poverty by making sanitary products available to all free of charge. All parties backed a bill put forward by Labour's Monica Lennon in its first test in the Holyrood chamber. However some warned there was a ""huge amount of work to do"" to amend the bill to make it deliverable and affordable. Ministers had originally opposed the plans but changed their position after coming under pressure from campaigners. The government is expected to put forward a raft of amendments to address their ""significant"" concerns about the legislation, including the estimated Â£24m annual cost of implementing it. Look back on the debate with Holyrood Live Ministers to back Scots period poverty legislation Guides call for rethink on period poverty law UK girls 'too poor to afford tampons' ThePeriod Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill,externalwould create a legal duty on the Scottish government to ensure that period products are available free of charge ""for anyone who needs them"". Ms Lennon said she was ""thrilled"" to have support ""from right across civic Scotland, from girl guides, trade unions, anti-poverty charities and many individuals who have had their own lived experience of period poverty and know what it is like not to have access to products when they need them"". She told MSPs that ""access to period products should be a right and available to all"", and pledged to work with other parties to make sure the proposals are deliverable. The legislation has been brought forward by Labour MSP Monica Lennon Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the proposed costs of the scheme had been dramatically underestimated, saying it would take ""a whole lot of hard work and endeavour to make sure we can get something that is fit for purpose"". She added: ""Parliament will now need to pull out all the stops and work hard collectively and collaboratively."" This was echoed by Tory MSP Graham Simpson, who said there was a ""huge amount of work to do"" to knock the bill into shape. At present tampons, pads and some reusable products are funded in schools, colleges and universities. The Scottish government provided Â£5.2m funding to support this. Another Â£4m was made available to councils so the roll-out could be expanded to other other public places, and another Â£50,000 for free provision in sports clubs. (Left to right) Caitlin, Xena and Amy are pupils at St Paul's High School in Glasgow. At St Paul's High School in Glasgow, there is a scheme where older pupils have been trained to talk to girls in S1 about periods and period poverty. ""Period poverty means that girls can't afford to buy period products,"" one pupil, Caitlin, told BBC Scotland. With average periods lasting about five days, it can cost up to Â£8 a month for tampons and pads. Xena said the expense meant some girls have to use items like tissues or socks instead. ""This means that some girls are feart to come to school and don't want to leave the house at all,"" said another pupil, Amy. Likeall schools in Scotland, free period products have been available in the toilets at St Paul's High School since the 2018/19 academic year. The move came after a survey ofmore than 2,000 people by Young Scot,externalfound that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access period products. Meanwhile about 12% of respondents toresearch by Plan International,externalsaid they have had to ""improvise sanitary wear"". ""It's a right that every woman should have that they should be able to access free sanitary products,"" Amy said. ""It's not like it is a luxury item or anything. We need them.""

Tenerife hotel locked down over coronavirus,"This video can not be played Guest John Turton: ""The doors are locked and there's a police cordon"" A hotel in Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands has been locked down after a visiting Italian doctor tested positive for coronavirus. Hundreds of guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel were told to stay in their rooms as medical tests were carried out. The doctor is reportedly from the virus-hit Lombardy region. His wife has also now tested positive, sources say. Global cases of the virus have passed 80,000, the vast majority in China. Iran, one of the worst-affected nations outside China, on Tuesday said its deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, had tested positive for the virus. Latest from the global battle against the virus What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? Top Iran health official gets virus as fears grow The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic - a situation where an infectious disease spreads easily between people in many countries. This video can not be played Iran's deputy health minister mopped his brow at a news conference before testing positive for the disease The proportion of infected people who die appears to be between 1% and 2%, although the WHO cautions that the precise mortality rate is not known yet. Spanish media reports say that police are guarding the four-star hotel in the south-west of the island and making sure no one enters or leaves. But authorities are avoiding describing the situation as an enforced quarantine. Health authority spokeswoman Veronica Martin earlier said that guests were being monitored for ""health reasons"", adding that ""the degree of supervision will be assessed during the day, but so far, we're not talking about quarantine"". One guest posted on Facebook an image of a note put under the door of their room on Tuesday saying: ""We regret to inform you that for health reasons, the hotel has been closed down. Until the sanitary authorities warn, you must remain in your rooms."" Another guest, John Turton, told the BBC he and his wife had seen the note but then heard people walking outside and heading to breakfast. He said: ""The hotel has been cordoned off but we're trying to make the best of what's going on. We haven't been given any more information other than the note but we're going to just wait, try and enjoy the holiday and see what happens."" How close are we to a pandemic? A visual guide to the outbreak Tell us how you've been affected by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external People had been walking around the hotel and using sun loungers, he said, but the police cordon was preventing people from leaving. Mr Turton said he had not yet been tested. Masked hotel staff prepare water bottles for guests Fellow Briton Nigel Scotland said he was most concerned that the man who had tested positive had been staying in the hotel for six days, and ""during that time, probably five or six hundred people must have left the hotel and gone back to various places in Europe"". The Italian doctor, who had been staying at the hotel with his wife, tested positive on Monday and has been placed in isolation at the University Hospital Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Candelaria. He will undergo a second test to confirm the virus. His wife was taken to the same hospital where she also tested positive in the first analysis, Spain's Diario de Avisos reports. Quarantine raises virus fears in northern Italy Britons returning from northern Italy told to self-isolate Meanwhile, a 36-year-old Italian woman has been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Barcelona.

Top Iran health official gets virus as fears grow,"This video can not be played Iraj Harirchi was sweating profusely at a news conference before testing positive for coronavirus disease Iran's deputy health minister and an MP have both tested positive for the new coronavirus, as it struggles to contain an outbreak that has killed 15. The country is one of three hot-spots outside China causing concern that the virus could be becoming a pandemic. The deputy minister, Iraj Harirchi, on Monday denied covering up the scale of the outbreak. He appeared in physical discomfort as he spoke to reporters. Iran has reported 95 cases, but the actual number is thought to be higher. The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the sudden increase in cases in countries outside China is ""deeply concerning"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Washington was concerned that Iran may have concealed ""vital details"" about its outbreak and urged all nations to ""tell the truth about the coronavirus"". All Tuesday's coronavirus developments What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? More people have died in Iran from the virus than anywhere else outside China. The two countries have strong trading links. The other countries currently in the spotlight are South Korea and Italy, where cases have surged in recent days. Iran's president has urged people to comply with the health ministry's directives More than 80,000 cases of the Covid-19 respiratory disease have been reported worldwide since it emerged late last year. About 2,700 patients have died - the vast majority in China. But the situation in Iran - home to holy sites that attract millions every year and in a region where several countries have weak health systems - has caused great concern about a potential mass outbreak in the Middle East. New coronavirus advice for Britons back from Italy Mission Impossible halts filming over health fears Italian sport disrupted by coronavirus Of the current hot-spots outside China, Iran is the most concerning because of the lack of an accurate picture of how widespread the outbreak really is, said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an expert in infectious diseases at King's College London. Most of the reported cases have been people who are elderly and dying, she said. ""It seems like we're hearing about the tip of the iceberg and missing that chunk underneath who may be younger and may not be particularly unwell."" A hotel in Tenerife, in Spain's Canary Islands, is in lockdownafter a doctor from Italy visiting the hotel tested positive for the virus Italy - Europe's worst-affected country - confirmed the deaths of four more elderly people, bringing the total number of fatalities there to 11 The virus has spread to the regions of Tuscany, Sicily and Liguria but Italy's PM said his country remained safe for tourism Several countries - Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Algeria - reported their first cases, all involving people who had been to Italy While Italy's European neighbours have agreed to keep borders open, some are screening arriving travellers US health authorities warned Americans to brace for the coronavirus to spreadand potentially cause severe disruption This video can not be played Mark Lowen was on the ground at the edge of Italy's coronavirus lockdown area By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian The reports that we are receiving from cities around Iran suggest that the number of cases is actually much higher than the Iranian authorities are giving. Unlike in Italy, Iranian officials are refusing to impose quarantines in areas affected by the outbreak. They say quarantines are old-fashioned and that they do not believe in them. The Shia shrines in the cities of Qom and Mashhad are still open, despite Qom being a hotbed of the virus. There are grand ayatollahs in Qom who believe that its shrine, which attracts millions of pilgrims from around the world, and its important seminary, which hosts many foreign religious students, are the pride of the Shia world. Teams are disinfecting public spaces in Qom, including the shrine of Hazrat Masumeh Shutting them down would be a huge step for the clerics and not one that they would be likely to take unless they come under international pressure. We can see the clear conflict between religious conservatism and science. Iran also lacks the medical equipment it needs to help contain the outbreak. It has run out of masks and does not have enough testing kits. A number of medical workers have also been infected, so there is a worry that they will soon run out of doctors and nurses to attend to those with the disease. The majority of Iranians are extremely worried. ""I had a fever as of last night and my preliminary test was positive around midnight,"" Mr Harirchi said in a video released on Tuesday. ""I've isolated myself in a place since... and now I am starting medication. ""We will definitely be victorious against this virus in the next few weeks,"" the minister added. Mr Harirchi's positive test for Covid-19 was announced a day after he took part in a news conference, where he coughed occasionally and appeared to sweat heavily. During the briefing, the minister denied a claim by a member of parliament for Qom - the centre of the outbreak - that the authorities were engaged in a cover-up. Ahmad Amirabadi-Farahani alleged that Covid-19 had arrived in Qom three weeks ago and that 50 people had died in the city alone. The death toll was rejected by Mr Harirchi, who vowed to resign if it could be proven that even half that number had died. Mr Amirabadi-Farahani subsequently refused to retract his claim, saying he had sent a list of 40 people who had died to the minister and awaited his resignation. How close are we to a pandemic?

The secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran Ali Shamkhani, said on Tuesday that he had asked the prosecutor-general to ""check the validity"" of the MP's allegation. Meanwhile, an MP from the Iranian capital Tehran, Mahmoud Sadeghi, said he had also tested positive for the virus Iran is believed to have been the source of the first cases reported by neighbouring Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, which have now imposed restrictions on travel to and from the Islamic Republic. However there are fears that the many Muslim Shia pilgrims and migrant workers who will have travelled between Iran and other parts of the region in recent weeks could have already spread the virus. In countries like war-ravaged Afghanistan - which has so far reported just one case - health authorities will struggle to trace and test contacts of infected people, experts say. Precautions are being taken in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf The WHO is sending medical supplies and additional testing kits to Iran and is also planning to send a technical team to the country. The United Arab Emirates - a major international transit hub, and home to the airline Emirates - has suspended all passenger and cargo flights to Iran for a week ""as a precautionary measure"". The UAE has reported 13 cases, including an Iranian couple. Bahrain's health ministry meanwhile raised its number of confirmed cases to 17. It said all of those infected had travelled from Iran via the UAE.

But in the 11 closed-off towns, in which more than 50,000 people are quarantined, fear is setting in. Andrea Alloni, a resident in Codogno, says while some are convincing themselves that the outbreak will blow over, others are so worried that they're using sleeping pills. Police have been stopping cars trying to get into Codogno Emergency medical phone-lines are saturated. The elderly are feeling particularly vulnerable. And while a handful of shops are open inside the town, the streets are quiet. Most are staying at home - or if they venture outside, they do so in face masks. Coronavirus: What you need to know New coronavirus advice for Britons back from Italy Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Coronavirus: Your rights as a traveller Italy is struggling to understand how it went from six coronavirus cases to more than 200 since last Friday, becoming Europe's worst-affected country and the third worst hit in the world after China and South Korea. So far, seven people have died. ""Patient zero"" - the individual first infected - has still not been identified. It was initially believed to be a 38-year-old man who visited a hospital in Codogno where a woman later died from the virus and whose colleague had been in China in January. But when his colleague tested negative, the search for the original infector continued. Finding the source of the outbreak would help authorities understand the spread and potentially stem it. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has defended his government's response, insisting that the high number here is because Italy is testing more people than other European countries. There is a hope that the outbreak has stabilised, with new cases slowing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With the unprecedented containment measures widening, the economic impact could be severe. Public spaces have been cordoned off, schools, universities and museums are closed, key events like the Venice Carnival and Milan fashion week have been curbed, even filming of the new Mission Impossible in Venice has been suspended. Passengers at the main station in Lombardy's capital, Milan, are now wearing face masks because of the rapid spread of the virus Lombardy and Veneto - the two most affected regions - make up 30% of the Italian economy. Italy's growth is already estimated at just 0.1% for 2019 - the lowest in the eurozone. The talk now is that the impact of the virus could tip it into recession. Neighbouring Croatia and Greece have cancelled all school visits to Italy. Kuwait has stopped flights here. Italy itself was the first European country to halt flights to and from China when the outbreak began: a risk for an economy that depends on some five million Chinese tourists a year. In an era of social media, rumours and scaremongering fly fast. It's too early to talk of panic here. But some supermarkets are seeing empty shelves, as families stock up. Bars and restaurants are closing this week - the old town of Piacenza was eerily quiet for a weekday evening. The far-right opposition is harnessing the situation to push its call for closed borders. ""We're confident our public health system can face this if it's a few hundred cases,"" says Andrea Alloni by phone from Codogno. ""But if the number spikes, it won't be able to cope.

"CCTV captures Arena bomber seconds before blastSalman Abedi's brother Hashem denies murder, attempted murder and conspiring to cause explosions.Manchester","Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena just seconds before he blew himself up Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi seconds before he blew himself up has been shown to jurors. The CCTV pictures showed him standing amid crowds of men, women and children 19 seconds before the fatal blast on 22 May 2017. Hashem Abedi, 22, is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of helping his brother plan the attack at the end of the Ariana Grande concert. He denies 22 murders, attempted murder, and conspiring to cause explosions. Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device packed with shrapnel as 359 people milled around the arena foyer at 22:31 BST - one minute after the concert ended. The suicide attack left 22 people dead and hundreds more injured, the jury was told. In the footage, the bomber was seen wearing a large Karrimor rucksack containing the device. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying his rucksack The court heard his body was recovered in four parts and was riddled with nuts, wire and metal parts after the blast.  He was identified by his DNA and fingerprints taken in 2012 when he was arrested for shoplifting. Forensic investigators later found more than 2,000 nuts at the scene. The Old Bailey heard all living casualties were moved out by 23:30 BST and 19 people were confirmed dead at the scene. The father of 15-year-old victim Megan Hurley remained with her body until after 01:00 BST, the court heard.

Donna Currie, 51, who was waiting in the foyer for her daughter and her friend, suffered multiple fractures to both legs and shrapnel wounds. She had previously sustained shrapnel injuries in the 1996 IRA bombing in Manchester and experienced extensive psychological trauma. The court heard that a 50-year-old woman, who suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, had also been caught up in the 1993 IRA bombings in Warrington. She had been waiting with a friend to collect their daughters when she was hurt at the arena. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria just over an hour before he detonated his bomb The court previously heard that Salman Abedi, 22, went to the arena days before the attack and watched music fans arrive for a Take That gig. He was seen looking at box office queues, a few yards from the spot where he detonated the bomb. The Old Bailey heard that on the day of the blast, he had arranged to send Â£460 to Libya. Later, he went out with his rucksack and took a Metrolink tram to Victoria Station in Manchester. While waiting for the tram, he made a call lasting just over four minutes to his family in Libya, the court heard. He then waited in the area of the arena for two hours before detonating his device. Jurors have heard that Hashem Abedi insists he is not an extremist and had no idea of his older brother's plans. He said he was in Libya with his family at the time of the attack. The trial continues.

What's it really like living up high?," By Tom de Castella Raspberry-coloured walls, chocolate brown carpet, the murmur of a radio. A few paces into Jane Hall's flat you spy a drinks cabinet housing treasures from holidays past - melon liqueur, Grand Marnier and Shamrock Irish County Cream. Then coming into the lounge you are overwhelmed by sky. She lives on the 14th floor of Austin House, a tower block in Walsall and her lounge is a window on the world. Or the West Midlands at any rate. Hall, currently getting around on crutches after a hip operation, feels very much at home. “I love living on the 14th floor,” she says, standing on the balcony, pointing out local landmarks. “Over there you've got Sutton, Cannock and Lichfield. I'm originally a Birmingham girl and people say Walsall is urban but when you look out there's so much trees, foliage and green.” Jane Hall on the balcony of her 14th floor flat Jane Hall on the balcony of her 14th floor flat She lives here with her ex-partner Dave and their dog Todd Bentley, named after a Canadian evangelist who, as she puts it with a wry smile, “fell from grace”. She works four days a week at Asda and today has her young grandson Lewis with her. He's allowed on the balcony but only with an adult. High-rise living has its own rituals and quirks. She has an app telling her when the lights of the International Space Station are passing overhead. She watches out for the giant Emirates A380s orbiting Birmingham International Airport. And she knows when West Brom are at home from the glow of the floodlights. Up here there are no spiders, plenty of ladybirds (they live in the cladding) and she gets to watch regular firework displays. “Every season your view will change. You go from the trees being lush, to brown to shedding,” she says. “Winter is amazing as you can see so much more. Every time I look out I see something different.”  Until 2015 she lived in a three-bedroom house. But she and her partner didn't need all that space and a month after deciding to give it up she was offered this flat in an over-55s block. Hall has never seen high-rise as strange. Her parents were moved out of the Birmingham slums in Ladywood and she grew up in a new town near the airport. It was a seven-storey block and her family lived on the sixth floor. There was a sense of freedom, she recalls. “There were play areas and we were next to a park so it was ideal. It was the early 1960s, it was a brand new block so you'd got new radiators, flooring, everything was completely different from the back-to-backs in Ladywood.” Some of the data in this article is drawn fromBBC Briefing, a mini-series of downloadable in-depth guides to the big issues in the news, with input from academics, researchers and journalists. It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. In the beginning there was no stigma associated with living in a social housing block. Not like now, Hall laughs. She imitates the sound of someone sounding nervous when she tells them she lives in high-rise. What floor, they ask her. “I say 14 and they go, 'Oh, I couldn't live in a high-rise.’” She explains how they need to change their perception, how tower blocks like hers are clean, safe and the lifts don't smell.

Tower blocks in Sheffield, 1972 Tower blocks in Sheffield, 1972 That people would choose to live in a concrete tower block might strike some as bizarre. And yet at their inception they were hailed as an escape from the slum housing of post-war Britain. The first residential tower block was finished in 1951 as part of Harlow New Town in Essex. It was only 10 storeys high, but it was a radical departure from what had gone before. It was awarded a Ministry of Health Housing medal. Living high was synonymous with fresh air, light and modern appliances. The Lawn in Harlow, Essex - the UK's first residential tower block The Lawn in Harlow, Essex - the UK's first residential tower block The architecture profession, politicians - of all stripes - and much of the media were mostly in favour. Building tall was the future. High rise was an economical way of tackling the terrible legacy of slum housing in the UK. “We are going to win this battle,” declared the Conservative housing minister Henry Brooke in 1957. “I am determined to get all slums down.” Construction at Moss Heights in Glasgow, 1953 Construction at Moss Heights in Glasgow, 1953 British architects in the 1950s looked not to the US but to the French architect Le Corbusier, who favoured raw concrete - in French, “beton brut”, hence the architectural term Brutalist. It would divide people into camps - architects often hailed these new forms as strikingly modern, but more traditionally minded citizens tended to see them as bleak and impersonal. David Kynaston's social history, Modernity Britain: Opening The Box 1957-1959, captures the range of views towards high rise at the time. In 1957, the local government correspondent of the Manchester Guardian wrote: “There are, of course, social objections to compelling families with young children to live in high flats, and economic objections to a form of housing that costs over twice as much, in labour and materials, both to build and to maintain, as the two-storey dwelling which the vast majority of tenants prefer.” However, many occupants were wowed by the modern facilities. Joan Dutton, who moved into a 10-storey block in Liverpool, told her local paper: “It takes some getting used to at first but once you've convinced yourself you are not dreaming, it is like being on a permanent holiday. The central heating scheme is marvellous. We really wanted a house, but until we came here we didn't know how comfortable a flat could be.” 1953: Inside a high rise flat on the Ackroydon estate, south London 1953: Inside a high rise flat on the Ackroydon estate, south London Until the late 1950s, there had been a policy of dispersal - moving people out of the inner city slums to towns like Swindon and Watford. But as the 1960s approached the new urbanism proposed keeping people in the city and building at heights of 20 storeys or more. In April 1958 the foundation stone for the Park Hill estate in Sheffield was laid. Built on a hill overlooking the city centre, it was the first “streets in the sky” development in Britain, a vast series of blocks housing more than 2,000 people.  “Out of ugliness we are to create something of beauty and utility,” the lord mayor declared. By the 1960s Britain was in the grip of a high-rise boom. The baton of tallest residential building passed from one new building to the next. By 1975 a total of 440,000 high-rise flats for public housing had been created in the UK. It was fuelled by a government subsidy that increased with every extra storey. One of the structures built to this formula was the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in West London, which was completed in 1974. But worries were creeping in. In 1968, while surveying high-rise tenants in Glasgow, the social researcher Pearl Jephcott flagged up concerns. “Practically no one disputes that this form of home [the high-rise] is unsatisfactory for the family with small children,"" she wrote. And in the same year, a gas explosion caused Ronan Point, a new block in East London, to partially collapse, killing four people. The accident was caused by faulty construction, but even well-built towers had an Achilles heel - maintenance. It cost far more to put scaffolding up on a 20-storey block than a terraced house, but not enough money was generally put aside for the purpose. When Margaret Thatcher's government came to power in 1979 the direction of travel in housing changed. Instead of building social housing, councils were told to sell their homes. An explosion caused Ronan Point to partially collapse in 1968 An explosion caused Ronan Point to partially collapse in 1968 Increasingly, high-rise became associated with crime and a lack of community - from ""streets in the sky"" to ""slums in the sky"". Tower blocks gained an image problem that never completely went away. High-rise became a convenient metaphor for society’s ills. In 1971, Stanley Kubrick's film Clockwork Orange was released, a vision of bleak, savage urban dystopia played out against the backdrop of the Thamesmead estate in south-east London. Above: A block of flats being demolished on Hackney's Nightingale Estate, 2000 With the notable exception of the Barbican in central London, high-rise was not seen for many years as somewhere for the middle classes. It was mass housing for the poor. Ever-rising house prices brought about a change of attitude in the 21st Century. There was also a growing appreciation for concrete towers, especially if they were built by signature architects such as Erno Goldfinger. His Trellick Tower in west London was Grade-II-listed in 1998 and a significant number of the flats are now privately owned. Balfron Tower, east London Balfron Tower, east London More revealing still is what is happening at The Trellick’s “sister”, the Balfron Tower in Poplar, east London. Housing association tenants have been “decanted” out to lower-rise homes in the area, and the block is in the hands of a private developer, nearing the end of a multi-million pound refurbishment. The flats, with their breathtaking views of central London, will soon be occupied by bankers, lawyers and other well-to-do professionals with a penchant for gritty urban design and three quarters of a million pounds or so to spare. But for social housing tenants and private owners alike, a shadow was cast over high-rise living by the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in west London, which killed 72 people. Its impact is still being felt, both emotionally and financially. Dani Leitch and Mark Hughson outside their home in Manchester Dani Leitch and Mark Hughson outside their home in Manchester “You should get a rope.” Dani Leitch and Mark Hughson are remembering what a friend told them recently. It was meant “half jokingly” but the more they thought about it the more it made sense. The couple live on the ninth floor of a Manchester block that post-Grenfell has been found to be a fire risk. If the building was to go up in flames and the fire were to spread to the stairs, they would have no way out. Hence, their contemplation of extreme measures. The rope needn't be long, they say. They would tie it to the balcony and climb down one floor at a time, untying and retying as they go. It's dusk and I'm looking at rain-lashed Manchester from their balcony. Down below, tiny figures hurry past the stationary tail-lights on a dual carriageway. To our left, illuminated trams fly over Victorian mills and ahead, in the distance, looms the outrageous overhang of the Beetham Tower. The scene resembles a Lowry painting crossed with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. It was the view that convinced Hughson to buy the flat in 2015. A couple of years later he started going out with Leitch - they worked at the same pensions firm but in offices hundreds of miles apart. Soon she moved up from Surrey and into her partner's flat. All seemed well at first. The fire at Grenfell Tower had happened before she moved in. But it was only later that the implications began to hit home, that a similar fire could happen in hundreds of flats across Britain, including their own. They live in City Gate 2, one of three City Gate blocks in the Castlefield district of Manchester. The buildings have been found to have combustible cladding, and a lack of cavity barriers which would prevent fire spreading. The buildings' steel frameworks also appear to lack fire protection. The buildings’ managing agents, whose surveyors identified these problems, say that the apartment blocks could not have complied with the Building Regulations at the time of construction – the developer, Bellway, denies this. Until recently there was a waking watch - people on patrol wearing hi-vis jackets - costing £3,200 a week across the three buildings. It ended at Christmas after the installation of smoke alarms to vulnerable areas. There are fire detectors in the communal areas but they do not sound to residents. In fact there is no common fire alarm in the building, only smoke alarms in people's flats. And there are no sprinklers. The lack of a sounding fire alarm is not illegal, indeed many apartment blocks operate this system, but it may surprise people. Indeed Hughson and Leitch were under the impression there was a central alarm they would hear if a fire started. However it is the lack of any way out other than one flight of stairs that most worries them. “It scares the living hell out of me,” Leitch says. “If there was a fire on the eighth floor we've got to make our way down.” Hughson adds that in the event of a fire the official advice is to “close all your doors and stay put”. “Which I don't want to do,” Leitch interrupts. “I want to get out. Sorry, I'm not going to wait for a fire engine to come. If there's a fire, I'm getting out.”  (This is where the rope idea came in). At Grenfell the London Fire Brigade told residents to stay in their flats rather than try to escape. As Sir Martin Moore-Bick wrote in the report of the inquiry's first phase: “The evidence taken as a whole strongly suggests that the 'stay put' concept had become an article of faith within the LFB so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable.” His report concluded that “more lives could have been saved” if the “stay put” advice had been jettisoned earlier. Fear of a fire is not the couple’s only anxiety. Like many leaseholders in high-rises, they face the question, who is going to pay to make the buildings safe? The City Gate development, Manchester The City Gate development, Manchester City Gate was developed by Bellway, the UK's fourth biggest housebuilder - a FTSE 250 company. One might assume that this company would be liable for any outstanding issues. But one would be wrong. The law states that developers are no longer liable six or 10 years (depending on legal complexities) after a building is completed. “Buildings stay up in places for hundreds of years. You can't have a warranty that lasts 10 years,” Hughson says. “It's not a valid reason, it's like a get-out-of-jail-free card.” While he and his partner hold Bellway responsible, they think the government should be doing more to help them. Theresa May's government last year announced it would compensate private high-rise buildings where the cladding is aluminium composite material (ACM), as Grenfell's was. However, like hundreds of blocks around the UK, most of the City Gate cladding is non-ACM, made up of timber and other materials. In short, government money won't help the residents. To fix the cladding and cavities will cost an estimated £8.2m. If the steelwork has to be redone as well, the final sum could be much higher. The managing agent for the building is a firm called Rendall & Rittner. Like companies across the country, it is passing the costs of the building work and interim safety measures to leaseholders like Leitch and Hughson through their service charge. Currently £120 a month, it is expected to rise to £550 a month. Then, as the more expensive work comes on track, it will go up more steeply. “It's about 28 grand a flat over two years,” Hughson says. His parents - who helped him buy the property - have taken over the lease. He and Leitch pay the service charge, but they can't afford it any longer. They have no choice but to find somewhere else to live. In effect they are being forced out of their home. Bellway told the BBC: “The City Gate buildings were built between 2003 and 2005 and passed all required building regulation checks at the time of completion. Recently, the managing agent has made us aware of some potential issues regarding the site. Bellway takes these issues very seriously and so, at its own cost, has committed to instruct an independent expert to review the situation.” Manchester City Council is also under the spotlight for giving the building the all clear. “The Council issued a building regulations completion certificate based on the appropriate national government guidance from the time of completion,” a spokesperson says. “However, this is not conclusive evidence of on-going compliance and is not an approval of the quality of work carried out.” The statement continues: “It was, and remains, the responsibility of the person carrying out the work to comply with building regulations, and it is a matter for the contractor or designers to ensure materials were used and properly installed - and any defects should be rectified by them.” A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner said: “All of the cladding installed at City Gate is being replaced, some of which is ACM cladding. Due to the age of the building, the 10-year warranty has expired and the buildings insurance does not cover these defects.” The Halo Tower, Stratford, east London The Halo Tower, Stratford, east London  For the purposes of this article, one resident at the 43-storey Halo Tower in Stratford, east London, who lives on the 41st floor, volunteered to measure the time it takes to descend by stairs at normal pace. Answer: nine minutes, 45 seconds. It’s a reminder that the lift is crucial to the smooth functioning of high-rise. Those towers that are popular with residents tend to have lifts that work. No-one would live in a tall building if it took several minutes to climb up or down. In fact, the history of high-rise probably begins with the invention of the lift. In 1842 Elisha Otis invented a safe elevator that would not plummet to the ground if the hoisting cable broke. It was this easy vertical transport from one floor to another that allowed the first skyscrapers to be built in Chicago and New York. Elisha Otis demonstrates his new elevator in New York, 1853 Elisha Otis demonstrates his new elevator in New York, 1853 After the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, there was widespread anxiety about tall buildings. For a time architects and planners hesitated. Were tall buildings too vulnerable to terror attacks? But as time went on, the panic dissipated. 9/11 was unique. Normal service was resumed. A new term “super-tall skyscraper” had to be introduced for the growing number of buildings over 300m tall. There are now 21 buildings around the world more than 450m tall. Indeed, if the World Trade Center towers were still standing, they would be just 28th and 29th highest in the world. If 9/11 failed to change the skyward direction of US buildings, it seems unlikely Grenfell will stop the growth of residential high-rise in the UK. In 2020 the new towers tend to be private, made out of glass and steel rather than concrete and are called apartment buildings, not tower blocks. Research from New London Architecture (NLA) last year suggested that there are 541 towers of more than 20 storeys planned or under construction in the capital, which, if built, will provide more than 110,000 new homes by 2030. Peter Murray of NLA  said at the time that the London skyline for the next 20 years will be “pockets of taller buildings located in those boroughs that are willing to accept them. These buildings are not super-tall, they are generally between 20 and 30 storeys.” Even if some of these projects fall by the wayside it shows the dramatic shift upwards of UK housing. Horror over Grenfell remains but if these new homes are well-built, using high-quality materials in accordance with tighter safety legislation, many would argue there's no problem. “We are facing a dire shortage of affordable housing in this country and high rises remain an important part of the solution,” says Victoria Moffett of the National Housing Federation, which represents social housing providers. Meanwhile, house builders want to continue their skyward march. “As we look to build more desperately needed homes, land availability, especially in urban areas, dictates that high-rise living will play a significant part in how we build in the future,” says a spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation. The HBF says that the number of flats being built as a proportion of the overall number of homes has dropped in recent years. Overall that may be so. But in big cities with high demand, like London and Manchester, the number of cranes on the horizon points to a different future.

But in big cities with high demand, like London and Manchester, the number of cranes on the horizon points to a different future. Emporis, a data firm specialising in property, defines high-rise as anything between 35m and 100m. And it is in this area that a large number of buildings in particular hubs such as London and Manchester are emerging. Grenfell may lead to tighter regulation. Since the fire the government has termed anything over 18m as high-rise. New legislation on sprinklers and cladding is expected. But for Leitch and Hughson it feels like a grim future. Living at height has meant abandoning control of their environment to forces beyond their control. Hughson, who loved the buzz of the city, will be giving that up for somewhere lower-rise, ideally with a garden.  He thinks it's unjust that housebuilders can ignore the mistakes they made in the past and be allowed to build ever higher. “I just think it's immoral,” he says. He notes that Bellway were one of the major beneficiaries of the government's Help To Buy scheme. Leitch believes a maximum storey height should be put in place. Her mental health has suffered and she can't wait to move out. “It's stressful. I've actually gone to the doctors about it.” Back in Walsall, Jane Hall is in a different position. She's a social housing tenant. Social housing providers such as councils and housing associations have responded more quickly to the job of replacing flammable cladding. It's true that some social housing tenants like those on part of Tottenham's Broadwater Farm estate, are being moved out as their homes have been found to be structurally flawed. But Hall says she is lucky. The cladding on Austin House, owned by WHG, a housing association, has been checked and found to be safe. She recalls a fire alarm not long after Grenfell. “It was about ten past midnight. We were in bed. You go, ‘Oh, what's that?’ And then my neighbour knocked on the door to say, ‘Are you ready, shall we go?’” And down they went, 14 floors with her dog under her arm. The fire brigade had had reports of smoke but in the end found nothing. Hall is reassured by such incidents rather than frightened. “I wouldn't want to move even after Grenfell. I feel safe,” she says. “There's still a lot of questions around Grenfell but it has raised awareness for landlords and tenants.” When council estates were a dream The 21st floor"
Diplomats owe over Â£116m in congestion charges,"Diplomats owe more than Â£116m to Transport for London for unpaid congestion charges, the Foreign Office has revealed. The US Embassy owes the largest amount at almost Â£12.5m, while the Embassy of Japan owes over Â£8.5m. The diplomats also owe over Â£200,000 in unpaid parking fines, with Nigeria's High Commission owing over Â£47,000. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had held meetings with embassies to ""press for payment"". But a US Embassy spokesman claimed the congestion charge was a tax which diplomats do not have to pay. EU plans post-Brexit London 'embassy' Diplomats owe Â£105m in congestion charges The figures for the congestion charge - the fee for most vehicles travelling in central London, which goes towards investment into public transport - dates back to between 2003 and 2018, with a total of Â£116,868,825 outstanding from embassies. The parking fines date from 2018 and total Â£200,686. The congestion charges for the US alone rose by more than Â£520,000 in one year, whilst Japan's went up by almost Â£500,000 for the same period. As well as topping the list for parking fines - up by Â£8,000 from the previous year - Nigeria was third on the congestion charge list, owing over Â£7m. In a written statement, Mr Raab said as well as the meetings, the government had written to diplomatic missions and international organisations with debts ""giving them the opportunity to either pay outstanding debts, or appeal against specific fines if they considered that they had been recorded incorrectly"". However, a number of embassies claim that under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, they do not have to pay taxes, which they consider these fees to be. A Foreign Office spokesman said they did not believe there were any legal grounds to exempt diplomats from paying the congestion charge, adding: ""The charge is comparable to a parking fee or a toll charge, which diplomatic missions and international organisations are required to pay."" And when it came to parking fines, he added: ""Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law and we therefore expect all foreign diplomats to pay their parking fines. ""As the [foreign secretary's statement] points out, we have made a concerted effort to urge missions to pay their fines."" A US Embassy spokesman said staff ""conscientiously pay fines for all traffic violations, such as parking and speeding violations"". ""Our position on the [congestion charge] tax... is based on the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which expressly prohibits the taxation of diplomatic missions in this manner,"" the spokesman said. ""This is a position shared by many other diplomatic missions in London. Our position is wholly in accordance with the convention, to which both the United States and the United Kingdom are parties."" The BBC has also contacted the Japanese and Nigerian embassies for a response.

Trade deal eludes Trump on first India visit,"This video can not be played Trump and Modi hail defence deal, 'positive' trade talks and shared values India and the US have signed defence, energy and telecoms deals but failed to reach a much-talked about trade accord. President Donald Trump hailed a ""very productive visit"" but said he would keep working with Indian PM Narendra Modi for ""a comprehensive trade deal"". The US is one of India's biggest trade partners. The two leaders hope the visit will mend a rift over tariffs. Mr Trump's visit to Delhi has been marred by the deadliest religious unrest in the capital for decades. Asked about the violence, he told reporters that the incident was ""up to India"" to handle. However, he said he had brought up the issue of religious freedom in the country and was impressed by Mr Modi's response. ""He [Modi] was incredible, he told me- 'In India we have worked very hard to have religious freedoms',"" Mr Trump said. Ten people, including a policeman, have been killed and about 150 injured in protests against a controversial new citizenship law, which critics say discriminates against Muslims. Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist government denies this, saying the law only seeks to give amnesty to persecuted minorities. At least seven people have died in violence in Delhi Correspondents say the timing of the unrest is an embarrassment to Mr Modi and the violence has taken the spotlight away from Mr Trump's visit. After talks on Tuesday, the US president and Mr Modi acknowledged they had not been able to sign a trade deal, but announced that negotiations would continue. Citizenship Amendment Bill: India's new 'anti-Muslim' law explained Jai Shri Ram: The Hindu chant that became a murder cry What will Trump's visit do for US-India ties? How Trump got his wall - in India ""We also agreed to open negotiations on a big trade deal. At the global level, our relationship is depended on the similar democratic values we share,"" Mr Modi said. But deals in other areas were announced. India is to buy attack helicopters and other US military equipment worth $3bn, Mr Trump said. They also announced co-operation in fighting radical Islamist terrorism and deepening energy ties, as well as pledging to work together to make 5G technology safer. As part of the deals announced, US firm Exxon Mobil and Indian Oil have signed an agreement to help India import more Liquefied Natural Gas (LPG). The two leaders hope their personal chemistry helps mend a rift over tariffs Bilateral trade between the two countries totalled $142.6bn (Â£110.3bn) in 2018. But in June 2019, the US ended preferential trade status for India. India imposed retaliatory tariffs on 28 US products, causing a diplomatic rift between the two countries. But Mr Trump's visit has helped improve relations, and cement what appears to be a strong personal rapport between him and Mr Modi. Mr Trump's two-day India visit has been high on optics. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Ahmedabad city in Gujarat, the home state of Mr Modi, to welcome him on Monday. The leaders later addressed a crowd of more than 100,000 people at the Motera cricket stadium. Mr Trump ended the day with a city to the iconic Taj Mahal. ""The last two days, especially yesterday at the stadium, it was a great honour for me. People were there maybe more for you [PM Narendra Modi] than for me... Every time I mentioned you, they cheered more. People love you here,"" President Trump said.

Poorest women's life expectancy declines,"There has been an increase in the number of food banks across the UK in recent years Life expectancy among women living in the poorest communities in England has declined since 2011, says a report warning of growing health inequalities. Overall, life expectancy growth has stalled over the past decade - for the first time in 100 years. The largest decreases were seen in the most deprived areas of north-east England, while the biggest increases were in the richest parts of London. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""still much more to do"". The report, by Prof Sir Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities, comes 10 years after hefirst published data on the growing gap between rich and poor,external, and between north and south, in England. ""England has lost a decade,"" Prof Marmot said, calling the damage to the nation's health ""shocking"". ""If health has stopped improving, that means society has stopped improving."" His follow-up report,external, after a decade of austerity, finds the picture has got worse. It highlights: stalling life expectancy for men and women in England since 2010 the more deprived the area, the shorter the life expectancy among women in the poorest 10% of areas, life expectancy fell between 2010-12 and 2016-18 people in poorer areas spend more of their lives in ill health than those in affluent areas the amount of time people spend in poor health has gone up across England since 2010 cuts in funding in deprived areas and areas outside London were larger and affected those areas more The report, from the Institute of Health Equity, maintains the widening health inequalities and deteriorating health which have marked the last decade cannot just be put down to very cold winters, flu, or problems with the NHS or social care. Instead, it points the finger at ""social and economic conditions, many of which have shown increased inequalities"". Prof Marmot said similar trends can be seen right across the UK, where the slow-down in life expectancy is more obvious than in most European and other high-income countries, apart from the US. The government must tackle health inequalities ""as a matter of urgency"" and bring the level of deprived areas in the north up to the level of good health enjoyed by people living in London and the south, the report says. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described the report as a ""devastating verdict on 10 years of austerity under the Conservatives"" and called for ""urgent action"" by the prime minister. In a statement, Mr Hancock said: ""There is still much more to do, and our bold prevention agenda, record Â£33.9bn a year investment in the NHS, and world-leading plans to improve children's health will help ensure every person can lead a long and healthy life."" This video can not be played Satpal Jutla was unemployed following a back injury and now provides job advice at a service in Coventry In some cities, like Coventry, projects have been set up to help bring about change, such as a support group for BAME mums and a centre helping people trying to find work by offering advice on CVs and application forms. For people like Wayne Martin, a cafe providing a decent meal and a chance for families to sit down together, has been a lifeline in tough times. The Real Junk Food Cafe is somewhere to meet others facing similar challenges. ""It's helped me mentally, I mean, because I suffer from depression,"" he said. ""One of the reasons I first started coming here was because I didn't want to talk to other people - being on my own with three children was kind of hard. ""So coming here was opening me up a little bit and actually getting me to mix with the people and talk to them."" Wayne says he started gained a sense of community and is now volunteering at the cafe. The report says some local authorities and communities have been good at tackling health inequalities, and the government now needs to build on these successful examples. Its other recommendations include: developing a national strategy for reducing inequalities in health, led by the prime minister early intervention in children's lives to reduce child poverty reduce low-paid and insecure work ensure a healthy standard of living for all invest more in deprived and 'ignored' areas ""The evidence is clear and the solutions are there - what is needed is the will to act,"" said the chief executive of the Health Foundation, Dr Jennifer Dixon. She said child poverty, Sure Start Children's centres and in-work poverty, were areas that needed immediate investment. Shirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: ""If the new government wants to show it can walk the talk on 'levelling up' for the regions and groups that have been left behind, it must begin by paying more than mere lip service to the reality of the deep and entrenched health inequalities across the UK.""

Woman wins Â£400k in DWP race discrimination row,"Anne Giwa-Amu, who is Nigerian and Welsh, won her claim against the government department The Department for Work and Pensions has been ordered to pay out nearly Â£400,000 after a Cardiff woman won her claim for race and age discrimination. Anne Giwa-Amu told the BBC the department was ""promoting a culture of racism"". The judge in her tribunal case said she had been a victim of deliberate and intended harassment by DWP staff. The department said racism was unacceptable and it took the judgement ""very seriously"". Warning: This report includes racist and offensive language Anne Giwa-Amu, 59, who is mixed Nigerian and Welsh, joined the DWP branch in Caerphilly as a full-time administrative officer in 2017, after trying without success to start a small business. She was the only non-white recruit and only trainee over the age of 50 in her cohort, according to documents from Cardiff Magistrates' Court seen by BBC News. Judge Howden-Evans said DWP staff had deliberately created a ""hostile environment"" for Ms Giwa-Amu and has ordered the department to pay out more than Â£386,000 in compensation. This includes Â£42,800 for injury to feelings, which is awarded in the ""most serious"" cases where there has been a lengthy campaign of harassment. ""It comes as a relief after what has been a harrowing experience for three years,"" Ms Giwa-Amu told the BBC. ""I've had to experience real financial hardship and the perpetrators were promoted despite how they had treated me."" Ms Giwa-Amu was based in the branch of the DWP at Caerphilly in south-east Wales A DWP official had violated her dignity by using racist language such as ""Paki-lover"" in her presence, the court found. Another had further humiliated and discriminated against Ms Giwa-Amu by loudly laughing and telling her cohort he had ""touched her bum"". Officials had also repeatedly accused Ms Giwa-Amu of stealing ice-cream, sprayed body-spray on themselves while next to her, and breached her confidence after she reported feeling ""bullied"". Ms Giwa-Amu went on sick leave in March 2017 and was unlawfully dismissed in October that year for being unable to return to work, the court found. She had been living off Â£55 a week and later had no money for food after her final pay cheque was withheld. Ms Giwa-Amu told the BBC she has since been living with ""immense stress and anxiety"". ""Management at the DWP are paying lip service to the equality legislation,"" she said. ""By protecting offenders, they are promoting a culture of racism."" The DWP has been ordered to contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission for diversity awareness training and its permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, must directly review her case. Ms Giwa-Amu's solicitor, Lawrence Davies from Equal Justice, said DWP staff had ""set out to destroy the confidence and wellbeing of a black employee with their appalling conduct"". ""None of the white DWP staff have been disciplined and some have been promoted,"" he said. ""Given that the DWP serves a high level of ethnic minority claimants, the presence of prejudice in the state benefits system is of grave concern."" In a statement, the DWP said: ""Racism is totally unacceptable and action will be taken against any staff found to be expressing such views. ""We take the judgement and the circumstances of this case very seriously.""

MSPs set to back plans for free sanitary products,"MSPs have backed the principle of tackling period poverty by making sanitary products available to all free of charge. All parties backed a bill put forward by Labour's Monica Lennon in its first test in the Holyrood chamber. However some warned there was a ""huge amount of work to do"" to amend the bill to make it deliverable and affordable. Ministers had originally opposed the plans but changed their position after coming under pressure from campaigners. The government is expected to put forward a raft of amendments to address their ""significant"" concerns about the legislation, including the estimated Â£24m annual cost of implementing it. Look back on the debate with Holyrood Live Ministers to back Scots period poverty legislation Guides call for rethink on period poverty law UK girls 'too poor to afford tampons' ThePeriod Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill,externalwould create a legal duty on the Scottish government to ensure that period products are available free of charge ""for anyone who needs them"". Ms Lennon said she was ""thrilled"" to have support ""from right across civic Scotland, from girl guides, trade unions, anti-poverty charities and many individuals who have had their own lived experience of period poverty and know what it is like not to have access to products when they need them"". She told MSPs that ""access to period products should be a right and available to all"", and pledged to work with other parties to make sure the proposals are deliverable. The legislation has been brought forward by Labour MSP Monica Lennon Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the proposed costs of the scheme had been dramatically underestimated, saying it would take ""a whole lot of hard work and endeavour to make sure we can get something that is fit for purpose"". She added: ""Parliament will now need to pull out all the stops and work hard collectively and collaboratively."" This was echoed by Tory MSP Graham Simpson, who said there was a ""huge amount of work to do"" to knock the bill into shape. At present tampons, pads and some reusable products are funded in schools, colleges and universities. The Scottish government provided Â£5.2m funding to support this. Another Â£4m was made available to councils so the roll-out could be expanded to other other public places, and another Â£50,000 for free provision in sports clubs. (Left to right) Caitlin, Xena and Amy are pupils at St Paul's High School in Glasgow. At St Paul's High School in Glasgow, there is a scheme where older pupils have been trained to talk to girls in S1 about periods and period poverty. ""Period poverty means that girls can't afford to buy period products,"" one pupil, Caitlin, told BBC Scotland. With average periods lasting about five days, it can cost up to Â£8 a month for tampons and pads. Xena said the expense meant some girls have to use items like tissues or socks instead. ""This means that some girls are feart to come to school and don't want to leave the house at all,"" said another pupil, Amy. Likeall schools in Scotland, free period products have been available in the toilets at St Paul's High School since the 2018/19 academic year. The move came after a survey ofmore than 2,000 people by Young Scot,externalfound that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access period products. Meanwhile about 12% of respondents toresearch by Plan International,externalsaid they have had to ""improvise sanitary wear"".

Rescues continue as river flood levels rise,"This video can not be played Some residents in Ironbridge have been advised to leave their homes Rail lines have closed and people have continued to evacuate as river levels continue to rise in Shropshire. Twosevere ""danger to life"" flood warnings,externalare in place for the River Severn at Shrewsbury and Ironbridge. Network Rail closed all lines at Shrewsbury station from 14:00 GMT, except for services to and from Chester and Crewe. Water is pouring over flood barriers in Bewdley, Worcestershire, and there are fears for the same in Ironbridge. The Environment Agency has warned defences at the Wharfage in the Shropshire town could be breached in the early hours of Wednesday, when the River Severn there is predicted to peak. The agency's Dave Throuptweeted,externalthe breach in Beales Corner, Bewdley, was not at the main demountable defences in Severnside, but urged people to avoid the area. West Mercia Police said residents who might be affected had been told and the force added the situation would be monitored overnight by fire crews and agency officials. Water began pouring over these flood defences in Bewdley on Tuesday evening Water levels in Ironbridge have now exceeded those seen last week and could reach up to 7m (22.9ft) overnight, the agency warned - making the river nearly 3m (9.8ft) deeper than it was on Sunday. Ch Supt Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police, said: ""We are particularly concerned this evening that those barriers [at the Wharfage] are going to be overtopped. ""We have spoken to all residents who could be impacted - most of which have evacuated."" He encouraged others who had decided not to evacuate to do so as high water levels were expected to remain for up to 48 hours. The force was prepared for the ""worse case scenario"" with rest centres and lots of staff and resources on the ground, he added. People have been been advised to evacuate along the Wharfage, Ironbridge, where the river is expected to peak overnight A Network Rail spokesman said hourly inspections were carried out on the Severn Viaduct, which carries the majority of lines in and out of Shrewsbury station. He said: ""Flood waters have been very close to the level where we have to close the viaduct for safety reasons."" As the river was expected to rise further, he said the lines would ""remain closed until levels have dropped below the closure mark and underwater inspections have been completed"".

Young drivers 'let down over insurance app faults',"Georgia said she had been ""fighting with Carrot back and forth to try and make sure they didn't cancel my policy"" Young people are being threatened with having their car insurance cancelled due to faults with an app that aims to make policies more affordable, the BBC has been told. Carrot Insurance uses phone data to measure journey length, acceleration and braking - but some say it often fails to work or wrongly records data. Tory MP Craig Tracey questioned whether it was ""fit for purpose"". Carrot said it was ""extremely sorry"" some had had a ""poor experience"". It told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme ""for the vast majority"" of young people, the app helps to reduce their premiums and to improve their driving safety. Carrot Insurance describes its Better Driver app as ""a clever bit of technology which uses 'telematics' to measure acceleration, braking, swerving, and the number and length of journeys that you make"". Users can then be rewarded for good driving. The premise is to help lower car insurance for younger people - who traditionally pay higher prices, as they are considered more at risk of an accident. Most telematics services run from a black box, which is a small device fitted to a car, that records data when it is being driven. But Carrot Insurance's Better Driver policy relies solely on GPS and Bluetooth - and requires a WiFi or data connection. More than 20 young people have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme they have had issues with the app - in some cases causing them to have their insurance cancelled, or end the policy themselves. Separate individuals have told the BBC the app had recorded them as driving while they were actually cycling or on the train. The person on the train was marked as speeding, which Carrot said ""can occur in some very rare instances when customers pair their phone to an additional Bluetooth device"". One woman, 28-year-old Jess, said Carrot cancelled her policy in December 2018 because she was not using the app - which she said was not working properly. ""In the end I lost two years no claims discount,"" she told the BBC. ""I have a new policy now but declaring the cancellation meant it cost me Â£1,600."" Carrot said it had fully compensated ""all those customers"" to which the BBC had alerted them. Layla said the app stopped working for her after it was updated Others have told the BBC their journeys had not been recorded properly by the app. Layla, 22, said after the app was updated in December, it stopped working. ""[Carrot] emailed me to say: 'If you do not connect the app to your car, your insurance will be cancelled,'"" she said. ""Then I was, 'Oh my god', panicking."" Carrot said that when the Better Driver App was updated, ""Layla began to record journeys accurately, as expected"". Georgia, a 22-year-old barista from Leicester, said she had been ""fighting with Carrot back and forth to try and make sure they didn't cancel my policy"", after the app ""started to play up"". Carrot said it was ""actively looking to resolve"" the matter with Georgia. Conservative MP Craig Tracey, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Insurance and Financial Services, said it was good that the industry had recognised the challenge young people faced to get affordable insurance. But, he said, while some technological advances had been ""really, really positive"", there was a need to ensure that regulation kept up. ""It seems like the technology [in the case of Carrot Insurance] is not working, is not fit for purpose. So it really needs to be looked at. ""There's a glitch somewhere along the line,"" he said. Craig Tracey MP said regulation needed to keep up with advances in technology He called on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to investigate. The FCA has told the BBC that for the second half of 2018, Carrot Insurance had the most complaints relative to the size of the company. Carrot Insurance said in a statement when the issue with its app ""became apparent in April 2019 we acted as quickly as possible to put things right and prevent anyone else experiencing similar problems or being disadvantaged in any way.

"Poorest women's life expectancy declines""If health has stopped improving, that means society has stopped improving,"" author of report says.Health","There has been an increase in the number of food banks across the UK in recent years Life expectancy among women living in the poorest communities in England has declined since 2011, says a report warning of growing health inequalities. Overall, life expectancy growth has stalled over the past decade - for the first time in 100 years. The largest decreases were seen in the most deprived areas of north-east England, while the biggest increases were in the richest parts of London. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""still much more to do"". The report, by Prof Sir Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities, comes 10 years after hefirst published data on the growing gap between rich and poor,external, and between north and south, in England. ""England has lost a decade,"" Prof Marmot said, calling the damage to the nation's health ""shocking"". ""If health has stopped improving, that means society has stopped improving."" His follow-up report,external, after a decade of austerity, finds the picture has got worse. It highlights: stalling life expectancy for men and women in England since 2010 the more deprived the area, the shorter the life expectancy among women in the poorest 10% of areas, life expectancy fell between 2010-12 and 2016-18 people in poorer areas spend more of their lives in ill health than those in affluent areas the amount of time people spend in poor health has gone up across England since 2010 cuts in funding in deprived areas and areas outside London were larger and affected those areas more The report, from the Institute of Health Equity, maintains the widening health inequalities and deteriorating health which have marked the last decade cannot just be put down to very cold winters, flu, or problems with the NHS or social care. Instead, it points the finger at ""social and economic conditions, many of which have shown increased inequalities"". Prof Marmot said similar trends can be seen right across the UK, where the slow-down in life expectancy is more obvious than in most European and other high-income countries, apart from the US. The government must tackle health inequalities ""as a matter of urgency"" and bring the level of deprived areas in the north up to the level of good health enjoyed by people living in London and the south, the report says. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described the report as a ""devastating verdict on 10 years of austerity under the Conservatives"" and called for ""urgent action"" by the prime minister. In a statement, Mr Hancock said: ""There is still much more to do, and our bold prevention agenda, record Â£33.9bn a year investment in the NHS, and world-leading plans to improve children's health will help ensure every person can lead a long and healthy life."" This video can not be played Satpal Jutla was unemployed following a back injury and now provides job advice at a service in Coventry In some cities, like Coventry, projects have been set up to help bring about change, such as a support group for BAME mums and a centre helping people trying to find work by offering advice on CVs and application forms. For people like Wayne Martin, a cafe providing a decent meal and a chance for families to sit down together, has been a lifeline in tough times. The Real Junk Food Cafe is somewhere to meet others facing similar challenges. ""It's helped me mentally, I mean, because I suffer from depression,"" he said. ""One of the reasons I first started coming here was because I didn't want to talk to other people - being on my own with three children was kind of hard. ""So coming here was opening me up a little bit and actually getting me to mix with the people and talk to them."" Wayne says he started gained a sense of community and is now volunteering at the cafe. The report says some local authorities and communities have been good at tackling health inequalities, and the government now needs to build on these successful examples. Its other recommendations include: developing a national strategy for reducing inequalities in health, led by the prime minister early intervention in children's lives to reduce child poverty reduce low-paid and insecure work ensure a healthy standard of living for all invest more in deprived and 'ignored' areas ""The evidence is clear and the solutions are there - what is needed is the will to act,"" said the chief executive of the Health Foundation, Dr Jennifer Dixon. She said child poverty, Sure Start Children's centres and in-work poverty, were areas that needed immediate investment. Shirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: ""If the new government wants to show it can walk the talk on 'levelling up' for the regions and groups that have been left behind, it must begin by paying more than mere lip service to the reality of the deep and entrenched health inequalities across the UK.""

Ex-Para 'had central role in soldiers' murders'The three Scottish soldiers were lured to their deaths by the IRA in Belfast in 1971.Northern Ireland,"The soldiers who died were, from left, Fusilier Dougald McCaughey, Fusilier John McCaig and Fusilier Joseph McCaig A former member of the Parachute Regiment was centrally involved in the killings of three off-duty soldiers almost 50 years ago, a BBC Spotlight investigation has established. The Scottish soldiers were John McCaig, 17; his brother, Joseph, 18, and Dougald McCaughey, 23. They were found shot dead in Ligoniel, north Belfast, on 10 March 1971. The Royal Highland Fusiliers had been drinking in a city centre pub when they were lured to their deaths by the IRA. The Spotlight investigation reveals that Paddy O'Kane, who had served seven years in the Parachute Regiment, shared a drink with the three Scots before taking them away to their deaths. Members of O'Kane's family and a former member of the IRA confirmed to Spotlight that O'Kane said he was involved in the killings. O'Kane, from north Belfast, joined the Parachute Regiment in 1957 and served in Cyprus and Jordan. A memorial stone marks the spot where the three soldiers were found on the outskirts of Belfast He was a member of the boxing team for 2 Para. When he left the Army in 1964, his duty was officially recorded as ""very good"". He is believed to have joined the Provisional IRA in 1969. Police identified him as a prime suspect almost immediately after the killings. The funeral for John and Joseph McCaig took place in Ayr He was seen drinking with the soldiers in a city centre pub by a work colleague. But O'Kane evaded arrest and went on the run in the Republic of Ireland where he remained very active in the IRA for at least another five years. Former IRA intelligence chief Kieran Conway knew O'Kane. He told Spotlight that O'Kane spoke openly about his role in the killings. Conway described the former Para as ""a psychopath"". ""I believe any man that could execute three young Scottish soldiers in that manner must have been a psychopath,"" he said. Separately, multiple sources confirmed to Spotlight that Paddy O'Kane was also a lead suspect for the Kingsmills massacre of January 1976, when 10 Protestant workmen were ordered off a minibus and shot dead by the IRA. O'Kane was listed as wanted for questioning about the Kingsmills killings for many years afterwards. He wasfirst refused an ""On-the-Run"" (OTR) letter in 2003,but in 2007 an OTR letter was approved, giving him confirmation that he was not wanted by any police force in the UK. O'Kane died two years later, in Shannon, County Clare, where he had lived since 1976. Paddy O'Kane was also wanted for questioning about the Kingsmills killings The bodies of the soldiers were discovered by a teenage girl. Three years ago, Brenda Kielty made her only recorded interview about that evening. ""They were just shot and dumped on top of each other. I didn't know whether it was three Protestants or three Catholics, but I never dreamt it was three soldiers,"" she said. ""There was nothing to indicate that it was three soldiers."" Ms Kielty, who died shortly after the interview, was then 14 years old, a little younger than the youngest of the victims, John McCaig. ""The wee boy had loads of freckles on his face. I actually put my hand on the wee boy's face and he was warm. He definitely wasn't cold like, he was warm,"" she said. The Spotlight investigation retraces the soldiers' last day. It scrutinises a longstanding rumour that women were used to lure the soldiers to their death in what was known as a ""honey trap"". It identifies three other men whom the police also suspected of involvement in the killings. One of those men told Spotlight that he ""vehemently denies any involvement"". As more emerges about the killings, there have been calls for a fresh inquest and a new investigation but police said that the clearest evidence has always been against O'Kane, who is now dead. Spotlight, The Killings of the Three Scottish Soldiers, is on Tuesday at 22:35 GMT on BBC 1 Northern Ireland.

The ups and downs of high-rise living," By Tom de Castella Raspberry-coloured walls, chocolate brown carpet, the murmur of a radio. A few paces into Jane Hall's flat you spy a drinks cabinet housing treasures from holidays past - melon liqueur, Grand Marnier and Shamrock Irish County Cream. Then coming into the lounge you are overwhelmed by sky. She lives on the 14th floor of Austin House, a tower block in Walsall and her lounge is a window on the world. Or the West Midlands at any rate. Hall, currently getting around on crutches after a hip operation, feels very much at home. “I love living on the 14th floor,” she says, standing on the balcony, pointing out local landmarks. “Over there you've got Sutton, Cannock and Lichfield. I'm originally a Birmingham girl and people say Walsall is urban but when you look out there's so much trees, foliage and green.” Jane Hall on the balcony of her 14th floor flat Jane Hall on the balcony of her 14th floor flat She lives here with her ex-partner Dave and their dog Todd Bentley, named after a Canadian evangelist who, as she puts it with a wry smile, “fell from grace”. She works four days a week at Asda and today has her young grandson Lewis with her. He's allowed on the balcony but only with an adult. High-rise living has its own rituals and quirks. She has an app telling her when the lights of the International Space Station are passing overhead. She watches out for the giant Emirates A380s orbiting Birmingham International Airport. And she knows when West Brom are at home from the glow of the floodlights. Up here there are no spiders, plenty of ladybirds (they live in the cladding) and she gets to watch regular firework displays. “Every season your view will change. You go from the trees being lush, to brown to shedding,” she says. “Winter is amazing as you can see so much more. Every time I look out I see something different.”  Until 2015 she lived in a three-bedroom house. But she and her partner didn't need all that space and a month after deciding to give it up she was offered this flat in an over-55s block. Hall has never seen high-rise as strange. Her parents were moved out of the Birmingham slums in Ladywood and she grew up in a new town near the airport. It was a seven-storey block and her family lived on the sixth floor. There was a sense of freedom, she recalls. “There were play areas and we were next to a park so it was ideal. It was the early 1960s, it was a brand new block so you'd got new radiators, flooring, everything was completely different from the back-to-backs in Ladywood.” Some of the data in this article is drawn fromBBC Briefing, a mini-series of downloadable in-depth guides to the big issues in the news, with input from academics, researchers and journalists. It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. In the beginning there was no stigma associated with living in a social housing block. Not like now, Hall laughs. She imitates the sound of someone sounding nervous when she tells them she lives in high-rise. What floor, they ask her. “I say 14 and they go, 'Oh, I couldn't live in a high-rise.’” She explains how they need to change their perception, how tower blocks like hers are clean, safe and the lifts don't smell.

Tower blocks in Sheffield, 1972 Tower blocks in Sheffield, 1972 That people would choose to live in a concrete tower block might strike some as bizarre. And yet at their inception they were hailed as an escape from the slum housing of post-war Britain. The first residential tower block was finished in 1951 as part of Harlow New Town in Essex. It was only 10 storeys high, but it was a radical departure from what had gone before. It was awarded a Ministry of Health Housing medal. Living high was synonymous with fresh air, light and modern appliances. The Lawn in Harlow, Essex - the UK's first residential tower block The Lawn in Harlow, Essex - the UK's first residential tower block The architecture profession, politicians - of all stripes - and much of the media were mostly in favour. Building tall was the future. High rise was an economical way of tackling the terrible legacy of slum housing in the UK. “We are going to win this battle,” declared the Conservative housing minister Henry Brooke in 1957. “I am determined to get all slums down.” Construction at Moss Heights in Glasgow, 1953 Construction at Moss Heights in Glasgow, 1953 British architects in the 1950s looked not to the US but to the French architect Le Corbusier, who favoured raw concrete - in French, “beton brut”, hence the architectural term Brutalist. It would divide people into camps - architects often hailed these new forms as strikingly modern, but more traditionally minded citizens tended to see them as bleak and impersonal. David Kynaston's social history, Modernity Britain: Opening The Box 1957-1959, captures the range of views towards high rise at the time. In 1957, the local government correspondent of the Manchester Guardian wrote: “There are, of course, social objections to compelling families with young children to live in high flats, and economic objections to a form of housing that costs over twice as much, in labour and materials, both to build and to maintain, as the two-storey dwelling which the vast majority of tenants prefer.” However, many occupants were wowed by the modern facilities. Joan Dutton, who moved into a 10-storey block in Liverpool, told her local paper: “It takes some getting used to at first but once you've convinced yourself you are not dreaming, it is like being on a permanent holiday. The central heating scheme is marvellous. We really wanted a house, but until we came here we didn't know how comfortable a flat could be.” 1953: Inside a high rise flat on the Ackroydon estate, south London 1953: Inside a high rise flat on the Ackroydon estate, south London Until the late 1950s, there had been a policy of dispersal - moving people out of the inner city slums to towns like Swindon and Watford. But as the 1960s approached the new urbanism proposed keeping people in the city and building at heights of 20 storeys or more. In April 1958 the foundation stone for the Park Hill estate in Sheffield was laid. Built on a hill overlooking the city centre, it was the first “streets in the sky” development in Britain, a vast series of blocks housing more than 2,000 people.  “Out of ugliness we are to create something of beauty and utility,” the lord mayor declared. By the 1960s Britain was in the grip of a high-rise boom. The baton of tallest residential building passed from one new building to the next. By 1975 a total of 440,000 high-rise flats for public housing had been created in the UK. It was fuelled by a government subsidy that increased with every extra storey. One of the structures built to this formula was the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in West London, which was completed in 1974. But worries were creeping in. In 1968, while surveying high-rise tenants in Glasgow, the social researcher Pearl Jephcott flagged up concerns. “Practically no one disputes that this form of home [the high-rise] is unsatisfactory for the family with small children,"" she wrote. And in the same year, a gas explosion caused Ronan Point, a new block in East London, to partially collapse, killing four people. The accident was caused by faulty construction, but even well-built towers had an Achilles heel - maintenance. It cost far more to put scaffolding up on a 20-storey block than a terraced house, but not enough money was generally put aside for the purpose. When Margaret Thatcher's government came to power in 1979 the direction of travel in housing changed. Instead of building social housing, councils were told to sell their homes. An explosion caused Ronan Point to partially collapse in 1968 An explosion caused Ronan Point to partially collapse in 1968 Increasingly, high-rise became associated with crime and a lack of community - from ""streets in the sky"" to ""slums in the sky"". Tower blocks gained an image problem that never completely went away. High-rise became a convenient metaphor for society’s ills. In 1971, Stanley Kubrick's film Clockwork Orange was released, a vision of bleak, savage urban dystopia played out against the backdrop of the Thamesmead estate in south-east London. Above: A block of flats being demolished on Hackney's Nightingale Estate, 2000 With the notable exception of the Barbican in central London, high-rise was not seen for many years as somewhere for the middle classes. It was mass housing for the poor. Ever-rising house prices brought about a change of attitude in the 21st Century. There was also a growing appreciation for concrete towers, especially if they were built by signature architects such as Erno Goldfinger. His Trellick Tower in west London was Grade-II-listed in 1998 and a significant number of the flats are now privately owned. Balfron Tower, east London Balfron Tower, east London More revealing still is what is happening at The Trellick’s “sister”, the Balfron Tower in Poplar, east London. Housing association tenants have been “decanted” out to lower-rise homes in the area, and the block is in the hands of a private developer, nearing the end of a multi-million pound refurbishment. The flats, with their breathtaking views of central London, will soon be occupied by bankers, lawyers and other well-to-do professionals with a penchant for gritty urban design and three quarters of a million pounds or so to spare. But for social housing tenants and private owners alike, a shadow was cast over high-rise living by the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in west London, which killed 72 people. Its impact is still being felt, both emotionally and financially. Dani Leitch and Mark Hughson outside their home in Manchester Dani Leitch and Mark Hughson outside their home in Manchester “You should get a rope.” Dani Leitch and Mark Hughson are remembering what a friend told them recently. It was meant “half jokingly” but the more they thought about it the more it made sense. The couple live on the ninth floor of a Manchester block that post-Grenfell has been found to be a fire risk. If the building was to go up in flames and the fire were to spread to the stairs, they would have no way out. Hence, their contemplation of extreme measures. The rope needn't be long, they say. They would tie it to the balcony and climb down one floor at a time, untying and retying as they go. It's dusk and I'm looking at rain-lashed Manchester from their balcony. Down below, tiny figures hurry past the stationary tail-lights on a dual carriageway. To our left, illuminated trams fly over Victorian mills and ahead, in the distance, looms the outrageous overhang of the Beetham Tower. The scene resembles a Lowry painting crossed with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. It was the view that convinced Hughson to buy the flat in 2015. A couple of years later he started going out with Leitch - they worked at the same pensions firm but in offices hundreds of miles apart. Soon she moved up from Surrey and into her partner's flat. All seemed well at first. The fire at Grenfell Tower had happened before she moved in. But it was only later that the implications began to hit home, that a similar fire could happen in hundreds of flats across Britain, including their own. They live in City Gate 2, one of three City Gate blocks in the Castlefield district of Manchester. The buildings have been found to have combustible cladding, and a lack of cavity barriers which would prevent fire spreading. The buildings' steel frameworks also appear to lack fire protection. The buildings’ managing agents, whose surveyors identified these problems, say that the apartment blocks could not have complied with the Building Regulations at the time of construction – the developer, Bellway, denies this. Until recently there was a waking watch - people on patrol wearing hi-vis jackets - costing £3,200 a week across the three buildings. It ended at Christmas after the installation of smoke alarms to vulnerable areas. There are fire detectors in the communal areas but they do not sound to residents. In fact there is no common fire alarm in the building, only smoke alarms in people's flats. And there are no sprinklers. The lack of a sounding fire alarm is not illegal, indeed many apartment blocks operate this system, but it may surprise people. Indeed Hughson and Leitch were under the impression there was a central alarm they would hear if a fire started. However it is the lack of any way out other than one flight of stairs that most worries them. “It scares the living hell out of me,” Leitch says. “If there was a fire on the eighth floor we've got to make our way down.” Hughson adds that in the event of a fire the official advice is to “close all your doors and stay put”. “Which I don't want to do,” Leitch interrupts. “I want to get out. Sorry, I'm not going to wait for a fire engine to come. If there's a fire, I'm getting out.”  (This is where the rope idea came in). At Grenfell the London Fire Brigade told residents to stay in their flats rather than try to escape. As Sir Martin Moore-Bick wrote in the report of the inquiry's first phase: “The evidence taken as a whole strongly suggests that the 'stay put' concept had become an article of faith within the LFB so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable.” His report concluded that “more lives could have been saved” if the “stay put” advice had been jettisoned earlier. Fear of a fire is not the couple’s only anxiety. Like many leaseholders in high-rises, they face the question, who is going to pay to make the buildings safe? The City Gate development, Manchester The City Gate development, Manchester City Gate was developed by Bellway, the UK's fourth biggest housebuilder - a FTSE 250 company. One might assume that this company would be liable for any outstanding issues. But one would be wrong. The law states that developers are no longer liable six or 10 years (depending on legal complexities) after a building is completed. “Buildings stay up in places for hundreds of years. You can't have a warranty that lasts 10 years,” Hughson says. “It's not a valid reason, it's like a get-out-of-jail-free card.” While he and his partner hold Bellway responsible, they think the government should be doing more to help them. Theresa May's government last year announced it would compensate private high-rise buildings where the cladding is aluminium composite material (ACM), as Grenfell's was. However, like hundreds of blocks around the UK, most of the City Gate cladding is non-ACM, made up of timber and other materials. In short, government money won't help the residents. To fix the cladding and cavities will cost an estimated £8.2m. If the steelwork has to be redone as well, the final sum could be much higher. The managing agent for the building is a firm called Rendall & Rittner. Like companies across the country, it is passing the costs of the building work and interim safety measures to leaseholders like Leitch and Hughson through their service charge. Currently £120 a month, it is expected to rise to £550 a month. Then, as the more expensive work comes on track, it will go up more steeply. “It's about 28 grand a flat over two years,” Hughson says. His parents - who helped him buy the property - have taken over the lease. He and Leitch pay the service charge, but they can't afford it any longer. They have no choice but to find somewhere else to live. In effect they are being forced out of their home. Bellway told the BBC: “The City Gate buildings were built between 2003 and 2005 and passed all required building regulation checks at the time of completion. Recently, the managing agent has made us aware of some potential issues regarding the site. Bellway takes these issues very seriously and so, at its own cost, has committed to instruct an independent expert to review the situation.” Manchester City Council is also under the spotlight for giving the building the all clear. “The Council issued a building regulations completion certificate based on the appropriate national government guidance from the time of completion,” a spokesperson says. “However, this is not conclusive evidence of on-going compliance and is not an approval of the quality of work carried out.” The statement continues: “It was, and remains, the responsibility of the person carrying out the work to comply with building regulations, and it is a matter for the contractor or designers to ensure materials were used and properly installed - and any defects should be rectified by them.” A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner said: “All of the cladding installed at City Gate is being replaced, some of which is ACM cladding. Due to the age of the building, the 10-year warranty has expired and the buildings insurance does not cover these defects.” The Halo Tower, Stratford, east London The Halo Tower, Stratford, east London  For the purposes of this article, one resident at the 43-storey Halo Tower in Stratford, east London, who lives on the 41st floor, volunteered to measure the time it takes to descend by stairs at normal pace. Answer: nine minutes, 45 seconds. It’s a reminder that the lift is crucial to the smooth functioning of high-rise. Those towers that are popular with residents tend to have lifts that work. No-one would live in a tall building if it took several minutes to climb up or down. In fact, the history of high-rise probably begins with the invention of the lift. In 1842 Elisha Otis invented a safe elevator that would not plummet to the ground if the hoisting cable broke. It was this easy vertical transport from one floor to another that allowed the first skyscrapers to be built in Chicago and New York. Elisha Otis demonstrates his new elevator in New York, 1853 Elisha Otis demonstrates his new elevator in New York, 1853 After the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, there was widespread anxiety about tall buildings. For a time architects and planners hesitated. Were tall buildings too vulnerable to terror attacks? But as time went on, the panic dissipated. 9/11 was unique. Normal service was resumed. A new term “super-tall skyscraper” had to be introduced for the growing number of buildings over 300m tall. There are now 21 buildings around the world more than 450m tall. Indeed, if the World Trade Center towers were still standing, they would be just 28th and 29th highest in the world. If 9/11 failed to change the skyward direction of US buildings, it seems unlikely Grenfell will stop the growth of residential high-rise in the UK. In 2020 the new towers tend to be private, made out of glass and steel rather than concrete and are called apartment buildings, not tower blocks. Research from New London Architecture (NLA) last year suggested that there are 541 towers of more than 20 storeys planned or under construction in the capital, which, if built, will provide more than 110,000 new homes by 2030. Peter Murray of NLA  said at the time that the London skyline for the next 20 years will be “pockets of taller buildings located in those boroughs that are willing to accept them. These buildings are not super-tall, they are generally between 20 and 30 storeys.” Even if some of these projects fall by the wayside it shows the dramatic shift upwards of UK housing. Horror over Grenfell remains but if these new homes are well-built, using high-quality materials in accordance with tighter safety legislation, many would argue there's no problem. “We are facing a dire shortage of affordable housing in this country and high rises remain an important part of the solution,” says Victoria Moffett of the National Housing Federation, which represents social housing providers. Meanwhile, house builders want to continue their skyward march. “As we look to build more desperately needed homes, land availability, especially in urban areas, dictates that high-rise living will play a significant part in how we build in the future,” says a spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation. The HBF says that the number of flats being built as a proportion of the overall number of homes has dropped in recent years. Overall that may be so. But in big cities with high demand, like London and Manchester, the number of cranes on the horizon points to a different future.

But in big cities with high demand, like London and Manchester, the number of cranes on the horizon points to a different future. Emporis, a data firm specialising in property, defines high-rise as anything between 35m and 100m. And it is in this area that a large number of buildings in particular hubs such as London and Manchester are emerging. Grenfell may lead to tighter regulation. Since the fire the government has termed anything over 18m as high-rise. New legislation on sprinklers and cladding is expected. But for Leitch and Hughson it feels like a grim future. Living at height has meant abandoning control of their environment to forces beyond their control. Hughson, who loved the buzz of the city, will be giving that up for somewhere lower-rise, ideally with a garden.  He thinks it's unjust that housebuilders can ignore the mistakes they made in the past and be allowed to build ever higher. “I just think it's immoral,” he says. He notes that Bellway were one of the major beneficiaries of the government's Help To Buy scheme. Leitch believes a maximum storey height should be put in place. Her mental health has suffered and she can't wait to move out. “It's stressful. I've actually gone to the doctors about it.” Back in Walsall, Jane Hall is in a different position. She's a social housing tenant. Social housing providers such as councils and housing associations have responded more quickly to the job of replacing flammable cladding. It's true that some social housing tenants like those on part of Tottenham's Broadwater Farm estate, are being moved out as their homes have been found to be structurally flawed. But Hall says she is lucky. The cladding on Austin House, owned by WHG, a housing association, has been checked and found to be safe. She recalls a fire alarm not long after Grenfell. “It was about ten past midnight. We were in bed. You go, ‘Oh, what's that?’ And then my neighbour knocked on the door to say, ‘Are you ready, shall we go?’” And down they went, 14 floors with her dog under her arm. The fire brigade had had reports of smoke but in the end found nothing. Hall is reassured by such incidents rather than frightened. “I wouldn't want to move even after Grenfell. I feel safe,” she says. “There's still a lot of questions around Grenfell but it has raised awareness for landlords and tenants.” When council estates were a dream The 21st floor"
MSPs set to back plans for free sanitary productsLabour MSP Monica Lennon's bill now has the support of all parties following a government U-turn.Scotland politics,"MSPs have backed the principle of tackling period poverty by making sanitary products available to all free of charge. All parties backed a bill put forward by Labour's Monica Lennon in its first test in the Holyrood chamber. However some warned there was a ""huge amount of work to do"" to amend the bill to make it deliverable and affordable. Ministers had originally opposed the plans but changed their position after coming under pressure from campaigners. The government is expected to put forward a raft of amendments to address their ""significant"" concerns about the legislation, including the estimated Â£24m annual cost of implementing it. Look back on the debate with Holyrood Live Ministers to back Scots period poverty legislation Guides call for rethink on period poverty law UK girls 'too poor to afford tampons' ThePeriod Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill,externalwould create a legal duty on the Scottish government to ensure that period products are available free of charge ""for anyone who needs them"". Ms Lennon said she was ""thrilled"" to have support ""from right across civic Scotland, from girl guides, trade unions, anti-poverty charities and many individuals who have had their own lived experience of period poverty and know what it is like not to have access to products when they need them"". She told MSPs that ""access to period products should be a right and available to all"", and pledged to work with other parties to make sure the proposals are deliverable. The legislation has been brought forward by Labour MSP Monica Lennon Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the proposed costs of the scheme had been dramatically underestimated, saying it would take ""a whole lot of hard work and endeavour to make sure we can get something that is fit for purpose"". She added: ""Parliament will now need to pull out all the stops and work hard collectively and collaboratively."" This was echoed by Tory MSP Graham Simpson, who said there was a ""huge amount of work to do"" to knock the bill into shape. At present tampons, pads and some reusable products are funded in schools, colleges and universities. The Scottish government provided Â£5.2m funding to support this. Another Â£4m was made available to councils so the roll-out could be expanded to other other public places, and another Â£50,000 for free provision in sports clubs. (Left to right) Caitlin, Xena and Amy are pupils at St Paul's High School in Glasgow. At St Paul's High School in Glasgow, there is a scheme where older pupils have been trained to talk to girls in S1 about periods and period poverty. ""Period poverty means that girls can't afford to buy period products,"" one pupil, Caitlin, told BBC Scotland. With average periods lasting about five days, it can cost up to Â£8 a month for tampons and pads. Xena said the expense meant some girls have to use items like tissues or socks instead. ""This means that some girls are feart to come to school and don't want to leave the house at all,"" said another pupil, Amy. Likeall schools in Scotland, free period products have been available in the toilets at St Paul's High School since the 2018/19 academic year. The move came after a survey ofmore than 2,000 people by Young Scot,externalfound that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access period products. Meanwhile about 12% of respondents toresearch by Plan International,externalsaid they have had to ""improvise sanitary wear"".

Why did infections rocket in South Korea?,"South Korea's coronavirus cases have spiked in the past week South Korea has seen by far the highest numbers of coronavirus cases outside of China - within a week confirmed cases jumped from a few dozen to more than 900. The country had seemed well prepared and so the skyrocketing numbers have many asking how this happened - and whether a similar sudden outbreak could happen elsewhere. In South Korea, more than half of the Covid-19 cases have been linked to a religious sect and its critics say the group's secretive nature helped the virus go undetected. Authorities have identified the fringe Christian group Shincheonji Church as being at the heart of this outbreak. At their services in the south-eastern city of Daegu, members likely infected one another and then fanned out around the country, apparently undetected. South Korean health officials believe that a 61-year-old member of the sect who last week tested positive for the virus was among the first to be infected and is now at the centre of their investigation. The female patient initially refused to be transferred to a hospital to be tested and is known to have attended several church gatherings before testing positive. Any large gathering in a confined space she would have attended - like a church service - would have likely led to further infections, health officials say. What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? Authorities have since disinfected the area around the Shincheonji building The director of the South Korean Centre for Disease Control, Jung Eun-kyeong, suggested at a press briefing that ""there is a possibility that the characteristics of many people sitting close together in a very confined space and holding service for more than an hour"" would have led to ""a few who were exposed infecting many other infectees"". ""The virus preys on our social habits and interactions,"" infectious disease specialist Dr Leong Hoe Nam told the BBC. ""There may be practices within a church - like weeping or the belting of songs - that would encourage droplet transmission."" Another cluster associated with the sect is at a hospital in Cheongdo where a large number of sect followers attended a funeral of the founder's brother over three days at the end of January. Church communities in other countries have also become virus outbreak clusters, though in much smaller numbers than in South Korea. All of them have suspended services and community gatherings to curb the spread. Since the outbreak began in China in December, one of the key questions has been how early the virus can be detected - and whether it can be spread by people who don't yet show any symptoms, which would make it very hard to curb the spread. While Chinese health authorities have long warned people can be contagious before they show any symptoms, the World Health Organization has so far not confirmed that. South Korea was already on alert over the virus before the clusters were discovered. So if people presumably were careful and paid heightened attention to each others' health, does this then suggest that people without symptoms were able to spread the virus? ""It's a contentious question,"" says Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network at the WHO, told the BBC. ""What we can say is that it spreads early - whereas Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) for instance spread late in the illness."" He explains that any infected people will have the virus on their throat before they show any symptoms. Yet without the symptoms - without coughing - they are also much less likely to spread the virus. Simply put, in order to spread the virus widely, an infected person would need to be coughing, i.e. coughing on their hands, on surfaces or on other people. ""At worst, the infectivity in an infected person without symptoms is much lower,"" Mr Fisher explains. ""And to be clear - the asymptomatic ones are not the big spreaders. It is only when you do have symptoms that you can spread it easily."" Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak How a misleading coronavirus map went global Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan Officially called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the group was founded in the 1980s and claims to have around 250,000 followers. During services, the members are reportedly asked to sit and kneel very close to one another and continue to gather after the service is over. The fringe Christian mega church is accused by some critics of being a cult. It is common to hide your membership of Shincheonji Church as they are not a popular sect in South Korea, says the BBC's South Korea correspondent Laura Bicker. The Daegu branch of the Shincheongji church has been linked to dozens of cases They also see sickness as a weakness. This combination means tracking those who've been infected has proven difficult. There are still some church-goers the health authorities have not managed to trace. The group itself says it is fully cooperating with authorities and that it has handed over a list of its members. On Tuesday however, officials broke into one of the offices of the church after discovering some names had been left off the list. Among the general public, there is a lot of anger and blame directed at the sect and hundreds of thousands have called for the dissolution of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Over 552,000 people have signed an online petition since Saturday after it was filed on the website of the presidential office of Cheong Wa-dae. ""Shincheonji contributed significantly to the sharp rise in the number of patients in Korea,"" Won Suk-choi of the division of infectious diseases at the Korea University College of Medicine, told the BBC, but he also warns that ""the situation Korea is currently experiencing can happen anywhere in the world"". There is fear in South Korea, especially for elderly parents and relatives, according to our correspondent, who is in the worst-hit city of Daegu. Yet there is also resigned acceptance and many South Koreans believe the country was well prepared for this outbreak. Medics and hospitals have been on standby for weeks. There are briefings from the Centre for Disease Control twice a day where experts have been mapping the source of every infection. This video can not be played Drone captures massive queue for masks in South Korea's Daegu city There are also text messages alerting residents to confirmed cases in their area telling you where they've been and when. Unlike Hong Kong or Singapore, there had been very little panic buying in South Korea until the beginning of the week. Yet when shops in Daegu announced they had new stock of masks arriving, thousands queued for hours in the hope of getting one. Reporting by the BBC's Andreas Illmer.

New coronavirus advice for Britons back from Italy,"Cases of the coronavirus in Italy rose from three to 229 in four days Children returning from holidays in northern Italy have been sent home from school after new government health advice on the coronavirus. Four schools in England have shut completely for a ""deep clean"" after pupils came back from skiing trips. The Foreign Office has now updatedits travel advice,,externalwarning against all but essential travel to 11 quarantined towns in Italy. The government said,externalanyone returning from those towns must self-isolate. And those who have travelled north of Pisa are asked to stay at home for 14 days if they develop flu-like symptoms. What are health officials saying? Will I get paid if I self-isolate? Italy has put the 11 towns in Lombardy and Veneto - areas which attract tourists for their ski resorts -  into lockdown. Police are manning checkpoints around the towns in quarantineafter 11 people died. Some travellers suggested UK authorities were too slow to respond to the outbreak in Italy, where the number of confirmed cases spiked over four days. Tenerife hotel locked down over coronavirus Measures to contain coronavirus stepped up Coronavirus: What you need to know Several schools in England andNorthern Irelandhave advised staff and students to stay at home after they returned from skiing trips in northern Italy. St Christopher's C of E High School in Accrington told parents it would be closed on Wednesday as a precautionary measure after some pupils returning from Pila in the Italian Alps said they felt unwell. Four schools have shut completely for a week while they carry out a ""deep clean"", after students and teachers returned from skiing trips over February half term. Gedney Church End and Lutton St Nicholas primary schools in the Spalding area in Lincolnshire have closed as a precautionary measure. The head of Cransley School in Northwich said he understood ""there will be a variety of reactions"" from parents Trinity Catholic College in Middlesbrough,externalsaid ""a small number of pupils and staff began showing mild flu-like symptoms"". Students would be sent work to do at home, the school added. And Cransley School, a private school in Cheshire,also closedafter 29 pupils and five members of staff returned from Bormio, a Lombardy ski resort. In an email to parents, headmaster Richard Pollock said the decision was going further than the advice from Public Health England ""to completely minimise"" the potential spread of infection. Guru Singh said he and his partner developed flu-like symptoms after returning from Milan and Venice on Friday. Having contacted the NHS, they are now being tested at a hospital in north-west London. ""I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, a bit scared,"" he told the BBC. ""They said we fit the criteria to get tested."" In Venice, in the region of Veneto, officials have has cancelled some events and closed cultural sites Rome is not in the zone covered by the UK government's health advice, but some visitors take precautions In the Sicilian capital of Palermo some supermarket shelves are empty amid fears of the virus Stephen Paskins, who is due to fly back to Bristol from Venice on Wednesday, told the BBC there were fewer tourists in the city, more police and more people wearing face masks. ""The only way to get about is via public transport so keeping away from people is impossible. Everyone is still visiting the landmarks even though you can't enter,"" he said. Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow said he has self-isolated himself as a precaution after visiting Iran to cover the election last week - but he does not have any symptoms. Meanwhile,a hotel in Tenerife has been locked downwith hundreds of guests inside after a visiting Italian doctor tested positive for the coronavirus. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were no plans to stop flights from Italy, which attracts about three million British visitors each year. ""If you look at Italy, they stopped all flights from China and they're now the worst affected country in Europe,"" he said. British Airways is allowing customers with flights to northern Italy until 2 March - including to Milan or Venice - to rebook for a later date or another destination. The quarantined towns in Italy are Bertonico, Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione d'Adda, Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia, Terranova dei Passerini - all in Lodi province in Lombardy - and Vo' Euganeo in Padova province, Veneto. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We advise against all but essential travel to 10 small towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto, which are currently in isolation due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. ""Any British nationals already in these towns should follow the advice of the local authorities.""

Your rights as a traveller Major events in northern Italy have been cancelled, cut short or rescheduled, including the Venice Carnival and Bologna book fair. The updated health advice,externalmeans people returning from these Italian towns, or Iran, parts of South Korea and Hubei province in China - where the outbreak began - are being asked to call NHS 111, stay indoors and avoid contact with others, even if they do not have symptoms. Mr Hancock said he was not aware of any British citizens currently in the Italian quarantine area, but he said anyone there should contact the embassy in Rome. This video can not be played Coronavirus in the UK: 5 things you need to know about Covid-19 The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent handwashing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service, even if symptoms are mild. If you have returned from the following specific areas since February 19, you should call NHS 111 and stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, even if you do not have symptoms: Iran, lockdown areas in Northern Italy, special care zones in South Korea, and Hubei province. If you have returned from the following areas since February 19 and develop symptoms - even mild ones - stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call NHS 111: northern Italy (above but not including Pisa, Florence and Rimini), Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The main focus for the government is on rapidly identifying people with the disease and taking them to specialist hospitals for treatment in isolation. They are then tracing anybody who has come into close contact with the patient to make sure they know the signs of the disease and what to do. After the World Health Organization warned that countries should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic, the health secretary said that the UK had already done ""a huge amount of work"". ""Once it gets to that point there isn't a way to stop it coming into the UK in a big way,"" Mr Hancock said. ""It is not yet clear that it will become a pandemic - the number of cases in China has been slowing over the last couple of weeks and we are relatively confident that information is correct."" In other developments worldwide: China reported 508 new infections on Monday as the death toll rose by 71 to 2,663 In South Korea, 10 people have died after contracting the virus, with the number of people infected reaching 977 Japan has now confined more than 850 people with the virus, mostly from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner Three more deaths have been recorded in Iran, state media says, bringing the death toll there to 15 Mr Hancock said if other countries where the number of cases are growing ""get their response right"", there was still the possibility that the outbreak will remain small in the UK. ""We still expect more cases but at the moment there are 13 cases in the UK,"" he added. How has coronavirus affected your trip in Italy?

EU set to agree UK trade talks mandate,"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: UK needs to build Irish Sea checks infrastructure Ministers from the EU have approved their mandate for post-Brexit trade talks with the UK. The document,external- approved by the EU General Affairs Council on Tuesday - will be the basis for the negotiations, to be carried out by Michel Barnier. It says that EU standards should serve as ""a reference point"" in any future trade deal. Meanwhile, UK ministers have agreed the government's mandate for the negotiations, which begin on Monday. The final agreement is due to be published online and presented in Parliament on Thursday. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? EU warns UK over goods checks between NI and GB UK 'would be insane' to let in chlorinated chicken What is a level playing field? The EU's mandate - a 46-page document - says that its ""envisaged agreement should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"". It says this should apply ""in the areas of state aid, competition, state-owned enterprises, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, relevant tax matters and other regulatory measures and practices in these areas"".

But the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc would not agree a deal ""at any price"". He warned there would be ""complex, demanding negotiations"" over a limited period of time, referring to the transition period that ends on 31 December. During this period, the UK continues to follow EU rules - including freedom of movement - and it is intended to allow time for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade agreement. Mr Barnier said: ""A short time, as chosen by the British government, not by us. ""In a very brief period, you can't do everything. We will do as much as we can under pressure of time."" Referring to the EU mandate document, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said: ""This is the blueprint that Michel Barnier will follow in the negotiations. ""We've learnt from experience these documents are very important because the EU will only accept a final outcome that is pretty similar to this starting point."" It is ""the roadmap for all the rows we're going to have over the next few months"", our correspondent added. Brexit: Will it be a Canadian or an Australian ending? What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? It is expected that ministers in the UK will commit to seekinga Canada-style agreementwith zero tariffs, a proposal Mr Johnson and his Europe adviser David Frosthave set out in speechesin recent weeks. But the push for a Canada-style deal could set up a clash with the EU after its chief negotiator Mr Barnier ruled out such an agreement. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will lead talks with the UK on future trade relations Mr Barnier has previously said the UK is too close in proximity to be permitted to compete with the other 27 member states on such terms. And Nathalie Loiseau, an MEP for French President Emmanuel Macron's La RÃ©publique En Marche! party, said that ""to my knowledge the UK is not Canada"", adding that the EU-UK relationship is ""very different"" from the one with Canada. Arriving at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels, Croatia's European Affairs minister Andreja Metelko-Zgombic said the EU would be willing to offer a ""substantial"" and ""ambitious"" partnership in trade talks. But Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok warned it will be ""very hard work"" and a ""tough road ahead"". And Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the prospect for a UK-EU free trade agreement will be ""damaged significantly"" if Britain did not build the infrastructure required for checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. The offer the EU was making to the UK was ""generous and fair"", he said. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the EU's proposals ""have been given a decidedly cool response from government sources"", who say the UK's priority is about control. He said the ""mood music"" from Number 10 was that the prime minister ""is quite prepared to walk away"" and use World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. When countries do not have free-trade agreements they use these terms. Under the WTO rules, each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering.

All supported the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. Following the meeting, the prime minister's spokesman said that agreeing the UK's negotiating mandate was a ""very smooth process"". ""The UK's primary objective in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021,"" the spokesman said. Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab What is the transition period? Mr Frost and his team will head to Brussels for the first round of negotiations on 2 March. One clash expected between the UK and EU is on fishing, with leading member states speaking regularly about wanting continued access to UK waters. In a speech in Greenwich, south-east London, earlier this month Mr Johnson announced that, once free of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, ""British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats"". But French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin signalled fishing would be a flash point when the two negotiating teams come together in London and Brussels over the coming months. ""The fishermen have the right to be protected, they know very well that if we sign a bad deal they will lose enormously,"" she told TV station France 2. The document also says that the UK should return ""unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin"". The passage is thought to refer to the Elgin Marbles, ancient Greek sculptures taken to Britain more than 200 years ago and now on display in the British Museum.

"Poorest women's life expectancy declinesThe gap between the health of rich and poor in England is widening, according to a report.Health","There has been an increase in the number of food banks across the UK in recent years Life expectancy among women living in the poorest communities in England has declined since 2011, says a report warning of growing health inequalities. Overall, life expectancy growth has stalled over the past decade - for the first time in 100 years. The largest decreases were seen in the most deprived areas of north-east England, while the biggest increases were in the richest parts of London. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""still much more to do"". The report, by Prof Sir Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities, comes 10 years after hefirst published data on the growing gap between rich and poor,external, and between north and south, in England. ""England has lost a decade,"" Prof Marmot said, calling the damage to the nation's health ""shocking"". ""If health has stopped improving, that means society has stopped improving."" His follow-up report,external, after a decade of austerity, finds the picture has got worse. It highlights: stalling life expectancy for men and women in England since 2010 the more deprived the area, the shorter the life expectancy among women in the poorest 10% of areas, life expectancy fell between 2010-12 and 2016-18 people in poorer areas spend more of their lives in ill health than those in affluent areas the amount of time people spend in poor health has gone up across England since 2010 cuts in funding in deprived areas and areas outside London were larger and affected those areas more The report, from the Institute of Health Equity, maintains the widening health inequalities and deteriorating health which have marked the last decade cannot just be put down to very cold winters, flu, or problems with the NHS or social care. Instead, it points the finger at ""social and economic conditions, many of which have shown increased inequalities"". Prof Marmot said similar trends can be seen right across the UK, where the slow-down in life expectancy is more obvious than in most European and other high-income countries, apart from the US. The government must tackle health inequalities ""as a matter of urgency"" and bring the level of deprived areas in the north up to the level of good health enjoyed by people living in London and the south, the report says. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described the report as a ""devastating verdict on 10 years of austerity under the Conservatives"" and called for ""urgent action"" by the prime minister. In a statement, Mr Hancock said: ""There is still much more to do, and our bold prevention agenda, record Â£33.9bn a year investment in the NHS, and world-leading plans to improve children's health will help ensure every person can lead a long and healthy life."" This video can not be played Satpal Jutla was unemployed following a back injury and now provides job advice at a service in Coventry In some cities, like Coventry, projects have been set up to help bring about change, such as a support group for BAME mums and a centre helping people trying to find work by offering advice on CVs and application forms. For people like Wayne Martin, a cafe providing a decent meal and a chance for families to sit down together, has been a lifeline in tough times. The Real Junk Food Cafe is somewhere to meet others facing similar challenges. ""It's helped me mentally, I mean, because I suffer from depression,"" he said. ""One of the reasons I first started coming here was because I didn't want to talk to other people - being on my own with three children was kind of hard. ""So coming here was opening me up a little bit and actually getting me to mix with the people and talk to them."" Wayne says he started gained a sense of community and is now volunteering at the cafe. The report says some local authorities and communities have been good at tackling health inequalities, and the government now needs to build on these successful examples. Its other recommendations include: developing a national strategy for reducing inequalities in health, led by the prime minister early intervention in children's lives to reduce child poverty reduce low-paid and insecure work ensure a healthy standard of living for all invest more in deprived and 'ignored' areas ""The evidence is clear and the solutions are there - what is needed is the will to act,"" said the chief executive of the Health Foundation, Dr Jennifer Dixon. She said child poverty, Sure Start Children's centres and in-work poverty, were areas that needed immediate investment. Shirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: ""If the new government wants to show it can walk the talk on 'levelling up' for the regions and groups that have been left behind, it must begin by paying more than mere lip service to the reality of the deep and entrenched health inequalities across the UK.""

"World must prepare for pandemic, says WHO","This video can not be played Drone captures massive queue for masks in South Korea's Daegu city The World Health Organization has said the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic. The WHO said it was too early to call the outbreak a pandemic but countries should be ""in a phase of preparedness"". A pandemic is when an infectious disease spreads easily from person to person in many parts of the world. More cases of the virus, which causes respiratory disease Covid-19, continue to emerge, with outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran causing concern. However, most infections are in China, the original source of the virus, where more than 77,000 people have the disease and over 2,600 have died. More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. Italy reported four more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to seven. Worldwide stock markets saw sharp fallsbecause of concerns about the economic impact of the virus. China said it would postpone the annual meeting of the National People's Congress next month, to ""continue the efforts"" against the coronavirus. The body, which approves decisions made by the Communist Party, has met every year since 1978. The proportion of infected people who die from Covid-19 appears to be between 1% and 2%, although the WHO cautions that the mortality rate is not known yet. On Monday Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain reported their first cases, all involving people who had come from Iran. Officials in Bahrain said the patient infected there was a school bus driver, and several schools had been closed as a result. Coronavirus: Could it become a pandemic?

Among other developments: Some upcoming football matches in Italy's Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors to prevent the spread of the virus, Italy's sports minister says Gold surged to its highest price in seven yearsas coronavirus fears led investors to seek a safe haven South Korean pop group BTS asks fans to stay away from upcoming TV shows, which will be taped without a studio audience North Korea has quarantined 380 foreignersin a bid to stop the coronavirus from breaking out. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday that the number of new cases in recent days in Iran, Italy and South Korea was ""deeply concerning"". However he added: ""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large scale severe disease or deaths. ""Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet."" ""The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained, indeed there are many countries that have done exactly that,"" Mr Tedros said. ""Using the word 'pandemic' now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear."" But Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, said now was the time to make ""do everything you would do to prepare for a pandemic"". Is the coronavirus a pandemic? For now the WHO says no. It argues the number of countries with outbreaks, the severity of the disease and the impact on society has not reached pandemic-level. But some scientists - assessing the same picture - think we are already there and others say we're on the cusp. The surge in cases in South Korea and the deaths in Iran and Italy have dialled up concern over the past few days. The deaths suggest there are far more cases in those two countries than have been reported and that the virus has been there for some time. But ultimately the word pandemic is just that - a word - it will not unlock more money or give the WHO new powers. It has already issued the highest warning it can, by declaring the virus a global emergency. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? A pandemic is theworldwide spread of a new disease,external The H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak, which killed hundreds of thousands of people, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in 2009 The WHO no longer formally labels an outbreak of disease a ""pandemic"" but says the term may be used ""colloquially"" Its advice to countries - to limit the infections while preparing for wider spread - remains the same South Korea- which has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China - reported another 231 infections on Monday taking the total there to more than 830. Eight people have died. Around 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were infected. But the biggest virus clusters have been linked to a hospital and a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu.

In the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, a lock-down is in place in several small towns. For the next two weeks, 50,000 residents will not be able to leave without special permission. This video can not be played Mark Lowen was on the ground at the edge of Italy's coronavirus lockdown area Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelled. Three deaths announced on Monday were all in Lombardy, Italian media reported. It is not yet clear how the virus entered the country, officials said. InChina, the government announced a ban on the consumption of wild animals and a crackdown on the hunting, transportation and trade of prohibited species, state media say. It is thought that the outbreak originated at a market in the city of Wuhan selling wild animals. China reported 508 new infections on Monday, compared with 409 on Sunday. The bulk of the new cases were in Wuhan. Outside the worst-hit province of Hubei, the number of new infections continues to decline, according to official figures. The death toll in China rose by 71 to 2,663. Iransaid on Sunday it had 61 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the holy city of Qom. Twelve of those infected have died, the highest number of deaths outside China. On Mondayan MP in Qom accused the government of covering up the extent of the outbreak, saying there were 50 deaths in the city alone. However, the country's deputy health minister quickly denied the claim.

Young drivers 'let down over insurance app faults'Carrot uses phone data to measure braking and acceleration - but some say it often fails to work.Business,"Georgia said she had been ""fighting with Carrot back and forth to try and make sure they didn't cancel my policy"" Young people are being threatened with having their car insurance cancelled due to faults with an app that aims to make policies more affordable, the BBC has been told. Carrot Insurance uses phone data to measure journey length, acceleration and braking - but some say it often fails to work or wrongly records data. Tory MP Craig Tracey questioned whether it was ""fit for purpose"". Carrot said it was ""extremely sorry"" some had had a ""poor experience"". It told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme ""for the vast majority"" of young people, the app helps to reduce their premiums and to improve their driving safety. Carrot Insurance describes its Better Driver app as ""a clever bit of technology which uses 'telematics' to measure acceleration, braking, swerving, and the number and length of journeys that you make"". Users can then be rewarded for good driving. The premise is to help lower car insurance for younger people - who traditionally pay higher prices, as they are considered more at risk of an accident. Most telematics services run from a black box, which is a small device fitted to a car, that records data when it is being driven. But Carrot Insurance's Better Driver policy relies solely on GPS and Bluetooth - and requires a WiFi or data connection. More than 20 young people have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme they have had issues with the app - in some cases causing them to have their insurance cancelled, or end the policy themselves. Separate individuals have told the BBC the app had recorded them as driving while they were actually cycling or on the train. The person on the train was marked as speeding, which Carrot said ""can occur in some very rare instances when customers pair their phone to an additional Bluetooth device"". One woman, 28-year-old Jess, said Carrot cancelled her policy in December 2018 because she was not using the app - which she said was not working properly. ""In the end I lost two years no claims discount,"" she told the BBC. ""I have a new policy now but declaring the cancellation meant it cost me Â£1,600."" Carrot said it had fully compensated ""all those customers"" to which the BBC had alerted them. Layla said the app stopped working for her after it was updated Others have told the BBC their journeys had not been recorded properly by the app. Layla, 22, said after the app was updated in December, it stopped working. ""[Carrot] emailed me to say: 'If you do not connect the app to your car, your insurance will be cancelled,'"" she said. ""Then I was, 'Oh my god', panicking."" Carrot said that when the Better Driver App was updated, ""Layla began to record journeys accurately, as expected"". Georgia, a 22-year-old barista from Leicester, said she had been ""fighting with Carrot back and forth to try and make sure they didn't cancel my policy"", after the app ""started to play up"". Carrot said it was ""actively looking to resolve"" the matter with Georgia. Conservative MP Craig Tracey, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Insurance and Financial Services, said it was good that the industry had recognised the challenge young people faced to get affordable insurance. But, he said, while some technological advances had been ""really, really positive"", there was a need to ensure that regulation kept up. ""It seems like the technology [in the case of Carrot Insurance] is not working, is not fit for purpose. So it really needs to be looked at. ""There's a glitch somewhere along the line,"" he said. Craig Tracey MP said regulation needed to keep up with advances in technology He called on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to investigate. The FCA has told the BBC that for the second half of 2018, Carrot Insurance had the most complaints relative to the size of the company. Carrot Insurance said in a statement when the issue with its app ""became apparent in April 2019 we acted as quickly as possible to put things right and prevent anyone else experiencing similar problems or being disadvantaged in any way. ""We are continually developing and improving our technology to provide the best possible products and services for our customers.""
