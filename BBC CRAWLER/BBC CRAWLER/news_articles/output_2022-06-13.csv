Sturgeon to launch fresh independence campaign,"This video can not be played ""Yes"" - Nicola Sturgeon asked if she is firing the indyref2 starting gun First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to launch a fresh campaign for Scottish independence. Asked whether she was now formally beginning the campaign for indyref2, the first minister replied: ""Yes"". She also insisted she still planned to hold another vote before the end of next year. Ms Sturgeon said she would unveil the first in a series of new papers setting out the case for independence on Tuesday. She added: ""Had we known in 2014 everything we know now about the path the UK would have taken then, I've got no doubt Scotland would have voted yes back then."" The first referendum on Scottish independence took place on18 September 2014when 55% of voters said ""No"" to the change while 45% said ""Yes"". Supporters of the Union have accused the Scottish government of being obsessed with independence. The first paper on the new independence push - entitled 'Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?' - will be a ""scene setter"" which will compare Scotland and the UK to other European countries and set out why the government believes the country would be better off if it were independent. Ms Sturgeon added that subsequent papers would look at a number of areas including; currency tax and spend defence social security and pensions and EU membership and trade The first minister told the BBC: ""The conclusion very clearly is that Scotland could be doing much better as an independent country... Nobody right now can look at the UK - the mess it's in currently and its prospects for the UK outside of the European Union surely and conclude anything other than that Scotland can do better as an independent country."" She said that a bill to bring about the referendum, or a timescale for putting forward a bill, would also be set out shortly. Indyref2 campaign should start now, Alex Salmond says Government publishes indyref2 legal advice Scotland 'cranking up' towards second referendum Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that whether Holyrood had the power to legislate for a referendum was contested, and had not yet been tested in the courts. She said: ""That is the issue we are currently navigating so that we can deliver a lawful process,"" - adding that more details on those plans would come soon too. Ms Sturgeon has always said that she wants any referendum to be officially recognised, which therefore means the power to hold a fresh vote must be passed from Westminster to Holyrood (as it was to allow for the 2014 referendum - in which voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% - to take place). However, the UK government has shown no sign it would be willing to give the formal consent that ensured the legality of the 2014 referendum again. Ms Sturgeon insisted her government had a mandate to hold a further ballot, and accused the UK government of respecting neither democracy nor the rule of law. Before the 2014 vote the UK government passed powers to Holyrood to hold the referendum In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland, the first minister also defended plans to make public sector cuts. Last week, her governmentset out plans to cut tens of thousands of public sector jobs. It followed a warning from a think tank that the Scottish government will face a Â£3.5bn gap opening up between spending and income. Asked whether now was the right time to hold another vote, the first minister said the case for independence was not ""abstract"" or ""separate"" to the challenges the country faced. ""It's exactly about how we best equip ourselves to navigate those challenges so we don't have our budget set by Westminster, but we are in charge of these decisions ourselves,"" she said. ""So many of these challenges if not caused by then are absolutely exacerbated by the fact we are not independent. So yes this is the time."" In response to the new campaign for a referendum, the Scottish Conservatives' Donald Cameron said the vast majority did not want the ""distraction"" of another referendum next year. He said the public wanted 100% of the government's focus to be on Covid recovery, the cost-of-living crisis, and supporting the health service. Sarah Boyack, of Scottish Labour, said the government's attention was ""still on their constitutional obsession"". She said it was an ""appalling waste of time, energy and money"" and that independence would ""make Brexit look like a walk in the park"". Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the Scottish government cared ""more about their independence obsession than everyone stuck on the longest NHS waiting lists in history, the cost of living crisis or the climate emergency. ""Nobody believes education is Nicola Sturgeon's top priority any more. Nicola Sturgeon has a Holyrood majority for indyref2 when all the SNP and Green votes are added together. What she does not have is the undisputed power to hold a referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. That was secured in 2014 through an agreement with the UK government which lent Holyrood the power to put a referendum beyond legal challenge. This time that will almost certainly not be forthcoming and if Holyrood legislates anyway, the bill is likely to be challenged in the UK Supreme Court. I don't expect the bill or even a timetable for it to emerge this week. The paper being published on Tuesday is likely to set out big picture arguments for independence rather than a process designed to break the deadlock over holding a referendum.

NHS staff completely knackered - health secretary,"A member of staff at University Hospital Monklands attends to a Covid patient on the ICU ward earlier this year NHS and social care staff are ""completely knackered"" due to the pressures of dealing with the fall-out from the pandemic, Scotland's health secretary has acknowledged. Humza Yousaf said the after-effects of Covid were being felt most acutely in accident and emergency departments. One junior doctor described the situation as ""frankly dangerous"". Thelatest figures,externalshow 9,417 patients spent more than eight hours in A&E in April. The Scottish government has a target of dealing with 95% of patients who come to an emergency department within four hours. But in April just 72.1% of patients were admitted, transferred or discharged within that timeframe. In Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, it was just 46%. Can video calls ease the pressure on Scotland's A&Es? Record numbers facing long waits at A&E in Scotland Hundreds dying due to A&E delays, doctors say Mr Yousaf told BBC Radio'sGood Morning ScotlandCovid has caused the biggest shock to the NHS in its history. The health service was put on an emergency footing amid an increase in Covid cases, with routing operations and cancer screenings cancelled. It also led to fewer people going to A&E. The health secretary said: ""The cumulative impact of that, while we are still of course dealing with this virus, is undoubtedly causing real strain, real pressure, real challenge, right across the health and social care system and felt really acutely in our A&E departments."" Mr Yousaf suggested clinicians were facing problems due to factors such as ""sicker"" patients attending A&E after having stayed away for longer than usually expected. He said issues in social care, such as delayed discharges from hospitals, can also be attributed to the challenges presented by the pandemic, adding that this number is ""far higher"" than he would want them to be. More than 53,000 days were spent in hospital by people whose discharge was delayed in April 2022 - a64% increase on April 2021,external. Mr Yousaf added: ""But also because people are maybe not able to get the Care at Home packages they desperately need, they're ending up with those slips, trips and falls - particularly the elderly - and back in the front door again. ""So it is a really difficult cycle, given the whole system is completely interconnected, hence why the interventions and the investment that we are making is in every part of the system."" He went on to acknowledge the strain staff were under. He added: ""I can understand entirely where doctors, nurses and everybody who works in health and social care are completely knackered and that's why we will continue to put investment into wellbeing and ensure they have access to some of those wellbeing initiatives."" The health secretary also said he was ""concerned but not panicked"" by therise in Covid infectionsin Scotland. Dr Lailah Peel, who chairs the British Medical Association's Scottish Junior Doctors Committee, is concerned the pressures on the NHS will only get worse. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""It is just frankly dangerous right now. ""If you look at the statistics for last month, one in 11 patients were waiting more than eight hours and evidence has shown that, for every 82 patients that are waiting more than eight hours in our A&E departments, there's one excess death. ""So that means about 114 patients in Scotland potentially died that should not have done."" Dr Peel added the problem was not just in A&E but said it was where ""the cracks in the system are showing"" as it was the one 24/7 service. She described the system as ""totally broken"" and said more acute hospital beds and staff were needed to address the pressures. Meanwhile, Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie accused Mr Yousaf of being ""in complete denial"". She said: ""NHS workers have not just been left exhausted by the pandemic, but by years of mismanagement under the SNP. ""Staff are still working tirelessly to paper over the cracks caused by SNP incompetence. ""Humza Yousaf needs to stop commenting on the problem and start fixing it by addressing the disastrous workforce crisis his government created."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the current situation was ""the result of years of botched workforce planning"". He added: ""The NHS is overwhelmed and people are dying as a consequence. ""The SNP/Green Government was wrong to vote down my call for a burnout prevention strategy to protect staff and it's wrong to oppose an urgent inquiry into the avoidable deaths linked to the emergency care crisis."" Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Dr Sandesh Gulhane MSP, said: ""NHS staff have been working under extreme stress for more than two years now. ""The Health Secretary's belated attempts to get on top of the situation will be seen as too little, too late, by the doctors and nurses who are on the edge of burnout. ""All the while, patients will continue to suffer and die needlessly until Humza Yousaf addresses the long-term, systemic problems in our NHS that have grown up under the SNP.""

Police deny bodies found in Amazon search,"Bruno Pereira (l) and Dom Phillips (r) pictured in 2018 Brazilian police have denied reports that bodies were discovered in the Amazon belonging to a journalist and an indigenous expert. Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira went missing on 5 June. Mr Phillips' brother-in-law told the BBC that the Brazilian embassy in the UK had informed the family that two bodies were found tied to a tree. Police say they have only found some of their belongings and ""biological material"" which is still being tested. The region's indigenous association Univaja, which first alerted authorities that the pair was missing, told the BBC that no bodies had been found. Speaking to the BBC, Dom Phillips' brother-in-law Paul Sherwood said he received a call on Monday morning from a liaison officer at the Brazilian embassy. Mr Sherwood was told, in clear English, that two bodies had been found and the embassy was letting the family know before the press found out. There was no misunderstanding, the brother-in-law said. The news was reported by local and international media, citing family members of Mr Phillips. But Brazil's federal police quickly released a statement saying that no bodies had been found, telling the BBC that there had been a miscommunication. Pair missing in the Amazon: 'A tragedy foretold' Local groups say both men had received threats for their work supporting indigenous rights in the region, where they were travelling by boat on a reporting trip. Both Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira were known for their deep knowledge of the region. Mr Phillips had been living in Brazil for more than a decade and was a long-time contributor to the Guardian newspaper - he was in the area researching a book. Mr Pereira, who was on leave from his post with the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, was an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon. Days before the pair went missing indigenous groups say Mr Pereira was threatened for campaigning against illegal fishing in the area. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Phillips' sister, Sian, said: ""I think it's likely they've been ambushed by some illegal criminal activity there, possibly to do with illegal fishing."" It is an ""incredibly distressing and awful situation"", she added. The region where they disappeared is home to around 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups. As well as clashes with fishermen catching protected stock, it has also seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug traffickers who smuggle cocaine from neighbouring Peru. Alarm over the men's disappearance was initially sounded by two indigenous rights groups, who said the pair had been travelling by boat in the Javari Valley to interview members of an indigenous group. The area is located in the west of Amazonas state, near the border with Peru.

The wedding took place at the Teasses Estate in Ceres, Fife, on Saturday,The Courier newspaper reported,external. The couple began dating in 2017, when Ms Dugdale was Scottish Labour leader and Ms Gilruth was a backbench SNP MSP. In a statement they said: ""This was a wonderfully happy day for us, and we were blessed to share it with family and friends."" Congratulations flooded in for the couple on Twitter on Monday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote ""Many congratulations to Jenny and Kez"", while Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was ""lovely news"", and wished them his warmest congratulations. Former SNP MSP Mike Russell, who was constitution secretary, said: ""It was a wonderful day - congratulations again and every good wish for your future happiness."" Ms Dugdale was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017 but stepped down as an MSP in 2019 to take up a post as director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service at Glasgow University.

LiveLiveHuman cost of eastern city battle 'terrifying' - Zelensky1 minute ago,"The human cost of the battle for the city of Severodonetsk is very high and simply terrifying, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says All three bridges to the embattled eastern Donbas city have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai A pro-Russian separatist leader says Ukrainian troops there must ""surrender or die"" because ""there is no other option"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has warned that the war in Ukraine risks plunging millions into food poverty across the globe This comes as a senior Ukrainian official says the country's grain harvest is likely to drop by almost half this year, following the invasion Up to 1,200 bodies found across Ukraine, including some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, the head of the national police says Edited by Claire Heald A resident walks between apartment blocks in Bakhmut, Ukraine We're pausing our live coverage shortly. Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk.

In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Police deny bodies found in Amazon searchBritish journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira went missing in Brazil on 5 June.Latin America & Caribbean,"Bruno Pereira (l) and Dom Phillips (r) pictured in 2018 Brazilian police have denied reports that bodies were discovered in the Amazon belonging to a journalist and an indigenous expert. Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira went missing on 5 June. Mr Phillips' brother-in-law told the BBC that the Brazilian embassy in the UK had informed the family that two bodies were found tied to a tree. Police say they have only found some of their belongings and ""biological material"" which is still being tested. The region's indigenous association Univaja, which first alerted authorities that the pair was missing, told the BBC that no bodies had been found. Speaking to the BBC, Dom Phillips' brother-in-law Paul Sherwood said he received a call on Monday morning from a liaison officer at the Brazilian embassy. Mr Sherwood was told, in clear English, that two bodies had been found and the embassy was letting the family know before the press found out. There was no misunderstanding, the brother-in-law said. The news was reported by local and international media, citing family members of Mr Phillips. But Brazil's federal police quickly released a statement saying that no bodies had been found, telling the BBC that there had been a miscommunication. Pair missing in the Amazon: 'A tragedy foretold' Local groups say both men had received threats for their work supporting indigenous rights in the region, where they were travelling by boat on a reporting trip. Both Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira were known for their deep knowledge of the region. Mr Phillips had been living in Brazil for more than a decade and was a long-time contributor to the Guardian newspaper - he was in the area researching a book. Mr Pereira, who was on leave from his post with the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, was an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon. Days before the pair went missing indigenous groups say Mr Pereira was threatened for campaigning against illegal fishing in the area. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Phillips' sister, Sian, said: ""I think it's likely they've been ambushed by some illegal criminal activity there, possibly to do with illegal fishing."" It is an ""incredibly distressing and awful situation"", she added. The region where they disappeared is home to around 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups. As well as clashes with fishermen catching protected stock, it has also seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug traffickers who smuggle cocaine from neighbouring Peru. Alarm over the men's disappearance was initially sounded by two indigenous rights groups, who said the pair had been travelling by boat in the Javari Valley to interview members of an indigenous group. The area is located in the west of Amazonas state, near the border with Peru.

Pope tells missionaries to talk to abuse survivors,"The group of abuse survivors group outside the Vatican before the Papal meeting A victim of child sexual abuse at a priest training school has said meeting the Pope was a ""healing"" experience. Mark Murray was among eight abuse survivors granted a private meeting with Pope Francis on Monday. They said the Pope now intends to ask the order that ran St Peter Claver College in west Yorkshire in the 1960s and 70s to engage with the group. Mr Murray, from St Asaph, Denbighshire, said he came away from the Vatican meeting with renewed hope. He endured repeated abuse by a priest at the former junior seminary between 1969, when he joined aged 13, and 1974. Mr Murray, now 66, had said before the meeting that he just wanted the Pope to listen. Afterwards he added: ""It was such a healing and transformative meeting. ""He was extremely attentive to what we were saying. ""I come away with hope; hope that things can carry on changing in the church and that safeguarding can carry on changing."" Mark Murray was one of 11 men who settled out of court for alleged abuse in the 1960s and 70s Mr Murray was one of 11 former trainee priestswho shared a Â£120,000 settlement from The Verona Fathers, a Roman Catholic mission now known as Comboni Missionaries, over abuse suffered in the 1960s and 70s. The men have also received anapology from the Bishop of Leeds, but have now shared their testimonies with Pope Francis after the body responsible for dealing with child sexual abuse in the Church helped set up the meeting. They came 5,000 miles - to ask Pope to say sorry Cardinal 'protected Church ahead of victims' Priest's 'harasser' will not face trial ""I don't think we could have expected a better outcome,"" said Bede Mullen, of the Comboni Survivors Group. ""He [the Pope] said he's immediately going to ring the superior general of the Comboni Missionaries personally and get him to engage with the survivors' group."" Pope Francis heard testimonies from seven victims of sexual abuse at a Catholic church priest training school Among the stories the pope listened to was that of father-of-two Mr Murray. He said he couldn't talk about his ordeal for more than 20 years before he began civil action in 1995 to fight for an acknowledgment of what happened to him from the order which ran the seminary. Ahead of the meeting he said: ""I don't want an apology. A forced apology isn't a true one. I want them to listen. ""My statement will come from a more personal aspect - what their treatment has done to me as a person and to my family. ""I dealt with the abuse I suffered as a child through years of psychotherapy. It's much harder to deal with the response of some of the institutions towards me."" Bede Mullen (left) and Mark Murray (right) were two boys abused at St Peter Claver College ""Where I'm coming from is the impact of the Combonis having no engagement with us."" Mr Murray added. ""They know what happened - but there's never been an admission that abuse took place. ""This should've been sorted decades ago. If the Comboni Order had listened with their hearts in 1995 this could have been sorted,"" he said. ""We didn't want what happened to us happening to other people, so you push for a meeting with the highest person in the Catholic Church."" The abuse took place in the 1960s and 70s before St Peter Claver College in Mirfield was shut in 1984 Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales whose leadership has been criticised in the child sexual abuse scandal, also attended Monday's meeting with the Pope. The Bishop of Leeds, Marcus Stock, in whose diocese the college in Mirfield was situated, will also be at the meeting after he offered the victims a ""heartfelt and unreserved apology"" last year. The Right Reverend Stock said sorry for the ""pain and trauma experienced when you were students at Mirfield and for the spiritual suffering and emotional distress which continues to affect you to this day"". Members of the Comboni Survivors' Group say they still want justice from the Order. The congregation, now known as the Comboni Missionaries, was founded in 1867 by Daniele Comboni and is a Catholic clerical male religious group. The Bishop of Leeds said the Pope was aware the men had not had an ""adequate pastoral response"" from the leadership of the Comboni Order They have ""publicly apologised for any abuse suffered by former seminarians"" and acknowledge the harm caused by child abuse. ""It was with great sadness and regret that we learned about the allegations of non-recent abuse relating to our former junior seminary which closed in 1984,"" said a Comboni Missionaries spokesperson. ""We have worked hard to respond with seriousness and sensitivity to the complaints and claims made, have fully supported and cooperated with the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse - and are working with a respected specialist charity to provide counselling and facilitate meetings."" The Catholic Safeguarding Standards Agency (CSSA) has said they will do ""everything in their power"" to help with ""any issue of Church-related abuse and suffering"". ""We are acutely aware of the survivors' concerns and we are actively engaged with them and with representatives of the Order to bring them together to address these concerns,"" said CSSA chairman Nazir Afzal.

LiveLiveHuman cost of eastern city battle 'terrifying' - Zelensky5 minutes ago,"The human cost of the battle for the city of Severodonetsk is very high and simply terrifying, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says All three bridges to the embattled eastern Donbas city have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai A pro-Russian separatist leader says Ukrainian troops there must ""surrender or die"" because ""there is no other option"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has warned that the war in Ukraine risks plunging millions into food poverty across the globe This comes as a senior Ukrainian official says the country's grain harvest is likely to drop by almost half this year, following the invasion Up to 1,200 bodies found across Ukraine, including some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, the head of the national police says Edited by Claire Heald A resident walks between apartment blocks in Bakhmut, Ukraine We're pausing our live coverage shortly. Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk. Maksym Katerin stands in the yard of his damaged house today, after his mother and his step-father were killed in shelling A man tries to put out a fire with a bucket of water after a bombardment destroyed the home next door on Friday A man and two boys cycle in an empty street in the city on Friday. In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe.

""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded.

Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite,"Fears over the prospects for the UK economy have grown after it shrank again in April, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices. The economy contracted by 0.3% in April after it shrank by 0.1% in March,the Office for National Statistics said.,external April's figure was weaker than expected, and it was the first time the economy has contracted for two months in a row since Covid struck. Some analysts have warned the UK risks falling into a recession. Both households and businesses have been hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. The cost of filling up an average family car with petrol recently hit Â£100, and there have been signs that people are cutting back spending as costs rise. The Bank of Englandhas warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"", and has forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Warning UK to see slowest growth of developed nations April was the first time all main sectors of the economy - services, manufacturing and production - had shrunk since January 2021. The ONS said the main driver of April's contraction was in the services sector, due to the winding down of the NHS's Covid Test and Trace operation. It also said some businesses were continuing to struggle with the impact of price increases and supply chain shortages. JJ Foodservice, a wholesale food and catering company, supplies food products and ingredients from restaurants and takeaways to schools and private customers. Kaan Hendekli, the firm's Head of Operations, told the BBC energy prices and skill shortages were hurting the businesses, but said the price of fuel was having the biggest impact because ""it affects everything"". ""Every product essentially hits a lorry - whether we deliver or we receive it from suppliers or our suppliers receive it from the manufactures,"" he said. Kaan Hendekli, is JJ Foodservice's Head of Operations Mr Hendekli said the business was trying to be ""creative"" to reduce its outgoings, which included offering its customers good deals for collections and ordering in advance, as well as selling its own brand ingredients. ""Nobody wants to increase their prices but we've got no choice but to increase at the moment,"" he added. ""We are trying to find our own ways [to manage the situation]."" Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said the UK looked ""at increased risk of a technical recession"", which is defined as the economy contracting for two consecutive three-month periods. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, said the business group was ""expecting the economy to be pretty much stagnant"". ""It won't take much to tip us into a recession, and even if we don't, it will feel like one for too many people,"" he added. ""Times are tough for businesses dealing with rising costs, and for people on lower incomes concerned about paying bills and putting food on the table."" But Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a recession ""remains unlikely"", due tothe government's recently announcement support package, which includes a Â£400 energy bill discount for all UK households. Responding to the latest GDP figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not immune from global economic shocks, but added the government was ""fully focussed on growing the economy to address the cost of living in the longer term, while supporting families and businesses with the immediate pressures they're facing"". Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the figures were ""extremely worrying"" and would ""add to growing concern about abysmal growth and plummeting living standards under the Conservatives"". The fall in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in April was worse than expectations, but given the circumstances, can come as no surprise. This was the month of the record 54% hike in domestic energy bills, continued pressure at the pumps, the National Insurance hikes, and ongoing uncertainty from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Government sources pointed to the fact that the economy would have just about grown were it not for the one off effect of the winding down of pandemic test and trace services. However, by that logic, a number of previous GDP figures were also flattered by such figures. There have been three months on the trot now of zero growth. Only in January has the UK economy grown this year. While May should break that pattern, the chances are that the economy is contracting over this quarter. Current forecasts suggest this should not be the start of a technical recession, especially given the support to household incomes from the energy package last month, but that risk certainly hangs over the economy. Though the jobs figures continue to impress, interest rates and inflation continue to rise. The risk of a UK-EU trade war is now material, which could push up inflation more and risk investment. And there are further pressures on tax and spend from businesses calling for tax cuts, to public sector workers seeking pay rises matching double-digit inflation. The ONS said there were ""some common themes"" being reported by firms that were having a negative impact across different industries. It said many firms reported how the soaring costs of petrol and diesel meant they had to pay more for materials or ""had to raise the price of the products they sold"". ""Other respondents also reported that large increases in utility bills, particularly for gas and electricity, had affected them,"" the ONS said. Elsewhere, other firms reported price rises to other inputs such as animal feed, chemicals, aluminium, steel, cooking oil and fertiliser, while some respondents said they had ""difficulties"" in sourcing machinery, electronic components, kitchen appliances, and wire harnesses for cars.

Russia earns $97bn on fuel exports since invasion,"Russia earned nearly $100bn (Â£82.3bn) from oil and gas exports during the first 100 days of the war in Ukraine, according to a report. Revenues have been falling since March, as many countries shunned Russian supplies, but remain high, the independent Centre For Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) found. It also warned of potential loopholes in efforts to curb imports from Russia. The EU, US and UK are among those to have pledged to cut Russian imports. But the CREA report found,externalRussia still earned $97bn in revenue from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days of the Ukraine conflict, from 24 February to 3 June. The European Union made up 61% of these imports, worth approximately $59bn. Overall, exports of Russian oil and gas are falling and Moscow's revenue from energy sales has also declined from a peak of well over $1bn a day in March. But revenues still exceeded the cost of the Ukraine war during the first 100 days - with the CREA estimating that Russia is spending around $876m per day on the invasion. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Putin: West unlikely to reject our energy for years The EU plans to ban Russian oil imports arriving by sea by the end of 2022, which would cut imports by two-thirds. In March, the bloc alsocommitted to reducing gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. However, so far it has been unable to agree on an outright ban. Meanwhile, the US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. The CREA report said the EU's planned oil embargo would have a significant impact. But it warned large quantities of Russian crude oil were now being shipped to India, which increased its share of Russia's total crude exports from around 1% before the invasion of Ukraine to 18% in May. The report said a ""significant share"" of this was being refined and sold on - often to customers in the US and Europe - which it described as ""an important loophole to close"". It added that strong sanctions against tankers transporting Russian crude would significantly limit the scope for this practice. The report points out that as Russia seeks new markets for oil, much of it is being transported by ship - and the majority of the vessels used are owned by European and US companies. As well as India, other countries that increased imports of Russian fuel included France, China, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the report said. On the face of it, this report contains a lot of bad news. Energy sales are still in effect funding the war in Ukraine, with high prices offsetting efforts to reduce demand. But that doesn't mean pressure on Moscow won't tell in the end. The report's authors expect a partial EU embargo on Russian oil to cut revenues by some $36bn a year, for example. Exports of gas have already fallen dramatically - and there are plans to reduce Europe's reliance on Russia still further. Yet embargoes have to be effective. The report points out that more and more Russian oil is being exported to India for refining. And some of those refined products are finding their way back onto European markets. Since refined products are not covered by the EU ban, this is a clear potential loophole. And with Russian oil being diverted from pipelines and onto ships as Moscow seeks new markets, there is growing demand for vessels to carry it. But the majority of the oil tankers currently being used are owned by European companies. For pressure on Russia to be most effective, issues like these will have to be addressed.

Sturgeon to launch fresh independence campaignScotland's first minister says she still plans to hold a referendum by the end of next year.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played ""Yes"" - Nicola Sturgeon asked if she is firing the indyref2 starting gun First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to launch a fresh campaign for Scottish independence. Asked whether she was now formally beginning the campaign for indyref2, the first minister replied: ""Yes"". She also insisted she still planned to hold another vote before the end of next year. Ms Sturgeon said she would unveil the first in a series of new papers setting out the case for independence on Tuesday. She added: ""Had we known in 2014 everything we know now about the path the UK would have taken then, I've got no doubt Scotland would have voted yes back then."" The first referendum on Scottish independence took place on18 September 2014when 55% of voters said ""No"" to the change while 45% said ""Yes"". Supporters of the Union have accused the Scottish government of being obsessed with independence. The first paper on the new independence push - entitled 'Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?' - will be a ""scene setter"" which will compare Scotland and the UK to other European countries and set out why the government believes the country would be better off if it were independent. Ms Sturgeon added that subsequent papers would look at a number of areas including; currency tax and spend defence social security and pensions and EU membership and trade The first minister told the BBC: ""The conclusion very clearly is that Scotland could be doing much better as an independent country... Nobody right now can look at the UK - the mess it's in currently and its prospects for the UK outside of the European Union surely and conclude anything other than that Scotland can do better as an independent country."" She said that a bill to bring about the referendum, or a timescale for putting forward a bill, would also be set out shortly. Indyref2 campaign should start now, Alex Salmond says Government publishes indyref2 legal advice Scotland 'cranking up' towards second referendum Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that whether Holyrood had the power to legislate for a referendum was contested, and had not yet been tested in the courts. She said: ""That is the issue we are currently navigating so that we can deliver a lawful process,"" - adding that more details on those plans would come soon too. Ms Sturgeon has always said that she wants any referendum to be officially recognised, which therefore means the power to hold a fresh vote must be passed from Westminster to Holyrood (as it was to allow for the 2014 referendum - in which voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% - to take place). However, the UK government has shown no sign it would be willing to give the formal consent that ensured the legality of the 2014 referendum again. Ms Sturgeon insisted her government had a mandate to hold a further ballot, and accused the UK government of respecting neither democracy nor the rule of law. Before the 2014 vote the UK government passed powers to Holyrood to hold the referendum In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland, the first minister also defended plans to make public sector cuts. Last week, her governmentset out plans to cut tens of thousands of public sector jobs. It followed a warning from a think tank that the Scottish government will face a Â£3.5bn gap opening up between spending and income. Asked whether now was the right time to hold another vote, the first minister said the case for independence was not ""abstract"" or ""separate"" to the challenges the country faced. ""It's exactly about how we best equip ourselves to navigate those challenges so we don't have our budget set by Westminster, but we are in charge of these decisions ourselves,"" she said. ""So many of these challenges if not caused by then are absolutely exacerbated by the fact we are not independent. So yes this is the time."" In response to the new campaign for a referendum, the Scottish Conservatives' Donald Cameron said the vast majority did not want the ""distraction"" of another referendum next year. He said the public wanted 100% of the government's focus to be on Covid recovery, the cost-of-living crisis, and supporting the health service. Sarah Boyack, of Scottish Labour, said the government's attention was ""still on their constitutional obsession"". She said it was an ""appalling waste of time, energy and money"" and that independence would ""make Brexit look like a walk in the park"". Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the Scottish government cared ""more about their independence obsession than everyone stuck on the longest NHS waiting lists in history, the cost of living crisis or the climate emergency. ""Nobody believes education is Nicola Sturgeon's top priority any more. Nicola Sturgeon has a Holyrood majority for indyref2 when all the SNP and Green votes are added together. What she does not have is the undisputed power to hold a referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. That was secured in 2014 through an agreement with the UK government which lent Holyrood the power to put a referendum beyond legal challenge. This time that will almost certainly not be forthcoming and if Holyrood legislates anyway, the bill is likely to be challenged in the UK Supreme Court. I don't expect the bill or even a timetable for it to emerge this week. The paper being published on Tuesday is likely to set out big picture arguments for independence rather than a process designed to break the deadlock over holding a referendum.

Man 'murdered wife and hid body in septic tank',"David Venables denies murdering his wife between 2 May and 5 May 1982 A retired pig farmer ""got away with murder"" after dumping his wife's body in a septic tank while having a long-standing affair, a jury has heard. David Venables denies murdering wife Brenda, 48, who disappeared in 1982. In July 2019, her remains were found in a septic tank at what had been their shared home in Kempsey, Worcestershire. Opening the case, prosecutor Michael Burrows QC said Mr Venables, now aged 89, had been in a relationship with his mother's former carer. The Crown alleges Mr Venables, then 49, killed his wife and dumped her body in the septic tank in the grounds of remote Quaking House Farm, off Bestmans Lane, where the couple had lived since 1961. Mr Burrows said: ""He wanted her out of the way; he wanted to resume his long-standing affair with another woman. ""He knew about the septic tank in its secluded location. ""It was for him almost the perfect hiding place. ""And for nearly 40 years, it was the perfect place and he got away with murder."" Brenda Venables was reported missing by her husband in May 1982 The jury heard Mr Venables' affair with carer Lorraine Styles started around 1967 and continued on and off. They had rekindled the relationship in the months before Mrs Venables vanished, Mr Burrows added. He said Mr Venables had reported his wife missing at Worcester police station on 4 May 1982 and told officers his wife, who had been depressed, had not been in the house when he woke that morning. A police investigation failed to find any trace of Mrs Venables, he added, and ""some people thought"" she had died by suicide. By 2019, Mr Venables had sold the farm to his nephew and in July that year contractors clearing out the septic tank found bones, including a human skull, which DNA testing found were the remains of Mrs Venables. Mr Burrows said it was ""beyond belief"" to suppose she had taken her own life by climbing into the septic tank. The trial of Mr Venables, of Elgar Drive, Kempsey, continues.

Starmer investigated by standards watchdog,"Parliament's standards commissioner is investigating whether Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer broke the rules by being late in registering earnings and gifts. MPs must declare within 28 days any interest which might be reasonably considered to influence their actions. Sir Keir appears to have missed this deadline on several occasions, including over Arsenal FC tickets and a payment made for writing a book. He said: ""I am confident there is no problem here."" Gifts and payments received by MPs are regularly published fortnightly in theRegister of Members' Financial Interests.,external Standards commissioner Kathryn Stone is believed to be looking into tickets received by Sir Keir for football matches involving Arsenal - whom the Labour leader supports - against Crystal Palace and Watford, worth Â£720 and Â£1,416 respectively. These were declared more than 28 days late, as was an Â£18,450 advance payment from publisher Harper Collins for a book outlining his early life and plans for governing the UK, and making""a fierce argument,externalfor the vital role of respect and integrity in political life"". The fee for this work is being donated to charity. Sir Keir also received an oil painting worth Â£1,500 from a donor called Tim Benson on 23 November last year, which was registered on 20 December. Food delivery firm Just Eat also gifted him tickets to the British Kebab Awards and Taste of London event, passed on to the Labour leader's staff, which were declared more than 28 days after they were received. A spokesperson for the Labour leader said: ""Keir Starmer takes his declaration responsibilities very seriously and has already apologised for the fact that administrative errors in his office have led to a small number of late declarations. ""The standards commissioner has asked for more information which we are happy to provide.""

Police deny bodies found of missing Amazon pair,"Bruno Pereira (l) and Dom Phillips (r) pictured in 2018 Brazilian police have denied reports that bodies were discovered in the Amazon belonging to a journalist and an indigenous expert. Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira went missing on 5 June. Mr Phillips' brother-in-law told the BBC that the Brazilian embassy in the UK had informed the family that two bodies were found tied to a tree. Police say they have only found some of their belongings and ""biological material"" which is still being tested. The region's indigenous association Univaja, which first alerted authorities that the pair was missing, told the BBC that no bodies had been found. Speaking to the BBC, Dom Phillips' brother-in-law Paul Sherwood said he received a call on Monday morning from a liaison officer at the Brazilian embassy. Mr Sherwood was told, in clear English, that two bodies had been found and the embassy was letting the family know before the press found out. There was no misunderstanding, the brother-in-law said. The news was reported by local and international media, citing family members of Mr Phillips. But Brazil's federal police quickly released a statement saying that no bodies had been found, telling the BBC that there had been a miscommunication. Pair missing in the Amazon: 'A tragedy foretold' Local groups say both men had received threats for their work supporting indigenous rights in the region, where they were travelling by boat on a reporting trip. Both Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira were known for their deep knowledge of the region. Mr Phillips had been living in Brazil for more than a decade and was a long-time contributor to the Guardian newspaper - he was in the area researching a book. Mr Pereira, who was on leave from his post with the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, was an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon. Days before the pair went missing indigenous groups say Mr Pereira was threatened for campaigning against illegal fishing in the area. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Phillips' sister, Sian, said: ""I think it's likely they've been ambushed by some illegal criminal activity there, possibly to do with illegal fishing."" It is an ""incredibly distressing and awful situation"", she added. The region where they disappeared is home to around 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups. As well as clashes with fishermen catching protected stock, it has also seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug traffickers who smuggle cocaine from neighbouring Peru. Alarm over the men's disappearance was initially sounded by two indigenous rights groups, who said the pair had been travelling by boat in the Javari Valley to interview members of an indigenous group. The area is located in the west of Amazonas state, near the border with Peru.

PM to unveil plans to scrap parts of EU Brexit deal,"This video can not be played The PM says the protocol is ""upsetting the balance of the Belfast Good Friday Agreementâ ahead of changes to be announced Boris Johnson will later publish plans to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal he struck with the EU in 2020. The PM wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to move between Britain and Northern Ireland. But the EU is against the move, saying it would break international law. The UK insists its proposals -to be set out in a parliamentary bill- are legal and will secure the future of the United Kingdom. The two sides agreed the protocol as they strived to maintain peace in Ireland - including the open Irish border - following Brexit. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Fifty two members of the 90 strong Northern Ireland Assembly, including those from Sinn FÃ©in, the Alliance and the SDLP, have written to the prime minister to say they ""reject in the strongest possible terms your government's reckless new protocol legislation"". No unionist assembly members signed the letter. Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin has called for negotiations between the UK and EU to deal with the impasse. He described the UK government's decision to change the protocol as a ""low point"", which was ""very regrettable"". The Republic of Ireland is still part of the EU's single market for goods and services, which the UK has left. Rather than impose a hard border - involving checks on goods and people moving between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic - the protocol introduces checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which won the second-most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly elections, argues this creates a divide that could lead to the break-up of the UK. It is refusing to set up a new ruling Northern Ireland executive with Sinn FÃ©in, which won most seats in the elections and accepts the protocol, until changes are made to the wording. There's been a long build up to this legislation which will, this week, generate a lot of noise. The EU won't ""sit by and watch the UK tear up a treaty"", warned one Brussels diplomat. The European Commission is expected to relaunch legal action against the UK, which was previously paused, once it's had a chance to analyse the bill. That's seen as a first step or ""low-hanging fruit"". But the commission is also likely, before long, to outline further ""flexibilities"" around its own proposals for easing checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. It won't be anything like the more fundamental rewriting of the treaty that the UK's calling for but officials on both sides have signalled that they don't see today's legislation as ending any prospect of further talks. In fact, some in Brussels view this bill, that's further exposed splits in a fractious Tory party, as a clumsy UK negotiating tactic. There's speculation too that Liz Truss is trying to burnish her leadership credentials with some Conservative Brexit supporters. But allies of the foreign secretary insist that, behind this potential law, there is a far simpler logic; if the EU won't renegotiate a treaty that is causing huge problems in Northern Ireland, then the UK government is obliged to act. Putting questions around blame and motives aside, one clear outcome of today looks set to be a further deterioration in post-Brexit relations between the UK and the EU. The UK government, despite signing up to the agreement in January 2020, has also raised concerns, prompting the publication of its bill later on Monday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she wanted to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol and restore political stability"", adding that Brussels must be ""willing to change"". But European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ tweeted that the UK's actions were ""damaging to mutual trust and a formula for uncertainty"". The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have experienced difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity. Food and horticulture importers have faced the greatest problems, as those goods face the most onerous controls. However, exporters, including food exporters, have benefited because unlike other parts of the UK they have maintained frictionless access to EU markets. The bill published later is expected to aim to remove checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain that are destined to remain there rather than enter the Irish Republic. Under the plans, businesses in Northern Ireland would be able to chose between sticking to either EU or UK standards, as well as UK VAT and state aid rules applying in Northern Ireland. It is also expected there would be a more limited role for the European Court of Justice. NI Protocol bill 'won't break international law' What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Arron Banks loses libel case against Cadwalladr,"Brexit supporter Arron Banks tried to sue the freelance journalist Carole Cadwalladr for libel Brexit campaigner Arron Banks has lost his libel case against investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Mr Banks, the founder of the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU, sued Ms Cadwalladr for defamation over two instances in 2019 - one in a TED Talk video and another in a tweet. Mr Banks claimed he was defamed after comments Ms Cadwalladr made about his relationship with the Russian state. Thejudgement from the High Court,externalfollows a five-day hearing in January. The case, which has been going on for nearly three years, centred on comments Ms Cadwalladr made in a TED talk which has been viewed more than five million times since it was broadcast online in April 2019. In the talk, she said: ""And I am not even going to get into the lies that Arron Banks has told about his covert relationship with the Russian government."" According to the judgement from Mrs Justice Steyn: The single meaning of Ms Cadwalladr's words was that: ""On more than one occasion Mr Banks told untruths about a secret relationship he had with the Russian government in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding"" Ms Cadwalladr said she did not intend to make that allegation, and accepts it was untrue After initially putting forward a truth defence, Ms Cadwalladr withdrew that defence She then used a public interest defence to justify her statements and Ms Cadwalladr established that ""her belief that publishing the TED talk was in the public interest was reasonable"" The court found that talk ""had caused serious harm to his [Banks's] reputation"" But Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""I accept the TED talk was political expression of high importance, and great public interest (in the strictest sense), not only in this country but worldwide"" The tweet, which Mr Banks also complained about, had not caused ""serious harm"" to his reputation The judge said if she had found the tweet had caused ""serious harm"" to Mr Banks' reputation she would have concluded Ms Cadwalladr's belief that the tweet was in the public interest was also reasonable. A public interest defence allows a defendant to justify themselves based on the reason that the information was in the public interest. ""I am so profoundly grateful and relieved,"" said Ms Cadwalladr, who first reported the Cambridge Analytica data scandal where harvested data was used during elections. Writing on Twitter after the judgement, she thanked her legal team and the 29,000 people who contributed to her legal defence fund, saying: ""I literally couldn't have done it without you."" She said the last three years had been ""extraordinarily difficult"" and hoped no other journalists had to go through this ""crushing, debilitating, all-consuming experience"". Mr Banks congratulated the investigative journalist on winning, but said he would ""likely"" appeal against the court judgement. ""It leaves open for the journalist the excuse that she thought what she said was correct even though she had no facts,"" he posted on Twitter. The High Court judgement ""is an important vindication"" for Ms Cadwalladr, said the journalist's legal team. Keith Mathieson from law firm RPC, which represented Ms Cadwalladr, said the judgement supports the public interest defence and the ""protection it offers journalists, bloggers and others to contribute to public debate on serious issues"". Rebecca Vincent, from the press freedom campaign group, Reporters without Borders, described it as a victory for journalism. It was not just Ms Cadwalladr's reputation at ""stake"", but also the ""ability of the press to report freely on such issues"". ""If Arron Banks had won today that would have a very different impact on the UK's press freedom climate so we're very pleased that it's gone the way that it has,"" she told the BBC. One of the questions raised in this case is why, amidst all the thousands of articles and broadcasts about Brexit, Arron Banks and Russia, did a few sentences in a TED talk and a tweet lead to a libel trial? Carole Cadwalladr clearly felt this was a personal assault on her. The word SLAPP was raised during the trial.  A SLAPP is a ""strategic lawsuit against public participation"" and is a phrase to describe the way in which the wealthy and powerful can threaten critics with often frivolous lawsuits that they cannot afford to contest. This was certainly a personal battle between Mr Banks and Ms Cadwalladr. She had spent years investigating and reporting on the alleged links between the Brexit campaign and Russia. Defending this lawsuit was, she says, ""crushing"" and ""debilitating"". Normally journalists have the financial and legal support of a newspaper or a broadcaster. Ms Cadwalladr had to rely on 29,000 people who contributed to her legal defence fund. However, the judge did not consider this to be a SLAPP saying this case was ""legitimate"" and ""it is neither fair nor apt to describe this as a SLAPP suit"". Nevertheless, it is worth noting the toll such a case can take on an individual. Ms Cadwalladr has written about its effect on her over the last three years and the cost of defending herself. Individuals can, in the age of social media, reach huge audiences but it has its risks.

What is the Rwanda asylum plan?,"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

Food strategy criticised by government's own adviser,"Food will be grown in greenhouses covering acres of land under proposals to increase self-sufficiency to help guard against future economic shocks. ""Backing farmers"" is the focus of the government's long-awaited food strategy for England. The strategy announced today has been described by critics as ""half-baked"". It follows a landmark review of the food system by restaurant owner, Henry Dimbleby, who said only about half of his recommendations had been taken on. But the pledge to ""back farmers"" has been welcomed by the National Farmers' Union and the Soil Association. Salt and sugar tax plan to be ruled out Tax sugar and salt and prescribe veg, report says Soil at heart of farm grant revolution The report recommends investment in automated farming methods to improve productivity Speaking from a Cornish farm, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""supporting great British farming"" and putting money into modernisation and innovation. Thefood strategy,externalputs a focus on home-grown food, including strengthening supply chains and boosting food production. Â£270 million will be invested in technology to increase productivity and profitability The government will  consult on an ambition for 50% of public sector food spend to go on food produced locally or certified to higher standard A framework will be published next year on how to help farmers grow more food while also meeting legally-binding targets to halt climate change and nature loss. Restaurateur Henry Dimbleby said the policy document was not detailed enough to be called a strategy. The government's own adviser on food told the BBC: ""They've now implemented more than 50% of what I recommended, but it hasn't been done with one vision across the whole system."" Campaigners say the government must do more to restore nature Health campaigners are critical of the omission of recommendations for a tax on unhealthy foods. But Mr Dimbleby said his salt and sugar tax proposal would be responded to by the government at a later date, adding that Health Secretary Sajid Javid should ""be bold and brave in a difficult political context and act to break that junk food cycle"". He also expressed hope people can ""get away from this narrative of personal responsibility and education, which is important, but it isn't going to get us out of the hole we're in"". Sue Davies of consumer group, Which?, said the strategy lacked ambition and many of the recommendations had been ""watered down, ignored or put off for further consultation"". And conservation charity, The Wildlife Trusts, said the government had broken its promise to restore nature at scale. Conservation group, WWF, said making UK farming ""good for climate and nature"" was the only way to ""fix a broken food system to ensure healthy, affordable, sustainable food is available for everyone, now and for generations to come"". ""Putting nature and climate at the heart of our food system was a clear promise of this government at COP26 - now it must raise its game and prove it's got the backbone to deliver for people and planet,"" Katie White said.

Life after Guantanamo: 'We are still in jail',"Mansoor Adayfi on the balcony of his Belgrade apartment. ""Guantanamo follows you everywhere you go,"" he said. (Joel Gunter/BBC) Mansoor Adayfi knew next to nothing about Serbia when a delegation from its government came to visit him in 2016, in his 14th year in the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The only thing Adayfi did know was that Serbian forces had massacred Bosnian Muslims in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. All of the prisoners set for release from Guantanamo that year knew this part of the history, Adayfi said, and no-one wanted to go to Serbia. By that point, Adayfi had been in Guantanamo all his adult life - picked up in Afghanistan aged 19 and held without charge until he was 32. The previous year, the US had officially downgraded its assessment of him to acknowledge that it was unclear whether he had ever been connected to al-Qaeda, and he had been cleared for release under a complex system of classified deals to resettle detainees abroad. Adayfi wanted to go to Qatar, where he had family, or to Oman, which had gained a reputation at Guantanamo for treating former detainees well. But when the time came for his delegation meeting in the designated room in Camp Six, Adayfi found a Serbian team waiting for him. He listened to them, he said, then gave them a polite no. ""I told them thank you very much, but I know the history."" According to Adayfi, the head of the delegation assured him that Muslims were welcome in Serbia. The government was going to treat him like a citizen, they said - help him finish his education, give him financial assistance, and arrange for a passport and ID. They were going to help him start over. After the meeting, Adayfi told the US officials at Guantanamo that he did not want to go. But they were frank about the extent of his influence on the process, he said. ""A state department envoy came to see me after the delegation meeting and she said, 'Mansoor, you have no choice. You are going to Serbia.'"" Detainees in orange jumpsuits at the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, in January 2002. Adayfi is 39, charismatic and quick to smile, with a childlike quality he attributes to being locked away at the moment he was becoming an adult. His long journey to Belgrade began in Yemen, where he grew up in a rural village without running water or electricity. As a teenager he moved to the capital Sanaa to finish school and study computer science. According to his account, he travelled to Afghanistan in 2001 for an assignment as a research assistant, arranged by an educational institute in Sanaa. Four months after Adayfi arrived, the US invaded Afghanistan and began hunting for members of al-Qaeda. Leaflets were dropped from planes promising large cash rewards for turning people in. Adayfi says the car he was travelling in in northern Afghanistan was ambushed by militants, just days before he was due to return to Yemen, and he was taken captive and handed to the US. Adayfi's first stop was an American black site, where he says he was stripped naked, beaten, interrogated and accused of being an Egyptian al-Qaeda commander. From there he was flown, hooded and shackled, to Guantanamo Bay. His 14 years in the notorious prison are recounted in Don't Forget Us Here, a memoir published late last year. It chronicles torture, psychological abuse, and the death of his brother and sister while he was incarcerated. He taught himself English from scratch in the camp, as well as some computer science and business theory. But the story ends shortly after his release, as he lands in Belgrade in the dark one night in July 2016 and is taken by the secret service to a small apartment in the city centre, where he later found surveillance cameras, he said. Adayfi stayed awake that first night, wondering what lay ahead of him. ""I was exhausted but I couldn't sleep, hungry but I couldn't eat,"" he said, sitting in his current Belgrade apartment late one night in February. ""There was loneliness in Guantanamo, but this was a new kind,"" he said. What came next is what Adayfi calls ""Guantanamo 2.0"" - an isolated and restricted existence in Serbia, which he is not allowed to leave and where he says he is followed by police who warn off anyone he tries to befriend. Half a dozen former Guantanamo detainees across different countries - all released without charge - described similar experiences: lives in limbo; limited by a lack of documents, police interference, and travel restrictions that confine them to a country or even a single city, making it hard to find work, visit family or form relationships. ""Welcome to our life,"" Adayfi said. ""This is life after Guantanamo."" Mansoor Adayfi near his apartment in Belgrade, where he was resettled from Guantanamo in 2016. (Joel Gunter/BBC) The resettlement deals spread the former detainees across the globe - to Serbia, Slovakia, Saudi Arabia, Albania, Kazakhstan, Qatar and elsewhere. Some had the relative good fortune of being repatriated to their home nations, including the UK, others were sent somewhere alien. Adayfi was barred from returning to Yemen, where his family lives, because the US congress decided it was a security risk to return detainees to what it deemed unstable countries. Yemen has also refused to grant Adayfi a passport, and so has Serbia, so he is effectively stateless, marooned in Belgrade. The deal that took him there, like a lot of things about Guantanamo, remains shrouded in secrecy. ""I don't know anything officially, because the United States does not tell the lawyers anything,"" said Adayfi's lawyer, Beth Jacob, a New Yorker who has now represented nine Guantanamo detainees pro-bono. ""Most of the information I have about my clients I cannot share with them because it is classified as secret, and what I have is heavily redacted - five-page documents with a few words floating in a sea of blackness."" The US state department told the BBC that it obtained assurances from all third countries that the former detainees would be treated humanely, as well as ""security assurances designed to mitigate the threat a former detainee may pose after transfer"" and a ""framework to facilitate a detainee's successful reintegration into society"". The state department had on occasion assisted with the costs associated with supporting former detainees, a spokesperson said - though the amounts involved and the duration of the assistance remain unclear. Serbia's government did not respond to the BBC's questions. To Adayfi, the resettlement deal feels like an invisible net. He is not sure where it begins and ends. He cannot leave Serbia because he has no passport, and he cannot leave Belgrade without applying for permission in advance. He is followed by police, he says, and has found listening software installed on his government-issued phone. He is not allowed to drive, so he rarely attends Friday prayers anymore because it involves a long round trip by bus to the nearest mosque. He has a residence permit, and he has received financial assistance for rent and further education, but it is difficult to find work because he cannot explain away the 15 years he spent in Guantanamo, so he struggles to make ends meet. He lives in an apartment found for him by the government in a suburb of the city where there are few other Muslims and no places to buy halal meat. He mostly eats at home alone, and to break his loneliness he takes the bus to a nearby shopping mall and wanders around. When he passes young families there, Adayfi often stares for too long. ""I cannot help myself,"" he said, one day, on a circuit of the mall. ""I feel like a shell, empty within."" A mailbox at Adayfi's apartment, and Guantanamo books on his bookshelf. (Joel Gunter/BBC) Shortly after he arrived in Belgrade in 2016, Adayfi gave his first interview to US media and told them he was unhappy about his new life. In response, a widely-read Serbian tabloid published a full-page story referring to him as an ""al-Qaeda jihadist"" and ""convicted terrorist"" who was ungrateful to his host nation. Those he has tried to befriend have been warned off by police, he says. He has screenshots of WhatsApp conversations in which people described these interactions to him - from his first solitary visit to a cafe, a few weeks after he arrived, when police apparently questioned a group of Libyans at an adjacent table, to his most recent interaction, last year, when he had coffee with a young Muslim man he met at the mosque. ""They stopped him and asked him, 'Do you know Mansoor from al-Qaeda?'"", Adayfi said. ""In the end I told him to delete my number. I don't want anyone to get hurt."" After an interview with PBS Frontline in 2018, Adayfi was taken in by police and beaten, he said. Two friends from his language course were also arrested. A woman from a phone repair course he took was confronted by officers after she spoke to him in the library, he said. He still has messages she sent him afterwards, asking why plainclothes police were warning her off. And so Adayfi spends most of his time alone in his apartment. He rarely engages with his neighbours, and he has been going to the mall less, he said, since he was seen praying in an outdoor area last year and escorted off the premises by police. ""After a while you give up, you withdraw,"" Adayfi said. ""But it means you are isolated. I mostly live inside my head now."" Adayfi's closest substitute for friends in Belgrade is an international network of former Guantanamo detainees he has helped to connect and which he calls ""the brothers"", who communicate through various WhatsApp groups or over the phone. The content of the groups is largely apolitical, to avoid putting anyone at risk in their host countries. ""We sing songs, tell jokes, share photos, talk to each other about our health. We share memories of Guantanamo - the clothes, the food,"" Adayfi said. ""It helps keep us going."" Mansoor Adayfi shows a drawing from his business plan for a milk and honey farm in Yemen, completed in Guantanamo. (Joel Gunter/BBC) Among the former detainees Adayfi talks to most is Sabry al-Qurashi, a fellow Yemeni who spent nearly 13 years at Guantanamo before he was forcibly resettled to Semey, a small city on a former nuclear test site in far-eastern Kazakhstan which he is not allowed to leave. Al-Qurashi was transferred to Kazakhstan in 2014 with four other former detainees, including Asim Thahit Abdullah Al Khalaqi - who died of kidney failure four months after arriving - and Lotfi Bin Ali, who couldn't get the medical care he needed in Semey for a heart condition, and died of heart disease last year after being deported to Mauritania. With Bin Ali gone, al-Qurashi remains alone in Semey, where he ""lives in a state worse than jail"", he said. He has written letters to the Kazakh president and prime minister, US embassy and ICRC asking to be set free or sent back to Guantanamo, but received no replies. The Kazakh government did not respond to the BBC's questions. ""Guantanamo was better than here, because at least there I had hope I would one day be in a better place,"" al-Qurashi said. ""When the government delegation came from Kazakhstan, they told me I would be treated like a citizen of Kazakhstan. But it was a lie. I have no status, no ID, no family, and no friends. I am stuck here and there is no end."" Al-Qurashi is often stopped by the police when he leaves his apartment, he said, and asked to produce ID he does not have. Sometimes he is taken to the police station and forced to wait seven or eight hours until someone from the ICRC comes to get him. He needs specialist medical care for damaged nerves in his face after he was punched by a plainclothes policeman for refusing to remove his jacket one day, he said, but like his old friend Lotfi Bin Ali, he has been refused permission to travel to the capital to get it. ""I went to the police station to ask what happened to the guy who hit me, and they said, 'Shut your mouth, you are nothing here, go home.'"" Selections from two paintings by Sabry al-Qarashi, who began painting in Guantanamo. (Sabry al-Qarash) The incident summed up his existence in Semey, al-Qurashi said - a life lived totally at the mercy of the local authorities, who regard him as a convicted terrorist. ""The first pain is the punch,"" he said. ""The second pain is that you have no access to justice. You have no rights."" Al-Qurashi was never charged by the US, which alleged that he was a member of al-Qaeda who attended a training camp in Afghanistan. He was arrested by Pakistani security forces at an alleged al-Qaeda safehouse in Karachi, but he denies he was ever a member of the group. During his detention in Guantanamo, al-Qurashi began painting, producing a large volume of work which was subsequently confiscated. He has tried to maintain the practice in Semey. It is ""the only thing that keeps me sane,"" he said. He is not allowed to order anything online, so his access to paint and canvases is limited. He was asked to contribute work to an exhibition of art by former detainees, but he has no Kazakh ID card and is unable as a result to get the work authenticated as his own and sent. ""I asked the ICRC, should I burn my paintings?"" al-Qurashi said. ""They told me their only job was to make sure I had a roof and food, and that was it."" Seven years ago, al-Qurashi was married, by family arrangement, to a woman in Yemen, whom he has never met because he is not allowed to leave Semey and she cannot travel to Kazakhstan to live with him. He has pleaded with various Kazakh authorities for permission to leave but his situation remains unchanged. ""I have been waiting for seven years for my life to begin,"" he said. In total, 779 men passed through the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. Twelve have been charged with a crime. Only two have ever been convicted. According to a 2006 analysis of US defence department data by Seton Hall University law school, just 5% of the 517 detainees left in the prison that year had been actually detained by US forces. Eighty-six per cent had been detained either by Pakistan or the Northern Alliance militant coalition in Afghanistan, and ""handed over to the United States at a time in which the United States offered large bounties for capture of suspected enemies"". This was Adayfi's fate, he says - caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""I was a package deal,"" he said, ""sold to the US and then sold to Serbia"". In a 2007 Guantanamo administrative review board, seven years into his detention, Adayfi stated that he was a ""jihadist"" and a ""son"" of Osama Bin Laden, and it was an ""honour to be an enemy of the United States"". He claims now that the outburst was a protest. The administrative review boards were pseudo legal hearings at which the detainees had no lawyers present. ""We didn't understand the review board, we thought it was another interrogation,"" he said. ""For us, everything was an interrogation. So I thought, today I am going to beat them, I'm going to tell them, I am your enemy."" Adayfi had emerged by that point as an informal leader of fellow detainees - organising hunger strikes and other protests. He earned himself a nickname among the guards, ""smiley troublemaker"". He also devoted himself to education, teaching himself fluent English from scratch, and to writing. He wrote his memoir of Guantanamo twice. The first version, written on contraband pieces of paper, was confiscated and destroyed. When he realised that legal letters were privileged, he sat for hours in the camp classroom, his feet shackled to the floor, and wrote letters, which later became the basis of his book. A title page listing contents for Adayfi's book, approved to be passed out of Guantanamo to his lawyer. (Joel Gunter/BBC) Adayfi is now working on a new book charting the struggles of his post-detention life in Serbia. One wall of his Belgrade apartment is filled with colourful sticky notes describing events that will make up its contents. The notes record interrogations by police, thwarted attempts to make friends and find a wife, and efforts to draw President Biden's attention to his plight. Every day he communicates with other former detainees - more than 100 in total - across various online and WhatsApp chat groups. Many have faced the same sorts of restrictions as Adayfi. ""The United States has created a uniquely terrible situation for these men,"" said Daphne Eviatar, director of security and human rights at Amnesty USA. ""Many of them were tortured and have received no acknowledgement, no compensation, no real rehabilitation,"" she said. ""To then transfer them into another situation where they are restricted, can't travel, can't earn a livelihood, can't move on - it's unconscionable."" To Adayfi, the only path to a new life after Guantanamo is to find a wife and have a family of his own. It is what he thinks about at night when he has run out of distractions. But efforts to meet someone in Serbia have not been a success. His faith dictates that he must marry a Muslim woman and meet her in a traditional way, through her family, but his attempts to integrate into the Muslim community in Belgrade have failed, because of a pervasive fear in the community, he says, of being associated with terrorism. Adayfi did find a match in 2019, with a woman abroad, he said. She was from a good family, and they communicated for a year while he appealed to Serbian authorities for permission to travel to join her. She was his first love, he said. In the end he begged the authorities to allow him to go to her, he said, but they refused. Eventually, her family ran out of patience and she married another man. ""The worst pain I ever felt was not the black site, it was not the 15 years in Guantanamo, it was when I lost someone I loved,"" Adayfi said. ""At Guantanamo they torture you but they cannot touch your soul. Love is a pain that touches your soul, and you suffer a lot."" Sticky notes on one wall of Adayfi's apartment chart the contents of his new book, on his life in Belgrade. (Joel Gunter/BBC) In July 2004, more than two years after the first prisoners arrived at Guantanamo, the Pentagon launched its first formal review of the status of the detainees and cleared 38 men for release with ""NEC"", or ""non-enemy combatant"" status. The status effectively acknowledged that the men were not associated with al-Qaeda or the Taliban and had not undertaken hostile actions against the US. Among the 38 were five Uyghurs picked up in Afghanistan that the US said it suspected were members of the East Turkestan Independence Movement - a small militant group dedicated to independence for the Chinese region also known as Xinjiang. It was unsafe to send the men back to their home nation of China, where Uyghurs are persecuted by the state, so the US struck a deal with Albania to take them. They were finally released in 2006 and landed late at night in the Albanian capital Tirana. Their initial joy at being free subsided when they were taken straight to a squalid refugee camp on the outskirts of the city, where they would spend more than a year. ""It was like another world,"" said Abu Bakker Qassim, a 52-year-old Uyghur now living a quiet life with his family in a poor and run down suburb outside Tirana. ""Five years we were in Guantanamo, in the heat, and suddenly we were in Albania in the deep cold. Every day we dressed heavily and ate tasteless food among the strangers in the camp."" Qassim denies ever being a member of the East Turkestan Independence Movement. He was travelling to Turkey via Pakistan when he was picked up by militants, he said, and handed to the US. Like Adayfi, Qassim and the other former detainees bound for Albania were promised financial assistance, passports, citizenship and apartments that were ready for them, they said, only to discover a very different reality on the ground. ""Guantanamo had six camps at that time, and the refugee camp in Albania was camp seven,"" said Zakir Hasam, an Uzbek detained in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2006. ""There were four or five people to a room, barbed wire around the camp, and we had no money and no good food,"" said Hasam. ""The authorities told us their only job was to keep us safe politically and physically, and that was it."" Abu Bakker Qassim at his home in Tirana. ""This is not freedom,"" he said. (Joel Gunter/BBC) After a year in the refugee camp, and a series of protests, the former detainees in Tirana were relocated to apartments. They are now further along in their post-Guantanamo lives than Adayfi and al-Qurashi, and in some ways more fortunate. Several have married or remarried. Qassim and Hasam both have children. They benefit from monthly financial assistance for rent and bills and have enjoyed success integrating into their local communities. Their good fortune was to end up in a majority-Muslim country. But in other ways they live under the same restrictions as the former detainees in Serbia, Slovakia and Kazakhstan. They have no passports or work permits, so they cannot travel or legally earn a living to supplement their modest financial assistance. ""This is not freedom,"" said Qassim. ""Thank God we are out of prison, but we are not free."" Qassim's wife ""buys the cheapest vegetables, the cheapest fruits, the ones that are a little spoiled,"" he said. ""We cannot buy in the market because we run out of money in 15 days. So we save wherever we can. We are here alone, we are foreigners, we have no family who can help."" The financial assistance keeps them afloat but it also keeps them in a precarious situation, because it is attached only to the former detainees and not their families. When Qassim's friend and fellow former detainee, Ala Abd Al-Maqsut Mazruh, died from Covid five months ago, his wife Hatiche received a letter from the Albanian government telling her that the assistance would be immediately cut off. She was also told that the government-rented property she lived in with their three young children would be taken back this coming September. Like Qassim, Ala was released without charge in 2005, after being designated a non-enemy combatant. Hatiche went to the ministry of the interior in person, she said, to plead her case, but wasn't allowed in, and she has not received a reply to her messages. She cannot afford a lawyer. In order to support her three children she will need to find full-time work, while caring for them. Her biggest fear is that she will not be able to shelter and feed her children. Her second biggest fear is that they will persecuted in the future because their father was in Guantanamo. ""I am afraid for my children tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,"" she said. ""I am afraid they will be followed by the stigma of Guantanamo."" The Albanian government did not respond to requests to comment for this story. Zakir Hasam at the junk market near his home in Tirana. 'We have no ID, it interferes with every part of life,"" he said. (Joel Gunter/BBC) ""Our biggest problem is we have no ID,"" said Hasam. ""It interferes with every part of life. You have no choices, you cannot choose where to live, you cannot choose to travel to see your family abroad, you cannot choose where to work - everyone asks for ID and documents and your work history,"" he said. Hasam goes every week to a sprawling junk market where he looks for electronic and mechanical items he can buy, repair and resell - broken smartphones and laptops, radios, drills, anything he can pry open and restore. But the pickings - and margins - are slim. A two-hour visit to the market one February weekend netted only a single set of damaged speakers. He wants above all to be able to get a good job, based on his mechanical skills, and provide better for his two autistic children, who cannot currently get proper care. He found out in 2020 that his name was listed on ""World Check"" - a global database that meant nothing to him at the time but is used by banks everywhere to screen customers for criminal backgrounds. Being listed on the database can limit a person in ways they cannot see, and Refinitiv, the company behind it, doesn't inform those who are listed. It emerged that year that many former Guantanamo detainees had been added to the database, many to its ""terrorism"" category despite never having being charged with a crime. Now, with the help of a British legal firm, they are slowly getting small payouts. Hasam got $3,000. Qassim got $3,000. Mansoor Adayfi hasn't received a payout yet, he is disputing the offer. ""When you take into account that the lawyers take 30%, it's not much,"" he said. Last month, Adayfi was cut off without explanation from the money transfer service Western Union. He had been using the service to send small amounts of money home to his family in Yemen to help pay for his mother's monthly medical expenses, he said, as well as receive donations or payments for work from abroad. Citing company policy, Western Union said it could not disclose to Adayfi or the BBC why he was cut off. A spokesman said the company ""takes its regulatory and compliance responsibilities very seriously"", and had reached out to Adayfi about his case. Adayfi is convinced that it is Guantanamo. The long shadow of his extrajudicial detention has been cast over so many parts of his life that he sees it everywhere. ""It follows you every place you go,"" he said, ruefully. ""America punishes you for 15 years, and then the rest of the world punishes you for the rest of your life."" One night back in February, a few days after the 20th anniversary of his arrival in Guantanamo, Adayfi was setting up his apartment to give a video talk to a group of students in the US state of Virginia about the art produced in Guantanamo. He moved his small writing desk in front of his preferred Zoom background - the wall of post-it notes that chart the structure of his new book - and took a silk orange scarf from a hook and tied it around his neck. Orange was the first colour Adayfi saw when his blindfold was removed at Guantanamo - the colour of the jumpsuits the men were forced to wear, that came to symbolise America's human rights abuses at the camp. He clicked on a cheap ring light he purchased online for these kinds of appearances and it lit up one corner of the apartment. Adayfi rarely turns down an offer to give an interview or talk - he has a book to promote, and he sees it as his responsibility to educate younger generations about Guantanamo. And it brings people into his life, briefly. Adayfi gave an introductory talk about the catalogue of art produced by Guantanamo detainees and the artists' ongoing battle to take their work out of the prison with them. Then he encouraged the students to ask questions. Many of the school and university age groups he talks to have a hazy understanding of what happened at Guantanamo and how the story began, and Adayfi has to remind himself that most of them weren't born when he was sent there. Adayfi has probably, by this point, been asked just about every question there is to ask about Guantanamo. But he cheerfully engaged with each one. ""At what point did you give up?"" a student asked. ""There was no giving up, the moment you give up you have lost,"" Adayfi said. ""We paint and they take the paintings away. We write and they destroy our words. We hunger strike and they break the strike. We hunger strike again. I wrote my book twice. They first time they took it away and it broke my heart. But I wrote it again."" Adayfi often gives online talks about Guantanamo. Many students were not born when he was sent to Guantanamo. (Joel Gunter/BBC) Adayfi completed his manuscript in Belgrade, with the help of an American writer, and it was published at the end of last year. He has also finished a bachelor's degree in business - his thesis an analysis of the successes and failures of former detainees re-entering social life and the labour market wherever they were sent. Guantanamo still circumscribes Adayfi's world - there is hardly anything he does that is not an exploration of or battle with the consequences of his detention. When the online talk was over, Adayfi clicked off his ring light and rearranged his apartment. It was late at night but he wanted to talk. The conversation turned again to family, and at one point Adayfi began mimicking a father trying to corral his small children and get them to behave. Soon he got carried away with the fantasy, jumping up to chase his imaginary son and daughter around the room, beaming with a wide smile and laughing as he called out their imaginary names. Then he caught himself, and stopped, and sat for a while in silence. For Adayfi, turning this fantasy into something he can touch will be the only real escape from Guantanamo. Until that day, he is locked in the strange phase of his life defined by his long extrajudicial detention. ""No matter what I do, there will be suspicion around me,"" he said, dejectedly. ""People just cannot believe that America would make a mistake."" In April, Adayfi's lawyer received a cryptic email from his government minder, telling her the government was ""done with Mansoor"" and the ""programme was finished"". She asked the minder if that meant the restrictions on Adayfi's ability to work, drive and travel would be lifted. He replied to say it would be discussed at the next meeting of officials. Nearly six years after Adayfi was sent to Serbia, it was the first acknowledgement - albeit tacit - that the restrictions against him even existed. They are waiting to hear back. Â© 2025 BBC.

Columnist admits 'mishandling' Rebel Wilson story,"Wilson revealed her new relationship on Friday, describing her partner as her ""Disney princess"" An Australian newspaper has removed a gossip column and its writer has offered an apology after being accused of outing actress Rebel Wilson. On Friday,Wilson shared a picture,externalof her with her new partner, saying she had found her ""Disney princess"". But the following day,the Sydney Morning Herald,externalwrote they'd known about the relationship before it was public. Their celebrity reporter said he had given Wilson 1.5 days to provide comment for a story. That report sparked widespread criticism on social media, with LGBTQ+ campaigners saying it was unacceptable to put pressure on people to come out. Allow Twitter content?

A Stonewall spokesperson said: ""Coming out is a deeply personal decision. Whether, when and how to come out should be decided by the individual, entirely on their terms. ""It is simply not OK to 'out' LGBTQ+ people or put pressure on us to come out. Media outlets should take care not to sensationalise LGBTQ+ lives and relationships."" In response, the newspaper denied pressuring Wilson, saying it had ""simply asked questions"". But on Monday, amid continued public backlash, columnist Andrew Hornery admitted they had ""mishandled steps in our approach"". ""It is not the Herald's business to 'out' people and that is not what we set out to do. But I understand why my email has been seen as a threat. The framing of it was a mistake."" He also said that ""as a gay man, I'm well aware of how deeply discrimination hurts"" and that he would not wish to ""inflict that pain on someone else"". Wilson: I know what it's like to be invisible Rebel Wilson 'deeply sorry' for plus-sized claims He included in his Monday column the email he had sent Wilson's representatives last Thursday morning. In it he had written that he had ""enough detail to publish"" and ""several sources"", before specifying a Friday 13:00 deadline. ""In the interests of transparency and fairness, before publishing I am reaching out to Rebel to see if she will engageâ¦.,"" he'd written. Wilson did not respond to the email before making her own post on Friday. She has not directly acknowledged the newspaper's actions. But in response to a Twitter post saying it wasn't her choice to come out, the 42-year-old Australian actress, who is known for roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect among others, said it was a ""very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace"". Wilson's post about her relationship with leisurewear designer Ramona Agruma prompted a wave of congratulations from fans and famous friends - along with more than 1.6 million likes. But in his original column, Hornery claimed that Wilson had ""opted to gazump the story"" after he'd been in touch. He added that ""her choice to ignore our discreet, genuine and honest queries was, in our view, underwhelming"". In Monday's note he acknowledged ""the tone of my column on Saturday was also off"". ""I got it wrong,"" he admitted. ""I allowed my disappointment to cast a shadow over the piece. That was not fair and I apologise."" In 2022 you might rightly wonder why someone's sexuality is of interest to anyone, let alone a front-page story in a newspaper. People within the LGBT community will probably agree that the very first time you tell family, friends or work colleagues is a day that you vividly remember. Many might want to shout it from the rooftops, others may choose to keep that part of themselves separate to other aspects of their life. But Rebel Wilson didn't seem to get that option and announced it to the world herself, before others could. Thanks to social media, celebrities can now have a greater control of their own narrative and Rebel made sure she got ahead to say what she wanted and has been widely welcomed and supported. The fact that I am writing this and you're reading it shows that there is still an interest, even in the 21st century. Maybe it's more the nature of how this emerged and the way it was handled that is stoking that though. No matter how famous a person is, there is an argument that their love life is their business alone. The criticism the Sydney Morning Herald has received does seem to show that's an opinion many appear to agree with. The newspaper's editor, Bevan Shields, was also criticised when heissued an 'editors note' on Sunday,externaldefending the report. In it he denied the paper had outed Wilson, saying the newsroom had made no decision on whether a report would have been published. He wrote: ""Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response."" That response sparked further anger on social media.

LiveLiveKey Donbas city 'could be cut off' if final bridge destroyed16 minutes ago,"The human cost of the battle for the city of Severodonetsk is very high and simply terrifying, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says All three bridges to the embattled eastern Donbas city have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai A pro-Russian separatist leader says Ukrainian troops there must ""surrender or die"" because ""there is no other option"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has warned that the war in Ukraine risks plunging millions into food poverty across the globe This comes as a senior Ukrainian official says the country's grain harvest is likely to drop by almost half this year, following the invasion Up to 1,200 bodies found across Ukraine, including some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, the head of the national police says Edited by Claire Heald A resident walks between apartment blocks in Bakhmut, Ukraine We're pausing our live coverage shortly. Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk. Maksym Katerin stands in the yard of his damaged house today, after his mother and his step-father were killed in shelling A man tries to put out a fire with a bucket of water after a bombardment destroyed the home next door on Friday A man and two boys cycle in an empty street in the city on Friday. In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Mum teaches football camp about severe allergies,"Rachel Williams was not sure her son would be safe at a football club, so has pushed for training on allergies A woman concerned by her son's allergies has changed the way a football camp approaches allergies. Rachel Williams' son Jacob, six, has a severe nut allergy and before he headed off to a football camp, she wanted to make sure he was in safe hands. After speaking to the Swansea City AFC Foundation, who operate local football camps, they invited her to show staff how to administer adrenaline. She said it could save children's lives. According to the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity, 5% of children have allergies. Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger, such as an allergy,according to the NHS,external. Symptoms include feeling light-headed, breathing difficulties, clammy skin, confusion and loss of consciousness. 'Allergies can cause life-changing damage' Why the world is becoming more allergic Allergic reaction hospital admissions double Jacob is like any other six-year-old, except he could die if those around him do not know how to administer treatment if he needs it. He is allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, dust, cats and has hay fever. Ms Williams said she did not want Jacob to miss out, but was nervous about sending him to a holiday camp. Ms Williams, from Swansea, contacted the team running the Swansea City boot camp, advising them of free allergy awareness training online. Staff at Swansea City AFC Foundation football camps have all been trained how to administer treatment for people who suffering from anaphylaxis However, it prompted the club to take stronger measures and they asked her to come in and speak about her family's experience and how to administer adrenaline auto-injectors. Adrenaline auto-injectors are prescribed to people with severe allergies who are at risk of a serious reaction, or anaphylaxis. They work by providing a dose of adrenaline into the bloodstream, and are often injected into the thigh. In the UK people will be prescribed either an Epi-pen, Jext or Emerade injector. ""They asked me a little bit about Jake's story so I told them about how we knew about his allergy,"" Ms Williams said. ""I told them about different symptoms we've come across along the years because we haven't had to use Epi-pens but we have had to use medication."" Tom Williams says it is important football camps are ""safe and inclusive"" environments Tom Williams, head of programmes for the Swansea City AFC Foundation, said: ""It's really important to us to offer a safe and inclusive environment so parents can leave their children with us and feel confident we can deal with any kind of medical issues that can arise. ""The training really did put a lot of staff at ease, that administering the auto injector pen isn't as big a thing as they might have feared. ""It's a relatively straightforward thing to do and it can save a life."" Sarah Baker, campaign manager at Anaphylaxis Campaign, said: ""I think there's a huge lack of awareness on how to use adrenaline auto-injectors. ""Training in knowing how they work and what to do with them is really important for everybody, because you could be walking down the street, you could be in the park, you may be with a family member or a friend who has anaphylaxis and is carrying an adrenaline auto injector. ""I would say absolutely everyone should have an awareness of what anaphylaxis is, how to recognise it, and then in turn know how to use the different types of adrenaline auto-injector on the market."" This video can not be played 'If he touches that birthday cake, he'll die' For Ms Williams, being able to share her knowledge has been a weight lifted off her shoulders. She said: ""It's so nice to know that they were willing to take it seriously. I'm really grateful that they were willing to do that. ""It's definitely going to help in future when Jacob goes to more days like that. ""It feels good to know that they've done it."" Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. It can be very serious if not treated quickly. If someone has symptoms of anaphylaxis, the NHS recommends: Use an adrenaline auto-injector if the person has one - but make sure you know how to use it correctly first Call an ambulance immediately and alert them the person has anaphylaxis Remove any trigger if possible - for example, carefully remove any stinger stuck in the skin Lie the person down and raise their legs - unless they're having breathing difficulties and need to sit up to help them breathe. If they're pregnant, lie them down on their left side. Give another injection after five minutes if the symptoms do not improve and a second auto-injector is available FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS:X-Ray returns and they've got your back SPOTLIGHT ON THE NHS:Is Covid masking a bigger problem with our health service?

Bodies found in search for Amazon pair,"Bruno Pereira (l) and Dom Phillips (r) pictured in 2018 Brazilian police have denied reports that bodies were discovered in the Amazon belonging to a journalist and an indigenous expert. Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira went missing on 5 June. Mr Phillips' brother-in-law told the BBC that the Brazilian embassy in the UK had informed the family that two bodies were found tied to a tree. Police say they have only found some of their belongings and ""biological material"" which is still being tested. The region's indigenous association Univaja, which first alerted authorities that the pair was missing, told the BBC that no bodies had been found. Speaking to the BBC, Dom Phillips' brother-in-law Paul Sherwood said he received a call on Monday morning from a liaison officer at the Brazilian embassy. Mr Sherwood was told, in clear English, that two bodies had been found and the embassy was letting the family know before the press found out. There was no misunderstanding, the brother-in-law said. The news was reported by local and international media, citing family members of Mr Phillips. But Brazil's federal police quickly released a statement saying that no bodies had been found, telling the BBC that there had been a miscommunication. Pair missing in the Amazon: 'A tragedy foretold' Local groups say both men had received threats for their work supporting indigenous rights in the region, where they were travelling by boat on a reporting trip. Both Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira were known for their deep knowledge of the region. Mr Phillips had been living in Brazil for more than a decade and was a long-time contributor to the Guardian newspaper - he was in the area researching a book. Mr Pereira, who was on leave from his post with the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, was an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon. Days before the pair went missing indigenous groups say Mr Pereira was threatened for campaigning against illegal fishing in the area. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Phillips' sister, Sian, said: ""I think it's likely they've been ambushed by some illegal criminal activity there, possibly to do with illegal fishing."" It is an ""incredibly distressing and awful situation"", she added. The region where they disappeared is home to around 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups. As well as clashes with fishermen catching protected stock, it has also seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug traffickers who smuggle cocaine from neighbouring Peru. Alarm over the men's disappearance was initially sounded by two indigenous rights groups, who said the pair had been travelling by boat in the Javari Valley to interview members of an indigenous group. The area is located in the west of Amazonas state, near the border with Peru.

Does PM have support for bill?,"It was the most anodyne of sentences from Prince Charles. No, nothing to do with what the heir to the throne may have said in private about the government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. This was a sentence he said in public, about the importance ministers attach to the ""internal economic bonds"" between all parts of the United Kingdom. A month ago, the Prince of Wales deputised for the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament, and after much hullaballoo about whether there would be a planned new law about Northern Ireland and Brexit in the government's shopping list of planned new laws that day, there wasn't. Just that one phrase, lightly hinting at something, without committing to it. Well, a month on, that planned new law, a bill, is happening. All of this is about what is known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? In short, it was a thing bolted onto the Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union which tried to find a solution to borders. Brexit is all about borders, about different rules either side of them. But the land border between the EU and UK, between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is open, as that is seen as crucial to maintaining peace. So some stuff now gets checked when it gets moved from England, Scotland and Wales to Northern Ireland. This is what some call a border in the Irish Sea. This was agreed by the British government and the EU in an international agreement, but the government has now decided it is not working as it should, and wants to introduce a new domestic law to get rid of the bits it doesn't like. That bill, the template for the planned new law, will be published on Monday. And it will prompt a row. When Iwent to Northern Ireland last month to report on the prime minister's visit to meet the political partiesthere, I described the challenge he faced as four dimensional diplomacy. Well, here's the thing: it still is, and it has probably got more complex still. Not only will this bill propose green lanes and red lanes for things crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland: green lanes for things staying in Northern Ireland, red lanes for things going on into the Republic. It will also seek to dilute the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing the Protocol - a long standing irritation to some because it is the court of a foreign jurisdiction, with the potential to have an impact on the UK. The bill will refer to it no longer being the ""sole arbiter."" The European Court of Justice - the European Union's highest legal authority - is the only court that deal with disputes on the matter of EU law in Northern Ireland Remember, though: the government did sign up to all this. Ministers argue privately they were in a bind when they did so, desperate to get a Brexit deal over the line and with very few if any other palatable options. They also claim the EU hasn't acted sufficiently flexibly. Enter next, the Democratic Unionist Party. They are currently refusing to go into devolved government in Northern Ireland, until issues around the Protocol are sorted, as they see it. And they are sounding pretty bullish. The mere publication of this bill doesn't sound like it will change much, although they are likely to acknowledge the government has done some heavy lifting to get this far. Then, there is the EU. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is set to discuss Northern Ireland on Monday with European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will speak to Maros Sefcovic of the European Commission on Monday morning. The EU has frequently pointed out this Protocol is something the UK signed up to. Another moving part is Washington: for whenever Northern Ireland politics is big news, it gets political tongues wagging in DC. And so the Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns has flown to America, for the second time in a matter of weeks, a document - NI Protocol: The UK's Solution - under his arm. He will be there until Thursday meeting political figures in Congress, the Senate and the State Department. President Joe Biden has previously warned that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit President Biden has been repeatedly outspoken about the importance of the Protocol, so the government knows it has some persuading to do. And now here is the added twist from a month ago: the internal dynamics of the Conservative Party. A few weeks ago, some in government were briefing that their principal aim was sorting out the so-called Irish Sea border, with the green lanes and red lanes idea. The governance of the deal, to use the lingo, the role of the European Court of Justice, mattered less. Now, it is being talked up rather more prominently. It is the view of some Conservatives that this is happening because of the Prime Minister's vulnerability. Some argue some of the most passionate Brexiteers on the Tory benches are exploiting Boris Johnson's weakness to demand an approach to the EU likely to result in a bust up. It is, one figure said to me, ""the application of an English nationalist's idea of Brexit to a strategy to holding together the union"" of the UK. ""It is law breaking, will annoy middle ground voters and the DUP position probably won't shift anyway,"" they added. The DUP are blocking restoration of power-sharing with Sinn Fein led by Michelle O 'Neill An internal note circulating among some Conservatives is blunt: ""breaking international law to rip up the prime minister's own treaty is damaging to everything the UK and the Conservatives stand forâ¦ no amount of shopping around for rent-a-quote lawyers can hide that."" All of which raises the question of whether the prime minister can keep enough of his MPs on side to get this through, particularly in the short term if it doesn't lead to a return to full devolution in Northern Ireland. So what happens next? There is some talk in government of hoping to get devolution up and running again in Northern Ireland in the next six weeks or so and that the progress of the new law might slow down if the DUP doesn't show enough willingness to change its outlook. But the DUP doesn't appear to be in any hurry, and wants to see action rather than words, even if those words are written down in a bill. There is plenty more mileage in this whole row yet.

A simple guide to the problem,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

What does each side want?,"The UK and EU are engaged in a long-standing dispute over the post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. The arrangements - known as the protocol - keep Northern Ireland aligned to EU product standards in order to avoid introducing checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It also puts in place checks on goods moving from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. The existence of the protocol has caused tension in Northern Ireland, but reaching a viable solution requires finding an agreement that can satisfy all the interested groups. So where does each side stands and what do they want? Boris Johnson's government wants to change parts of the protocol, which forms part of the deal it negotiated with the EU in 2019 and signed in 2020 It has published the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which would allow some goods leaving Great Britain for Northern Ireland to go through ""green lanes"", meaning they would avoid customs checks provided they remain in Northern Ireland rather than going on to the Irish Republic The UK government also wants to allow businesses in Northern Ireland to choose between meeting UK or EU standards in a new dual regulatory regime The UK wants to scrap the European Court of Justice's role in overseeing the deal in favour of an alternative ""dispute resolution process"" And the government says the UK should have more freedom to set VAT rates in Northern Ireland Ministers hope that making changes to the agreement will persuade the DUP to return to power-sharing government in Northern Ireland They say they want to reach a consensus with the EU Slovakian diplomat Maros Å efÄoviÄ is leading negotiations for the EU The EU has warned the UK against unilaterally changing the protocol, saying it would undermine trust between the two sides It has launched legal action against the UK government, accusing it of breaking international law The bloc has proposed reducing checks on products coming into Northern Ireland, but not eliminating them altogether In exchange, it wants safeguards to stop goods moving from Great Britain into the Republic of Ireland It says the UK needs to share more of its trade data with the EU The EU has dismissed the UK's proposal to remove the European Court of Justice's role from the protocol DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson with party colleagues Campaigned for Leave in the Brexit referendum In recent elections, the DUPcampaigned,externalon a pledge of removing the Northern Ireland Protocol It believes the protocol undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional status as it has created an internal UK border down the Irish Sea The party's manifestolaid out seven tests,externalfor any special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland which amounted to fundamental changes to the protocol These include no checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland The party is blocking the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland in protest over the protocol - and says it wants to see ""action not words"" from the UK government Sinn FÃ©in leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill after meeting Boris Johnson Campaigned for Remain The largest party following the 5 May elections, it wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing Sinn FÃ©in says the protocol is necessary following Brexit The party says it gives Northern Ireland access to both the EU and British markets, protects the Good Friday Agreement and prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland The party agrees there are practical issues related to the operation of the protocol, but any solutions must be made through talks between the UK government and the EU They do not support any prospect of unilateral action by the UK government. Alliance party leader Naomi Long also met with the UK prime minister Campaigned for Remain It wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing On the protocol, it acknowledges the need for flexibility but blames Brexit rather than the EU for Northern Ireland's latest problems Alliance said mutually agreed, sustainable and legal solutions to the challenges posed are needed It argues there's no reason the Stormont executive shouldn't get up and running while issues like the protocol are dealt with in parallel Doug Beattie leads the Ulster Unionist Party Campaigned for Remain It wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing The party is against the protocol It said there can be no border in the Irish Sea and wants to see the removal of checks of goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland It said it was ""regretful"" that the UK may move unilaterally to change it, but the ""stand-off cannot continue"" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood with other members of his party Campaigned for Remain It wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing The party acknowledges there are a ""small amount of issues with the protocol that remain outstanding"" But it says issues need to be sorted through negotiations between the UK and EU It does not back unilateral action by the UK government.

"Arron Banks loses libel case against CadwalladrThe Brexit campaigner says he will ""likely"" appeal against the High Court judgement.UK","Brexit supporter Arron Banks tried to sue the freelance journalist Carole Cadwalladr for libel Brexit campaigner Arron Banks has lost his libel case against investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Mr Banks, the founder of the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU, sued Ms Cadwalladr for defamation over two instances in 2019 - one in a TED Talk video and another in a tweet. Mr Banks claimed he was defamed after comments Ms Cadwalladr made about his relationship with the Russian state. Thejudgement from the High Court,externalfollows a five-day hearing in January. The case, which has been going on for nearly three years, centred on comments Ms Cadwalladr made in a TED talk which has been viewed more than five million times since it was broadcast online in April 2019. In the talk, she said: ""And I am not even going to get into the lies that Arron Banks has told about his covert relationship with the Russian government."" According to the judgement from Mrs Justice Steyn: The single meaning of Ms Cadwalladr's words was that: ""On more than one occasion Mr Banks told untruths about a secret relationship he had with the Russian government in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding"" Ms Cadwalladr said she did not intend to make that allegation, and accepts it was untrue After initially putting forward a truth defence, Ms Cadwalladr withdrew that defence She then used a public interest defence to justify her statements and Ms Cadwalladr established that ""her belief that publishing the TED talk was in the public interest was reasonable"" The court found that talk ""had caused serious harm to his [Banks's] reputation"" But Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""I accept the TED talk was political expression of high importance, and great public interest (in the strictest sense), not only in this country but worldwide"" The tweet, which Mr Banks also complained about, had not caused ""serious harm"" to his reputation The judge said if she had found the tweet had caused ""serious harm"" to Mr Banks' reputation she would have concluded Ms Cadwalladr's belief that the tweet was in the public interest was also reasonable. A public interest defence allows a defendant to justify themselves based on the reason that the information was in the public interest. ""I am so profoundly grateful and relieved,"" said Ms Cadwalladr, who first reported the Cambridge Analytica data scandal where harvested data was used during elections. Writing on Twitter after the judgement, she thanked her legal team and the 29,000 people who contributed to her legal defence fund, saying: ""I literally couldn't have done it without you."" She said the last three years had been ""extraordinarily difficult"" and hoped no other journalists had to go through this ""crushing, debilitating, all-consuming experience"". Mr Banks congratulated the investigative journalist on winning, but said he would ""likely"" appeal against the court judgement. ""It leaves open for the journalist the excuse that she thought what she said was correct even though she had no facts,"" he posted on Twitter. The High Court judgement ""is an important vindication"" for Ms Cadwalladr, said the journalist's legal team. Keith Mathieson from law firm RPC, which represented Ms Cadwalladr, said the judgement supports the public interest defence and the ""protection it offers journalists, bloggers and others to contribute to public debate on serious issues"". Rebecca Vincent, from the press freedom campaign group, Reporters without Borders, described it as a victory for journalism. It was not just Ms Cadwalladr's reputation at ""stake"", but also the ""ability of the press to report freely on such issues"". ""If Arron Banks had won today that would have a very different impact on the UK's press freedom climate so we're very pleased that it's gone the way that it has,"" she told the BBC. One of the questions raised in this case is why, amidst all the thousands of articles and broadcasts about Brexit, Arron Banks and Russia, did a few sentences in a TED talk and a tweet lead to a libel trial? Carole Cadwalladr clearly felt this was a personal assault on her. The word SLAPP was raised during the trial.  A SLAPP is a ""strategic lawsuit against public participation"" and is a phrase to describe the way in which the wealthy and powerful can threaten critics with often frivolous lawsuits that they cannot afford to contest. This was certainly a personal battle between Mr Banks and Ms Cadwalladr. She had spent years investigating and reporting on the alleged links between the Brexit campaign and Russia. Defending this lawsuit was, she says, ""crushing"" and ""debilitating"". Normally journalists have the financial and legal support of a newspaper or a broadcaster. Ms Cadwalladr had to rely on 29,000 people who contributed to her legal defence fund. However, the judge did not consider this to be a SLAPP saying this case was ""legitimate"" and ""it is neither fair nor apt to describe this as a SLAPP suit"". Nevertheless, it is worth noting the toll such a case can take on an individual. Ms Cadwalladr has written about its effect on her over the last three years and the cost of defending herself. Individuals can, in the age of social media, reach huge audiences but it has its risks.

Does Johnson have support for NI Protocol bill?,"It was the most anodyne of sentences from Prince Charles. No, nothing to do with what the heir to the throne may have said in private about the government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. This was a sentence he said in public, about the importance ministers attach to the ""internal economic bonds"" between all parts of the United Kingdom. A month ago, the Prince of Wales deputised for the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament, and after much hullaballoo about whether there would be a planned new law about Northern Ireland and Brexit in the government's shopping list of planned new laws that day, there wasn't. Just that one phrase, lightly hinting at something, without committing to it. Well, a month on, that planned new law, a bill, is happening. All of this is about what is known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? In short, it was a thing bolted onto the Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union which tried to find a solution to borders. Brexit is all about borders, about different rules either side of them. But the land border between the EU and UK, between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is open, as that is seen as crucial to maintaining peace. So some stuff now gets checked when it gets moved from England, Scotland and Wales to Northern Ireland. This is what some call a border in the Irish Sea. This was agreed by the British government and the EU in an international agreement, but the government has now decided it is not working as it should, and wants to introduce a new domestic law to get rid of the bits it doesn't like. That bill, the template for the planned new law, will be published on Monday. And it will prompt a row. When Iwent to Northern Ireland last month to report on the prime minister's visit to meet the political partiesthere, I described the challenge he faced as four dimensional diplomacy. Well, here's the thing: it still is, and it has probably got more complex still. Not only will this bill propose green lanes and red lanes for things crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland: green lanes for things staying in Northern Ireland, red lanes for things going on into the Republic. It will also seek to dilute the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing the Protocol - a long standing irritation to some because it is the court of a foreign jurisdiction, with the potential to have an impact on the UK. The bill will refer to it no longer being the ""sole arbiter."" The European Court of Justice - the European Union's highest legal authority - is the only court that deal with disputes on the matter of EU law in Northern Ireland Remember, though: the government did sign up to all this. Ministers argue privately they were in a bind when they did so, desperate to get a Brexit deal over the line and with very few if any other palatable options. They also claim the EU hasn't acted sufficiently flexibly. Enter next, the Democratic Unionist Party. They are currently refusing to go into devolved government in Northern Ireland, until issues around the Protocol are sorted, as they see it. And they are sounding pretty bullish. The mere publication of this bill doesn't sound like it will change much, although they are likely to acknowledge the government has done some heavy lifting to get this far. Then, there is the EU. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is set to discuss Northern Ireland on Monday with European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will speak to Maros Sefcovic of the European Commission on Monday morning. The EU has frequently pointed out this Protocol is something the UK signed up to. Another moving part is Washington: for whenever Northern Ireland politics is big news, it gets political tongues wagging in DC. And so the Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns has flown to America, for the second time in a matter of weeks, a document - NI Protocol: The UK's Solution - under his arm. He will be there until Thursday meeting political figures in Congress, the Senate and the State Department. President Joe Biden has previously warned that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit President Biden has been repeatedly outspoken about the importance of the Protocol, so the government knows it has some persuading to do. And now here is the added twist from a month ago: the internal dynamics of the Conservative Party. A few weeks ago, some in government were briefing that their principal aim was sorting out the so-called Irish Sea border, with the green lanes and red lanes idea. The governance of the deal, to use the lingo, the role of the European Court of Justice, mattered less. Now, it is being talked up rather more prominently. It is the view of some Conservatives that this is happening because of the Prime Minister's vulnerability. Some argue some of the most passionate Brexiteers on the Tory benches are exploiting Boris Johnson's weakness to demand an approach to the EU likely to result in a bust up. It is, one figure said to me, ""the application of an English nationalist's idea of Brexit to a strategy to holding together the union"" of the UK. ""It is law breaking, will annoy middle ground voters and the DUP position probably won't shift anyway,"" they added. The DUP are blocking restoration of power-sharing with Sinn Fein led by Michelle O 'Neill An internal note circulating among some Conservatives is blunt: ""breaking international law to rip up the prime minister's own treaty is damaging to everything the UK and the Conservatives stand forâ¦ no amount of shopping around for rent-a-quote lawyers can hide that."" All of which raises the question of whether the prime minister can keep enough of his MPs on side to get this through, particularly in the short term if it doesn't lead to a return to full devolution in Northern Ireland. So what happens next? There is some talk in government of hoping to get devolution up and running again in Northern Ireland in the next six weeks or so and that the progress of the new law might slow down if the DUP doesn't show enough willingness to change its outlook. But the DUP doesn't appear to be in any hurry, and wants to see action rather than words, even if those words are written down in a bill. There is plenty more mileage in this whole row yet.

A simple guide to the Brexit border problem,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want?,"The UK and EU are engaged in a long-standing dispute over the post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. The arrangements - known as the protocol - keep Northern Ireland aligned to EU product standards in order to avoid introducing checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It also puts in place checks on goods moving from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. The existence of the protocol has caused tension in Northern Ireland, but reaching a viable solution requires finding an agreement that can satisfy all the interested groups. So where does each side stands and what do they want? Boris Johnson's government wants to change parts of the protocol, which forms part of the deal it negotiated with the EU in 2019 and signed in 2020 It has published the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which would allow some goods leaving Great Britain for Northern Ireland to go through ""green lanes"", meaning they would avoid customs checks provided they remain in Northern Ireland rather than going on to the Irish Republic The UK government also wants to allow businesses in Northern Ireland to choose between meeting UK or EU standards in a new dual regulatory regime The UK wants to scrap the European Court of Justice's role in overseeing the deal in favour of an alternative ""dispute resolution process"" And the government says the UK should have more freedom to set VAT rates in Northern Ireland Ministers hope that making changes to the agreement will persuade the DUP to return to power-sharing government in Northern Ireland They say they want to reach a consensus with the EU Slovakian diplomat Maros Å efÄoviÄ is leading negotiations for the EU The EU has warned the UK against unilaterally changing the protocol, saying it would undermine trust between the two sides It has launched legal action against the UK government, accusing it of breaking international law The bloc has proposed reducing checks on products coming into Northern Ireland, but not eliminating them altogether In exchange, it wants safeguards to stop goods moving from Great Britain into the Republic of Ireland It says the UK needs to share more of its trade data with the EU The EU has dismissed the UK's proposal to remove the European Court of Justice's role from the protocol DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson with party colleagues Campaigned for Leave in the Brexit referendum In recent elections, the DUPcampaigned,externalon a pledge of removing the Northern Ireland Protocol It believes the protocol undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional status as it has created an internal UK border down the Irish Sea The party's manifestolaid out seven tests,externalfor any special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland which amounted to fundamental changes to the protocol These include no checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland The party is blocking the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland in protest over the protocol - and says it wants to see ""action not words"" from the UK government Sinn FÃ©in leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill after meeting Boris Johnson Campaigned for Remain The largest party following the 5 May elections, it wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing Sinn FÃ©in says the protocol is necessary following Brexit The party says it gives Northern Ireland access to both the EU and British markets, protects the Good Friday Agreement and prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland The party agrees there are practical issues related to the operation of the protocol, but any solutions must be made through talks between the UK government and the EU They do not support any prospect of unilateral action by the UK government. Alliance party leader Naomi Long also met with the UK prime minister Campaigned for Remain It wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing On the protocol, it acknowledges the need for flexibility but blames Brexit rather than the EU for Northern Ireland's latest problems Alliance said mutually agreed, sustainable and legal solutions to the challenges posed are needed It argues there's no reason the Stormont executive shouldn't get up and running while issues like the protocol are dealt with in parallel Doug Beattie leads the Ulster Unionist Party Campaigned for Remain It wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing The party is against the protocol It said there can be no border in the Irish Sea and wants to see the removal of checks of goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland It said it was ""regretful"" that the UK may move unilaterally to change it, but the ""stand-off cannot continue"" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood with other members of his party Campaigned for Remain It wants to see the immediate restoration of power-sharing The party acknowledges there are a ""small amount of issues with the protocol that remain outstanding"" But it says issues need to be sorted through negotiations between the UK and EU It does not back unilateral action by the UK government.

UK economy shrinks as higher prices bite,"Fears over the prospects for the UK economy have grown after it shrank again in April, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices. The economy contracted by 0.3% in April after it shrank by 0.1% in March,the Office for National Statistics said.,external April's figure was weaker than expected, and it was the first time the economy has contracted for two months in a row since Covid struck. Some analysts have warned the UK risks falling into a recession. Both households and businesses have been hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. The cost of filling up an average family car with petrol recently hit Â£100, and there have been signs that people are cutting back spending as costs rise. The Bank of Englandhas warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"", and has forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Warning UK to see slowest growth of developed nations April was the first time all main sectors of the economy - services, manufacturing and production - had shrunk since January 2021. The ONS said the main driver of April's contraction was in the services sector, due to the winding down of the NHS's Covid Test and Trace operation. It also said some businesses were continuing to struggle with the impact of price increases and supply chain shortages. JJ Foodservice, a wholesale food and catering company, supplies food products and ingredients from restaurants and takeaways to schools and private customers. Kaan Hendekli, the firm's Head of Operations, told the BBC energy prices and skill shortages were hurting the businesses, but said the price of fuel was having the biggest impact because ""it affects everything"". ""Every product essentially hits a lorry - whether we deliver or we receive it from suppliers or our suppliers receive it from the manufactures,"" he said. Kaan Hendekli, is JJ Foodservice's Head of Operations Mr Hendekli said the business was trying to be ""creative"" to reduce its outgoings, which included offering its customers good deals for collections and ordering in advance, as well as selling its own brand ingredients. ""Nobody wants to increase their prices but we've got no choice but to increase at the moment,"" he added. ""We are trying to find our own ways [to manage the situation]."" Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said the UK looked ""at increased risk of a technical recession"", which is defined as the economy contracting for two consecutive three-month periods. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, said the business group was ""expecting the economy to be pretty much stagnant"". ""It won't take much to tip us into a recession, and even if we don't, it will feel like one for too many people,"" he added. ""Times are tough for businesses dealing with rising costs, and for people on lower incomes concerned about paying bills and putting food on the table."" But Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a recession ""remains unlikely"", due tothe government's recently announcement support package, which includes a Â£400 energy bill discount for all UK households. Responding to the latest GDP figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not immune from global economic shocks, but added the government was ""fully focussed on growing the economy to address the cost of living in the longer term, while supporting families and businesses with the immediate pressures they're facing"". Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the figures were ""extremely worrying"" and would ""add to growing concern about abysmal growth and plummeting living standards under the Conservatives"". The fall in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in April was worse than expectations, but given the circumstances, can come as no surprise. This was the month of the record 54% hike in domestic energy bills, continued pressure at the pumps, the National Insurance hikes, and ongoing uncertainty from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Government sources pointed to the fact that the economy would have just about grown were it not for the one off effect of the winding down of pandemic test and trace services. However, by that logic, a number of previous GDP figures were also flattered by such figures. There have been three months on the trot now of zero growth. Only in January has the UK economy grown this year. While May should break that pattern, the chances are that the economy is contracting over this quarter. Current forecasts suggest this should not be the start of a technical recession, especially given the support to household incomes from the energy package last month, but that risk certainly hangs over the economy. Though the jobs figures continue to impress, interest rates and inflation continue to rise. The risk of a UK-EU trade war is now material, which could push up inflation more and risk investment. And there are further pressures on tax and spend from businesses calling for tax cuts, to public sector workers seeking pay rises matching double-digit inflation. The ONS said there were ""some common themes"" being reported by firms that were having a negative impact across different industries. It said many firms reported how the soaring costs of petrol and diesel meant they had to pay more for materials or ""had to raise the price of the products they sold"". ""Other respondents also reported that large increases in utility bills, particularly for gas and electricity, had affected them,"" the ONS said. Elsewhere, other firms reported price rises to other inputs such as animal feed, chemicals, aluminium, steel, cooking oil and fertiliser, while some respondents said they had ""difficulties"" in sourcing machinery, electronic components, kitchen appliances, and wire harnesses for cars.

Police find belongings of missing pair in Brazil,"Bruno Pereira (l) and Dom Phillips (r) pictured in 2018 Brazilian police say they have found personal items belonging to missing UK journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira. The items include Mr Phillips' boots and a backpack with clothes in, as well as Mr Pereira's health ID card, a flip-flop, black trousers and boots. The pair went missing while travelling by boat on a reporting trip in a remote Amazon rainforest on 5 June. Mr Phillips' wife and mother-in-law say they now presume the two men are dead. ""They are no longer with us,"" his mother-in-law wrote on Instagram. The post was later shared by the journalist's wife. Last week, the police found possible human remains in a river near the town of Atalaia do Norte. Experts have since been analysing the ""organic material"". Blood traces found on a boat belonging to a fisherman, who has been arrested, are also being tested. Another boat belonging to the suspect, named as Amarildo da Costa, was also discovered in the past 24 hours. Mr da Costa, known locally as ""Pelado"", has been questioned and charged with illegal possession of restricted ammunition. The authorities were helped by searches carried out by the indigenous communities. Over the weekend, they alerted the authorities to an area of vegetation on the side of the river where there were signs that a boat had been dragged through the area. This video can not be played Watch: Family and friends of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira want answers about their disappearance Bruno Pereira had many friends among the indigenous communities. With increasing government cuts to budgets for indigenous protection, he helped train indigenous people to defend themselves against the increasing threat of illegal fishermen and poachers. ""It's a huge loss for the indigenous - two men who fought and gave their life for the indigenous communities so we could live in peace,"" one leader said, who asked to remain anonymous. ""The community is shocked."" Indigenous groups say both men have received threats for their work in the region, which has seen illegal fishing, logging, mining and drug trafficking. The indigenous communities fear the same. ""A fisherman financed by the narcos will do what they probably did to Bruno, end our lives - because they see us as an obstacle.""

UK economy shrinks as firms battle higher prices,"Fears over the prospects for the UK economy have grown after it shrank again in April, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices. The economy contracted by 0.3% in April after it shrank by 0.1% in March,the Office for National Statistics said.,external April's figure was weaker than expected, and it was the first time the economy has contracted for two months in a row since Covid struck. Some analysts have warned the UK risks falling into a recession. Both households and businesses have been hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. The cost of filling up an average family car with petrol recently hit Â£100, and there have been signs that people are cutting back spending as costs rise. The Bank of Englandhas warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"", and has forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Warning UK to see slowest growth of developed nations April was the first time all main sectors of the economy - services, manufacturing and production - had shrunk since January 2021. The ONS said the main driver of April's contraction was in the services sector, due to the winding down of the NHS's Covid Test and Trace operation. It also said some businesses were continuing to struggle with the impact of price increases and supply chain shortages. JJ Foodservice, a wholesale food and catering company, supplies food products and ingredients from restaurants and takeaways to schools and private customers. Kaan Hendekli, the firm's Head of Operations, told the BBC energy prices and skill shortages were hurting the businesses, but said the price of fuel was having the biggest impact because ""it affects everything"". ""Every product essentially hits a lorry - whether we deliver or we receive it from suppliers or our suppliers receive it from the manufactures,"" he said. Kaan Hendekli, is JJ Foodservice's Head of Operations Mr Hendekli said the business was trying to be ""creative"" to reduce its outgoings, which included offering its customers good deals for collections and ordering in advance, as well as selling its own brand ingredients. ""Nobody wants to increase their prices but we've got no choice but to increase at the moment,"" he added. ""We are trying to find our own ways [to manage the situation]."" Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said the UK looked ""at increased risk of a technical recession"", which is defined as the economy contracting for two consecutive three-month periods. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, said the business group was ""expecting the economy to be pretty much stagnant"". ""It won't take much to tip us into a recession, and even if we don't, it will feel like one for too many people,"" he added. ""Times are tough for businesses dealing with rising costs, and for people on lower incomes concerned about paying bills and putting food on the table."" But Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a recession ""remains unlikely"", due tothe government's recently announcement support package, which includes a Â£400 energy bill discount for all UK households. Responding to the latest GDP figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not immune from global economic shocks, but added the government was ""fully focussed on growing the economy to address the cost of living in the longer term, while supporting families and businesses with the immediate pressures they're facing"". Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the figures were ""extremely worrying"" and would ""add to growing concern about abysmal growth and plummeting living standards under the Conservatives"". The fall in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in April was worse than expectations, but given the circumstances, can come as no surprise. This was the month of the record 54% hike in domestic energy bills, continued pressure at the pumps, the National Insurance hikes, and ongoing uncertainty from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Government sources pointed to the fact that the economy would have just about grown were it not for the one off effect of the winding down of pandemic test and trace services. However, by that logic, a number of previous GDP figures were also flattered by such figures. There have been three months on the trot now of zero growth. Only in January has the UK economy grown this year. While May should break that pattern, the chances are that the economy is contracting over this quarter. Current forecasts suggest this should not be the start of a technical recession, especially given the support to household incomes from the energy package last month, but that risk certainly hangs over the economy. Though the jobs figures continue to impress, interest rates and inflation continue to rise. The risk of a UK-EU trade war is now material, which could push up inflation more and risk investment. And there are further pressures on tax and spend from businesses calling for tax cuts, to public sector workers seeking pay rises matching double-digit inflation. The ONS said there were ""some common themes"" being reported by firms that were having a negative impact across different industries. It said many firms reported how the soaring costs of petrol and diesel meant they had to pay more for materials or ""had to raise the price of the products they sold"". ""Other respondents also reported that large increases in utility bills, particularly for gas and electricity, had affected them,"" the ONS said. Elsewhere, other firms reported price rises to other inputs such as animal feed, chemicals, aluminium, steel, cooking oil and fertiliser, while some respondents said they had ""difficulties"" in sourcing machinery, electronic components, kitchen appliances, and wire harnesses for cars.

"Food strategy will back farmers, Johnson says","Food will be grown in greenhouses covering acres of land under proposals to increase self-sufficiency to help guard against future economic shocks. ""Backing farmers"" is the focus of the government's long-awaited food strategy for England. The strategy announced today has been described by critics as ""half-baked"". It follows a landmark review of the food system by restaurant owner, Henry Dimbleby, who said only about half of his recommendations had been taken on. But the pledge to ""back farmers"" has been welcomed by the National Farmers' Union and the Soil Association. Salt and sugar tax plan to be ruled out Tax sugar and salt and prescribe veg, report says Soil at heart of farm grant revolution The report recommends investment in automated farming methods to improve productivity Speaking from a Cornish farm, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""supporting great British farming"" and putting money into modernisation and innovation. Thefood strategy,externalputs a focus on home-grown food, including strengthening supply chains and boosting food production. Â£270 million will be invested in technology to increase productivity and profitability The government will  consult on an ambition for 50% of public sector food spend to go on food produced locally or certified to higher standard A framework will be published next year on how to help farmers grow more food while also meeting legally-binding targets to halt climate change and nature loss. Restaurateur Henry Dimbleby said the policy document was not detailed enough to be called a strategy. The government's own adviser on food told the BBC: ""They've now implemented more than 50% of what I recommended, but it hasn't been done with one vision across the whole system."" Campaigners say the government must do more to restore nature Health campaigners are critical of the omission of recommendations for a tax on unhealthy foods. But Mr Dimbleby said his salt and sugar tax proposal would be responded to by the government at a later date, adding that Health Secretary Sajid Javid should ""be bold and brave in a difficult political context and act to break that junk food cycle"". He also expressed hope people can ""get away from this narrative of personal responsibility and education, which is important, but it isn't going to get us out of the hole we're in"". Sue Davies of consumer group, Which?, said the strategy lacked ambition and many of the recommendations had been ""watered down, ignored or put off for further consultation"". And conservation charity, The Wildlife Trusts, said the government had broken its promise to restore nature at scale. Conservation group, WWF, said making UK farming ""good for climate and nature"" was the only way to ""fix a broken food system to ensure healthy, affordable, sustainable food is available for everyone, now and for generations to come"". ""Putting nature and climate at the heart of our food system was a clear promise of this government at COP26 - now it must raise its game and prove it's got the backbone to deliver for people and planet,"" Katie White said.

"LiveLiveRussia could 'cut off' key Ukrainian city, official says17 minutes ago","The human cost of the battle for the city of Severodonetsk is very high and simply terrifying, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says All three bridges to the embattled eastern Donbas city have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai A pro-Russian separatist leader says Ukrainian troops there must ""surrender or die"" because ""there is no other option"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has warned that the war in Ukraine risks plunging millions into food poverty across the globe This comes as a senior Ukrainian official says the country's grain harvest is likely to drop by almost half this year, following the invasion Up to 1,200 bodies found across Ukraine, including some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, the head of the national police says Edited by Claire Heald A resident walks between apartment blocks in Bakhmut, Ukraine We're pausing our live coverage shortly. Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk. Maksym Katerin stands in the yard of his damaged house today, after his mother and his step-father were killed in shelling A man tries to put out a fire with a bucket of water after a bombardment destroyed the home next door on Friday A man and two boys cycle in an empty street in the city on Friday. In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

What is the government's Rwanda asylum plan?,"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

Legislation to change NI Protocol to be published,"This video can not be played The PM says the protocol is ""upsetting the balance of the Belfast Good Friday Agreementâ ahead of changes to be announced Boris Johnson will later publish plans to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal he struck with the EU in 2020. The PM wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to move between Britain and Northern Ireland. But the EU is against the move, saying it would break international law. The UK insists its proposals -to be set out in a parliamentary bill- are legal and will secure the future of the United Kingdom. The two sides agreed the protocol as they strived to maintain peace in Ireland - including the open Irish border - following Brexit. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Fifty two members of the 90 strong Northern Ireland Assembly, including those from Sinn FÃ©in, the Alliance and the SDLP, have written to the prime minister to say they ""reject in the strongest possible terms your government's reckless new protocol legislation"". No unionist assembly members signed the letter. Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin has called for negotiations between the UK and EU to deal with the impasse. He described the UK government's decision to change the protocol as a ""low point"", which was ""very regrettable"". The Republic of Ireland is still part of the EU's single market for goods and services, which the UK has left. Rather than impose a hard border - involving checks on goods and people moving between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic - the protocol introduces checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which won the second-most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly elections, argues this creates a divide that could lead to the break-up of the UK. It is refusing to set up a new ruling Northern Ireland executive with Sinn FÃ©in, which won most seats in the elections and accepts the protocol, until changes are made to the wording. There's been a long build up to this legislation which will, this week, generate a lot of noise. The EU won't ""sit by and watch the UK tear up a treaty"", warned one Brussels diplomat. The European Commission is expected to relaunch legal action against the UK, which was previously paused, once it's had a chance to analyse the bill. That's seen as a first step or ""low-hanging fruit"". But the commission is also likely, before long, to outline further ""flexibilities"" around its own proposals for easing checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. It won't be anything like the more fundamental rewriting of the treaty that the UK's calling for but officials on both sides have signalled that they don't see today's legislation as ending any prospect of further talks. In fact, some in Brussels view this bill, that's further exposed splits in a fractious Tory party, as a clumsy UK negotiating tactic. There's speculation too that Liz Truss is trying to burnish her leadership credentials with some Conservative Brexit supporters. But allies of the foreign secretary insist that, behind this potential law, there is a far simpler logic; if the EU won't renegotiate a treaty that is causing huge problems in Northern Ireland, then the UK government is obliged to act. Putting questions around blame and motives aside, one clear outcome of today looks set to be a further deterioration in post-Brexit relations between the UK and the EU. The UK government, despite signing up to the agreement in January 2020, has also raised concerns, prompting the publication of its bill later on Monday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she wanted to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol and restore political stability"", adding that Brussels must be ""willing to change"". But European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ tweeted that the UK's actions were ""damaging to mutual trust and a formula for uncertainty"". The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have experienced difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity. Food and horticulture importers have faced the greatest problems, as those goods face the most onerous controls. However, exporters, including food exporters, have benefited because unlike other parts of the UK they have maintained frictionless access to EU markets. The bill published later is expected to aim to remove checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain that are destined to remain there rather than enter the Irish Republic. Under the plans, businesses in Northern Ireland would be able to chose between sticking to either EU or UK standards, as well as UK VAT and state aid rules applying in Northern Ireland. It is also expected there would be a more limited role for the European Court of Justice. NI Protocol bill 'won't break international law' What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"Food strategy will back farmers, Johnson saysEngland's future food strategy is being released amid criticism from campaigners it lacks ambition.Science & Environment","Food will be grown in greenhouses covering acres of land under proposals to increase self-sufficiency to help guard against future economic shocks. ""Backing farmers"" is the focus of the government's long-awaited food strategy for England. The strategy announced today has been described by critics as ""half-baked"". It follows a landmark review of the food system by restaurant owner, Henry Dimbleby, who said only about half of his recommendations had been taken on. But the pledge to ""back farmers"" has been welcomed by the National Farmers' Union and the Soil Association. Salt and sugar tax plan to be ruled out Tax sugar and salt and prescribe veg, report says Soil at heart of farm grant revolution The report recommends investment in automated farming methods to improve productivity Speaking from a Cornish farm, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""supporting great British farming"" and putting money into modernisation and innovation. Thefood strategy,externalputs a focus on home-grown food, including strengthening supply chains and boosting food production. Â£270 million will be invested in technology to increase productivity and profitability The government will  consult on an ambition for 50% of public sector food spend to go on food produced locally or certified to higher standard A framework will be published next year on how to help farmers grow more food while also meeting legally-binding targets to halt climate change and nature loss. Restaurateur Henry Dimbleby said the policy document was not detailed enough to be called a strategy. The government's own adviser on food told the BBC: ""They've now implemented more than 50% of what I recommended, but it hasn't been done with one vision across the whole system."" Campaigners say the government must do more to restore nature Health campaigners are critical of the omission of recommendations for a tax on unhealthy foods. But Mr Dimbleby said his salt and sugar tax proposal would be responded to by the government at a later date, adding that Health Secretary Sajid Javid should ""be bold and brave in a difficult political context and act to break that junk food cycle"". He also expressed hope people can ""get away from this narrative of personal responsibility and education, which is important, but it isn't going to get us out of the hole we're in"". Sue Davies of consumer group, Which?, said the strategy lacked ambition and many of the recommendations had been ""watered down, ignored or put off for further consultation"". And conservation charity, The Wildlife Trusts, said the government had broken its promise to restore nature at scale. Conservation group, WWF, said making UK farming ""good for climate and nature"" was the only way to ""fix a broken food system to ensure healthy, affordable, sustainable food is available for everyone, now and for generations to come"". ""Putting nature and climate at the heart of our food system was a clear promise of this government at COP26 - now it must raise its game and prove it's got the backbone to deliver for people and planet,"" Katie White said.

US gun culture - in seven charts,"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.
