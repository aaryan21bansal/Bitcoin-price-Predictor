"Democracy is in retreat, warns foreign secretary","The foreign secretary has warned democracy is ""in retreat"", in a speech setting out his vision for the UK's role in the world. Dominic Raab argued democracies face their greatest threat since the end of the Cold War. He said that is why countries like Britain should try to be a ""force for good in the world"". It comes as the government faces criticism over the UK's future relationship with China. TheIntegrated Review of foreign and defence policy,externalset out by the government yesterday plans to increase the cap on the UK's stockpile of nuclear weapons. It also said Britain would shift its focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, while pledging to tackle the ""systemic challenge"" of China. UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' Ageing equipment puts Army at risk, MPs warn Speaking to the US Aspen Security Forum, Mr Raab predicted in the next decade, the combined wealth of autocratic regimes is likely to exceed that of the world's democracies. ""Think about what that means for a second,"" he said. ""Tyranny is richer than freedom, and that matters to us here at home. ""Because stable, freedom-respecting democracies are much less likely to go to war, house terrorists or trigger large scale flows of migrants and they are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with, and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems."" He said the UK has ""a moral responsibility and an indivisible stake in our planet, our global economy, our global ecosystem and the conditions of peace and stability that underpin them"". And he argued that the UK ""can and should help alleviate the worst suffering in the world"". Responding to the review on Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an ""era of retreat,"" with armed forces cuts ""every year for the last decade"". And he also said the UK's policy towards China had been ""inconsistent"" and accused the government of turning ""a blind eye"" to human rights abuses in the country. Meanwhile, Mr Raab has faced criticism after apparently telling officials the UK should trade with countries not meeting European Convention on Human Rights standards, ina leaked clip obtained by HuffPost UK,external. The Foreign Office said the recording was selectively clipped to distort the comments of the foreign secretary who, it said, had emphasised the importance of promoting human rights. The government is facing internal Conservative pressure to harden its stance on China over issues including its clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. The review said the UK should ""continue to pursue a positive trade and investment relationship"" with the country - prompting some criticism from backbenchers. Senior Tory Julian Lewis took issue with its description of China as a ""partner,"" adding it suggested suggested the ""grasping naivety"" of the party's approach under David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, ""still lingers on"". But giving evidence to a Lords committee on Wednesday, Mr Osborne defended his approach, arguing the UK should not take a ""dramatically different"" stance on Chinese investment. He told peers the UK was ""more likely to get a hearing"" over its human rights concerns by ""engaging"" with China economically. He added that forcing China to ""engage with the world"" was likely to improve British security in the long-run. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also defended the government's approach, arguing that to ""pull up the drawbridge"" would not be ""productive"" when it comes to rights issues. ""You can trade with a country and at the same time make very strong representations about their mistreatment of minorities and their human rights abuses,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme.

Thieves and burglars to be fitted with GPS tags,"Police will be able to cross-reference data from the tags to new crimes Prolific burglars, robbers and thieves are to be tagged with GPS trackers in a bid to stop them reoffending. Offenders will be automatically tagged for up to 12 months after being released from prison, under a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pilot. Gwent, Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Humberside and West Midlands police forces are all taking part. The MoJ said tracking offenders 24 hours a day would act as a deterrent. It estimated 250 offenders, who have served a year in prison, will be fitted with the tag in the first six months of the scheme, as part of their licence conditions. 'Sobriety tag' changed offender's life Police pressure as pandemic changes 'landscape of crime' 'I fought off dognappers who threatened to stab me' Police will be able to cross-reference the GPS data with reports of new thefts, robberies and burglaries to see if offenders were in the area at the time. Diane Titmus says she has stopped claiming on her insurance Burglars broke into Diane Titmus's hair salon, stealing about Â£2,000 of stock and all of her stylists' hairdryers and straighteners, in December last year. The break-in was the 12th time the Newport salon had been broken into in 30 years. ""They just took the most expensive items, they knew what they were doing,"" said Ms Titmus. ""The first time it happened was some years ago. I came in on the Christmas weekend, our biggest weekend, they had taken every single item. ""I had to run around to all my friends and borrow dryers, scissors, just to be able to work that day. ""I was really very, very upset, but also angry. How dare they? I worked really hard all my life to have this, just for someone to come in and take it."" Ms Titmus said it had happened so many times she no longer made claims on her insurance because of the increase it would mean to her premium. ""Other times they've cost me Â£500 when they break a window and they probably had about 30p in pennies that were left in the drawer,"" she said. ""We just have to write it off as a loss. We work hard for a week to pay the burglar - that's how it works out."" More than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released During the coronavirus pandemic, the number of theft and burglary offences in England and Walesfell as many people stayed at home. Minister for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said, with levels expect to return to those seen before Covid-19, the tagging pilot was ""critical"". ""We want to make sure we help those offenders get back on the straight and narrow,"" he said. ""We think 24-hour-a-day supervision, through this tag on their ankle, will help them to realise that they're effectively being watched, and therefore choose something else to do, other than go back to their former crime. ""It's a rigorous supervision in a way that we haven't really seen before and we think it will have a big impact."" Kit Malthouse said the tags would help catch repeat offenders More than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released from prison, according to MoJ figures. It said these types of crimes cost the public an estimated Â£4.8bn a year, yet 79% of theft cases and 62% of robbery cases resulted in no suspect being identified - compared with an average of 24% in all other cases. Following the pilots, the MoJ said it planned to roll out the scheme, run by the National Probation Service, to a further 13 forces in September. Tags have already been introduced in parts of England and Wales to monitor whether offenders who who were convicted of committing crimes while fuelled with alcohol, have been drinking. The ""sobriety tags"" monitor sweat levels of the wearer every 30 minutes to see whether they have drunk alcohol. The probation service is then alerted if they have had a drink. Amanda Blakeman said she hoped targeting serial offenders would reduce crime in the area Gwent's Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said a small number of offenders were committing thefts, burglaries and robberies. ""Offenders tend to be serial offenders doing quite a lot of these types of crime over a short period of time, that can be very forensically aware, they can locate premises that aren't overlooked so there aren't any witnesses and then it becomes very difficult to pull those clues together to solve that particular crime. ""Obviously with the ability to be able to tag our persistent offenders it means we're able to see where they are and if they're in proximity of offences that have occurred,"" she said.

MPs call for inquiry into Football Index 'scandal',"Queens Park Rangers has now removed Football Index sponsorship from its shirts. A group of MPs has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling for a public inquiry into the collapse of gambling website Football Index. They say it is ""a scandal"" and shows the need to reform the gambling sector. The firm has suspended operations and appointed administrators, sparking an outcry from punters whose money is still locked up in the business. There are reports gamblers could lose more than Â£90m, with some now seeking legal advice about possible claims. In their letter, the MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gambling Related Harm estimate that Football Index punters have lost Â£3,000 each on average. ""This can only be termed a scandal,"" said chair Carolyn Harris. ""It underlines the need for wholesale reform of the gambling industry and raises significant questions of the Gambling Commission, given they saw fit to licence this platform and failed to enact adequate oversight."" Not only does there need to be a urgent inquiry, it is more evidence of the need to create a Gambling Ombudsman to help protect consumers, she said. Ben, aged 22, estimates the collapse in the value of his Football Index portfolio will cost him close to Â£6,500. ""I feel embarrassed and cheated,"" he told the BBC. ""The crash has affected me mentally."" He lives at home and has no dependents, so thinks he got off lightly. ""There are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse; lost far more than me. ""I'll never trust Football Index again. I will go elsewhere and enjoy my love of football with other companies and probably bet in a more conventional way. But it will make me think twice before putting money into other companies. ""Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index."" Punters feel the company has ""stitched up their loyal fan base"", he said. Read more about the young gamblers who lost thousands. Football Index hit serious financial problems earlier this month. The company cut dividend pay-outs on players, sparking a crash in their ""share"" price value. This change in the terms and conditions meant the value of gamblers' portfolios plummeted, with many users taking to social media to report losses of thousands of pounds  - even tens of thousands. Several punters contacted the BBCwith reports of the impact on their finances, and called for action against the company and the regulator, the Gambling Commission. A group of gamblers has formed an action group, and on Tuesday it was announced that law firm Leigh Day is looking into possible legal action against Football Index parent company BetIndex on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money. Gambling reform campaigner Matt Zarb-Cousin is working with lawyers and Football Index customers about possible legal action. Leigh Day partner Nichola Marshall said the role of the Gambling Commission will also come under scrutiny. Ms Marshall said: ""Whilst it is very early days in our investigations on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money, there are serious questions which will need answering regarding what has happened at Football Index and what the Gambling Commission understood of Football Index's activities."" Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Clean Up Gambling campaign, who is working with Football Index customers and Leigh Day, said: ""Football Index ended up in a situation where they needed new customers to honour the dividend payments to existing users. ""It was a business run in an entirely unsustainable way, which people do not expect of a licensed operator in a regulated sector. The Gambling Commission has been asleep at the wheel."" Fast-growing Football Index launched in 2015 and allowed users to buy what it called ""shares"" in professional footballers. The firm paid users ""dividends"" according to player performances. If a player performed well or transferred to a bigger club, the transfer value went up and so did the ""share price"". The aim for users was to identify rising stars, buying shares in them while still relatively cheap before selling at a profit after their values rose. Football Index called itself a ""challenge to traditional bookmakers"" and an alternative to the regular stock market which it said could ""seem intimidating and inaccessible"". But although it used the terminology of the stock market, Football Index was regulated by the Gambling Commission, not the Financial Conduct Authority. In an update on Tuesday about the administration, BetIndex said it still hoped the company could ""be rescued as a going concern"". It added: ""Our priority is to safeguard the interests of our customers and to seek the best outcome for our community with the goal of continuing the platform in a restructured form."" The BBC has asked the Gambling Commission for comment. Last week the regulator said it was carrying out its own inquiries, pointing out it had concerns Football Index was not operating ""in accordance with a condition of its licence"".

Hairdressers to open on 5 April as Scots rules ease,"This video can not be played Hairdressers and garden centres set to open in Scotland Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""brighter days are ahead of us"". The ""stay at home"" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to ""stay local"" for a further three weeks. Live: Nicola Sturgeon announces easing of lockdown What Covid rules are changing, and when? What will Scotland's new Covid levels look like? Other changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April. All children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April. Hairdressers can reopen from 5 April The first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including ""a significant majority of Scotland's adult population"" - by mid-April. She said this would ""give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April"". It is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that: restrictions on travel within mainland Scotland will be lifted gyms will reopen for individual exercise remaining shops will open, along with tourist accommodation, museums, libraries and galleries up to six people from three households can meet outside, while under-18s from up to six households are allowed to gather pubs, cafes and restaurants can open outdoors until 22:00 and can sell alcohol indoor hospitality can open until 20:00, but alcohol will not be allowed and people must meet in groups of up to four people from two households work in people's homes can resume, as can driving lessons up to 50 people can attend weddings and funerals A decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept ""under ongoing review"". She told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest. Other changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises. But Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like ""normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs"" - would involve ""plucking it out of thin air"". However, she said she was ""optimistic"" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues. ""This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,"" she said. Restrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or ""as soon as possible thereafter"". However, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus. She said that ""our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that"" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place ""for some time to come"". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome. However, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments. And she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can ""get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed ""effective testing and tracing"" systems to keep infections low. He called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that ""transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close"". Data not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland. The first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored. When Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic. Today, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme. But the first minister said this was the ""most hopeful"" she had felt for a long time and that ""something much closer to actual normality"" might be achieved as we move into summer. The change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown. Ms Sturgeon said the government had to make ""careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions"" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving ""steadily and in one direction"". The final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the ""need for medium term-support"". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year. Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was ""most welcome for everyone"", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses. Ms Sturgeon said that ""any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission"", and that ""we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can"". Scottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the ""indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area"". The first minister said everything was ""predicated on the data going in the right direction"", and that ""all bets are off"" if case numbers rise sharply again. She told MSPs that her ""hope and ambition"" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month.

UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We will... relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values"" The UK is set to reverse plans to reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by the middle of the decade, as part of a foreign policy overhaul. The overall cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010. The UK will shift focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, described as the world's ""growth engine"". And it pledges the UK will do more on the ""systemic challenge"" of China. Outlining the strategy to MPs, Boris Johnson said the UK would have to ""relearn the art"" of competing against countries with ""opposing values"". But he added the UK would remain ""unswervingly committed"" to the Nato defence alliance and preserving peace and security in Europe. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an ""era of retreat,"" with armed forces cuts ""every year for the last decade"". Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy UK to shift foreign policy focus after review Theintegrated review,externalof foreign and defence policies, which runs to over 100 pages, has taken over a year and sets out UK priorities until 2030. The UK nuclear stockpile is estimated to comprise 195 warheads, and had been due to fall to 180 by the mid-2020s under a 2010 defence review. But the latest assessment says this ambition is ""no longer possible"" given the ""evolving security environment"" over the last decade. It adds that the UK will no longer publish figures on the size of its operational stockpile, to maintain ""deliberate ambiguity"" for adversaries. However, it pledges the UK will maintain the ""minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK's nuclear deterrent remains credible"". The review, which identifies Russia as the ""most acute threat"" to UK security, also says: It is ""likely"" that a terrorist group will launch a successful chemical, biological or nuclear attack by 2030 The UK will set up a new counter-terrorism operations centre to improve the response to terror attacks The government wants the UK to become a ""science and tech superpower"" by the end of the decade The review also pledged to reverse cuts on foreign aid, from 0.7% of national income down to 0.5%, when ""the fiscal situation allows"". The government haspreviously faced criticismfor the cuts, which it said were necessary in the wake of financial challenges posed by the Covid pandemic. The review argues the UK should refocus its foreign policy towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia in the ""Indo-Pacific"" region. It said the region's shipping lanes were vital to maintain UK trade with Asia, whilst the region is also on the ""frontline of new security challenges"". Analysis by Rob Watson, BBC World Service UK Political Correspondent What's striking about the review is the continuity in UK foreign policy. So just as before Brexit and ""Global Britain"", the UK continues to see the main threats to its security as China, Russia, terrorism and cyber attacks.  And it continues to have as its main goals, among other things, the promotion of democracy, free trade, human rights and the fight against climate change. There are differences, though. The most striking is the suggestion of a pivot away from Europe to the Indo-Pacific. But exactly what that means is not spelled out (although we do know Boris Johnson will travel to India next month, and there will be new focus on new partnerships and trade agreements with south-east Asian countries). More broadly, Mr Johnson's central claim is that leaving the EU will make the UK more nimble and flexible, whether it's in how to deal with China or becoming a science superpower or anything else. Critics will say the review is long on aspiration and that the UK will face the same global challenges it faced before Brexit - but with one fewer foreign policy tool in its toolbox, namely its membership of the EU. Mr Johnson said: ""The review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values."" He said the UK had led international condemnation of China's ""mass detention"" of Uighur people in Xinjiang, and its actions in Hong Kong, adding: ""There is no question China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours."" In response, Sir Keir said UK policy towards China had been ""inconsistent"" and the government had ""turned a blind eye"" to the country's human rights abuses. He said Labour remained committed to retaining nuclear weapons, but said the document had failed to detail the ""strategic purpose"" for increasing the warhead stockpile. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""This review breaks the goal... to reduce our nuclear stockpile"" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the review demonstrated ""just how hollow the brand of Global Britain is"". He also asked the prime minister ""who gave his government the democratic right to renege on the UK's obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty"" referring to the government's plans on nuclear weapons. Speaking to the BBC, Beatrice Fihn - head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons -  described the UK's decision to change its nuclear provision as ""outrageous, irresponsible and very dangerous"". She said it went against international law and didn't address the real security threats faced by Britain such as climate change and disinformation. Analysis by Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent The review calls China the ""biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"". But there is clearly disquiet among the government's own MPs that it hasn't been robust enough in identifying the challenge posed by its Communist regime. Former Conservative foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was worried by its description of China as a ""systemic"" challenge, given its current clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. Another senior Conservative, Julian Lewis, took issue with its description of China as a ""partner"". He added it suggested the ""grasping naivety"" of the party's approach under David Cameron and George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, ""still lingers on"". Boris Johnson said there was a ""balance to be struck"", and although the UK wanted a ""strong trading relationship,"" it should be ""clear-eyed"" and ""tough where we see risk"". But the trade-offs between seeking investment and protecting the UK from becoming too vulnerable to Chinese economic and political influence and pressure will come under increasing scrutiny.

"Uber to pay minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions","This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

Mother's anguish over parallels with Everard case,"Sales executive Moira, who was 40 when she was murdered in May 2008, and her mother Bea The mother of a woman who was abducted and murdered in Glasgow has expressed her concern for Sarah Everard's family. Bea Jones said she had been left ""distressed"" by the similarities between the case and what happened to her own daughter, Moira, in 2008. And she has urged the public to keep Sarah's loved ones in mind. Bea wrote: ""We send love to them all and wish them all the strength they need to get through all the dark days ahead."" Moira Jones was randomly abducted yards from her home and forced into nearby Queen's Park, where she was raped and beaten to death. The diary of my daughter's murder Catching the park killer who vanished 'like a ghost' New service launched to help families of murder victims Slovakian national Marek Harcar was jailed in 2009 for the murder and the judge set the punishment part of his life sentence at 25 years. Lord Bracadale said the crime had ""shocked the nation"" and told Harcar: ""Your conduct that night reflects a level of wickedness very rarely encountered."" In a bid to cope with her loss, former teacher Bea wrote a harrowing diary, which last year featured in BBC Scotland documentaryThe Dark Shadow of Murder. She also set up a charity,The Moira Fund,external, to help bereaved families. Bea, from Weston, Staffordshire, decided towrite a letter,externaloutlining her fears about the Sarah Everard case after receiving multiple media approaches for comment. Ms Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Sarah Everard has been described by her family as ""kind, thoughtful, caring and dependable"" Bea wrote: ""We have been very distressed by what has happened to Sarah, similar in many respects, to Moira's ordeal. ""I really could not face talking about this and thought that perhaps one open letter would suffice."" She said her main concern was for Sarah's family and loved ones. She wrote: ""They are totally devastated and bewildered and vulnerable. They cannot fully take in what has happened and the permanence of what has occurred. ""They have experienced nightmare on top of nightmare as events have unravelled and their beautiful missing daughter became another murder victim. And there seems no end to it."" Bea says she can understand the reaction and response from women nationwide to the shocking crime and believes Sarah's family may have been comforted by the thought that ""so many were grieving with them"". But she continues: ""Now it has all escalated into a media frenzy more representative of individual anger than of shared grief. ""I am very concerned thatevents have developedto such an extent that those who matter most, Sarah and her family, are being totally swamped and further traumatised by what is going on around them, adding trauma to trauma. ""How can they cope at all? There is only so much that a head can absorb and a heart can cope with and they have so much more to find out in the weeks and months ahead as dreadful details of Sarah's death are revealed to them."" A stone marks the spot in Queen's Park where Moira's body was discovered Bea says the family need to be protected from media intrusion and then turns her thoughts towards Sarah's mother, whom she says will have a head full of questions about what happened to her daughter and what she went through. Drawing on her own experiences, she lists several, including: ""Did she know how very much we loved her?"" Bea continues: ""There are no answers to these questions, there never will be, but she will keep on asking them, over and over torturing herself. I ask them still - not so often but after 13 years I ask them still. ""Sarah's mum needs time and space to ask them too, to run all sorts through her head before an avalanche of other information descends. ""Her family have lived with the joy of Sarah for 33 years and the loss of that joy will affect them for the rest of their lives. It will be a long time before they can even get past the trauma, to start processing the awfulness of it all and being able to grieve. There really are no words to describe that awfulness."" Notes and ribbons were tied to the gates of Queen's Park in Glasgow's southside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""struck"" by this tribute left in Glasgow's Queen's Park to Moira Jones, who was murdered in 2008. She also tweeted a picture of a candle lit to remember ""Sarah, and all the others"" As part of the nationwide events, ribbons and messages have been tied to the gates of Queen's Park including many which mention Moira, 40, by name. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to the sales executive on social media at the weekend and said she thought of Moira every time she walked through the park in the south side of the city. Bea said she had been moved by the fresh messages of support for her ""darling girl"", who moved from London to Glasgow in 2003. The campaigner has previously described how she cannot bear to say the name of the man who killed Moira. Hu and Bea Jones outside court after the verdict was delivered Bea also called on the media to focus on Sarah Everard as opposed toMet police officer Wayne Couzens, who is accused of murdering and kidnapping the marketing executive. She concludes her letter by pledging to continue to support those who have been bereaved by violence and urges the public never to forgot the pain they go through. She wrote: ""We frequently read and hear of murder cases in the news but it is rare indeed for us to read of the plight of those left behind, whose lives that are changed forever by the violent death of a loved one.""

Trial date for PC accused of Sarah Everard's murder,"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A Met police officer is due to go on trial in the autumn accused of the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Wayne Couzens, of Deal, appeared at the Old Bailey via a videolink from Belmarsh Prison. The judge set a plea hearing date for 9 July and a provisional trial for 25 October. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? The court heard the provisional trial could last up to four weeks. Prosecutor Tom Little QC said the circumstances of the case had led to a ""very significant and wide-ranging investigation"". He told the court the case had attracted ""almost unprecedented media and public attention"". Wayne Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018 In the short hearing, Mr Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. The 48-year-old wore grey tracksuit bottoms, a red top and appeared to have two cuts on his head. No bail application was made by defence barrister James Sturman QC, who also said legal aid was yet to be granted. Mr Couzens was charged on Friday and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday. Wayne Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh Prison Ms Everard had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home. She never arrived and was reported missing by her boyfriend the next day. Her body was found a week later inside a builder's bag in an area of woodland in Ashford and was identified through dental records. A post-mortem examination has taken place but no cause of death has been released. The court heard Sarah Everard's disappearance had attracted ""unprecedented media attention"" An inquest into the death of Ms Everard is likely to be opened later this week, Kent County Council has said. Mr Couzens joined the Met in September 2018 and was initially based in the Bromley area. In February last year he moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in London.

Care home residents 'dehumanised' by staff,"Stanley Bradford, June Hamer, Evelyn Jones and Edith Evans were all residents at Brithdir Residents at a care home were ""dehumanised"" by staff and the standards of care were ""wholly inadequate"", an inquest has found. The deaths of six residents at Brithdir Nursing Home from 2003-2005 in New Tredegar, Caerphilly,eventually triggered a police investigation. Coroner Geraint Williams said residents were ""warehoused"", meaning they are ""simply kept, fed and watered"". The evidence suggested ""even the feeding and watering was inadequate"". Stanley James, 89, June Hamer, 71, Stanley Bradford, 76, Edith Evans, 85, Evelyn Jones, 87, and William Hickman, 71 were all residents at the home. This video can not be played The coroner said there was a ""gross betrayal of the trust relatives placed in Brithdir"" The coroner said their families were ""deliberately"" kept in the dark about the existence of pressure sores, and families were ""deceived"" ""This was a gross betrayal of the trust relatives placed in Brithdir,"" he told the court. However, a lack of available evidence and multiple staff looking after residents meant he could not reach a conclusion of unlawful killing in any of the cases. Documentation, including care plans and feeding charts were ""in some cases clearly fabricated"". The coroner said the ""lowest point"" was how residents were ""dehumanised"", including when incontinence pads were changed in the home's lounge in front of other residents. The manager Peter Smith's statement said he believed they would not have realised because they had dementia. Care home owner Prana Das avoided a trial after suffering a brain injury in 2012 when he was attacked in his home Geraint Williams said the points outlined ""contributed significantly"" to the deaths of the six residents. At the start of the inquest,which began in January, Mr Williams said: ""It is a matter of regret that so many years have passed, with the consequence that the families have been denied justice for so long."" In relation to the six residents, the coroner gave the following conclusions: Stanley James developed ""multiple"" pressure sores during his time at Brithdir but the coroner said that expert Malcolm Hodkinson had told the inquest he could not say that Mr James died of the ulcers. The coroner said he accepted the cause of death given for Mr James by a GP at the time. But he added: ""The lack of care did cause the pressure ulceration. He was not being turned in accordance with his care plan."" Referring to a former nurse at the home, Daphne Richards, he said her failings in relation to Mr James were ""truly, exceptionally bad"". June Hamer lost three stone (19kg) and had a serious pressure sore while at the care home The coroner said June Hamer had a ""painful and uncomfortable death"". ""Mrs Hamer received an incredibly poor standard of care in Brithdir. She was frequently left in wet clothes. Generally her personal hygiene was neglected by staff and pressure sores were allowed to develop,"" he told the court. Geraint Williams said he believed an infected pressure sore played a part in her death, adding: ""It is clear that Mrs Hamer needed prompt and appropriate medical care. I find the the failure was gross and directly contributed to her death."" The coroner said William Hickman had 17 areas of pressure damage to his skin while at Brithdir. When he was admitted to hospital, he had a pressure sore 3.5in by 2in (9cm by 5cm) in size and was in an ""awful physical condition"". Considering the evidence, the coroner said he considered there to have been ""gross failings in the care provided which were a direct cause of his death. Further I find it was obvious that Mr Hickman needed basic care"". Mr Bradford had a ""wicked sense of humour"" but his health deteriorated following a stroke in 2001 The coroner said he found the evidence of Mr Bradford's daughters ""powerful and completely believable"" and he agreed Mr Bradford had been ""forgotten about"" by staff at the home. ""In my opinion the evidence demonstrated overwhelmingly the standard of care was grossly deficient and was a significant contributory factor to his death,"" he said. ""It was abundantly clear that Mr Bradford needed care and this should have been obvious to the most inexperienced of staff."" His daughters Pam Cook and Gaynor Evans were appalled by what happened and believed action should have been taken against Dr Prana Das sooner. Stanley Bradford's daughters Pam Cook and Gaynor Evans and granddaughter Haley Evans (centre) wondered if others suffered ""We can't believe how it was left to just go on and on,"" Mrs Evans said. ""They knew what was happening and the risks to residents, and he was still allowed to have his homes open. They should have been shut down. ""It makes me think now how many other residents, before this all came out, how many others suffered and died from neglect?"" Mrs Evans said ""someone"" should have been jailed ""especially Dr Das"". ""He got away with it all,"" she said. Mrs Cook said: ""We've shed a lot of tears and had a lot of upset but besides that it has made us very, very angry. ""This was left to go on and no-one stopped it and everyone blames each other."" Edith Evans spent six years at Brithdir Care Home Mr Williams said there were ""gross failings at every level"" in the ""haphazard and slapdash"" care of Edith Evans which contributed to her death. Mrs Evans's family had raised concerns about the cleanliness of a feeding tube into her stomach, known as a PEG. When taken to hospital, staff were shocked at the level of care. Her appearance was described as ""unclean, with dirty and matted hair, incontinent and dirty with faeces"". Her feeding tube was infected with the superbug MRSA. Staff at the home said they were not aware of a problem with the PEG, which Mr Williams found ""inconceivable"" Senior nurse and manager Phil McCaffrey had denied any knowledge of the poor state of Mrs Evans's PEG, which the coroner called ""simply untrue"" adding he had showed ""gross failures that contributed to Mrs Evans's death"". Edith Evans's nieces Betty and Gaynor Williams were ""horrified"" by what happened to their aunt Mrs Evans, did not have any children, but was survived by nieces Gail Morris, Gaynor Williams and Betty Williams. ""We were horrified,"" Gaynor Williams said. ""There's more come out and we thought we knew everything, we knew so little."" Mrs Morris said: ""I think we have been angry since October 2005 when Edie went into hospital and that's when we found out how bad things were."" They said they had learnt their aunt contracted MRSA twice. Like other families, they only found out Dr Das ran Brithdir after the death of Mrs Evans. ""When they said Aunt Edie was going into Brithdir and we said 'didn't Dr Das own it?' and they said 'no, he's not there now',"" Gaynor Williams said. Mrs Morris said: ""It would be nice to say it won't happen again, but I think it could easily happen again."" Evelyn Jones was one of the care home residents whose family raised concerns The coroner said that the details he heard in relation to Evelyn Jones amounted to ""institutional abuse"". A 50cm (20in) pressure sore on Mrs Jones's back was described by doctors as ""the worst they had seen"". ""It is clear that failure was a direct cause of Mrs Jones's death - the totality is overwhelming - and there was a flagrant disregard for her obvious need for medical attention,"" said Mr Williams. The coroner also assessed evidence from the owners and managers at the home, as well as the state agencies. He found Dr Das, the owner of Puretruce Health Care Ltd which owned 22 homes including Brithdir, was ""aggressive to all who opposed him"" and his ""sole concern was making money from his businesses"". The coroner said Paul Black, the chief executive of the company, was an ""unreliable and dishonest witness"" who played an active and direct part in deceiving the state agencies"". The state agencies, including Caerphilly Local Health Board, Caerphilly council and Care Inspectorate Wales, were often ""too focused on systems and processes"". Giving his formal conclusions, the coroner said given the fact that many staff were involved in the care of residents, and that some evidence was not available, it was ""not safe to reach a conclusion of unlawful killing"" for any of the residents. For Stanley James he gave conclusion of natural causes. For June Hamer, William Hickman, Stanley Bradford, Edith Evans and Evelyn Jones he recorded narrative conclusions and said all five deaths ""were contributed to by neglect"". The coroner ended by thanking the families of the six residents. He said: ""I wish to pay tribute to the families for the honourable and dignified way that they had conducted themselves. ""It is a considerable regret that it has taken so long and I hope the families now feel that justice has been done for their loved ones."" Following Operation Jasmine, a policy inquiry into deaths at six care homes in south Wales, Dr Prana Das was due to stand trial on neglect and fraud charges, butthe trial was called off after he suffered brain damage when he was attacked in his home by two intrudersin 2012. He died in January 2020. An inquest into the death of a seventh resident, Matthew Higgins, 86, will be held now this hearing has concluded. The author of a review into the alleged abuse at nursing homes in south east Wales said people must ""never be complacent"" about levels of care. But Dr Margaret Flynn said she did not believe there was anything of the same scale at present in Wales as that seen at Brithdir. She said there had been significant changes, but there still needed to be more scrutiny of private companies running care homes. ""Changes did result from this dreadful time in health and social care, in regulation and in policing, because these poor people's injuries and their experiences were made visible and what was once tolerated is no longer tolerated,"" she said. ""We have reason to be hopeful but we may never, ever be complacent. Care homes can change with every shift and it's important we remain attentive to that. ""I share the disappointment of the families that it is very unlikely there will ever be prosecutions."" Care home boss was 'rude and offensive' Problems at care home 'were making staff ill' Care neglect inquiry doctor 'did not help police' Care home resident developed '50cm pressure sore' Nurse's care for residents 'sincere', inquest told Care home resident had been 'unclean for some time' Care home resident ""looked like prisoner of war"" Daughter fed residents at 'hopeless' care home Doctor charged with care home neglect dies Neglect claim care home nurse 'struggled to cope' Anger at abuse cases inquiry refusal.

"Uber to pay minimum wage, holiday pay and pensionsTaxi app's decision follows court ruling that drivers should be classed as workers, not self-employed.Business","This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

"MPs call for inquiry into Football Index 'scandal'The failure of the betting site raises serious questions about regulation of the gambling industry, MPs say.Business","Queens Park Rangers has now removed Football Index sponsorship from its shirts. A group of MPs has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling for a public inquiry into the collapse of gambling website Football Index. They say it is ""a scandal"" and shows the need to reform the gambling sector. The firm has suspended operations and appointed administrators, sparking an outcry from punters whose money is still locked up in the business. There are reports gamblers could lose more than Â£90m, with some now seeking legal advice about possible claims. In their letter, the MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gambling Related Harm estimate that Football Index punters have lost Â£3,000 each on average. ""This can only be termed a scandal,"" said chair Carolyn Harris. ""It underlines the need for wholesale reform of the gambling industry and raises significant questions of the Gambling Commission, given they saw fit to licence this platform and failed to enact adequate oversight."" Not only does there need to be a urgent inquiry, it is more evidence of the need to create a Gambling Ombudsman to help protect consumers, she said. Ben, aged 22, estimates the collapse in the value of his Football Index portfolio will cost him close to Â£6,500. ""I feel embarrassed and cheated,"" he told the BBC. ""The crash has affected me mentally."" He lives at home and has no dependents, so thinks he got off lightly. ""There are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse; lost far more than me. ""I'll never trust Football Index again. I will go elsewhere and enjoy my love of football with other companies and probably bet in a more conventional way. But it will make me think twice before putting money into other companies. ""Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index."" Punters feel the company has ""stitched up their loyal fan base"", he said. Read more about the young gamblers who lost thousands. Football Index hit serious financial problems earlier this month. The company cut dividend pay-outs on players, sparking a crash in their ""share"" price value. This change in the terms and conditions meant the value of gamblers' portfolios plummeted, with many users taking to social media to report losses of thousands of pounds  - even tens of thousands. Several punters contacted the BBCwith reports of the impact on their finances, and called for action against the company and the regulator, the Gambling Commission. A group of gamblers has formed an action group, and on Tuesday it was announced that law firm Leigh Day is looking into possible legal action against Football Index parent company BetIndex on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money. Gambling reform campaigner Matt Zarb-Cousin is working with lawyers and Football Index customers about possible legal action. Leigh Day partner Nichola Marshall said the role of the Gambling Commission will also come under scrutiny. Ms Marshall said: ""Whilst it is very early days in our investigations on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money, there are serious questions which will need answering regarding what has happened at Football Index and what the Gambling Commission understood of Football Index's activities."" Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Clean Up Gambling campaign, who is working with Football Index customers and Leigh Day, said: ""Football Index ended up in a situation where they needed new customers to honour the dividend payments to existing users. ""It was a business run in an entirely unsustainable way, which people do not expect of a licensed operator in a regulated sector. The Gambling Commission has been asleep at the wheel."" Fast-growing Football Index launched in 2015 and allowed users to buy what it called ""shares"" in professional footballers. The firm paid users ""dividends"" according to player performances. If a player performed well or transferred to a bigger club, the transfer value went up and so did the ""share price"". The aim for users was to identify rising stars, buying shares in them while still relatively cheap before selling at a profit after their values rose. Football Index called itself a ""challenge to traditional bookmakers"" and an alternative to the regular stock market which it said could ""seem intimidating and inaccessible"". But although it used the terminology of the stock market, Football Index was regulated by the Gambling Commission, not the Financial Conduct Authority. In an update on Tuesday about the administration, BetIndex said it still hoped the company could ""be rescued as a going concern"". It added: ""Our priority is to safeguard the interests of our customers and to seek the best outcome for our community with the goal of continuing the platform in a restructured form."" The BBC has asked the Gambling Commission for comment. Last week the regulator said it was carrying out its own inquiries, pointing out it had concerns Football Index was not operating ""in accordance with a condition of its licence"".

But Mr Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, adds: ""To be told that we can open without alcohol is, frankly, ludicrous. ""Only opening until 8pm doesn't do us any good at all. ""All the way down the line here there will be people who find it impossible to open, impossible to be viable."" Mr Waterson says even at Level zero there will be many smaller premises that will not be allowed to reopen due to social distancing restrictions. He adds: ""We are going to have to wait a long tie to get back to some viability."" Mr Waterson told Drivetime some of his members have amassed debts of between Â£90,000 and Â£60,000 during the pandemic. BBC Radio Scotland Hairdresser and barber salons are to reopen for

Hairdressing & Beauty Salon in Glasgow's city centre, says he is ""over the moonâ at being able to resume haircuts. The beauty side of his business will have to wait until 26 April when ""close contact"" services are allowed to restart. Mr Moran says the mental health benefits of

The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. BBC Radio Scotland George Gouding, who runs a garden
centre in the Clyde Valley, says it is ""very welcome news"" to be told his business can open indoor and outdoors from 5 April, three weeks earlier than other non-essential retail. He said the last update on the road map did not give any clarity but now there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Mr Gouding said opening garden centres would be good for people who could now get out in the fresh air and work in their garden. The garden centre business also has a restaurant, which will not be able to open for sit-in customers until 26 April. BBC Radio Scotland Jamie Scott, owner of the Newport restaurant, says the length of time businesses are having to wait is ""nonsensical"". Mr Scott, former winner of Masterchef Professionals, adds it is ""so poor"" the sector is having to wait longer to reopen than hairdressers. He says: ""I don't understand how you can walk into a non-essential retail shop, not give any details over, be in there as long as you like, not be policed in what you are doing, touch everything you want and leave when you want."" Mr Scott compares this to the set up at his restaurant, which must abide by track and trace and have strict measures in place. Ewan MacDonald Russell from the Scottish Retail Consortium tells Radio Scotland: ""We're certainly quite happy with what we heard today."" Mr Russell says retailers will welcome garden centres and hardware stores reopening on 5 April and also click and collect services being opened up to everyone ""This will allow smaller shops the ability to compete online."" He also welcomes ""the big opening date on the 26 April, when we can finally get shops reopened after what feels like an eternity closed."" Mr Russell also welcomes the stay local message that will replace the stay at home message on 2 April, encouraging shoppers to go their local high street. A lot of local shops are ""surviving on government grants which is not where anybody wants to be"", he adds. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of
Commerce, says the first minister's statement will enable many
businesses and customers to start planning and preparing for re-opening. She adds the intention to relax travel restrictions
should support the viability of the tourism, hospitality and retail sectors. But Dr Cameron also calls for clarification of what is allowed in the various levels of restrictions, sooner
rather than later. She adds: ""We would urge alignment across all UK nations which enables
the industry to restart together and to avoid confusion for travellers."" On the establishment of restart grants, Dr Cameron says: ""It makes more sense to provide businesses with a lump sum
so they can deploy these resources where it can be of most use."" BBC Radio Scotland Lockerbie-based hotel owner Stephen Montgomery tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime that today's announcement is ""horrible for hospitality"". Mr Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, says there is ""pent up demand from customers"" but he adds: ""From 9 October we have seen hospitality shut across the central belt and the spike in positive cases went right through the roof. ""So it is well seen alcohol cannot be attributed to this. What happened is that people gathered in homes."" He warns that unless businesses get a clear run in the summer they will end up experiencing another period comparable with the winter. Figures updated at 14:00 daily. Read the full breakdownhere. Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""brighter days are ahead of us"". The ""stay at home"" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to ""stay local"" for a further three weeks. Read more here. BBC Radio Scotland For some non-essential retail, today's news was less good. Hairdressers and
barbers will reopen on Monday, 5 April, but other retail outlets will have to
wait another three weeks until 26 April. Kerrie Guiney, who runs the Perfect Fit shoe shop in
Peebles, tells Drivetime: ""I'm feeling a bit confused, a bit upset that we're not on the list of shops that is classed as essential. ""We totally expected to be able to reopen on the 5th of April or at least sooner than the 26th of April."" So yeah feeling a bit disappointed that putting, no offence, haircuts, and putting being able to go and buy a new car and a new plant for your garden ahead of children's feet and making sure our children are in properly fitted footwear. Kerrie Guiney, Show shop owner Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Data
not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland. The
first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus
suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should
be restored. When
Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some
for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic. Today,
thereâs caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and
keeping up the vaccination programme. But
the first minister said this was the âmost hopefulâ she had felt for a long
time and that âsomething much closer to actual normalityâ might be achieved as
we move into summer. The
change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before
the first anniversary of the original lockdown. Sohairdressers and barbers will re-open on Monday 5 Aprilbut other retail outlets will have to wait
until 26 April. Karen Thomson, who owns KAM Hair and Body
Spa in Lossiemouth, tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime this is the news she was hoping for: ""We are all just so excited. Our hair department will get back so we will be able to cut and colour. ""Our beauty department will have to wait till we get further notice. ""But just to get back to hair will be amazing."" Ms Thomson says E-mail salon messages have been going crazy already: I'm just glad that part of my business can get back. Haircuts, for all of us, it's not just about the haircut it's about how people feel, about the feelgood factor... Hopefully we've learned a lot and it will be quite seamless going back."" Karen Thomson, KAM Hair and Body Spa in Lossiemouth The Campaign for
Real Ale says pubs will need continued financial support to cope
with a ""devastating"" return to restrictions. CAMRA Scotlandâs director Joe Crawford said: âPub goers,
licensees and brewers will be disappointed to see our pubs being
treated unfairly compared to similar businesses like cafÃ©s and
non-essential retail. âThe return
of curfews and a ban on alcohol being consumed indoors is
devastating news for the industry which is looking to reopen Covid-secure
venues so that people can socialise safely."" Mr Crawford welcomed the restart
grants announced by the government, but added without a full and proper
reopening and with continuing restrictions, more support would be needed before his members could trade at full
capacity. For many businesses it just wonât be worthwhile opening back up as they wonât be able to turn a profit under these draconian restrictions. Joe Crawford, CAMRA Scotland director The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. See the detailshere,external. The Federation of
Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the first minister's announcement  but warned that the survival of
many local firms is still in doubt. Policy chair Andrew McRae said the indicative dates allowed many firms
to plan ahead, while the ""restrained optimism from the first minister may encourage
some small businesses not to throw in the towel."" But he cautioned that many businesses faced a countdown before their reserves of
cash and resolve were exhausted. He said: ""Half of all Scottish independent business owners say they're
worried about their survival, and official figures show that local Scottish
enterprises are laden with billions of pound of debt. ""The crisis is nowhere
near finished for thousands of important local Scottish firms."" He added more action was needed to help local
businesses deal with the long-term consequences of the pandemic. From 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was expected all parts of Scotland currently in level 4 would move down to a ""modified"" level 3.
The island communities currently in level 3 will have the option to move at that stage to level 2 but this could have implications for travel and will be discussed further. LEVEL 3 The new ""modified"" level 3 from 26 April would see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant. Up to six people from up to three households can socialise outdoors. All remaining retail premises and close contact services will re-open. Gyms can open for individual exercise. Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open. Funerals and weddings including post-funeral events and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (no alcohol). LEVEL 2 From 17 May, it is hoped that all level 3 areas - or as many as possible - will move to level 2. This will see hospitality venues open until 22:30 indoors (alcohol permitted, two-hour dwell time) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls can reopen. Outdoor adult contact sport and indoor group exercise can restart. LEVEL 1 From early June, the ambition is for all of Scotland will move to level 1 - which will allow for a further easing of restrictions. Up to six people from up to three households will be able to socialise indoors in a home or public place. Up to eight people from three households can socialise outdoors. Eight 12-17 year olds can meet socially from eight households outdoors. Hospitality can remain open until 23:00. Indoor non-contact sport can take place. LEVEL 0 By the end of June, it is hoped that all of Scotland will move to at least level 0. This could mean a phased return of some office staff. The Scottish government will be assessing the situation on an ongoing basis, with a view to restoring as much normality as possible. BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime is due to begin on Radio Scotland shortly and will have all the reaction and analysis to the first minister's timetable out of lockdown. This includes being able to get ahaircut on April the 5th and a trip to the gym, the shops, a hotel, a cafe and a beer garden from the 26th. However there will be no visiting other people indoors before 17 May. Join Laura MacIver from 4pm. Alison Johnstone says the Scottish Greens support a cautious approach to easing lockdown, but warns of the increase in daily case numbers compared with last week. Ms Johnstone says there has been reports of an increase in cases due to theunsafe gathering of football fans in Glasgow. She also asks about a ""marked increase"" in case numbers in children under 14 years old and whether lateral flow testing will be introduced for students. The first minister says lateral flow testing will be used to support the return of further and higher education students in April. Ms Sturgeon says there has been a small number of cases amongst the people that gathered for the ""football incident"" in Glasgow. She adds there may be more cases due to the incubation period. The first minister warns any time people come together, there is a greater increase in the chance of transmission and highlights mitigations brought into schools. Â© 2025 BBC.

New safety measures after Sarah Everard killing,"""Immediate steps"" aimed at improving safety for women and girls in England and Wales have been announced by No 10 after Sarah Everard's death. Among them is an additional Â£25m for better lighting and CCTV as well as a pilot scheme which would see plain-clothes officers in pubs and clubs. Campaigners say the money is not enough and called for institutional changes. Labour said meaningful changes to law are needed rather than plans involving ""police officers in skinny jeans"". It comes afterhundreds of people protestedin central London on Monday. Ms Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Following a meeting of the government's Crime and Justice Taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take ""immediate steps"" to give ""further reassurance"" to women and girls in the wake of the killing of Ms Everard. No 10 said it would double the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to Â£45m. Undercover police will be sent to clubs, bars and popular nightspots to relay intelligence about predatory or suspicious offenders to uniformed officers, in pilots of so-called Project Vigilant, rolled out across the country. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' How many attacks on women are there? LISTEN: How can women feel safer? Safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins said undercover officers working in the night-time economy would feed intelligence to uniformed officers. She said the government would work with businesses and police to ensure, as the industry reopened following the coronavirus lockdown, ""that women can feel safe in our streets"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" But Labour's shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips told BBC Breakfast that in her years of experience, she had not come across experts or victims calling for more CCTV in public spaces. She accused ministers of being ""caught on the hop"" and rolling out plans involving ""police officers in skinny jeans"" rather than meaningful changes to legislation regarding street harassment, or a detailed review of how rape is prosecuted in England and Wales. The shadow home secretary, Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the measures were ""nowhere near good enough"" and called for ""urgent action"" on issues like harassment of women, domestic homicide sentencing and more support for victims of rape. Labour MP Stella Creasy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more funding for better street lighting was not unwelcome, but ""it really just doesn't understand what the issues are"". She said measures focused on policing nightspots do not recognise ""that women get abused, assaulted and intimidated in all sorts of places"". Dr Ellie Cosgrave, a lecturer in urban innovation and policy at University College London, said it was right that the government consider lighting as a way to help make cities safer, but added: ""You can't just shove a light in and hope that the public space will be better."" She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that ""over-lighting"" some areas in a city can make other areas feel less safe. Dr Cosgrave said the best action ministers can take to make cities safer is to understand the ""social dynamics"" of an area by conducting surveys, speaking to people, and implementing change based on what they say. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast it was good news that more women were feeling more confident to report rape allegations, but he added ""we still haven't done well enough to get the evidence that can secure convictions"". A spokeswoman for organisation Reclaim These Streets said it welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were ""so important"". ""Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,"" she said. This video can not be played Dania Al-Obeid: ""All I wanted was to stand with other women"" Home Secretary Priti Patel had warned against holding vigils, and has launched a review into the policing of a gathering over the weekend insouth London in memory of Ms Everard. During that event, officers handcuffed and removed several women after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects. On Monday, hundreds marched across central London in what was said to be a meeting by Sisters Uncut, which describes itself as an ""intersectional feminist direct-action collective"", with many of those in attendance carrying placards. Four people were arrested- three on suspicion of breaching coronavirus regulations and a fourth on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker. A further two people were issued with fixed penalty notices, the Metropolitan Police said. Protests will be able to legally resume on 29 March, when the coronavirus ""stay at home"" order lifts in England. The prime minister's spokesman said demonstrations will continue to be subject to Covid-secure precautions such as appropriate measures to maintain social distancing. Meanwhile, MPs will continue debating the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill later, which would change how protests are managed, including allowing police to impose conditions such as start and finish times. Labour has criticised the bill saying it did ""nothing to help women feel safer"", and imposed ""disproportionate"" controls on freedom of speech. Ms Patelsaid the bill would end the halfway releaseof those convicted of sexual offences such as rape and also said the Domestic Abuse bill was on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, which she said would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"".

But Mr Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, adds: ""To be told that we can open without alcohol is, frankly, ludicrous. ""Only opening until 8pm doesn't do us any good at all. ""All the way down the line here there will be people who find it impossible to open, impossible to be viable."" Mr Waterson says even at Level zero there will be many smaller premises that will not be allowed to reopen due to social distancing restrictions. He adds: ""We are going to have to wait a long tie to get back to some viability."" Mr Waterson told Drivetime some of his members have amassed debts of between Â£90,000 and Â£60,000 during the pandemic. BBC Radio Scotland Hairdresser and barber salons are to reopen for
appointments on 5 April. Michael Moran, who owns Pele
Hairdressing & Beauty Salon in Glasgow's city centre, says he is ""over the moonâ at being able to resume haircuts. The beauty side of his business will have to wait until 26 April when ""close contact"" services are allowed to restart. Mr Moran says the mental health benefits of
hair and beauty cannot be stressed enough. âIt gives you such a shot in the arm,"" he says. ""You feel better, you

The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. BBC Radio Scotland George Gouding, who runs a garden
centre in the Clyde Valley, says it is ""very welcome news"" to be told his business can open indoor and outdoors from 5 April, three weeks earlier than other non-essential retail. He said the last update on the road map did not give any clarity but now there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Mr Gouding said opening garden centres would be good for people who could now get out in the fresh air and work in their garden. The garden centre business also has a restaurant, which will not be able to open for sit-in customers until 26 April. BBC Radio Scotland Jamie Scott, owner of the Newport restaurant, says the length of time businesses are having to wait is ""nonsensical"". Mr Scott, former winner of Masterchef Professionals, adds it is ""so poor"" the sector is having to wait longer to reopen than hairdressers. He says: ""I don't understand how you can walk into a non-essential retail shop, not give any details over, be in there as long as you like, not be policed in what you are doing, touch everything you want and leave when you want."" Mr Scott compares this to the set up at his restaurant, which must abide by track and trace and have strict measures in place. Ewan MacDonald Russell from the Scottish Retail Consortium tells Radio Scotland: ""We're certainly quite happy with what we heard today."" Mr Russell says retailers will welcome garden centres and hardware stores reopening on 5 April and also click and collect services being opened up to everyone ""This will allow smaller shops the ability to compete online."" He also welcomes ""the big opening date on the 26 April, when we can finally get shops reopened after what feels like an eternity closed."" Mr Russell also welcomes the stay local message that will replace the stay at home message on 2 April, encouraging shoppers to go their local high street. A lot of local shops are ""surviving on government grants which is not where anybody wants to be"", he adds. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of
Commerce, says the first minister's statement will enable many
businesses and customers to start planning and preparing for re-opening. She adds the intention to relax travel restrictions
should support the viability of the tourism, hospitality and retail sectors. But Dr Cameron also calls for clarification of what is allowed in the various levels of restrictions, sooner
rather than later. She adds: ""We would urge alignment across all UK nations which enables
the industry to restart together and to avoid confusion for travellers."" On the establishment of restart grants, Dr Cameron says: ""It makes more sense to provide businesses with a lump sum
so they can deploy these resources where it can be of most use."" BBC Radio Scotland Lockerbie-based hotel owner Stephen Montgomery tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime that today's announcement is ""horrible for hospitality"". Mr Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, says there is ""pent up demand from customers"" but he adds: ""From 9 October we have seen hospitality shut across the central belt and the spike in positive cases went right through the roof. ""So it is well seen alcohol cannot be attributed to this. What happened is that people gathered in homes."" He warns that unless businesses get a clear run in the summer they will end up experiencing another period comparable with the winter. Figures updated at 14:00 daily. Read the full breakdownhere. Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""brighter days are ahead of us"". The ""stay at home"" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to ""stay local"" for a further three weeks. Read more here. BBC Radio Scotland For some non-essential retail, today's news was less good. Hairdressers and
barbers will reopen on Monday, 5 April, but other retail outlets will have to
wait another three weeks until 26 April. Kerrie Guiney, who runs the Perfect Fit shoe shop in
Peebles, tells Drivetime: ""I'm feeling a bit confused, a bit upset that we're not on the list of shops that is classed as essential. ""We totally expected to be able to reopen on the 5th of April or at least sooner than the 26th of April."" So yeah feeling a bit disappointed that putting, no offence, haircuts, and putting being able to go and buy a new car and a new plant for your garden ahead of children's feet and making sure our children are in properly fitted footwear. Kerrie Guiney, Show shop owner Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Data
not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland. The
first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus
suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should
be restored. When
Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some
for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic. Today,
thereâs caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and
keeping up the vaccination programme. But
the first minister said this was the âmost hopefulâ she had felt for a long
time and that âsomething much closer to actual normalityâ might be achieved as
we move into summer. The
change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before
the first anniversary of the original lockdown. Sohairdressers and barbers will re-open on Monday 5 Aprilbut other retail outlets will have to wait
until 26 April. Karen Thomson, who owns KAM Hair and Body
Spa in Lossiemouth, tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime this is the news she was hoping for: ""We are all just so excited. Our hair department will get back so we will be able to cut and colour. ""Our beauty department will have to wait till we get further notice. ""But just to get back to hair will be amazing."" Ms Thomson says E-mail salon messages have been going crazy already: I'm just glad that part of my business can get back. Haircuts, for all of us, it's not just about the haircut it's about how people feel, about the feelgood factor... Hopefully we've learned a lot and it will be quite seamless going back."" Karen Thomson, KAM Hair and Body Spa in Lossiemouth The Campaign for
Real Ale says pubs will need continued financial support to cope
with a ""devastating"" return to restrictions. CAMRA Scotlandâs director Joe Crawford said: âPub goers,
licensees and brewers will be disappointed to see our pubs being
treated unfairly compared to similar businesses like cafÃ©s and
non-essential retail. âThe return
of curfews and a ban on alcohol being consumed indoors is
devastating news for the industry which is looking to reopen Covid-secure
venues so that people can socialise safely."" Mr Crawford welcomed the restart
grants announced by the government, but added without a full and proper
reopening and with continuing restrictions, more support would be needed before his members could trade at full
capacity. For many businesses it just wonât be worthwhile opening back up as they wonât be able to turn a profit under these draconian restrictions. Joe Crawford, CAMRA Scotland director The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. See the detailshere,external. The Federation of
Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the first minister's announcement  but warned that the survival of
many local firms is still in doubt. Policy chair Andrew McRae said the indicative dates allowed many firms
to plan ahead, while the ""restrained optimism from the first minister may encourage
some small businesses not to throw in the towel."" But he cautioned that many businesses faced a countdown before their reserves of
cash and resolve were exhausted. He said: ""Half of all Scottish independent business owners say they're
worried about their survival, and official figures show that local Scottish
enterprises are laden with billions of pound of debt. ""The crisis is nowhere
near finished for thousands of important local Scottish firms."" He added more action was needed to help local
businesses deal with the long-term consequences of the pandemic. From 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was expected all parts of Scotland currently in level 4 would move down to a ""modified"" level 3.
The island communities currently in level 3 will have the option to move at that stage to level 2 but this could have implications for travel and will be discussed further. LEVEL 3 The new ""modified"" level 3 from 26 April would see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant. Up to six people from up to three households can socialise outdoors. All remaining retail premises and close contact services will re-open. Gyms can open for individual exercise. Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open. Funerals and weddings including post-funeral events and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (no alcohol). LEVEL 2 From 17 May, it is hoped that all level 3 areas - or as many as possible - will move to level 2. This will see hospitality venues open until 22:30 indoors (alcohol permitted, two-hour dwell time) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls can reopen. Outdoor adult contact sport and indoor group exercise can restart. LEVEL 1 From early June, the ambition is for all of Scotland will move to level 1 - which will allow for a further easing of restrictions. Up to six people from up to three households will be able to socialise indoors in a home or public place. Up to eight people from three households can socialise outdoors. Eight 12-17 year olds can meet socially from eight households outdoors. Hospitality can remain open until 23:00. Indoor non-contact sport can take place. LEVEL 0 By the end of June, it is hoped that all of Scotland will move to at least level 0. This could mean a phased return of some office staff. The Scottish government will be assessing the situation on an ongoing basis, with a view to restoring as much normality as possible. BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime is due to begin on Radio Scotland shortly and will have all the reaction and analysis to the first minister's timetable out of lockdown. This includes being able to get ahaircut on April the 5th and a trip to the gym, the shops, a hotel, a cafe and a beer garden from the 26th. However there will be no visiting other people indoors before 17 May. Join Laura MacIver from 4pm. Alison Johnstone says the Scottish Greens support a cautious approach to easing lockdown, but warns of the increase in daily case numbers compared with last week. Ms Johnstone says there has been reports of an increase in cases due to theunsafe gathering of football fans in Glasgow. She also asks about a ""marked increase"" in case numbers in children under 14 years old and whether lateral flow testing will be introduced for students. The first minister says lateral flow testing will be used to support the return of further and higher education students in April. Ms Sturgeon says there has been a small number of cases amongst the people that gathered for the ""football incident"" in Glasgow. She adds there may be more cases due to the incubation period. The first minister warns any time people come together, there is a greater increase in the chance of transmission and highlights mitigations brought into schools. Â© 2025 BBC.

Golden Globes make diversity pledge after backlash,"A man protested on the night of the Golden Globes last month, outside the LA hotel where the awards were filmed Organisers of the Golden Globe film and TV awards have pledged to increase diversity by making sure at least 13% of its membership is black. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has been criticised after a report said none of its 87 members are black. More than 100 Hollywood PR firms have signed a letter to say they will advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA until changes are made. They accused the organisation of ""discriminatory behaviour"". The HFPA said it was ""committed to making necessary changes"". Its members are all international journalists based in Los Angeles, who vote for the winners of the glitzy annual awards. Nomadland and Borat win top Globe awards Director Chloe Zhao makes history at Golden Globes In pictures: Golden Globes 2021 The HFPA said it would add a minimum of 13 black members,increasing the total membership to at least 100.,external The threatened boycott could prove costly to the HPFA because its members often make their living writing articles from press conferences and interviews with film and TV stars. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, this year's virtual Globe award hosts, poked fun at the HFPA during this year's ceremony The letter from the PR group, published on Monday, read: ""We call on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to swiftly manifest profound and lasting change to eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption endemic to the HFPA. ""To reflect how urgent and necessary we feel this work is, we cannot advocate for our clients to participate in HFPA events or interviews as we await your explicit plans and timeline for transformational change."" Tina Chen, president and CEO of Time's Up, added in a statement: ""We are proud to be in solidarity with the voices of over 100 Hollywood PR firms in calling for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to radically transform the Golden Globes. ""We agree that anything less than transparent, meaningful change will no longer be acceptable. The entire world is watching."" In its response, the HFPA added: ""We also acknowledge that we should have done more."" The group's legal advisers have begun to implement changes, ""including a comprehensive review of our governance and code of conduct"", it continued. ""While we recognise this is a long-term process, we will continue to be transparent, provide updates, and have confidence in our ability to change and restore trust in our organisation and the Golden Globes. ""As we do so, we invite others in the Hollywood community to join us in advancing racial equity in our industry."" Controversy about the make-up of the HFPA has been circling for some time. The LA Times recently reported,externalthat there are currently no black members of the HFPA, and the organisation responded by saying it wasworking on an ""action plan"" to rectify this.,external Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, the sequel to 2006's hugely successful Borat, was named best musical or comedy film at last month's awards. ""Thank you to the all-white Hollywood Foreign Press,"" said Sacha Baron Cohen as he accepted the prize. ChloÃ© Zhao won best director for Nomadland at last month's Golden Globes No. The publicists' accusations of ""ethical impropriety"" and ""unprofessionalism"" are nothing new. It has been suggested repeatedly over the years that the HFPA's small and secretive membership pool means the choices of nominees and winners can be swayed by promotions and freebies from production companies. In the Los Angeles Times expose, it was also reported that HFPA members were flown to Paris by Netflix in support of its comedy series Emily in Paris, which received two nominations at this year's Globes. Many critics expressed surprise because the show has had lukewarm reviews, whereas the critically acclaimed I May Destroy You was left out of the nominations. A source close to the HFPA told BBC News last month that it is common for journalists to attend set visits, premieres and press conferences, adding that members attend 15-20 trips per year on average. They said the airfare to the Emily In Paris set was paid for by the HFPA and not the studio. The suggestion that such trips have any influence on nominations was ""absurd"", they added, pointing out that set visits to many other TV shows in the last year had not led to nominations.

The days when the country edged close to disaster,"At the beginning of March 2020, I asked a senior member of the government: ""Do you feel worried?"" They replied: ""Personally? No."" But just weeks later, Downing Street was scrambling to manage the biggest crisis since World War Two. Since then, monumental decisions have had to be taken. And there have been many accusations of failings - the desperate shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), Covid ripping through unprepared care homes, hundreds of billions borrowed and spent to keep the economy going, to name a few. I have asked 20 of the most senior politicians, officials and former officials, who either witnessed or were involved in the big decisions, to pick five pivotal moments from the past 12 months. What they say tells us so much about what really happened, what our leaders were thinking, and, strikingly, how little they knew. The contributors are not being named, so they could speak freely. On 31 January, it was reported that coronavirus had arrived in the UK, as two people were admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, more than 80 Britons evacuated from China were quarantined at a facility in the north-west of England. But for the government, Brexit had sucked up all the political energy - it was the day the country officially left the EU. The prime minister and his team were exhausted but elated. It felt like Boris Johnson had ""just really started to take flight"", one member of the team tells me. Ministers and officials had already been meeting to discuss the virus in China - but it felt thousands of miles away. There was a ""lack of concern and energy,"" one source tells me. ""The general view was it is just hysteria. It was just like a flu."" The prime minister was even heard to say: ""The best thing would be to ignore it."" And he repeatedly warned, several sources tell me, that an overreaction could do more harm than good. A small group in Downing Street had started daily meetings, after, according to one of those who attended, ""it became clear that there was no proper, 'Emergency break-the-glass' plan."" But for many of those I've spoken to, the game-changer was at the end of February, when the virus took hold in northern Italy - it was closer to home, and England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had, one minister told me, warned that if it got out of China, it would become global, and be on its way to the UK. ""The biggest moment for me was when I saw those pictures of northern Italy,"" one senior minister says. ""I thought that will be us if we don't move."" Reports of the chaos there catapulted the virus, one senior minister says, ""from not on the radar, to people on the floor of hospitals in Lombardy."" They say that was the moment ""we knew that it was inevitable"". Ministers and officials became locked in arguments over how to respond. The prime minister and many cabinet ministers were reluctant to consider anything as draconian as a lockdown. To many people, the very idea would have seemed fanciful. Even stopping shaking hands seemed a step too far for the prime minister. Before the first major coronavirus briefing on 3 March, he had, I am told, been prepared by aides to say, if asked by journalists, people should stop shaking hands with each other - as per government scientific advice. But he said the exact opposite. ""I've shaken hands with everybody,"" he said, about visiting a hospital with Covid patients. And it was not just a slip, one of those present at the briefing says. It demonstrated ""the whole conflict for him - and his lack of understanding of the severity of what was coming"". A Downing Street spokesperson told the BBC: ""The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed."" By this point, Mr Johnson was attending emergency committee Cobra meetings with officials and leaders from Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff - although he had missed the first few. But one senior politician who attended at the same time says: ""The early meetings with the prime minister were dreadful."" And inside Downing Street, senior staff's concerns about the government's ability to cope grew. There were huge logistical considerations about equipment, facilities and how fast the disease might move in the UK, and questions about how effective the actions taken in China to suppress the virus would be here. It was not well understood, for example, that people without symptoms could still pass it on, nor that Britons returning from half-term holidays in northern Europe were bringing the virus back home in large numbers. ""There was a genuine argument in government, which everyone has subsequently denied,"" one senior figure tells me, about whether there should be a hard lockdown or a plan to protect only the most vulnerable, and even encourage what was described to me at that time as ""some degree of herd immunity"". There was even talk of ""chicken pox parties"", where healthy people might be encouraged to gather to spread the disease. And while that was not considered a policy proposal, real consideration was given to whether suppressing Covid entirely could be counter productive. On 3 March, when the prime minister set out the government's plan, the focus was on detecting early cases and preventing the spread. But on 12 March, with journalists crammed into the state dining room at No 10, he told the public that the country was facing its worst health crisis in a generation. Anyone with symptoms was told to stay at home for a week. Advisers seemed confident it was not yet time to close schools or stop large crowds gathering. And the government's scientists felt they had time to slow everything down - the peak was not expected for another 10-14 weeks. That same week, though, nervousness was rising among others in government that the virus was outpacing everyone's expectations, and the plans in place to smooth out the outbreak would not work. One source tells me it felt like the ""government machine was breaking in our hands"", things were ""imploding"", and within 48 hours the approach outlined on the 12th would feel out of date. There has been no shortage of controversy over whether the government was too slow to close the doors on 23 March - but many of the conversations I have had, pinpoint the moment it became urgent in No 10. On 13 March, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee concluded the virus was spreading faster than thought. But it was Downing Street ""modellers in the building"", according to one current official, who pored again over the numbers, and realised the timetable that had only just been announced was likely to result in disaster. The next morning, a small group of key staff got together. Simple graphs were drawn on a whiteboard and the prime minister was confronted with the stark prediction that the plan he had just announced would result in the NHS collapsing under the sheer number of cases. Several of those present tell me that was the moment Mr Johnson realised the urgency - that the official assumptions about the speed of the spread of this new disease had been wrong. To prevent the NHS ""falling over"", he was warned, the government would have to impose measures as infections rose. And while they could be relaxed as cases fell, this pattern might recur across ""multiple waves for 18 months"". Several sources recall vividly the ""snake like graph"" they were shown that day. Then, one official says, everything started to move at ""lightning speed"". And behind closed doors - before the terrifying projections of Imperial College became public, a couple of days later - plans were accelerated. On 16 March, the public were told to stop all unnecessary social contact and to work at home if possible. New cabinet committees were formed. And the machine moved into a different phase, with the prime minister and the ""quad"" - Matt Hancock, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - the new decision-making form. It was, I am told, ""high tension - [with] a lot of testosterone in the room"". For many inside government, the pace of change that week was staggering - but others remain frustrated the government machine, in their view, had failed to move quickly enough. There was tension between those who wanted to ensure systems were as ready as they could be first, and others who argued vociferously that moving fast against the virus was more important than anything else. But those I spoke to now agree on one thing - how much they did not know about the disease. ""You can kick yourself about the things that you wish you knew,"" one minister says, ""but we just didn't have anything in place."" Another cabinet minister says: ""It's easy to say we should have locked down longer, gone harder, but there are more complex debates about where the national interests really lie."" And it was all so strange. One minister who made some of the public announcements when lockdown came says: ""I remember when I wrote it into the script, I just couldn't believe that I was saying this."" And one official, struck by how huge it all felt, says he googled: ""Did they shut the schools during the War?"" Another, meanwhile, admits, ""We were more blind than we told the public,"" and suggests that is still the case one year on. On 18 March, we reported that a small number of members of staff in No 10 had fallen ill. One insider says: ""People were dropping like flies."" The prime minister, however, was acting as though he was impervious to the risk. He had developed a habit of banging his own chest, telling staff he was ""strong as a bull"". Soon, though, this chest-banging turned into ""extreme coughing fits"". Tests, in short supply everywhere, were requested for him from 25 March. And two days later, he tested positive. He switched to the chancellor's bigger suite of offices so that he could keep working, screened off from the rest of the building. Insiders recall how much he hated this and, in a second spell of isolation in the autumn, chairs had to be placed across the door ""like a puppy gate"", so he could still communicate with the tiny number of staff allowed into the same part of the building. Then, at the end of March, the prime minister became increasingly ill - each video call he made to reassure the public required more takes. On 6 April, he agreed to go to St Thomas' Hospital and, struggling for breath on a phone call, I have been told, confirmed he wanted Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stand in for him. Initially, Downing Street tried to give the impression that all was well. Journalists were even told that Mr Johnson was working on his red boxes. That message has been put down to a mix up, and we now know this was far from the truth. The moment of genuine crisis came when he was moved into intensive care. No-one knew if the prime minister would make it through the night - or what the plan was if he did not. By this point, with so many in No 10 and in government already sick, there were, I have been told, about ""half a dozen people running things"". Fears that he might need to be intubated were shared by a tiny group inside Number 10. They discussed the possibility that ministers would have to gather in the cabinet room, with the doors closed, until they chose a successor - but there was no fixed protocol, and no conclusion was reached. The Tory Party, I have been told, even started to consider how to transfer the leadership without a contest, fearing that such a competition could be seen as ""venal"" after the prime minister's death. Then cabinet ministers were summoned urgently for a conference call. ""All of a sudden we were asked to join this call - not knowing if he was alive,"" one tells me.  Then No 10 prepared to make the news public. The Downing Street voice on the other end of the phone cracked with fear as I was asked to get to the Foreign Office as soon possible with a camera to talk to Mr Raab, who was being sent out to try to reassure the country. We reported the news that Mr Johnson was in intensive care from the back of a taxi. A former official tells me: ""We thought we really could lose him - we had to plan for a full transition."" That night was ""long and shocking"", one source says. By the end of May, the number of coronavirus cases was falling, the prime minister was back at work full time, and the public had surprised the government by overwhelmingly sticking to the rules. Furthermore, despite some embarrassing and prominent lockdown breaches - in April, for example, Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to quit over her visits to her holiday home - there had been what one senior minister describes as ""tremendous goodwill"". But then came the Mirror and the Guardian's scoop - in March, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled hundreds of miles to County Durham, after his wife fell ill with Covid. He, too, succumbed to the virus and his stay on his family's farm to recover, before returning to London, had been kept secret - apart from among a tiny number of Downing Street staff. And Mr Cummings was determined not to quit. After considering sacking him, the prime minister stuck by him - but first, there was what has been described to me as tense ""mediation between a couple deciding whether to divorce"". Before making that decision, he had summoned Mr Cummings to go through his version of events. Together, they planned for him to give this version publicly - despite others' protestations. The result was the surreal press conference in the Downing Street rose garden. Many of those I have talked to describe this episode as a terrible turning-point. ""Even for us, this is mad,"" a member of the Downing Street team tells me. Senior ministers say: ""The handling was a fiasco"". ""It was ridiculous"", and, at a time of national emergency, ""broke the political consensus"". Perhaps, after two months of lockdown, the public was ready to be angry with someone. MPs' inboxes were swamped with irate emails - mine too. ""The early pandemic washed away all the bitterness of Brexit,"" one senior minister tells me. ""That all came flooding back, all that bile, all that pent up frustration."" Some ministers tweeted their support for Mr Cummings. One of those who refused says: ""He should have resigned straight away. You lead by example. I was busy chopping logs with my chainsaw to get the frustration out."" Some polling suggests the Barnard Castle episode really did dent the public's trust in the government. ""It gave people who wanted to break the rules an excuse,"" one source says. But inside government, there was a belief that an extraordinary period of unity had already started to fade, and the public had started to tire of the rules once the government had moved towards its plans to lift them. There is no question, though, the whole misadventure made the politics of the pandemic more scratchy and less consensual. Mr Cummings was not the only one to be caught up. In June, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, provoked anger by attending a huge Republican funeral. But it was after Barnard Castle that it felt like the mood in the country had changed. ""People wanted to portray the PM as a clown,"" one minister tells me, ""or not up to the level of events."" Britain in the summer did not feel like a country still gripped by a pandemic. ""There was loads of over optimistic messaging,"" one politician says. For example, the time when a Labour MP asked for advice at the end of June for his constituency, which was home to a popular beach and he was worried about huge numbers heading for the sea. ""Show some guts,"" the prime minister told him. In July, a grinning chancellor delivered plates of Japanese curry to unsuspecting customers at a London restaurant, to promote his ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Then the prime minister started to encourage people back to the office. But behind closed doors, there were significant doubts about the wisdom of this new mood. ""We knew there was going to be a second wave,"" one cabinet minister tells me, ""and there was a row about whether people should work from home or not - it was totally ridiculous."" The summer optimism and opening was ""the biggest mistake - a rush of blood to the head"", another senior figure says. ""The PM has to carry the can"". The prime minister believed that another lockdown would be a disaster and wanted to avoid it at all costs - but for many of those involved in making the decisions, his hostility to tightening the rules again was frustrating, dangerous and political. ""The policy objective in the summer and the autumn was - do the minimum possible,"" one tells me. But by the end of August, with Britons packing beaches, the warnings of what might come were already flickering in Number 10. Some days, sources suggest, the prime minister would express concern about the virus coming back. Others, he would be in ""let-it-rip mode"". And senior officials expressed deep concern about what seemed to be changes of heart on a daily basis. The disease would not be contained by indecision, and  by the start of September, with schools and universities having returned, ""you could clearly see a steady increase,"" a senior figure says. The testing system had not been able to keep pace with demand, and too few people were willing to, or could afford, to self-isolate if they tested positive. ""The idea that you could liberalise in the summer was based on the idea that you could whackamole with test and trace,"" the source says. ""But if you didn't whack the right moles then it doesn't work."" By the middle of September, ""the data was already screaming out"", one insider says. On the 17th, I was told by one source: ""If you do nothing now, by the end of October you will get something worse than the first wave."" The possibility of a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown was already being discussed in Downing Street that week. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and Mr Cummings and others were arguing hard for action to be taken - but the prime minister was unpersuaded. Others wanted to push again - one current official recalls a ""concerted effort"" - and on Sunday 20th, the No 10 team gathered a range of scientists. But the prime minister remained reluctant. Another current official describes his attitude as, ""if there is a way not to act, why do it?"". Over the next 36 hours, I have been told, a small group inside Downing Street repeatedly tried to change Mr Johnson's mind - but by then, he was operating in a very different atmosphere. ""A swampiness had risen because of ideological pressure on this government at every turn to do less - and to do it more slowly,"" a senior figure says. And it is understood Mr Johnson had privately assured groups of MPs there would be no more restrictions. The Treasury was pointing out the damage any further restrictions would do to the economy, many of the traditional Tory-backing newspapers were hungry for restrictions to be relaxed, the party was restless, and I remember cabinet ministers who had hardly any cases of the virus in their constituencies at that point, suggesting they saw no evidence for further action. So when Mr Johnson made changes to the coronavirus restrictions on 22 September, they were tweaks, rather than a real tightening up.  I remember talking to Tory backbenchers that day who felt they had won. The importance of the missed September moment is cited by many senior figures - and some now concede it was a mistake. ""We strained at the leash to get things going,"" one cabinet minister admits. ""I was aggressively for that - but I have learned that it is better to go slow."" Another senior minister, one of those who pushed for more radical action at the time, now says: ""We should have locked down more severely, earlier in the autumn - the whole point was, the earlier you act the more you buy yourself time for a strategy that can get out."" You can still hear the frustration in the voices of those who lost the argument. ""The PM was saying the Tory Party won't swallow it,"" one tells me. ""Everyone else felt, we know we are going to have to do a lockdown."" And there is no question that the tier system that was introduced over the autumn, which portioned England into different levels of restrictions, was soon tied up in confusion and regional spats. ""It was completely unintelligible to any normal human being,"" one senior official says. ""It was too slow, and too Byzantine, and that resulted in more cases."" Another says now: ""We ended up tying ourselves into ever tighter knots,"" as the system became more and more particular to each part of the country. It is impossible to know what would have happened if the brakes had been slammed on in September - but some ministers pin the terrible scale of the second wave, at least in part, on the apparent reluctance to act. The circuit-breaker that was imposed later in Wales did not make the problem go away, however. Case numbers weren't the only concern - the economy had been shuttered, and shattered. Political demands had changed. In defence of Mr Johnson, one senior minister says: ""He's not to blame if he was trying to reflect the aspiration for the country back in the summer"". Another tells me the plans, and the billions spent on ""test-and-trace and tiering meant it was reasonable to do the unlock"". They reject the idea that a circuit breaker was the obvious option - ""There wasn't a slam dunk recommendation."" Regarding the potential introduction of national restrictions in September, Downing Street referred us back to comments made by the prime minister to parliament in early November. ""No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential,"" Mr Johnson told the Commons. ""So it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low."" But while there is no question mistakes were made in the first phase of the pandemic, when so much about the virus was a mystery, those involved in the decisions are already less forgiving of their own mistakes the second time around. ""A miracle,"" is how one minister describes the vaccine gamble to me. A government so often lambasted by critics for busting convention did it again - but this time, so far, with a stunning outcome. Vaccines had been discussed in January, as the government machine began to contemplate, slowly, what might be ahead. Early on the chancellor, holding the cheque book, indicated a willingness to spend at speed, without asking for guarantees. No 10 decided to ""chuck everything at it"", at a meeting in April. With Sir Patrick's crucial experience and deputy chief medical officer for England Prof Jonathan Van-Tam's emphasis on the practicalities of delivering the vaccine, politicians were persuaded to take what was then a huge risk. There was an early decision to ""pay high, pay early, and ensure it works,"" one senior official tells me. And it seems their decision was informed by everything that had gone wrong with trying to secure PPE - the collapse of the NHS's normal procurement process, which is controlled by the Department of Health. The UK decided early not to participate in the EU's joint plan to buy vaccines. While publicly this decision may have been politically controversial, behind closed doors it was ""easy"" and ""straightforward"", ministers and officials say. ""No-one wanted any of the Brexit baggage anywhere near it."" And, more importantly, the EU had made it clear any participating country would be unable to make its own deals with manufacturers the EU had an agreement with - or control its own supply. The vaccines team had warned ministers at the start of May that nothing was certain - and developing a vaccine as quickly as the prime minister, who ""wanted it yesterday"", required would be an uphill struggle. But, as one minister says, it was ""the one thing we would wish that we had done in a year's time"". Another, a senior minister, says: ""The PM strategically saw immediately that the combination of testing, drugs and vaccine was the way out."" And when it came to vaccines, the UK was ready to take an expensive gamble. The Treasury was spending speculatively in ways it had not since the War - and vaccine spending has already reached nearly Â£13.5bn. ""Imagine if it hadn't come off and we had spent all of that taxpayers' money,"" one senior official says to me. There was intense secrecy, throughout, with the various vaccines given secret code names to ensure commercial confidentiality. All were named after submarines - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine ""Ambush"", I can now reveal, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca ""Triumph"". After 12 months of grappling with endless calculations about balancing risks to life, wider health and how the country makes a living, decision-makers are exhausted. They have to accept it is perfectly possible to be wrong, one senior minister tells me. And those who made the decisions are all too aware mistakes they made in these past 12 months may have had such a terrible cost. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ford chooses Dagenham for new Transit engines,"Ford has announced that diesel engines for a new generation of its Transit Custom van will be built at its factory in Dagenham. The company says the move will help to safeguard jobs at the site, which currently employs 1,900 people. The engines will be exported to Turkey, where the vans themselves will be assembled by Ford's local joint venture company, Ford Otosan. Last year, Ford closed its other major UK engine plant at Bridgend in Wales. The Transit Custom is a medium-sized version of Ford's well-known commercial workhorse. The company plans to launch a new version of it in 2023. Ford Otosan, a joint venture between the American giant and Turkish company KoÃ§ Holding, will manufacture the new van at its plant in Kocaeli, in Northwestern Turkey. Dagenham will build diesel engines for the new model - which will also be available as an electric van, as well as in various hybrid forms. Although moves to electrify passenger cars are proceeding rapidly, Ford says it expects diesel to continue to play an important role in commercial vehicles for many years. Demand from Ford Otosan, which will also build a similar-sized van on behalf of Volkswagen, is expected to account for up to 60% of Dagenham's diesel engine production by 2025. Ford to go all-electric in Europe by 2030 End of Ford and Bridgend marriage 'hard to take' Ford said the trade agreement reached between Turkey and the UK in late 2020 was ""extremely significant"" for its business - pointing out that Ford and Ford Otosan together account for more than 10% of the trade volume between the two countries. Ford closed its Bridgend plant last year, as part of a drastic overhaul of its European business. The factory, which opened in 1977, was unable to obtain enough new work after two major engine programmes ended in 2019. Five other factories in Europe were also shut, and some 10,000 workers were laid off. Transit vans were once built at a plant near Southampton, but in 2013 the factory was closed and production was moved to Turkey, where Ford said production costs were much lower. The International Trade Minister, Ranil Jayawardena, described Ford's announcement as ""great news for Ford and its 7,500 workers across the United Kingdom"".

Hairdressers to open on 5 April as Scots rules easeFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says garden centres can also reopen in the days after the stay at home lockdown order is lifted.Scotland,"This video can not be played Hairdressers and garden centres set to open in Scotland Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""brighter days are ahead of us"". The ""stay at home"" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to ""stay local"" for a further three weeks. Live: Nicola Sturgeon announces easing of lockdown What Covid rules are changing, and when? What will Scotland's new Covid levels look like? Other changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April. All children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April. Hairdressers can reopen from 5 April The first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including ""a significant majority of Scotland's adult population"" - by mid-April. She said this would ""give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April"". It is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that: restrictions on travel within mainland Scotland will be lifted gyms will reopen for individual exercise remaining shops will open, along with tourist accommodation, museums, libraries and galleries up to six people from three households can meet outside, while under-18s from up to six households are allowed to gather pubs, cafes and restaurants can open outdoors until 22:00 and can sell alcohol indoor hospitality can open until 20:00, but alcohol will not be allowed and people must meet in groups of up to four people from two households work in people's homes can resume, as can driving lessons up to 50 people can attend weddings and funerals A decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept ""under ongoing review"". She told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest. Other changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises. But Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like ""normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs"" - would involve ""plucking it out of thin air"". However, she said she was ""optimistic"" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues. ""This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,"" she said. Restrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or ""as soon as possible thereafter"". However, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus. She said that ""our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that"" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place ""for some time to come"". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome. However, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments. And she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can ""get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed ""effective testing and tracing"" systems to keep infections low. He called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that ""transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close"". Data not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland. The first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored. When Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic. Today, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme. But the first minister said this was the ""most hopeful"" she had felt for a long time and that ""something much closer to actual normality"" might be achieved as we move into summer. The change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown. Ms Sturgeon said the government had to make ""careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions"" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving ""steadily and in one direction"". The final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the ""need for medium term-support"". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year. Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was ""most welcome for everyone"", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses. Ms Sturgeon said that ""any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission"", and that ""we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can"". Scottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the ""indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area"". The first minister said everything was ""predicated on the data going in the right direction"", and that ""all bets are off"" if case numbers rise sharply again. She told MSPs that her ""hope and ambition"" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome. However, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments. And she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can ""get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed ""effective testing and tracing"" systems to keep infections low. He called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that ""transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close"". Data not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland. The first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored. When Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic. Today, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme. But the first minister said this was the ""most hopeful"" she had felt for a long time and that ""something much closer to actual normality"" might be achieved as we move into summer. The change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown. Ms Sturgeon said the government had to make ""careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions"" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving ""steadily and in one direction"". The final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the ""need for medium term-support"". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year. Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was ""most welcome for everyone"", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses. Ms Sturgeon said that ""any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission"", and that ""we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can"". Scottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the ""indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area"". The first minister said everything was ""predicated on the data going in the right direction"", and that ""all bets are off"" if case numbers rise sharply again. She told MSPs that her ""hope and ambition"" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month.

Outdoor drinking will be permitted until 10pm The aim is to have the lowest level of restrictions across Scotland by the end of June - that could mean physical distancing rules remaining along with number limits and table service in hospitality Mainland Scotland has been in lockdown since 26 December last year Hairdressers will start operating again from 5 April; gyms and non-essential shops will be allowed to open on 26 April Schools will resume full time after the Easter break, which for most pupils will be mid-April From 17 May up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space In the past 24 hours there have been 597 new lab-tested cases of Covid-19.

But Mr Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, adds: ""To be told that we can open without alcohol is, frankly, ludicrous. ""Only opening until 8pm doesn't do us any good at all. ""All the way down the line here there will be people who find it impossible to open, impossible to be viable."" Mr Waterson says even at Level zero there will be many smaller premises that will not be allowed to reopen due to social distancing restrictions. He adds: ""We are going to have to wait a long tie to get back to some viability."" Mr Waterson told Drivetime some of his members have amassed debts of between Â£90,000 and Â£60,000 during the pandemic. BBC Radio Scotland Hairdresser and barber salons are to reopen for
appointments on 5 April. Michael Moran, who owns Pele
Hairdressing & Beauty Salon in Glasgow's city centre, says he is ""over the moonâ at being able to resume haircuts. The beauty side of his business will have to wait until 26 April when ""close contact"" services are allowed to restart. Mr Moran says the mental health benefits of
hair and beauty cannot be stressed enough. âIt gives you such a shot in the arm,"" he says. ""You feel better, you

The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. BBC Radio Scotland George Gouding, who runs a garden
centre in the Clyde Valley, says it is ""very welcome news"" to be told his business can open indoor and outdoors from 5 April, three weeks earlier than other non-essential retail. He said the last update on the road map did not give any clarity but now there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Mr Gouding said opening garden centres would be good for people who could now get out in the fresh air and work in their garden. The garden centre business also has a restaurant, which will not be able to open for sit-in customers until 26 April. BBC Radio Scotland Jamie Scott, owner of the Newport restaurant, says the length of time businesses are having to wait is ""nonsensical"". Mr Scott, former winner of Masterchef Professionals, adds it is ""so poor"" the sector is having to wait longer to reopen than hairdressers. He says: ""I don't understand how you can walk into a non-essential retail shop, not give any details over, be in there as long as you like, not be policed in what you are doing, touch everything you want and leave when you want."" Mr Scott compares this to the set up at his restaurant, which must abide by track and trace and have strict measures in place. Ewan MacDonald Russell from the Scottish Retail Consortium tells Radio Scotland: ""We're certainly quite happy with what we heard today."" Mr Russell says retailers will welcome garden centres and hardware stores reopening on 5 April and also click and collect services being opened up to everyone ""This will allow smaller shops the ability to compete online."" He also welcomes ""the big opening date on the 26 April, when we can finally get shops reopened after what feels like an eternity closed."" Mr Russell also welcomes the stay local message that will replace the stay at home message on 2 April, encouraging shoppers to go their local high street. A lot of local shops are ""surviving on government grants which is not where anybody wants to be"", he adds. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of
Commerce, says the first minister's statement will enable many
businesses and customers to start planning and preparing for re-opening. She adds the intention to relax travel restrictions
should support the viability of the tourism, hospitality and retail sectors. But Dr Cameron also calls for clarification of what is allowed in the various levels of restrictions, sooner
rather than later. She adds: ""We would urge alignment across all UK nations which enables
the industry to restart together and to avoid confusion for travellers."" On the establishment of restart grants, Dr Cameron says: ""It makes more sense to provide businesses with a lump sum
so they can deploy these resources where it can be of most use."" BBC Radio Scotland Lockerbie-based hotel owner Stephen Montgomery tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime that today's announcement is ""horrible for hospitality"". Mr Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, says there is ""pent up demand from customers"" but he adds: ""From 9 October we have seen hospitality shut across the central belt and the spike in positive cases went right through the roof. ""So it is well seen alcohol cannot be attributed to this. What happened is that people gathered in homes."" He warns that unless businesses get a clear run in the summer they will end up experiencing another period comparable with the winter. Figures updated at 14:00 daily. Read the full breakdownhere. Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""brighter days are ahead of us"". The ""stay at home"" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to ""stay local"" for a further three weeks. Read more here. BBC Radio Scotland For some non-essential retail, today's news was less good. Hairdressers and
barbers will reopen on Monday, 5 April, but other retail outlets will have to
wait another three weeks until 26 April. Kerrie Guiney, who runs the Perfect Fit shoe shop in
Peebles, tells Drivetime: ""I'm feeling a bit confused, a bit upset that we're not on the list of shops that is classed as essential. ""We totally expected to be able to reopen on the 5th of April or at least sooner than the 26th of April."" So yeah feeling a bit disappointed that putting, no offence, haircuts, and putting being able to go and buy a new car and a new plant for your garden ahead of children's feet and making sure our children are in properly fitted footwear.

Spa in Lossiemouth, tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime this is the news she was hoping for: ""We are all just so excited. Our hair department will get back so we will be able to cut and colour. ""Our beauty department will have to wait till we get further notice. ""But just to get back to hair will be amazing."" Ms Thomson says E-mail salon messages have been going crazy already: I'm just glad that part of my business can get back. Haircuts, for all of us, it's not just about the haircut it's about how people feel, about the feelgood factor... Hopefully we've learned a lot and it will be quite seamless going back."" Karen Thomson, KAM Hair and Body Spa in Lossiemouth The Campaign for
Real Ale says pubs will need continued financial support to cope
with a ""devastating"" return to restrictions. CAMRA Scotlandâs director Joe Crawford said: âPub goers,
licensees and brewers will be disappointed to see our pubs being
treated unfairly compared to similar businesses like cafÃ©s and
non-essential retail. âThe return
of curfews and a ban on alcohol being consumed indoors is
devastating news for the industry which is looking to reopen Covid-secure
venues so that people can socialise safely."" Mr Crawford welcomed the restart
grants announced by the government, but added without a full and proper
reopening and with continuing restrictions, more support would be needed before his members could trade at full
capacity. For many businesses it just wonât be worthwhile opening back up as they wonât be able to turn a profit under these draconian restrictions. Joe Crawford, CAMRA Scotland director The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. See the detailshere,external. The Federation of
Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the first minister's announcement  but warned that the survival of
many local firms is still in doubt. Policy chair Andrew McRae said the indicative dates allowed many firms
to plan ahead, while the ""restrained optimism from the first minister may encourage
some small businesses not to throw in the towel."" But he cautioned that many businesses faced a countdown before their reserves of
cash and resolve were exhausted. He said: ""Half of all Scottish independent business owners say they're
worried about their survival, and official figures show that local Scottish
enterprises are laden with billions of pound of debt. ""The crisis is nowhere
near finished for thousands of important local Scottish firms."" He added more action was needed to help local
businesses deal with the long-term consequences of the pandemic. From 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was expected all parts of Scotland currently in level 4 would move down to a ""modified"" level 3.
The island communities currently in level 3 will have the option to move at that stage to level 2 but this could have implications for travel and will be discussed further. LEVEL 3 The new ""modified"" level 3 from 26 April would see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant. Up to six people from up to three households can socialise outdoors. All remaining retail premises and close contact services will re-open. Gyms can open for individual exercise. Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open. Funerals and weddings including post-funeral events and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (no alcohol). LEVEL 2 From 17 May, it is hoped that all level 3 areas - or as many as possible - will move to level 2. This will see hospitality venues open until 22:30 indoors (alcohol permitted, two-hour dwell time) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls can reopen. Outdoor adult contact sport and indoor group exercise can restart. LEVEL 1 From early June, the ambition is for all of Scotland will move to level 1 - which will allow for a further easing of restrictions. Up to six people from up to three households will be able to socialise indoors in a home or public place. Up to eight people from three households can socialise outdoors. Eight 12-17 year olds can meet socially from eight households outdoors. Hospitality can remain open until 23:00. Indoor non-contact sport can take place. LEVEL 0 By the end of June, it is hoped that all of Scotland will move to at least level 0. This could mean a phased return of some office staff. The Scottish government will be assessing the situation on an ongoing basis, with a view to restoring as much normality as possible. BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime is due to begin on Radio Scotland shortly and will have all the reaction and analysis to the first minister's timetable out of lockdown. This includes being able to get ahaircut on April the 5th and a trip to the gym, the shops, a hotel, a cafe and a beer garden from the 26th. However there will be no visiting other people indoors before 17 May. Join Laura MacIver from 4pm. Alison Johnstone says the Scottish Greens support a cautious approach to easing lockdown, but warns of the increase in daily case numbers compared with last week. Ms Johnstone says there has been reports of an increase in cases due to theunsafe gathering of football fans in Glasgow. She also asks about a ""marked increase"" in case numbers in children under 14 years old and whether lateral flow testing will be introduced for students. The first minister says lateral flow testing will be used to support the return of further and higher education students in April. Ms Sturgeon says there has been a small number of cases amongst the people that gathered for the ""football incident"" in Glasgow. She adds there may be more cases due to the incubation period. The first minister warns any time people come together, there is a greater increase in the chance of transmission and highlights mitigations brought into schools. Â© 2025 BBC.

Greggs to expand despite first loss for 36 yearsThe bakery chain is confident of long-term recovery despite sales being hit amid the pandemic.BusinessComments,"Bakery chain Greggs is to open 100 new shops in 2021 as it bets on a post-pandemic recovery. This is despite the chain reporting its first loss for 36 years in 2020 after sales fell by a third amid coronavirus lockdown measures. Greggs said it had ramped up deliveries, wholesale, and click-and-collect as High Street sales fell. Chief executive Roger Whiteside added that Greggs had ""made a better-than-expected start to 2021"". He added that the chain was ""well placed to participate in the recovery from the pandemic"". Sales at company-managed shops fell by more than 36% last year as footfall in city centres and travel hub sites fell substantially during lockdowns. This was partly offset by deliveries through Just Eat, which is one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms. Greggs reported a pre-tax loss of Â£13.7m, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984.

But Mr Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, adds: ""To be told that we can open without alcohol is, frankly, ludicrous. ""Only opening until 8pm doesn't do us any good at all. ""All the way down the line here there will be people who find it impossible to open, impossible to be viable."" Mr Waterson says even at Level zero there will be many smaller premises that will not be allowed to reopen due to social distancing restrictions.

The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. BBC Radio Scotland George Gouding, who runs a garden
centre in the Clyde Valley, says it is ""very welcome news"" to be told his business can open indoor and outdoors from 5 April, three weeks earlier than other non-essential retail. He said the last update on the road map did not give any clarity but now there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Mr Gouding said opening garden centres would be good for people who could now get out in the fresh air and work in their garden. The garden centre business also has a restaurant, which will not be able to open for sit-in customers until 26 April. BBC Radio Scotland Jamie Scott, owner of the Newport restaurant, says the length of time businesses are having to wait is ""nonsensical"". Mr Scott, former winner of Masterchef Professionals, adds it is ""so poor"" the sector is having to wait longer to reopen than hairdressers. He says: ""I don't understand how you can walk into a non-essential retail shop, not give any details over, be in there as long as you like, not be policed in what you are doing, touch everything you want and leave when you want."" Mr Scott compares this to the set up at his restaurant, which must abide by track and trace and have strict measures in place. Ewan MacDonald Russell from the Scottish Retail Consortium tells Radio Scotland: ""We're certainly quite happy with what we heard today."" Mr Russell says retailers will welcome garden centres and hardware stores reopening on 5 April and also click and collect services being opened up to everyone ""This will allow smaller shops the ability to compete online."" He also welcomes ""the big opening date on the 26 April, when we can finally get shops reopened after what feels like an eternity closed."" Mr Russell also welcomes the stay local message that will replace the stay at home message on 2 April, encouraging shoppers to go their local high street. A lot of local shops are ""surviving on government grants which is not where anybody wants to be"", he adds. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of
Commerce, says the first minister's statement will enable many
businesses and customers to start planning and preparing for re-opening. She adds the intention to relax travel restrictions
should support the viability of the tourism, hospitality and retail sectors. But Dr Cameron also calls for clarification of what is allowed in the various levels of restrictions, sooner
rather than later. She adds: ""We would urge alignment across all UK nations which enables
the industry to restart together and to avoid confusion for travellers."" On the establishment of restart grants, Dr Cameron says: ""It makes more sense to provide businesses with a lump sum
so they can deploy these resources where it can be of most use."" BBC Radio Scotland Lockerbie-based hotel owner Stephen Montgomery tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime that today's announcement is ""horrible for hospitality"". Mr Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, says there is ""pent up demand from customers"" but he adds: ""From 9 October we have seen hospitality shut across the central belt and the spike in positive cases went right through the roof. ""So it is well seen alcohol cannot be attributed to this. What happened is that people gathered in homes."" He warns that unless businesses get a clear run in the summer they will end up experiencing another period comparable with the winter. Figures updated at 14:00 daily. Read the full breakdownhere. Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that ""brighter days are ahead of us"". The ""stay at home"" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to ""stay local"" for a further three weeks.

barbers will reopen on Monday, 5 April, but other retail outlets will have to
wait another three weeks until 26 April. Kerrie Guiney, who runs the Perfect Fit shoe shop in
Peebles, tells Drivetime: ""I'm feeling a bit confused, a bit upset that we're not on the list of shops that is classed as essential. ""We totally expected to be able to reopen on the 5th of April or at least sooner than the 26th of April.""

not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland. The
first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus
suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should
be restored. When
Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some
for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic. Today,
thereâs caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and
keeping up the vaccination programme. But
the first minister said this was the âmost hopefulâ she had felt for a long
time and that âsomething much closer to actual normalityâ might be achieved as
we move into summer. The
change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before
the first anniversary of the original lockdown. Sohairdressers and barbers will re-open on Monday 5 Aprilbut other retail outlets will have to wait
until 26 April. Karen Thomson, who owns KAM Hair and Body
Spa in Lossiemouth, tells Radio Scotland's Drivetime this is the news she was hoping for: ""We are all just so excited. Our hair department will get back so we will be able to cut and colour. ""Our beauty department will have to wait till we get further notice. ""But just to get back to hair will be amazing."" Ms Thomson says E-mail salon messages have been going crazy already: I'm just glad that part of my business can get back. Haircuts, for all of us, it's not just about the haircut it's about how people feel, about the feelgood factor... Hopefully we've learned a lot and it will be quite seamless going back."" Karen Thomson, KAM Hair and Body Spa in Lossiemouth The Campaign for
Real Ale says pubs will need continued financial support to cope
with a ""devastating"" return to restrictions. CAMRA Scotlandâs director Joe Crawford said: âPub goers,
licensees and brewers will be disappointed to see our pubs being
treated unfairly compared to similar businesses like cafÃ©s and
non-essential retail. âThe return
of curfews and a ban on alcohol being consumed indoors is
devastating news for the industry which is looking to reopen Covid-secure
venues so that people can socialise safely."" Mr Crawford welcomed the restart
grants announced by the government, but added without a full and proper
reopening and with continuing restrictions, more support would be needed before his members could trade at full
capacity. For many businesses it just wonât be worthwhile opening back up as they wonât be able to turn a profit under these draconian restrictions. Joe Crawford, CAMRA Scotland director The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. See the detailshere,external. The Federation of
Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the first minister's announcement  but warned that the survival of
many local firms is still in doubt. Policy chair Andrew McRae said the indicative dates allowed many firms
to plan ahead, while the ""restrained optimism from the first minister may encourage
some small businesses not to throw in the towel."" But he cautioned that many businesses faced a countdown before their reserves of
cash and resolve were exhausted. He said: ""Half of all Scottish independent business owners say they're
worried about their survival, and official figures show that local Scottish
enterprises are laden with billions of pound of debt. ""The crisis is nowhere
near finished for thousands of important local Scottish firms."" He added more action was needed to help local
businesses deal with the long-term consequences of the pandemic. From 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was expected all parts of Scotland currently in level 4 would move down to a ""modified"" level 3.
The island communities currently in level 3 will have the option to move at that stage to level 2 but this could have implications for travel and will be discussed further. LEVEL 3 The new ""modified"" level 3 from 26 April would see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant. Up to six people from up to three households can socialise outdoors. All remaining retail premises and close contact services will re-open. Gyms can open for individual exercise. Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open. Funerals and weddings including post-funeral events and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (no alcohol). LEVEL 2 From 17 May, it is hoped that all level 3 areas - or as many as possible - will move to level 2. This will see hospitality venues open until 22:30 indoors (alcohol permitted, two-hour dwell time) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls can reopen. Outdoor adult contact sport and indoor group exercise can restart. LEVEL 1 From early June, the ambition is for all of Scotland will move to level 1 - which will allow for a further easing of restrictions. Up to six people from up to three households will be able to socialise indoors in a home or public place. Up to eight people from three households can socialise outdoors. Eight 12-17 year olds can meet socially from eight households outdoors. Hospitality can remain open until 23:00. Indoor non-contact sport can take place. LEVEL 0 By the end of June, it is hoped that all of Scotland will move to at least level 0. This could mean a phased return of some office staff. The Scottish government will be assessing the situation on an ongoing basis, with a view to restoring as much normality as possible. BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime is due to begin on Radio Scotland shortly and will have all the reaction and analysis to the first minister's timetable out of lockdown. This includes being able to get ahaircut on April the 5th and a trip to the gym, the shops, a hotel, a cafe and a beer garden from the 26th. However there will be no visiting other people indoors before 17 May. Join Laura MacIver from 4pm. Alison Johnstone says the Scottish Greens support a cautious approach to easing lockdown, but warns of the increase in daily case numbers compared with last week. Ms Johnstone says there has been reports of an increase in cases due to theunsafe gathering of football fans in Glasgow. She also asks about a ""marked increase"" in case numbers in children under 14 years old and whether lateral flow testing will be introduced for students. The first minister says lateral flow testing will be used to support the return of further and higher education students in April. Ms Sturgeon says there has been a small number of cases amongst the people that gathered for the ""football incident"" in Glasgow. She adds there may be more cases due to the incubation period. The first minister warns any time people come together, there is a greater increase in the chance of transmission and highlights mitigations brought into schools. Â© 2025 BBC.

St Patrick's Day celebrations move online,"The last St Patrick's Day parade in Belfast was in 2019 St Patrick's Day celebrations will once again be different this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Traditional parades in Belfast and Dublin have been cancelled for the second year in a row, with many events across the island again moving online. Police have warned that anyone breaking Covid-19 regulations in NI will face a ""robust"" response. But while large gatherings are mostly ruled out, attempts have been made to celebrate in style around the world. When the Global Greenings initiative was first launched, just the Sydney Opera House and the Sky Tower in Auckland took part Since 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, a record number of places are taking part. Some 670 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative. The quirkiest additions to this year's list include an abandoned sauna in Finland and a Smurf statue in Brussels. Here's how other places in Northern Ireland and further afield are planning to mark the occasion: Belfast has anarray of virtual events,externalfor people to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes throughout the month of March. An online disco, Irish language festivals and a virtual guided tour of the city's street art are just some of the events on offer. Several live music events will also be streamed throughout St Patrick's Day, showcasing the city's talent. St Joseph's Church in Sailortown is one such venue celebrating with an eight-hour live-streamed event. The St Patrick's Centre in Downpatrick, County Down is celebrating with a number of online events for St Patrick's Day and also to mark its 20 year anniversary. A new show about St Patrick, a children's virtual art competition and a series of podcasts from former BBC politics correspondent Martina Purdy and ex-barrister Elaine Kelly, who are pilgrim guides on the new St Patrick's Way, are just some of the events on offer. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Purdy said that some of the guests involved on the podcast are journalist and presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as Irish cellist Patrick Dexter, who has foundonline fame with his open-air recitals, shot outside his cottage in County Mayo. ""I was probably less aggressive than I was previously with some politicians,"" she said. It is claimed that St Patrick is buried outside Downpatrick Cathedral. A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century. The council'sSpring and St Patrick's Day programme,externalpromises to ""bring some colour"" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney. He thanked event organisers for a programme that ""strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe"". Event organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: ""While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise"". Armagh'sAt Home With St Patrick Festival,externalincludes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class. All events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance. The council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with aseries of online performances and storytelling,external. All events have moved online andthe festival includes music and dance performances,,externalstreamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen. The council is streaming a series ofcraft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances,externallive on social media channels throughout the day. Hundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland for St Patrick's Day Police in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations. Hundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday. The substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast. Police said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines. Saint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity. While St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ. He is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. The city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March,,externalwith more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland. Organisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RTÃ for the virtual parade. The celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said. The Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited. In her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: ""We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.""

Traditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM). That long-standing tradition will continue this year, albeit virtually. The bowl will be placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin on Wednesday. The two leaders will discuss, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, according to the White House. Joe Biden posing for a photo with residents in Ballina, County Mayo, in 2016 Mr Biden, who has strong links to Mayo and Carlingford, will no doubt want to celebrate his Irish roots. Before a visit to the land of his forefathers in 2016, the then US vice-president said: ""Being Irish, without fear of contradiction, has shaped my entire life."" Joe Biden could return to Irish roots as US president In Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River event but the city's mayor was determined to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare.

Haircuts, for all of us, it's not just about the haircut it's about how people feel, about the feelgood factor... Hopefully we've learned a lot and it will be quite seamless going back."" Karen Thomson, KAM Hair and Body Spa in Lossiemouth The Campaign for
Real Ale says pubs will need continued financial support to cope
with a ""devastating"" return to restrictions. CAMRA Scotlandâs director Joe Crawford said: âPub goers,
licensees and brewers will be disappointed to see our pubs being
treated unfairly compared to similar businesses like cafÃ©s and
non-essential retail. âThe return
of curfews and a ban on alcohol being consumed indoors is
devastating news for the industry which is looking to reopen Covid-secure
venues so that people can socialise safely."" Mr Crawford welcomed the restart
grants announced by the government, but added without a full and proper
reopening and with continuing restrictions, more support would be needed before his members could trade at full
capacity. For many businesses it just wonât be worthwhile opening back up as they wonât be able to turn a profit under these draconian restrictions. Joe Crawford, CAMRA Scotland director The Scottish government has published a full breakdown of the plans to lift lockdown in the coming weeks. See the detailshere,external. The Federation of
Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the first minister's announcement  but warned that the survival of
many local firms is still in doubt. Policy chair Andrew McRae said the indicative dates allowed many firms
to plan ahead, while the ""restrained optimism from the first minister may encourage
some small businesses not to throw in the towel."" But he cautioned that many businesses faced a countdown before their reserves of
cash and resolve were exhausted. He said: ""Half of all Scottish independent business owners say they're
worried about their survival, and official figures show that local Scottish
enterprises are laden with billions of pound of debt. ""The crisis is nowhere
near finished for thousands of important local Scottish firms."" He added more action was needed to help local
businesses deal with the long-term consequences of the pandemic. From 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was expected all parts of Scotland currently in level 4 would move down to a ""modified"" level 3.
The island communities currently in level 3 will have the option to move at that stage to level 2 but this could have implications for travel and will be discussed further. LEVEL 3 The new ""modified"" level 3 from 26 April would see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant. Up to six people from up to three households can socialise outdoors. All remaining retail premises and close contact services will re-open. Gyms can open for individual exercise. Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open. Funerals and weddings including post-funeral events and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (no alcohol). LEVEL 2 From 17 May, it is hoped that all level 3 areas - or as many as possible - will move to level 2. This will see hospitality venues open until 22:30 indoors (alcohol permitted, two-hour dwell time) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls can reopen. Outdoor adult contact sport and indoor group exercise can restart. LEVEL 1 From early June, the ambition is for all of Scotland will move to level 1 - which will allow for a further easing of restrictions. Up to six people from up to three households will be able to socialise indoors in a home or public place. Up to eight people from three households can socialise outdoors. Eight 12-17 year olds can meet socially from eight households outdoors. Hospitality can remain open until 23:00. Indoor non-contact sport can take place. LEVEL 0 By the end of June, it is hoped that all of Scotland will move to at least level 0. This could mean a phased return of some office staff. The Scottish government will be assessing the situation on an ongoing basis, with a view to restoring as much normality as possible. BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime is due to begin on Radio Scotland shortly and will have all the reaction and analysis to the first minister's timetable out of lockdown. This includes being able to get ahaircut on April the 5th and a trip to the gym, the shops, a hotel, a cafe and a beer garden from the 26th. However there will be no visiting other people indoors before 17 May. Join Laura MacIver from 4pm. Alison Johnstone says the Scottish Greens support a cautious approach to easing lockdown, but warns of the increase in daily case numbers compared with last week. Ms Johnstone says there has been reports of an increase in cases due to theunsafe gathering of football fans in Glasgow. She also asks about a ""marked increase"" in case numbers in children under 14 years old and whether lateral flow testing will be introduced for students. The first minister says lateral flow testing will be used to support the return of further and higher education students in April. Ms Sturgeon says there has been a small number of cases amongst the people that gathered for the ""football incident"" in Glasgow. She adds there may be more cases due to the incubation period. The first minister warns any time people come together, there is a greater increase in the chance of transmission and highlights mitigations brought into schools. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mother's anguish over parallels with Everard caseBea Jones has been left ""distressed"" by the similarities with the murder of her daughter Moira in 2008.Glasgow & West Scotland","Sales executive Moira, who was 40 when she was murdered in May 2008, and her mother Bea The mother of a woman who was abducted and murdered in Glasgow has expressed her concern for Sarah Everard's family. Bea Jones said she had been left ""distressed"" by the similarities between the case and what happened to her own daughter, Moira, in 2008. And she has urged the public to keep Sarah's loved ones in mind. Bea wrote: ""We send love to them all and wish them all the strength they need to get through all the dark days ahead."" Moira Jones was randomly abducted yards from her home and forced into nearby Queen's Park, where she was raped and beaten to death. The diary of my daughter's murder Catching the park killer who vanished 'like a ghost' New service launched to help families of murder victims Slovakian national Marek Harcar was jailed in 2009 for the murder and the judge set the punishment part of his life sentence at 25 years. Lord Bracadale said the crime had ""shocked the nation"" and told Harcar: ""Your conduct that night reflects a level of wickedness very rarely encountered."" In a bid to cope with her loss, former teacher Bea wrote a harrowing diary, which last year featured in BBC Scotland documentaryThe Dark Shadow of Murder. She also set up a charity,The Moira Fund,external, to help bereaved families. Bea, from Weston, Staffordshire, decided towrite a letter,externaloutlining her fears about the Sarah Everard case after receiving multiple media approaches for comment. Ms Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Sarah Everard has been described by her family as ""kind, thoughtful, caring and dependable"" Bea wrote: ""We have been very distressed by what has happened to Sarah, similar in many respects, to Moira's ordeal. ""I really could not face talking about this and thought that perhaps one open letter would suffice."" She said her main concern was for Sarah's family and loved ones. She wrote: ""They are totally devastated and bewildered and vulnerable. They cannot fully take in what has happened and the permanence of what has occurred. ""They have experienced nightmare on top of nightmare as events have unravelled and their beautiful missing daughter became another murder victim. And there seems no end to it."" Bea says she can understand the reaction and response from women nationwide to the shocking crime and believes Sarah's family may have been comforted by the thought that ""so many were grieving with them"". But she continues: ""Now it has all escalated into a media frenzy more representative of individual anger than of shared grief. ""I am very concerned thatevents have developedto such an extent that those who matter most, Sarah and her family, are being totally swamped and further traumatised by what is going on around them, adding trauma to trauma. ""How can they cope at all? There is only so much that a head can absorb and a heart can cope with and they have so much more to find out in the weeks and months ahead as dreadful details of Sarah's death are revealed to them."" A stone marks the spot in Queen's Park where Moira's body was discovered Bea says the family need to be protected from media intrusion and then turns her thoughts towards Sarah's mother, whom she says will have a head full of questions about what happened to her daughter and what she went through. Drawing on her own experiences, she lists several, including: ""Did she know how very much we loved her?"" Bea continues: ""There are no answers to these questions, there never will be, but she will keep on asking them, over and over torturing herself. I ask them still - not so often but after 13 years I ask them still. ""Sarah's mum needs time and space to ask them too, to run all sorts through her head before an avalanche of other information descends. ""Her family have lived with the joy of Sarah for 33 years and the loss of that joy will affect them for the rest of their lives. It will be a long time before they can even get past the trauma, to start processing the awfulness of it all and being able to grieve. There really are no words to describe that awfulness."" Notes and ribbons were tied to the gates of Queen's Park in Glasgow's southside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""struck"" by this tribute left in Glasgow's Queen's Park to Moira Jones, who was murdered in 2008. She also tweeted a picture of a candle lit to remember ""Sarah, and all the others"" As part of the nationwide events, ribbons and messages have been tied to the gates of Queen's Park including many which mention Moira, 40, by name. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to the sales executive on social media at the weekend and said she thought of Moira every time she walked through the park in the south side of the city. Bea said she had been moved by the fresh messages of support for her ""darling girl"", who moved from London to Glasgow in 2003. The campaigner has previously described how she cannot bear to say the name of the man who killed Moira. Hu and Bea Jones outside court after the verdict was delivered Bea also called on the media to focus on Sarah Everard as opposed toMet police officer Wayne Couzens, who is accused of murdering and kidnapping the marketing executive. She concludes her letter by pledging to continue to support those who have been bereaved by violence and urges the public never to forgot the pain they go through. She wrote: ""We frequently read and hear of murder cases in the news but it is rare indeed for us to read of the plight of those left behind, whose lives that are changed forever by the violent death of a loved one.""

UK nuclear stockpile to increase after review,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We will... relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values"" The UK is set to reverse plans to reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by the middle of the decade, as part of a foreign policy overhaul. The overall cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010. The UK will shift focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, described as the world's ""growth engine"". And it pledges the UK will do more on the ""systemic challenge"" of China. Outlining the strategy to MPs, Boris Johnson said the UK would have to ""relearn the art"" of competing against countries with ""opposing values"". But he added the UK would remain ""unswervingly committed"" to the Nato defence alliance and preserving peace and security in Europe. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an ""era of retreat,"" with armed forces cuts ""every year for the last decade"". Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy UK to shift foreign policy focus after review Theintegrated review,externalof foreign and defence policies, which runs to over 100 pages, has taken over a year and sets out UK priorities until 2030. The UK nuclear stockpile is estimated to comprise 195 warheads, and had been due to fall to 180 by the mid-2020s under a 2010 defence review. But the latest assessment says this ambition is ""no longer possible"" given the ""evolving security environment"" over the last decade. It adds that the UK will no longer publish figures on the size of its operational stockpile, to maintain ""deliberate ambiguity"" for adversaries. However, it pledges the UK will maintain the ""minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK's nuclear deterrent remains credible"". The review, which identifies Russia as the ""most acute threat"" to UK security, also says: It is ""likely"" that a terrorist group will launch a successful chemical, biological or nuclear attack by 2030 The UK will set up a new counter-terrorism operations centre to improve the response to terror attacks The government wants the UK to become a ""science and tech superpower"" by the end of the decade The review also pledged to reverse cuts on foreign aid, from 0.7% of national income down to 0.5%, when ""the fiscal situation allows"". The government haspreviously faced criticismfor the cuts, which it said were necessary in the wake of financial challenges posed by the Covid pandemic. The review argues the UK should refocus its foreign policy towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia in the ""Indo-Pacific"" region. It said the region's shipping lanes were vital to maintain UK trade with Asia, whilst the region is also on the ""frontline of new security challenges"". Analysis by Rob Watson, BBC World Service UK Political Correspondent What's striking about the review is the continuity in UK foreign policy. So just as before Brexit and ""Global Britain"", the UK continues to see the main threats to its security as China, Russia, terrorism and cyber attacks.  And it continues to have as its main goals, among other things, the promotion of democracy, free trade, human rights and the fight against climate change. There are differences, though. The most striking is the suggestion of a pivot away from Europe to the Indo-Pacific. But exactly what that means is not spelled out (although we do know Boris Johnson will travel to India next month, and there will be new focus on new partnerships and trade agreements with south-east Asian countries). More broadly, Mr Johnson's central claim is that leaving the EU will make the UK more nimble and flexible, whether it's in how to deal with China or becoming a science superpower or anything else. Critics will say the review is long on aspiration and that the UK will face the same global challenges it faced before Brexit - but with one fewer foreign policy tool in its toolbox, namely its membership of the EU. Mr Johnson said: ""The review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values."" He said the UK had led international condemnation of China's ""mass detention"" of Uighur people in Xinjiang, and its actions in Hong Kong, adding: ""There is no question China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours."" In response, Sir Keir said UK policy towards China had been ""inconsistent"" and the government had ""turned a blind eye"" to the country's human rights abuses. He said Labour remained committed to retaining nuclear weapons, but said the document had failed to detail the ""strategic purpose"" for increasing the warhead stockpile. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""This review breaks the goal... to reduce our nuclear stockpile"" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the review demonstrated ""just how hollow the brand of Global Britain is"". He also asked the prime minister ""who gave his government the democratic right to renege on the UK's obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty"" referring to the government's plans on nuclear weapons. Speaking to the BBC, Beatrice Fihn - head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons -  described the UK's decision to change its nuclear provision as ""outrageous, irresponsible and very dangerous"". She said it went against international law and didn't address the real security threats faced by Britain such as climate change and disinformation. Analysis by Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent The review calls China the ""biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"". But there is clearly disquiet among the government's own MPs that it hasn't been robust enough in identifying the challenge posed by its Communist regime. Former Conservative foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was worried by its description of China as a ""systemic"" challenge, given its current clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. Another senior Conservative, Julian Lewis, took issue with its description of China as a ""partner"". He added it suggested the ""grasping naivety"" of the party's approach under David Cameron and George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, ""still lingers on"". Boris Johnson said there was a ""balance to be struck"", and although the UK wanted a ""strong trading relationship,"" it should be ""clear-eyed"" and ""tough where we see risk"". But the trade-offs between seeking investment and protecting the UK from becoming too vulnerable to Chinese economic and political influence and pressure will come under increasing scrutiny.

New children's commissioner to 'rebuild' childhood,"Dame Rachel de Souza has promised to be a ""fearless"" advocate for children The new children's commissioner for England wants to ""rebuild childhood"" after the disruption of the pandemic. Dame Rachel de Souza says the scale of the challenge is like reconstructing the social security system in the wake of World War Two. She also wants short-term measures - such as free school meals - being extended into the summer holidays, and not ""dropping"" Universal Credit levels. Dame Rachel says she will be ""fearless"" in representing children's interests. The new children's commissioner is launching what is claimed to be England's biggest survey of children - the ""Big Ask"" - which will gather children's views on the impact of the pandemic, and what they think are the barriers to children's ambitions The online survey, to be sent to all schools and also children in youth custody, children's homes and mental health units, will provide information for a ""once-in-a-generation"" review of how children's lives might be improved. This video can not be played Childrenâs commissioner: How can children learn if theyâre hungry? It takes its ""spirit and the ambition"" from William Beveridge's 1942 report, which laid the foundations for the post-war welfare state, identifying the five great challenges as ""want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness"". How will generation Covid catch up? First steps back to normality as schools return Children's lives have faced huge disruption ""Our response to the trauma of the Second World War was to create a blueprint for a social service system and a National Health Service that improved our lives. We have the chance to do the same again now for children,"" says the children's commissioner. Dame Rachel, who ran schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, wants a 10-year plan to emerge from her review - with the promise of tackling a political system which can ""often short-change children"". School pupils have lost months of learning in the classroom For more immediate challenges, on whether free school meals should run across the summer holidays, she told the BBC: ""I absolutely want to see free school meals extended. ""And I'm very concerned about suggestions of dropping Universal Credit. If it was dropped down again, I'd like to see services provided in its place, but I'd rather it wasn't dropped."" A former teacher, head teacher and chief executive of a school academy trust, Dame Rachel promised to be an ""independent voice, there to fight to protect and promote the rights of children"". If government was ""doing something wrong"", she said, ""I will be fearless in exposing that and challenging them"". The review will consider how children will recover from so much disrupted education - calculating that collectively pupils in England have lost 840 million days of in-person schooling since the start of the pandemic, representing about 19 weeks each. It will address the ""social fault lines"" and inequalities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, between generations, the wealthy and the disadvantaged, by ethnicity and geography. Free school meals should be extended, says Dame Rachel This includes how the gulf between rich and poor and young and old has widened, with older, higher earners increasing their savings in the lockdown, while poorer families and younger people have faced job losses and increasingly fragile finances. Today's young people are the first post-war generation to be less well-off than their parents, says the report launching the children's commissioner's review. ""As we emerge from the Covid pandemic, this is the moment for something big, for children to recognise the sacrifices they have made,"" said Dame Rachel. ""I have seen first-hand the effect of this crisis on young people's hopes and dreams, and sometimes our answers simply have not been good enough."" Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: ""Over the last decade the Conservatives have overseen record numbers of children being pushed into poverty, a worsening mental health crisis and an 18-month gap in learning between disadvantaged children and their peers at GCSE."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We know that children and families have faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic. ""We've expanded frontline charity support and provided new resources for schools and teachers to support children and young people's mental health. ""Our Â£1.7bn investment in recovery support will help tackle the impact of any lost learning and we are investing an additional Â£79m to increase the number of mental health support teams working with schools and colleges.""

'I found out my husband had indecent images',"People are being urged to spot signs that members of their families are viewing indecent images online. Calls to a confidential helpline to prevent online abuse in the UK have increased by nearly 50% during the pandemic, say reports. Stop it Now! said spending more time together in lockdown may have revealed signs in some households. Sarah - not her real name - from Wales has shared her story in the hope it will help others. Her husband of 25 years was arrested nearly five years ago for possessing indecent images of children. ""I had no idea what he was doing until the police raided our house early one morning as I was upstairs getting ready for work,"" she said. ""He must have realised the implications, but he kept on saying to me, 'I'm not a paedophile'."" Police took her husband for questioning and removed all electronic devices from the house. Later that day, Sarah was able to speak to him alone at the police station, which was when he confessed to viewing pornography for 10 years, including illegal material for the last two years. ""I was completely shocked and numbed,"" Sarah added. Social media regulator call over indecent images 'The most distressing experience of my life' ""When I learned what my husband had done, it immediately meant the end of our marriage. ""Many women choose to stick with their partners, but I knew our marriage could never be the same again."" Sarah thought her husband was just reading about interests such as sport Sarah initiated divorce proceedings as she felt she could not trust him any more. It also put her in an awkward position with her career as a teacher, while she had to break the news to their teenage daughters, who were studying at university. ""It was horrible telling my daughters, which I had to do by phone because they were both away studying,"" she said. ""I was afraid that, if I didn't act quickly, they might hear through social media. ""The police had arrived in marked cars and had also been to my husband's place of work to remove his computer, so I didn't know what was known in the local community."" Both daughters have managed to rebuild their relationship with their father, however Sarah, who has since remarried, said he is now ""depressed"" and living ""a pretty impoverished"" life. Sarah thought something was wrong, with a number of warning signs She said it is important people are able to recognise the signs. Her husband had a long history of depression and low self-esteem, he struggled at work and was always worried he might be forced out of his job. Sarah had a niggling suspicion something was not right and, a few weeks before his arrest, had called his line manager to express her concerns. She mistakenly thought his late nights on the computer and struggles with sleeping were because he was reading about his interests, such as sport. ""I wish now that I'd been less naÃ¯ve and trusting, and more suspicious,"" Sarah said. ""The abused children are the real victims of these crimes."" She said it is really important people act on any suspicion and praised the support she received from the Stop it Now! charity. It is the UK's first confidential and anonymous helpline dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse by supporting adults concerned about their own sexual thoughts and behaviours. Helpline director Donald Findlater urged anyone who suspects a loved one of viewing sexual images of an under-18 online to call. ""Due to Covid and people working and living more closely, I think that's part of the reason we've had an increase to the helpline. People are either more self-consciously aware or a loved one has noticed,"" he said. In 2020, 114 people from Wales contacted the helpline about their own or someone else's behaviour, with 2,750 viewing the self-help website. Mr Findlater added: ""Due to the pandemic, feelings of isolation, stress and general uncertainty, over the last year in particular, are often what leads to our callers' escalating pornography habits, and in turn, illegal online behaviour. ""It can be really tricky to spot the signs but they can include, becoming much more secretive with online devices, using them at odd times - such as early in the morning and feeling guilty or uneasy the next day."" National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: ""Anyone who is having inappropriate thoughts about children, or anyone who believes a family member may be, should seek help from Stop It Now!, otherwise they should expect a visit from police officers.""

""It was horrible telling my daughters, which I had to do by phone because they were both away studying,"" she said. ""I was afraid that, if I didn't act quickly, they might hear through social media. ""The police had arrived in marked cars and had also been to my husband's place of work to remove his computer, so I didn't know what was known in the local community."" Both daughters have managed to rebuild their relationship with their father, however Sarah, who has since remarried, said he is now ""depressed"" and living ""a pretty impoverished"" life. Sarah thought something was wrong, with a number of warning signs She said it is important people are able to recognise the signs. Her husband had a long history of depression and low self-esteem, he struggled at work and was always worried he might be forced out of his job. Sarah had a niggling suspicion something was not right and, a few weeks before his arrest, had called his line manager to express her concerns. She mistakenly thought his late nights on the computer and struggles with sleeping were because he was reading about his interests, such as sport. ""I wish now that I'd been less naÃ¯ve and trusting, and more suspicious,"" Sarah said. ""The abused children are the real victims of these crimes."" She said it is really important people act on any suspicion and praised the support she received from the Stop it Now! charity. It is the UK's first confidential and anonymous helpline dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse by supporting adults concerned about their own sexual thoughts and behaviours. Helpline director Donald Findlater urged anyone who suspects a loved one of viewing sexual images of an under-18 online to call. ""Due to Covid and people working and living more closely, I think that's part of the reason we've had an increase to the helpline. People are either more self-consciously aware or a loved one has noticed,"" he said. In 2020, 114 people from Wales contacted the helpline about their own or someone else's behaviour, with 2,750 viewing the self-help website. Mr Findlater added: ""Due to the pandemic, feelings of isolation, stress and general uncertainty, over the last year in particular, are often what leads to our callers' escalating pornography habits, and in turn, illegal online behaviour. ""It can be really tricky to spot the signs but they can include, becoming much more secretive with online devices, using them at odd times - such as early in the morning and feeling guilty or uneasy the next day."" National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: ""Anyone who is having inappropriate thoughts about children, or anyone who believes a family member may be, should seek help from Stop It Now!, otherwise they should expect a visit from police officers.""

UK to shift foreign policy focus after review,"The UK is pledging to shift its focus towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia, after a year-long review of its foreign policy. The government said it would boost alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, describing it as ""increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would work with China on issues such as climate change. And he warned against adopting a ""Cold-War mentality"" with the country. The review, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out later in the House of Commons, also paves the way for an increase in nuclear warheads. Labour says the strategy will leave the UK ""woefully unprepared"". Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army? Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' The publication of the review comes amidgrowing internal pressureon the government from Conservative circles to harden its line on China over issues such as its clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. Mr Raab said there were ""positives"" to the UK's relationship with China, including over trade and investment. He added that it would also not be possible to ""shift the dial"" on climate change without co-operating with the country. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said there would also be ""difficult issues"" to manage, including over protecting UK industrial secrets and telecoms infrastructure. But he warned: ""It wouldn't make sense, I don't think it would be feasible to go into some old, outdated Cold War mentality with China."" Pressed on whether the UK should toughen its stance on the country, as advocated by so-called China hawks, Mr Raab replied: ""China is here to stay."" Mr Raab also said more nuclear warheads could be required as part of the Integrated Review, as they represented the ""ultimate insurance policy"" against global threats. For years Britain's place in the world was defined by its membership of the European Union and its relationship with the United States. It was often seen as a bridge between the two. But Brexit changed all that. So now the government is looking for Britain to play a new global role. The big idea of the so-called Integrated Review of foreign policy is a new focus on the Indo-Pacific. The government wants to boost Britain's trade, security and diplomacy in a region that is seeing fast economic growth. But it also wants to build new partnerships as Britain recalibrates its relationship with the biggest player in Asia, namely China. The question is what this new ""Indo-Pacific tilt"" will actually mean in practice and whether it will come at a cost of not focusing enough on repairing relations with the EU. The long-awaitedintegrated reviewof foreign and defence policy will also set out plans for a White House-style situation room built in the Cabinet Office. It will also include plans for a new counter-terrorism operations centre, intended to improve the speed of response to terrorist incidents. Sir Alex Younger, a former head of MI6, told Today the gap between western nations and China had closed in important ways during the coronavirus pandemic, and a new approach was now needed. While he said there was ""no sense declaring a new Cold War"", Sir Alex admitted both China and the Russian government presented ""generational"" threats to Britain. Plans include building a White House-style situation room in the Cabinet Office While the government says Nato remains the bedrock of defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, it wants to work alongside allies to ""shape a more open international order in which democracies flourish"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the aim of the review would be to showcase offensive as well as defensive capabilities, suggesting high-tech investment in fields like artificial intelligence will help modernise the military, maintain Britain's power and bring economic growth at home. But he said becoming a technology ""superpower"" and competing with the likes of China was no easy task. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there was a ""yawning chasm"" between the government's words and actions and said government policy had ""left our defences down in our own backyard"". The publication of the review comes months afterBoris Johnson announced a Â£16.5bn increase in defence spendingover the next four years. At the time, he said the funding would allow for investment in an agency dedicated to artificial intelligence and a ""space command"" capable of launching the UK's first rocket by 2022, as well as a cyber corridor across the north of England which would include headquarters for the new National Cyber Force. But MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee have warned the extra funding could be swallowed up by a ""black hole"" in department finances, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facing a potential Â£17bn shortfall in its current equipment programme. The committee said a further Â£20bn the military wanted to invest has not been included in the budget and the MPs also accused the MoD of making unrealistic claims about future efficiency savings. Its chair, Meg Hillier, said it was crucial that the extra money for defence was not eaten up by the ""constant debilitating"" budget overruns that ""have been eroding our national defence and security for years"". The MoD said the increased funding would ""restore financial sustainability"".

PC accused of Sarah Everard murder in court,"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A Met police officer is due to go on trial in the autumn accused of the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Wayne Couzens, of Deal, appeared at the Old Bailey via a videolink from Belmarsh Prison. The judge set a plea hearing date for 9 July and a provisional trial for 25 October. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? The court heard the provisional trial could last up to four weeks. Prosecutor Tom Little QC said the circumstances of the case had led to a ""very significant and wide-ranging investigation"". He told the court the case had attracted ""almost unprecedented media and public attention"". Wayne Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018 In the short hearing, Mr Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. The 48-year-old wore grey tracksuit bottoms, a red top and appeared to have two cuts on his head. No bail application was made by defence barrister James Sturman QC, who also said legal aid was yet to be granted. Mr Couzens was charged on Friday and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday. Wayne Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh Prison Ms Everard had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home. She never arrived and was reported missing by her boyfriend the next day. Her body was found a week later inside a builder's bag in an area of woodland in Ashford and was identified through dental records. A post-mortem examination has taken place but no cause of death has been released. The court heard Sarah Everard's disappearance had attracted ""unprecedented media attention"" An inquest into the death of Ms Everard is likely to be opened later this week, Kent County Council has said. Mr Couzens joined the Met in September 2018 and was initially based in the Bromley area. In February last year he moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in London.

New safety measures after Sarah Everard death,"""Immediate steps"" aimed at improving safety for women and girls in England and Wales have been announced by No 10 after Sarah Everard's death. Among them is an additional Â£25m for better lighting and CCTV as well as a pilot scheme which would see plain-clothes officers in pubs and clubs. Campaigners say the money is not enough and called for institutional changes. Labour said meaningful changes to law are needed rather than plans involving ""police officers in skinny jeans"". It comes afterhundreds of people protestedin central London on Monday. Ms Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Following a meeting of the government's Crime and Justice Taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take ""immediate steps"" to give ""further reassurance"" to women and girls in the wake of the killing of Ms Everard. No 10 said it would double the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to Â£45m. Undercover police will be sent to clubs, bars and popular nightspots to relay intelligence about predatory or suspicious offenders to uniformed officers, in pilots of so-called Project Vigilant, rolled out across the country. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' How many attacks on women are there? LISTEN: How can women feel safer? Safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins said undercover officers working in the night-time economy would feed intelligence to uniformed officers. She said the government would work with businesses and police to ensure, as the industry reopened following the coronavirus lockdown, ""that women can feel safe in our streets"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" But Labour's shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips told BBC Breakfast that in her years of experience, she had not come across experts or victims calling for more CCTV in public spaces. She accused ministers of being ""caught on the hop"" and rolling out plans involving ""police officers in skinny jeans"" rather than meaningful changes to legislation regarding street harassment, or a detailed review of how rape is prosecuted in England and Wales. The shadow home secretary, Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the measures were ""nowhere near good enough"" and called for ""urgent action"" on issues like harassment of women, domestic homicide sentencing and more support for victims of rape. Labour MP Stella Creasy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more funding for better street lighting was not unwelcome, but ""it really just doesn't understand what the issues are"". She said measures focused on policing nightspots do not recognise ""that women get abused, assaulted and intimidated in all sorts of places"". Dr Ellie Cosgrave, a lecturer in urban innovation and policy at University College London, said it was right that the government consider lighting as a way to help make cities safer, but added: ""You can't just shove a light in and hope that the public space will be better."" She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that ""over-lighting"" some areas in a city can make other areas feel less safe. Dr Cosgrave said the best action ministers can take to make cities safer is to understand the ""social dynamics"" of an area by conducting surveys, speaking to people, and implementing change based on what they say. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast it was good news that more women were feeling more confident to report rape allegations, but he added ""we still haven't done well enough to get the evidence that can secure convictions"". A spokeswoman for organisation Reclaim These Streets said it welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were ""so important"". ""Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,"" she said. This video can not be played Dania Al-Obeid: ""All I wanted was to stand with other women"" Home Secretary Priti Patel had warned against holding vigils, and has launched a review into the policing of a gathering over the weekend insouth London in memory of Ms Everard. During that event, officers handcuffed and removed several women after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects. On Monday, hundreds marched across central London in what was said to be a meeting by Sisters Uncut, which describes itself as an ""intersectional feminist direct-action collective"", with many of those in attendance carrying placards. Four people were arrested- three on suspicion of breaching coronavirus regulations and a fourth on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker. A further two people were issued with fixed penalty notices, the Metropolitan Police said. Protests will be able to legally resume on 29 March, when the coronavirus ""stay at home"" order lifts in England. The prime minister's spokesman said demonstrations will continue to be subject to Covid-secure precautions such as appropriate measures to maintain social distancing. Meanwhile, MPs will continue debating the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill later, which would change how protests are managed, including allowing police to impose conditions such as start and finish times. Labour has criticised the bill saying it did ""nothing to help women feel safer"", and imposed ""disproportionate"" controls on freedom of speech. Ms Patelsaid the bill would end the halfway releaseof those convicted of sexual offences such as rape and also said the Domestic Abuse bill was on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, which she said would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"".

"'I lost Â£4,000 on Football Index in seven days'","Queens Park Rangers said on Friday it had now removed Football Index sponsorship from its shirts. It's been sleepless nights and cold sweats for customers of Football Index, the gambling company whose collapse into administration has left people facing huge losses. ""I feel embarrassed and cheated,"" Ben told the BBC. He's not alone. Social media and online chat threads are alight with anger and dismay at the rapid demise of one of the UK's fastest growing betting firms. In the couple of weeks before Football Index called in administrators to run the business, Ben, aged 22, lost more than Â£4,000 in seven days, Â£1,400 of which disappeared in 24 hours. It's now possible he will lose all his Â£6,500 deposit in the firm. ""I'm employed, I live at home, and I've not got many overheads. I'm only responsible for myself right now, but there are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse."" Like other people who spoke to the BBC - young, male and red-faced at losing so much money - Ben did not want to disclose his surname. ""The crash has affected me mentally,"" he said. ""Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index."" What has happened to Football Index? The Jersey-based company styled itself as a ""stock market of football"". Gamblers, which it called punters, bought and sold ""shares"" in professional footballers, earning dividend payments depending on the players' performance and rising - or falling - value. Launched in 2015, it soon became a fixture of the sports betting sector and was a sponsor of Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest football teams, which have removed branding. Now, Football Index risks becoming the biggest failure in UK gambling history. Reports suggest punters stand to lose up to Â£100m. Law firm Leigh Day is investigating whether there are grounds to take legal action against the platform on behalf of affected punters. Jack, 24, told the BBC: ""I have always been really into football. But I was never interested in traditional football betting. Football Index had a stock market element, which attracted me. It combined my interest in analysing the game."" He has already lost Â£5,000, and fears his remaining Â£2,500 locked up in the business will go. ""I earn a modest public sector wage, so Â£7,500 goes a long way."" He says that, with hindsight, there were signs Football Index had been ""going downhill for a while"". But things turned really sour on 5 March. The company cut dividend payouts on players, sparking a crash in their ""share"" value. There's also concern that Football Index had recently issued ""shares"" in new players, which encouraged people to ""invest"". What angers customers is that these were corporate policy changes, and nothing to do with footballers' performances. ""We all knew that if a footballer broke a leg or moved to China, that would affect the value,"" he said. ""This was different."" Another Football Index customer put it this way: ""If I'd put Â£1,000 on the 3.15 at Ascot and it came last, that's my fault. I'll take the hit."" But Football Index ""moved the goalposts in the middle of the game"", he believes. ""Â£20,000 is a lot of money to lose. I have been putting money into Football Index since 2016, when I was 18. A year ago my portfolio was 100% up. ""The drop in value of my portfolio sets me back a lot. Most of it was savings. I've seen Football Index as my savings account. ""I will have to think about what to do without that substantial money and I have made cutbacks in my personal life. I've moved out of London and back into the family home. I used to be quite free with my spending but now I tell myself that I can't spend anything. ""I would have wanted to buy property with the money - put it down as a deposit. ""Mentally, football doesn't give me the same enjoyment. I put a lot of energy into my portfolio. After five years of putting energy into it, it's all been sucked out."" Jack says it was almost a relief when management called in administrators to try to salvage something from the business. ""For days (before the collapse) I'd been struggling with what to do - pull out what money was left, hang on for an upturn,"" he said. ""There's been talk of legal action. I've considered that. Now the decisions have been taken out of my hands. It's lifted a worry."" Some critics argue Football Index was akin to a Ponzi scheme. ""To pay out dividends, it required more customers to deposit money. When that dried up, the problems started"", said Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling and a former gambling addict. ""Football Index is an unsustainable business model. They created a stock market out of assets they themselves created. The football players on the market had no underlying value,"" he said. Ben saw Â£4,000 of his money evaporate within days Jack thinks the Ponzi comparison is unfair. Gamblers knew what they were getting into - they just didn't expect Football Index to suddenly change its terms, he said. ""The concept is still brilliant. It was fun. If there was a change of management I'd be willing to give them a second chance - but I'll definitely reduce my (financial) stake,"" he said. Jack, and Mr Zarb-Cousin, agree on one thing, though: the Gambling Commission (GC) has a lot of questions to answer. ""Football Index should never have been given a licence. Did the Gambling Commission really understand what they were approving? They should certainly have acted earlier,"" Mr Zarb-Cousin said. James Grimes, an ex-gambler and founder of the The Big Step campaign group, said: ""It comes as little surprise to many of us harmed by gambling that another company has failed to protect its customers from immeasurable harm. ""The immediate financial impact on the people caught up in this failure is devastating, but the damage to mental health and affected others is too much to contemplate, especially when gambling-related harm incurs such a high suicide risk."" The GC declined to comment, instead referring the BBC to itsstatement last week and suspension of the company's gambling licence,externalafter Football Index called in administrators. This statement said the GC had concerns Football Index was not operating ""in accordance with a condition of its licence"". Football Index also declined to comment. In a statement last week, the company's parent, BetIndex,said its ""goal"" was for Football Index to re-open for trading once a restructuring was completed.,externalIt also said remaining cash balances were being held in a ""segregated account"".

'I found out my husband had indecent images'People are urged to look out for signs family members are viewing illegal images online.,"People are being urged to spot signs that members of their families are viewing indecent images online. Calls to a confidential helpline to prevent online abuse in the UK have increased by nearly 50% during the pandemic, say reports. Stop it Now! said spending more time together in lockdown may have revealed signs in some households. Sarah - not her real name - from Wales has shared her story in the hope it will help others. Her husband of 25 years was arrested nearly five years ago for possessing indecent images of children. ""I had no idea what he was doing until the police raided our house early one morning as I was upstairs getting ready for work,"" she said. ""He must have realised the implications, but he kept on saying to me, 'I'm not a paedophile'."" Police took her husband for questioning and removed all electronic devices from the house. Later that day, Sarah was able to speak to him alone at the police station, which was when he confessed to viewing pornography for 10 years, including illegal material for the last two years. ""I was completely shocked and numbed,"" Sarah added. Social media regulator call over indecent images 'The most distressing experience of my life' ""When I learned what my husband had done, it immediately meant the end of our marriage. ""Many women choose to stick with their partners, but I knew our marriage could never be the same again."" Sarah thought her husband was just reading about interests such as sport Sarah initiated divorce proceedings as she felt she could not trust him any more. It also put her in an awkward position with her career as a teacher, while she had to break the news to their teenage daughters, who were studying at university. ""It was horrible telling my daughters, which I had to do by phone because they were both away studying,"" she said. ""I was afraid that, if I didn't act quickly, they might hear through social media. ""The police had arrived in marked cars and had also been to my husband's place of work to remove his computer, so I didn't know what was known in the local community."" Both daughters have managed to rebuild their relationship with their father, however Sarah, who has since remarried, said he is now ""depressed"" and living ""a pretty impoverished"" life. Sarah thought something was wrong, with a number of warning signs She said it is important people are able to recognise the signs. Her husband had a long history of depression and low self-esteem, he struggled at work and was always worried he might be forced out of his job. Sarah had a niggling suspicion something was not right and, a few weeks before his arrest, had called his line manager to express her concerns. She mistakenly thought his late nights on the computer and struggles with sleeping were because he was reading about his interests, such as sport. ""I wish now that I'd been less naÃ¯ve and trusting, and more suspicious,"" Sarah said. ""The abused children are the real victims of these crimes."" She said it is really important people act on any suspicion and praised the support she received from the Stop it Now! charity. It is the UK's first confidential and anonymous helpline dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse by supporting adults concerned about their own sexual thoughts and behaviours. Helpline director Donald Findlater urged anyone who suspects a loved one of viewing sexual images of an under-18 online to call.

PC accused of Sarah Everard murder in courtWayne Couzens appears at the Old Bailey accused of murdering and kidnapping the 33-year-old.London,"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A Met police officer is due to go on trial in the autumn accused of the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Wayne Couzens, of Deal, appeared at the Old Bailey via a videolink from Belmarsh Prison. The judge set a plea hearing date for 9 July and a provisional trial for 25 October. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? The court heard the provisional trial could last up to four weeks. Prosecutor Tom Little QC said the circumstances of the case had led to a ""very significant and wide-ranging investigation"". He told the court the case had attracted ""almost unprecedented media and public attention"". Wayne Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018 In the short hearing, Mr Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. The 48-year-old wore grey tracksuit bottoms, a red top and appeared to have two cuts on his head. No bail application was made by defence barrister James Sturman QC, who also said legal aid was yet to be granted. Mr Couzens was charged on Friday and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday. Wayne Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh Prison Ms Everard had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home. She never arrived and was reported missing by her boyfriend the next day. Her body was found a week later inside a builder's bag in an area of woodland in Ashford and was identified through dental records. A post-mortem examination has taken place but no cause of death has been released. The court heard Sarah Everard's disappearance had attracted ""unprecedented media attention"" An inquest into the death of Ms Everard is likely to be opened later this week, Kent County Council has said. Mr Couzens joined the Met in September 2018 and was initially based in the Bromley area. In February last year he moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in London.

The inside story of Number 10's battle against Covid,"At the beginning of March 2020, I asked a senior member of the government: ""Do you feel worried?"" They replied: ""Personally? No."" But just weeks later, Downing Street was scrambling to manage the biggest crisis since World War Two. Since then, monumental decisions have had to be taken. And there have been many accusations of failings - the desperate shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), Covid ripping through unprepared care homes, hundreds of billions borrowed and spent to keep the economy going, to name a few. I have asked 20 of the most senior politicians, officials and former officials, who either witnessed or were involved in the big decisions, to pick five pivotal moments from the past 12 months. What they say tells us so much about what really happened, what our leaders were thinking, and, strikingly, how little they knew. The contributors are not being named, so they could speak freely. On 31 January, it was reported that coronavirus had arrived in the UK, as two people were admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, more than 80 Britons evacuated from China were quarantined at a facility in the north-west of England. But for the government, Brexit had sucked up all the political energy - it was the day the country officially left the EU. The prime minister and his team were exhausted but elated. It felt like Boris Johnson had ""just really started to take flight"", one member of the team tells me. Ministers and officials had already been meeting to discuss the virus in China - but it felt thousands of miles away. There was a ""lack of concern and energy,"" one source tells me. ""The general view was it is just hysteria. It was just like a flu."" The prime minister was even heard to say: ""The best thing would be to ignore it."" And he repeatedly warned, several sources tell me, that an overreaction could do more harm than good. A small group in Downing Street had started daily meetings, after, according to one of those who attended, ""it became clear that there was no proper, 'Emergency break-the-glass' plan."" But for many of those I've spoken to, the game-changer was at the end of February, when the virus took hold in northern Italy - it was closer to home, and England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had, one minister told me, warned that if it got out of China, it would become global, and be on its way to the UK. ""The biggest moment for me was when I saw those pictures of northern Italy,"" one senior minister says. ""I thought that will be us if we don't move."" Reports of the chaos there catapulted the virus, one senior minister says, ""from not on the radar, to people on the floor of hospitals in Lombardy."" They say that was the moment ""we knew that it was inevitable"". Ministers and officials became locked in arguments over how to respond. The prime minister and many cabinet ministers were reluctant to consider anything as draconian as a lockdown. To many people, the very idea would have seemed fanciful. Even stopping shaking hands seemed a step too far for the prime minister. Before the first major coronavirus briefing on 3 March, he had, I am told, been prepared by aides to say, if asked by journalists, people should stop shaking hands with each other - as per government scientific advice. But he said the exact opposite. ""I've shaken hands with everybody,"" he said, about visiting a hospital with Covid patients. And it was not just a slip, one of those present at the briefing says. It demonstrated ""the whole conflict for him - and his lack of understanding of the severity of what was coming"". A Downing Street spokesperson told the BBC: ""The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed."" By this point, Mr Johnson was attending emergency committee Cobra meetings with officials and leaders from Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff - although he had missed the first few. But one senior politician who attended at the same time says: ""The early meetings with the prime minister were dreadful."" And inside Downing Street, senior staff's concerns about the government's ability to cope grew. There were huge logistical considerations about equipment, facilities and how fast the disease might move in the UK, and questions about how effective the actions taken in China to suppress the virus would be here. It was not well understood, for example, that people without symptoms could still pass it on, nor that Britons returning from half-term holidays in northern Europe were bringing the virus back home in large numbers. ""There was a genuine argument in government, which everyone has subsequently denied,"" one senior figure tells me, about whether there should be a hard lockdown or a plan to protect only the most vulnerable, and even encourage what was described to me at that time as ""some degree of herd immunity"". There was even talk of ""chicken pox parties"", where healthy people might be encouraged to gather to spread the disease. And while that was not considered a policy proposal, real consideration was given to whether suppressing Covid entirely could be counter productive. On 3 March, when the prime minister set out the government's plan, the focus was on detecting early cases and preventing the spread. But on 12 March, with journalists crammed into the state dining room at No 10, he told the public that the country was facing its worst health crisis in a generation. Anyone with symptoms was told to stay at home for a week. Advisers seemed confident it was not yet time to close schools or stop large crowds gathering. And the government's scientists felt they had time to slow everything down - the peak was not expected for another 10-14 weeks. That same week, though, nervousness was rising among others in government that the virus was outpacing everyone's expectations, and the plans in place to smooth out the outbreak would not work. One source tells me it felt like the ""government machine was breaking in our hands"", things were ""imploding"", and within 48 hours the approach outlined on the 12th would feel out of date. There has been no shortage of controversy over whether the government was too slow to close the doors on 23 March - but many of the conversations I have had, pinpoint the moment it became urgent in No 10. On 13 March, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee concluded the virus was spreading faster than thought. But it was Downing Street ""modellers in the building"", according to one current official, who pored again over the numbers, and realised the timetable that had only just been announced was likely to result in disaster. The next morning, a small group of key staff got together. Simple graphs were drawn on a whiteboard and the prime minister was confronted with the stark prediction that the plan he had just announced would result in the NHS collapsing under the sheer number of cases. Several of those present tell me that was the moment Mr Johnson realised the urgency - that the official assumptions about the speed of the spread of this new disease had been wrong. To prevent the NHS ""falling over"", he was warned, the government would have to impose measures as infections rose. And while they could be relaxed as cases fell, this pattern might recur across ""multiple waves for 18 months"". Several sources recall vividly the ""snake like graph"" they were shown that day. Then, one official says, everything started to move at ""lightning speed"". And behind closed doors - before the terrifying projections of Imperial College became public, a couple of days later - plans were accelerated. On 16 March, the public were told to stop all unnecessary social contact and to work at home if possible. New cabinet committees were formed. And the machine moved into a different phase, with the prime minister and the ""quad"" - Matt Hancock, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - the new decision-making form. It was, I am told, ""high tension - [with] a lot of testosterone in the room"". For many inside government, the pace of change that week was staggering - but others remain frustrated the government machine, in their view, had failed to move quickly enough. There was tension between those who wanted to ensure systems were as ready as they could be first, and others who argued vociferously that moving fast against the virus was more important than anything else. But those I spoke to now agree on one thing - how much they did not know about the disease. ""You can kick yourself about the things that you wish you knew,"" one minister says, ""but we just didn't have anything in place."" Another cabinet minister says: ""It's easy to say we should have locked down longer, gone harder, but there are more complex debates about where the national interests really lie."" And it was all so strange. One minister who made some of the public announcements when lockdown came says: ""I remember when I wrote it into the script, I just couldn't believe that I was saying this."" And one official, struck by how huge it all felt, says he googled: ""Did they shut the schools during the War?"" Another, meanwhile, admits, ""We were more blind than we told the public,"" and suggests that is still the case one year on. On 18 March, we reported that a small number of members of staff in No 10 had fallen ill. One insider says: ""People were dropping like flies."" The prime minister, however, was acting as though he was impervious to the risk. He had developed a habit of banging his own chest, telling staff he was ""strong as a bull"". Soon, though, this chest-banging turned into ""extreme coughing fits"". Tests, in short supply everywhere, were requested for him from 25 March. And two days later, he tested positive. He switched to the chancellor's bigger suite of offices so that he could keep working, screened off from the rest of the building. Insiders recall how much he hated this and, in a second spell of isolation in the autumn, chairs had to be placed across the door ""like a puppy gate"", so he could still communicate with the tiny number of staff allowed into the same part of the building. Then, at the end of March, the prime minister became increasingly ill - each video call he made to reassure the public required more takes. On 6 April, he agreed to go to St Thomas' Hospital and, struggling for breath on a phone call, I have been told, confirmed he wanted Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stand in for him. Initially, Downing Street tried to give the impression that all was well. Journalists were even told that Mr Johnson was working on his red boxes. That message has been put down to a mix up, and we now know this was far from the truth. The moment of genuine crisis came when he was moved into intensive care. No-one knew if the prime minister would make it through the night - or what the plan was if he did not. By this point, with so many in No 10 and in government already sick, there were, I have been told, about ""half a dozen people running things"". Fears that he might need to be intubated were shared by a tiny group inside Number 10. They discussed the possibility that ministers would have to gather in the cabinet room, with the doors closed, until they chose a successor - but there was no fixed protocol, and no conclusion was reached. The Tory Party, I have been told, even started to consider how to transfer the leadership without a contest, fearing that such a competition could be seen as ""venal"" after the prime minister's death. Then cabinet ministers were summoned urgently for a conference call. ""All of a sudden we were asked to join this call - not knowing if he was alive,"" one tells me.  Then No 10 prepared to make the news public. The Downing Street voice on the other end of the phone cracked with fear as I was asked to get to the Foreign Office as soon possible with a camera to talk to Mr Raab, who was being sent out to try to reassure the country. We reported the news that Mr Johnson was in intensive care from the back of a taxi. A former official tells me: ""We thought we really could lose him - we had to plan for a full transition."" That night was ""long and shocking"", one source says. By the end of May, the number of coronavirus cases was falling, the prime minister was back at work full time, and the public had surprised the government by overwhelmingly sticking to the rules. Furthermore, despite some embarrassing and prominent lockdown breaches - in April, for example, Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to quit over her visits to her holiday home - there had been what one senior minister describes as ""tremendous goodwill"". But then came the Mirror and the Guardian's scoop - in March, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled hundreds of miles to County Durham, after his wife fell ill with Covid. He, too, succumbed to the virus and his stay on his family's farm to recover, before returning to London, had been kept secret - apart from among a tiny number of Downing Street staff. And Mr Cummings was determined not to quit. After considering sacking him, the prime minister stuck by him - but first, there was what has been described to me as tense ""mediation between a couple deciding whether to divorce"". Before making that decision, he had summoned Mr Cummings to go through his version of events. Together, they planned for him to give this version publicly - despite others' protestations. The result was the surreal press conference in the Downing Street rose garden. Many of those I have talked to describe this episode as a terrible turning-point. ""Even for us, this is mad,"" a member of the Downing Street team tells me. Senior ministers say: ""The handling was a fiasco"". ""It was ridiculous"", and, at a time of national emergency, ""broke the political consensus"". Perhaps, after two months of lockdown, the public was ready to be angry with someone. MPs' inboxes were swamped with irate emails - mine too. ""The early pandemic washed away all the bitterness of Brexit,"" one senior minister tells me. ""That all came flooding back, all that bile, all that pent up frustration."" Some ministers tweeted their support for Mr Cummings. One of those who refused says: ""He should have resigned straight away. You lead by example. I was busy chopping logs with my chainsaw to get the frustration out."" Some polling suggests the Barnard Castle episode really did dent the public's trust in the government. ""It gave people who wanted to break the rules an excuse,"" one source says. But inside government, there was a belief that an extraordinary period of unity had already started to fade, and the public had started to tire of the rules once the government had moved towards its plans to lift them. There is no question, though, the whole misadventure made the politics of the pandemic more scratchy and less consensual. Mr Cummings was not the only one to be caught up. In June, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, provoked anger by attending a huge Republican funeral. But it was after Barnard Castle that it felt like the mood in the country had changed. ""People wanted to portray the PM as a clown,"" one minister tells me, ""or not up to the level of events."" Britain in the summer did not feel like a country still gripped by a pandemic. ""There was loads of over optimistic messaging,"" one politician says. For example, the time when a Labour MP asked for advice at the end of June for his constituency, which was home to a popular beach and he was worried about huge numbers heading for the sea. ""Show some guts,"" the prime minister told him. In July, a grinning chancellor delivered plates of Japanese curry to unsuspecting customers at a London restaurant, to promote his ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Then the prime minister started to encourage people back to the office. But behind closed doors, there were significant doubts about the wisdom of this new mood. ""We knew there was going to be a second wave,"" one cabinet minister tells me, ""and there was a row about whether people should work from home or not - it was totally ridiculous."" The summer optimism and opening was ""the biggest mistake - a rush of blood to the head"", another senior figure says. ""The PM has to carry the can"". The prime minister believed that another lockdown would be a disaster and wanted to avoid it at all costs - but for many of those involved in making the decisions, his hostility to tightening the rules again was frustrating, dangerous and political. ""The policy objective in the summer and the autumn was - do the minimum possible,"" one tells me. But by the end of August, with Britons packing beaches, the warnings of what might come were already flickering in Number 10. Some days, sources suggest, the prime minister would express concern about the virus coming back. Others, he would be in ""let-it-rip mode"". And senior officials expressed deep concern about what seemed to be changes of heart on a daily basis. The disease would not be contained by indecision, and  by the start of September, with schools and universities having returned, ""you could clearly see a steady increase,"" a senior figure says. The testing system had not been able to keep pace with demand, and too few people were willing to, or could afford, to self-isolate if they tested positive. ""The idea that you could liberalise in the summer was based on the idea that you could whackamole with test and trace,"" the source says. ""But if you didn't whack the right moles then it doesn't work."" By the middle of September, ""the data was already screaming out"", one insider says. On the 17th, I was told by one source: ""If you do nothing now, by the end of October you will get something worse than the first wave."" The possibility of a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown was already being discussed in Downing Street that week. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and Mr Cummings and others were arguing hard for action to be taken - but the prime minister was unpersuaded. Others wanted to push again - one current official recalls a ""concerted effort"" - and on Sunday 20th, the No 10 team gathered a range of scientists. But the prime minister remained reluctant. Another current official describes his attitude as, ""if there is a way not to act, why do it?"". Over the next 36 hours, I have been told, a small group inside Downing Street repeatedly tried to change Mr Johnson's mind - but by then, he was operating in a very different atmosphere. ""A swampiness had risen because of ideological pressure on this government at every turn to do less - and to do it more slowly,"" a senior figure says. And it is understood Mr Johnson had privately assured groups of MPs there would be no more restrictions. The Treasury was pointing out the damage any further restrictions would do to the economy, many of the traditional Tory-backing newspapers were hungry for restrictions to be relaxed, the party was restless, and I remember cabinet ministers who had hardly any cases of the virus in their constituencies at that point, suggesting they saw no evidence for further action. So when Mr Johnson made changes to the coronavirus restrictions on 22 September, they were tweaks, rather than a real tightening up.  I remember talking to Tory backbenchers that day who felt they had won. The importance of the missed September moment is cited by many senior figures - and some now concede it was a mistake. ""We strained at the leash to get things going,"" one cabinet minister admits. ""I was aggressively for that - but I have learned that it is better to go slow."" Another senior minister, one of those who pushed for more radical action at the time, now says: ""We should have locked down more severely, earlier in the autumn - the whole point was, the earlier you act the more you buy yourself time for a strategy that can get out."" You can still hear the frustration in the voices of those who lost the argument. ""The PM was saying the Tory Party won't swallow it,"" one tells me. ""Everyone else felt, we know we are going to have to do a lockdown."" And there is no question that the tier system that was introduced over the autumn, which portioned England into different levels of restrictions, was soon tied up in confusion and regional spats. ""It was completely unintelligible to any normal human being,"" one senior official says. ""It was too slow, and too Byzantine, and that resulted in more cases."" Another says now: ""We ended up tying ourselves into ever tighter knots,"" as the system became more and more particular to each part of the country. It is impossible to know what would have happened if the brakes had been slammed on in September - but some ministers pin the terrible scale of the second wave, at least in part, on the apparent reluctance to act. The circuit-breaker that was imposed later in Wales did not make the problem go away, however. Case numbers weren't the only concern - the economy had been shuttered, and shattered. Political demands had changed. In defence of Mr Johnson, one senior minister says: ""He's not to blame if he was trying to reflect the aspiration for the country back in the summer"". Another tells me the plans, and the billions spent on ""test-and-trace and tiering meant it was reasonable to do the unlock"". They reject the idea that a circuit breaker was the obvious option - ""There wasn't a slam dunk recommendation."" Regarding the potential introduction of national restrictions in September, Downing Street referred us back to comments made by the prime minister to parliament in early November. ""No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential,"" Mr Johnson told the Commons. ""So it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low."" But while there is no question mistakes were made in the first phase of the pandemic, when so much about the virus was a mystery, those involved in the decisions are already less forgiving of their own mistakes the second time around. ""A miracle,"" is how one minister describes the vaccine gamble to me. A government so often lambasted by critics for busting convention did it again - but this time, so far, with a stunning outcome. Vaccines had been discussed in January, as the government machine began to contemplate, slowly, what might be ahead. Early on the chancellor, holding the cheque book, indicated a willingness to spend at speed, without asking for guarantees. No 10 decided to ""chuck everything at it"", at a meeting in April. With Sir Patrick's crucial experience and deputy chief medical officer for England Prof Jonathan Van-Tam's emphasis on the practicalities of delivering the vaccine, politicians were persuaded to take what was then a huge risk. There was an early decision to ""pay high, pay early, and ensure it works,"" one senior official tells me. And it seems their decision was informed by everything that had gone wrong with trying to secure PPE - the collapse of the NHS's normal procurement process, which is controlled by the Department of Health. The UK decided early not to participate in the EU's joint plan to buy vaccines. While publicly this decision may have been politically controversial, behind closed doors it was ""easy"" and ""straightforward"", ministers and officials say. ""No-one wanted any of the Brexit baggage anywhere near it."" And, more importantly, the EU had made it clear any participating country would be unable to make its own deals with manufacturers the EU had an agreement with - or control its own supply. The vaccines team had warned ministers at the start of May that nothing was certain - and developing a vaccine as quickly as the prime minister, who ""wanted it yesterday"", required would be an uphill struggle. But, as one minister says, it was ""the one thing we would wish that we had done in a year's time"". Another, a senior minister, says: ""The PM strategically saw immediately that the combination of testing, drugs and vaccine was the way out."" And when it came to vaccines, the UK was ready to take an expensive gamble. The Treasury was spending speculatively in ways it had not since the War - and vaccine spending has already reached nearly Â£13.5bn. ""Imagine if it hadn't come off and we had spent all of that taxpayers' money,"" one senior official says to me. There was intense secrecy, throughout, with the various vaccines given secret code names to ensure commercial confidentiality. All were named after submarines - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine ""Ambush"", I can now reveal, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca ""Triumph"". After 12 months of grappling with endless calculations about balancing risks to life, wider health and how the country makes a living, decision-makers are exhausted. They have to accept it is perfectly possible to be wrong, one senior minister tells me. And those who made the decisions are all too aware mistakes they made in these past 12 months may have had such a terrible cost. Â© 2025 BBC.

Greggs to open shops despite first loss in 36 years,"Bakery chain Greggs is to open 100 new shops in 2021 as it bets on a post-pandemic recovery. This is despite the chain reporting its first loss for 36 years in 2020 after sales fell by a third amid coronavirus lockdown measures. Greggs said it had ramped up deliveries, wholesale, and click-and-collect as High Street sales fell. Chief executive Roger Whiteside added that Greggs had ""made a better-than-expected start to 2021"". He added that the chain was ""well placed to participate in the recovery from the pandemic"". Sales at company-managed shops fell by more than 36% last year as footfall in city centres and travel hub sites fell substantially during lockdowns. This was partly offset by deliveries through Just Eat, which is one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms. Greggs reported a pre-tax loss of Â£13.7m, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984. Nevertheless, the chain is planning to open about 100 net new shops this year, adding to the 2,078 it already operates. 'I lost my job and launched a pop-up food business' Uber sees 'fundamental shift' in food order demand Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pandemic ""tore a huge chunk off business as it turned once bustling city centres into ghost towns"". ""Although the crisis is likely to prove a temporary interruption to our insatiable demand for sausage rolls rather than a sign of dramatically changing tastes, it is quite a sustained break, and it's going to take a toll. Greggs has previously said it doesn't expect a return to pre-Covid levels of operations until 2022 at the earliest."" John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: ""The High Street is likely to be a very different place when lockdown restrictions are fully ended, with many empty spaces and chains such as Pret re-focusing on suburban areas - the traditional heartland of Greggs. ""While these factors cannot be underestimated, the company is in good shape, with a solid balance sheet, and has a great record of rising to the challenge."" Greggs chairman Ian Durant said 2020 was ""not the year that any of us planned for"". He said the firm had started the year strongly but then temporarily closed its shops in March due to the Covid outbreak. It then reopened shops in the middle of the year. To get through the pandemic, Greggs arranged financing both from the government, which it has since repaid, and from lenders. ""Government support has been essential to mitigate the impact of Covid and protect as many jobs as possible through this period,"" Mr Durant said. He said it had been ""sad to say goodbye"" to staff whose roles had been cut by the firm ""to reflect the reality of the trading environment"".

PC accused of Sarah Everard murder due in court,"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A Met police officer is due to go on trial in the autumn accused of the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Wayne Couzens, of Deal, appeared at the Old Bailey via a videolink from Belmarsh Prison. The judge set a plea hearing date for 9 July and a provisional trial for 25 October. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? The court heard the provisional trial could last up to four weeks. Prosecutor Tom Little QC said the circumstances of the case had led to a ""very significant and wide-ranging investigation"". He told the court the case had attracted ""almost unprecedented media and public attention"". Wayne Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018 In the short hearing, Mr Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. The 48-year-old wore grey tracksuit bottoms, a red top and appeared to have two cuts on his head. No bail application was made by defence barrister James Sturman QC, who also said legal aid was yet to be granted. Mr Couzens was charged on Friday and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday. Wayne Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh Prison Ms Everard had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home. She never arrived and was reported missing by her boyfriend the next day. Her body was found a week later inside a builder's bag in an area of woodland in Ashford and was identified through dental records. A post-mortem examination has taken place but no cause of death has been released. The court heard Sarah Everard's disappearance had attracted ""unprecedented media attention"" An inquest into the death of Ms Everard is likely to be opened later this week, Kent County Council has said. Mr Couzens joined the Met in September 2018 and was initially based in the Bromley area. In February last year he moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in London.

Post-Brexit UK to reshape its foreign policy,"The UK is pledging to shift its focus towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia, after a year-long review of its foreign policy. The government said it would boost alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, describing it as ""increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would work with China on issues such as climate change. And he warned against adopting a ""Cold-War mentality"" with the country. The review, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out later in the House of Commons, also paves the way for an increase in nuclear warheads. Labour says the strategy will leave the UK ""woefully unprepared"". Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army? Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' The publication of the review comes amidgrowing internal pressureon the government from Conservative circles to harden its line on China over issues such as its clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. Mr Raab said there were ""positives"" to the UK's relationship with China, including over trade and investment. He added that it would also not be possible to ""shift the dial"" on climate change without co-operating with the country. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said there would also be ""difficult issues"" to manage, including over protecting UK industrial secrets and telecoms infrastructure. But he warned: ""It wouldn't make sense, I don't think it would be feasible to go into some old, outdated Cold War mentality with China."" Pressed on whether the UK should toughen its stance on the country, as advocated by so-called China hawks, Mr Raab replied: ""China is here to stay."" Mr Raab also said more nuclear warheads could be required as part of the Integrated Review, as they represented the ""ultimate insurance policy"" against global threats. For years Britain's place in the world was defined by its membership of the European Union and its relationship with the United States. It was often seen as a bridge between the two. But Brexit changed all that. So now the government is looking for Britain to play a new global role. The big idea of the so-called Integrated Review of foreign policy is a new focus on the Indo-Pacific. The government wants to boost Britain's trade, security and diplomacy in a region that is seeing fast economic growth. But it also wants to build new partnerships as Britain recalibrates its relationship with the biggest player in Asia, namely China. The question is what this new ""Indo-Pacific tilt"" will actually mean in practice and whether it will come at a cost of not focusing enough on repairing relations with the EU. The long-awaitedintegrated reviewof foreign and defence policy will also set out plans for a White House-style situation room built in the Cabinet Office. It will also include plans for a new counter-terrorism operations centre, intended to improve the speed of response to terrorist incidents. Sir Alex Younger, a former head of MI6, told Today the gap between western nations and China had closed in important ways during the coronavirus pandemic, and a new approach was now needed. While he said there was ""no sense declaring a new Cold War"", Sir Alex admitted both China and the Russian government presented ""generational"" threats to Britain. Plans include building a White House-style situation room in the Cabinet Office While the government says Nato remains the bedrock of defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, it wants to work alongside allies to ""shape a more open international order in which democracies flourish"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the aim of the review would be to showcase offensive as well as defensive capabilities, suggesting high-tech investment in fields like artificial intelligence will help modernise the military, maintain Britain's power and bring economic growth at home. But he said becoming a technology ""superpower"" and competing with the likes of China was no easy task. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there was a ""yawning chasm"" between the government's words and actions and said government policy had ""left our defences down in our own backyard"". The publication of the review comes months afterBoris Johnson announced a Â£16.5bn increase in defence spendingover the next four years. At the time, he said the funding would allow for investment in an agency dedicated to artificial intelligence and a ""space command"" capable of launching the UK's first rocket by 2022, as well as a cyber corridor across the north of England which would include headquarters for the new National Cyber Force. But MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee have warned the extra funding could be swallowed up by a ""black hole"" in department finances, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facing a potential Â£17bn shortfall in its current equipment programme. The committee said a further Â£20bn the military wanted to invest has not been included in the budget and the MPs also accused the MoD of making unrealistic claims about future efficiency savings. Its chair, Meg Hillier, said it was crucial that the extra money for defence was not eaten up by the ""constant debilitating"" budget overruns that ""have been eroding our national defence and security for years"". The MoD said the increased funding would ""restore financial sustainability"".

Charities warn cancer death rate could rise,"A group of 47 cancer charities says that without urgent action, the UK's cancer death rate will rise for the first time in decades. NHS figures suggest tens of thousands fewer people started cancer treatment since the first lockdown compared to normal times. One Cancer Voice says that the NHS needs more resources. The government says cancer treatment remains a top priority and urges people to see their GP if they have symptoms. People 'delayed GP cancer checks because of Covid' Radio 1 Newsbeat has spoken exclusively to One Cancer Voice about the impact of coronavirus on cancer care. The group of charities also wants to see more staff available to diagnose and treat cancer, with greater NHS access to private facilities in order to ""clear the backlog"". ""We are calling on the government to invest more money in ensuring the backlog of cancer cases is reduced and eliminated,"" says Michelle Mitchell, the boss of Cancer Research UK, which heads up One Cancer Voice. ""We could face, in this country today, the prospect of cancer survival reducing for the first time in decades. That's why urgent action is required by the government."" George says: ""We'll see how we go on chemotherapy. And if it stops working, or slows down, we have a few other options"" One Cancer Voice estimates that millions of people have had their cancer care affected in some way by the pandemic. Newsbeat's spent the last three months speaking to some of those. George Hatfield, 20, was told by doctors he's one of the youngest patients ever diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. Having been on different treatments of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, George, from Hampshire, was considered for surgery because of the ""good response"" he was showing. Five mental health tips for lockdown But he says in the pandemic, that all changed, with doctors hesitant to press ahead. ""They didn't want to put me at an even higher risk of catching Covid and getting seriously ill. I was already immunosuppressed by my drugs."" George admits thinking about how things might have been different without a pandemic, which has effectively taken away a treatment option. ""When having lots of options is your positive thing and suddenly one gets taken away, it's quite worrying,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. This video can not be played How Covid hit my cancer care George says his future is very much a case of taking ""every day as it comes"" and not looking too far ahead. ""I look a bit further now. When I first started, I didn't look past three weeks but now I look at what plans I've got for the end of the year."" He feels his experience has been made worse by things he was looking forward to being stopped. ""Occasionally, I do get very frustrated with everything. And it feels like the entire universe is out to get you and make things as difficult as possible for you. ""But I think sometimes you just have to not dwell on things too much and take things as they come."" Craig says: ""It just isn't right. It's not part of the natural order that you see somebody at that age, going through what she went through"" Craig Russell's stepdaughter, Kelly Smith, had stage four terminal bowel cancer. It was being well-managed by chemotherapy, according to Craig, but because of the pandemic, she was advised to have a 12-week break in her treatment due to the risk of catching the virus at hospital. She died 12 weeks later, aged 31, leaving behind her now seven-year-old son, Finnley. âI was desperate for a cancer manual â but there isnât oneâ ""From Kelly's point of view, chemotherapy was keeping her alive so it was best to deal with that first,"" Craig, from Macclesfield, says. ""We believe staying on the chemotherapy may have given her a month, three months, six months or longer. ""When you've got a young son, that's all the time in the world. ""You should never hear somebody of that age, especially somebody you love, coming out with the words that they don't want to die and they're terrified."" Kelly's son Finnley was six when she passed away Craig says Kelly would be angered by the way the pandemic has hit other people's cancer care. ""First of all, obviously, Kelly's care was impacted, and in my opinion, led to her premature death. ""She fought for the rights of cancer patients to be heard and treated. At the moment neither is happening. ""In my view, the government has completely neglected cancer patients in this country."" Looking after your mental health in a pandemic The government says: ""Cancer diagnosis and treatment has remained a top priority throughout the pandemic, with 1.86m urgent referrals and over 477,000 people receiving cancer treatment between March 2020 and January 2021. ""We continue to urge people to come forward to their GP if they have symptoms. As part of our additional investment in the NHS, an extra Â£1bn is being used to boost diagnosis and treatment across all areas of elective care in the year ahead."" One Cancer Voice estimates at least 43,700 fewer people got treatment for cancer from April 2020 compared to the equivalent period before the pandemic. That's based on stats from the health services in England (April to January 2021), Wales (April to December 2020), Scotland and Northern Ireland (both April to September 2020). Sophie's been having cancer treatment since 2015 Sophie Mulligan from Liverpool is in remission from leukaemia. Her joints have been left damaged, meaning she lives in a lot of pain and is facing a long wait for surgery. The 24-year-old's white blood cells had to be flown to America for treatment. Normally, the process for cells would take around four weeks, but Sophie had to wait longer. She was concerned about whether her cancer would spread in those extra few weeks. Sophie's treatments have left her with bone tissue damage ""I saw people moaning about trivial things, like not being able to go out and see friends or go to the pub,"" she says. ""And I'm thinking, this is a life or death situation for me, that is totally different."" With all the treatments she's had over the years, Sophie has developed a condition called avascular necrosis - which is the death of bone tissue. ""And that affects my hip joints, shoulder joints, elbow and wrist. ""It means that I am very restricted in mobility, I suffer from horrendous pain and it affects my day-to-day life."" ""I'm not a normal 24-year-old by any means,"" says Sophie The pandemic means that there's a long wait for the surgery, and instead, Sophie is having to manage with painkillers and not leaving her house. And while lots of people Sophie's age will be thinking about the country emerging from lockdown, she just wants to be pain-free. ""I'm more bothered about going back into hospital to have surgery so that I can live some form of a normal life again."" ""I think I'm an example of how the NHS should actually be working,"" Toyin says But not every cancer patient has had a bad experience during the pandemic. Toyin Coker was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer the week before her 28th birthday, but is now in remission. ""I haven't had any appointments rescheduled, I haven't had any issues at all, every single treatment was right on time,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. When the pandemic hit, Toyin, from London, admits to feeling ""absolutely petrified"". ""You think about if the surgery or treatment is postponed, and how your body would react to that. ""You don't know if the delays will make your cancer worse, because I've never dealt with it before."" ""It's the fear of not knowing what's going to happen"" So she understands the fear many other cancer patients have felt during this time. ""It's very scary to hear the issues that other people are facing, because this is a life-or-death situation. ""You've got family members that are worrying as well. So it's a lot more than the person dealing with cancer."" For now, Toyin feels stronger ""and in a very good place. ""And I'm just really happy to be to be given the all-clear. I'm grateful and feel blessed."" Additional reporting from Manish Pandey.

'The last year for theatre has been hell',"Nica Burns is the chief executive of Nimax Theatres and co-owns six theatres in London's West End ""We were walking innocently into the future with no idea what was coming,"" says Nica Burns, chief executive of Nimax Theatres. On 16 March last year, she was watching a preview of the musical City of Angels that was due to open at the firm's Garrick Theatre. ""We knew we had something special,"" she said. Within a couple of hours, cast and crew gathered in the bar for a sudden goodbye, sharing pizzas and drinks with colleagues they thought they would see in a few weeks' time. That night, all theatres shut due to Covid-19. For most, their stages have been in darkness ever since. ""The last year for theatre has been hell... You couldn't have made it up in a play, a musical or a dream,"" Ms Burns told the BBC. Like others, Nimax's costs have mounted but little cash has come in during lockdown. A new survey by industry body UK Theatre found that 95% of 944 theatre venues, producers and businesses were worse off financially due to the pandemic. And 16 organisations reported losses of more than Â£5m in the last year. A year ago, the show did not go on. What happened next? The night London's theatres went dark In the last 18 months, Ms Burns estimates Nimax has made a loss of about Â£20m. At its peak last August, 339 staff members were on furlough. It also suffered a number of false starts. About 25,000 audience members managed to see a show when its theatres, which host Six and Everybody's Talking About Jamie, were allowed to reopen last Christmas. But closing them again under fresh lockdown restrictions cost Â£250,000. Six the Musical at the Lyric Theatre in London was forced to close just 10 days after reopening in December Despite that, the theatre boss plans to reopen all six sites from 17 May at 50% capacity, under the government's ""roadmap"" for lifting restrictions. With social distancing measures in place, Nimax theatres will either make a small loss or break even, Ms Burns says. ""For larger shows, such as Harry Potter or Hamilton - that just wouldn't be viable. They need to spend months marketing, see if cast are available, start rehearsals..."" But she says of her, mostly medium-sized, venues: ""It is much better for us to be open, there's no doubt."" ""With ticket sales coming in, we'll be making a contribution to overheads and will be able to avoid dipping into our reserves."" ""But the other great thing about it is we can give a whole lot of people their jobs back,"" she adds. Having cut down costs by renegotiating with suppliers, as well as making use of furlough and a Â£5m coronavirus business interruption loan, Ms Burns says the firm is on a ""strong footing"" coming out of the crisis. ""We had a very successful business brought to its knees - but we're ready to go out and fight."" Julian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, describes the pandemic's impact as ""devastating"" for firms across the country. ""We saw an existential threat come out of nowhere that has had a completely dramatic effect in shutting down our industry... an industry that relies on people coming into an auditorium, paying for a ticket and watching a production."" Julian Bird is the chief executive of both UK Theatre and the Society of London Theatre Without government support such as the Culture Recovery Fund or business rates holidays for theatres, many more would have ""gone to the wall"". But a lack of insurance for Covid-related cancellations means commercial producers and theatre owners have been left shouldering big financial risks coming out of lockdown. UK Theatre is pushing for an ""indemnity scheme"" that would stand behind losses in the event of coronavirus-related shutdowns or cast or crew getting ill. A similar scheme exists for film and TV productions. He points to the huge losses theatres and investors made in December when pantomimes and other shows closed due to rising Covid cases. Without additional support, he says: ""We won't see big shows, big UK tours coming back quickly - that's the big risk.""  Â£1.28bnannual ticket revenue 34 millionannual visitors Â£1.2bnVAT generated 70%estimated theatre workforce who are freelance And the economic impact could be huge, Mr Bird argues. ""What you see on-stage is the product of many companies: the suppliers of sound, lighting, video technology, wig-makers, costumes - and that's a microcosm."" ""We have our own ecosystem in the theatre world"", which fits into a wider supply chain. It's estimated theatre generates more than Â£1.2bn in VAT for the Treasury from ticket sales, as well as related coach trips, hotel bookings and meals in restaurants. Mr Bird is confident, though, that the show will go on, despite the last year being ""incredibly difficult"". And the industry may face a shake-up on its return, due to a focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as a ""realisation a lot of people who make up the industry are self-employed or freelance,"" he says. Alice Fearn watched the government coronavirus briefing on her phone as she travelled on the bus to the Phoenix Theatre in London's West End. Last 16 March, the actress from South London was just five weeks into a year-long contract playing a lead role in the musical Come From Away. Having seen that Broadway shows were forced to shut the week before, ""that made me think we were next,"" she says. Alice Fearn was playing Captain Beverley Bass in Come From Away when theatres were shut down one year ago The cast gathered on-stage for a warm-up at the usual time of 18:15. ""I had a full face of make-up, other girls had their hair in pin curls ready to get their wigs on,"" says Alice. But the production was halted that evening due to the new Covid restrictions. One year on, Alice hasn't returned to the theatre and has used about half of her savings to pay bills. Although she has been self-employed for a number of years, she was not eligible for Universal Credit or the government's Self-Employed Income Support Scheme because of her previous earnings in a higher-paying role, playing Elphaba in Wicked. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the same rule hasdisqualified about 225,000 people.,external Despite being excluded from government support, Alice feels fortunate she has been able to make ends meet by giving talks at performing arts colleges and singing lessons. ""My career is completely theatre-based, or live giggingâ¦ I was part of a world where everything closed down... I made myself available for absolutely everything that came in."" While she's excited for the industry's return, she says: ""I think the roadmap has given me more anxiety. How do we know it's real and going to exist the way it's written? ""None of us have done shows for a year. We need to market them, rehearse them... that's costly and if they are cancelled again that's just money down the drain. ""I want the industry to come back - but I want it back for good."" The show did not go on. What happened next?

'Thorntons says it's closing shops but we're open',"Mark and his son Henry, when he was a baby, outside the shop in Allestree, Derbyshire. Mark Rees and his wife Katy run a chain of gift shops with the Thorntons name in big letters above the door. And they pay Â£7,000 a year for the privilege. So imagine their shock when the chocolate maker told them it would be issuing a global press release announcing its plans to close all of its 61 stores. What that announcement didn't say is that Thorntons' more than 100 franchisees - who, together, account for the bulk of its High Street presence - have no intention of closing. In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Thorntons said: ""We proactively communicated with all our franchise partners this morning to reassure them that we remain committed to supporting them and continuing to supply their business with our Thorntons range."" But the couple have faced questions from staff who thought they were losing their jobs and customers who thought their shops would not reopen after lockdowns are lifted. For Mark, it is the latest blow in a relationship that has seen him ""rode roughshod over"" for 15 years by Thorntons. Chocolate maker Thorntons to close all its shops Pandemic impact 'yet to be felt' on High Streets His parents started the chain of shops 30 years ago when they spent tens of thousands of pounds to become a Thorntons partner. And it wasn't easy. To this day the chocolate maker has absolute say over what lighting Mark uses to illuminate its products and even what he puts on the floor in front of them. But for his parents, it was worth it. Then, Mark says, it was a privilege to stock Thorntons products and it made their stores a destination for chocolate lovers. But that changed in 2004, shortly after Mark took over the business. The chocolate maker took its franchise partners by surprise by announcing that it would start selling its products in supermarkets and beyond. That meant Thorntons' loyal customers could get their Continental Selection boxes elsewhere - and for less. While Mark says he had to adhere to strict rules about how the product was displayed and how much he could charge, those same boxes were being ""bunged on to shelves"" at petrol stations and discount retailers. ""And yet, we are actually policed,"" Mark says. ""We could have our franchise agreement taken away, if we do not abide by the rules of the contract."" ""They've ruled by fear in many ways,"" he says. Thorntons shops that look like this will not reopen once lockdown restrictions are eased Meanwhile, Mark was able to walk into Wilko and buy Thorntons products for less than he was paying to the chocolate maker itself. ""It's damaging for us because customers see us as expensive, but we just simply cannot afford to sell the product any cheaper,"" Mark says. Last year, he was selling Easter eggs for Â£8 that he was buying from Thorntons for Â£5. At Wilko, that same egg was being sold for Â£3. That meant Mark was often forced to stock up at the discount retailer, rather than his ""supposed partner"", which is how he refers to Thorntons. ""You can imagine the damage and the hurt that that causes you,"" he says. Katy thinks the franchise partners, who are often family-run businesses that helped build the Thorntons brand in the 90s, have been ""completely forgotten and now left to fight for their survival"". Meanwhile, she accuses Thorntons of ""flooding"" supermarket shelves with its chocolates and cheapening the brand that franchisees like her and Mark pay so much to buy in to. As a result, the couple have decided to rebrand their stores to Henry & Co, named after their son. The Rees family in their newly-rebranded Henry & Co shop ""We have decided that the alliances that we have with these brands, is actually damaging us and not benefiting us at all,"" Mark says. ""We're going to break away from the shackles of dealing with these big brands and the onerous contracts and constraints that that brings with it."" A Thorntons spokeswoman said: ""In addition to our own retail estate, we work closely with around 100 other franchise stores that sell Thorntons product within a broader retail store environment - such as cards stores, gift stores and post offices."" ""Our franchise partners, alongside our grocery partners and e-commerce, remain a key part of our strategy for the future of Thorntons. The Thorntons website store locator will continue to reflect the franchise stores available to customers.""

Facebook to pay News Corp for content in Australia,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has secured payments from Facebook in Australia Facebook has agreed to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Australia for journalism from its local mastheads. The deal was secured just weeks after Australia passed a controversial world-first law aimed at making tech platforms pay for news content. News Corp has not disclosed the value of the three-year contract in Australia. Last month,it clinched a global deal with Google. Mr Murdoch's media empire began with his Australian newspapers. The deal covers all of News Corp Australia's content. It controls about 70% of newspaper circulation in Australia with titles including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun. What happened after Facebook blocked news in Australia? Facebook v Australia: Two sides to the story It also owns news.com.au, as well as the Fox News-modelled conservative TV network Sky News Australia, which has grown to become the most-shared Australian news brand on Facebook. News Corp already has a different deal with Facebook for its US media titles, under which the platform pays for stories to include in its Facebook News tab. Like other publishers globally, Australian media outlets lost revenue in the past decade as advertisers turned to internet giants such as Facebook and Google. The tech firms argue they simply enable people to find news content and help news publishers by driving traffic back to news sites from their platforms. But carrying news content also drives viewers - and advertising money - to the tech giants, news producers say. Murdoch shuts 112 Australia print papers in digital shift News Corp spearheaded a lobbying campaign in Australia - with support from its traditional rivals - to get politicians to make the tech firms pay for news content from its sites. The Australian government then drew up legislation to enshrine ""fairer"" contract negotiations between media and tech companies. TheNews Media Bargaining Codeencourages tech firms to strike their own commercial deals with media outlets, such as this one between Facebook and News Corp. Without such deals, the law would potentially force tech firms into forced arbitration with publishers over the value of content. Battles over the law's design ledFacebook to suddenly block all access to Australian news content on its site last month. The news ban lasted for about a week beforethe Australian government made concessions and passed the law on 25 February. This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) On Tuesday, News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson praised the Facebook deal as a ""landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism"". ""Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order,"" said Mr Thomson. ""This digital denouement has been more than a decade in the making."" Analysts looking at Australia's media law have long suggested that it is primarily designed to help big firms like News Corp as opposed to smaller media titles. Another of Australia's top three media companies - Seven West - also signed a deal with Facebook last month. The Facebook-News Corp deal came as a parliamentary inquiry in Canberra examined News Corp's media dominance and influence in domestic affairs. It was sparked byan anti-Murdoch petition from former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd which received more than 500,000 signatures. This deal was always going to be big. News Corps owns a huge chunk of the media market here in Australia. So it's not surprising that when Facebook finally agreed to start payment negotiations after parliament passed the News Media Bargaining Code, the Murdoch empire was going to get a substantial sum, even if they haven't shared the number. But the fact that Facebook sat down and negotiated payment for news outlets is headline worthy - this is our first glimpse at what the application of this massively disputed law will look like. The key for this code, however, is going to be how smaller media outlets and local newspapers fare with it. They are the ones which have suffered the most in loss of advertising revenue. Also, what hasn't been put to the test yet is how Facebook will react to forced arbitration if it's unable to reach a deal with a given news company.  Remember, when the government was advocating for this legislation it said that one of its aims was to tilt that balance of power in the skewed dynamic between the tech giants and the media. The idea isn't just that conglomerates like Rupert Murdoch's reach massive payment agreements. The big headline is when a small local news outlet is able to confidently negotiate with Facebook and get paid for news content they create for their communities.

France to return Klimt artwork sold during Nazi era,"Rosiers sous les Arbres is the only painting by Gustav Klimt owned by the French state, culture minister Roselyne Bachelot said France is to return a painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt to the heirs of the Jewish family that was forced to sell it by the Nazis. French culture minister Roselyne Bachelot said restoring it to its rightful owners was an acknowledgement of the crimes they suffered. She said the painting bore witness to the ""broken lives"" of the Nazi era. The French state bought the work, its only Klimt, in 1980 without realising its history. The pre-war owner of Rosiers sous les Arbres (Rose Bushes Under the Trees) was Nora Stiasny, from a well-known Austrian Jewish family. She had inherited it from her uncle, the Austrian industrialist and art collector Viktor Zuckerkandl, Ms Bachelot told a news conference at the MusÃ©e d'Orsay in Paris. Painting found in wall confirmed as stolen Klimt Austrian panel opposes return of Klimt frieze looted by Nazis Ms Stiasny was forced to sell it in August 1938 at a knock-down price to survive financially, months after the Nazis annexed Austria. In 1942 Ms Stiasny was deported to a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, and died the same year. The art dealer held on to the masterpiece until his death in the 1960s. France bought it at auction in 1980 for the MusÃ©e d'Orsay. ""Today we know that it is indeed a work that was looted in Austria in August 1938,"" Ms Bachelot told reporters. ""The decision we've taken is of course a difficult one. It results in taking a masterpiece out of the national collections which is the only painting by Gustav Klimt which France owned. ""But this decision is necessary, essential. Eighty-three years after the forced sale of this painting by Nora Stiasny, this is the accomplishment of an act of justice."" The beneficiaries will be the descendants of Nora Stiasny's sister. The French government will have to pass a bill to allow it to be released from the national collection and returned to the family, Ms Bachelot added. In 2017 a floral Gustav Klimt painting wassold for nearly Â£48m at Sotheby's in London. In 2020, Claudia Maga told how, as an art student, she discovered that a portrait by Klimt had been painted over another work by the artist which had not been seen since 1912.

Covid: Charities warn cancer death rate could rise,"A group of 47 cancer charities says that without urgent action, the UK's cancer death rate will rise for the first time in decades. NHS figures suggest tens of thousands fewer people started cancer treatment since the first lockdown compared to normal times. One Cancer Voice says that the NHS needs more resources. The government says cancer treatment remains a top priority and urges people to see their GP if they have symptoms. People 'delayed GP cancer checks because of Covid' Radio 1 Newsbeat has spoken exclusively to One Cancer Voice about the impact of coronavirus on cancer care. The group of charities also wants to see more staff available to diagnose and treat cancer, with greater NHS access to private facilities in order to ""clear the backlog"". ""We are calling on the government to invest more money in ensuring the backlog of cancer cases is reduced and eliminated,"" says Michelle Mitchell, the boss of Cancer Research UK, which heads up One Cancer Voice. ""We could face, in this country today, the prospect of cancer survival reducing for the first time in decades. That's why urgent action is required by the government."" George says: ""We'll see how we go on chemotherapy. And if it stops working, or slows down, we have a few other options"" One Cancer Voice estimates that millions of people have had their cancer care affected in some way by the pandemic. Newsbeat's spent the last three months speaking to some of those. George Hatfield, 20, was told by doctors he's one of the youngest patients ever diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. Having been on different treatments of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, George, from Hampshire, was considered for surgery because of the ""good response"" he was showing. Five mental health tips for lockdown But he says in the pandemic, that all changed, with doctors hesitant to press ahead. ""They didn't want to put me at an even higher risk of catching Covid and getting seriously ill. I was already immunosuppressed by my drugs."" George admits thinking about how things might have been different without a pandemic, which has effectively taken away a treatment option. ""When having lots of options is your positive thing and suddenly one gets taken away, it's quite worrying,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. This video can not be played How Covid hit my cancer care George says his future is very much a case of taking ""every day as it comes"" and not looking too far ahead. ""I look a bit further now. When I first started, I didn't look past three weeks but now I look at what plans I've got for the end of the year."" He feels his experience has been made worse by things he was looking forward to being stopped. ""Occasionally, I do get very frustrated with everything. And it feels like the entire universe is out to get you and make things as difficult as possible for you. ""But I think sometimes you just have to not dwell on things too much and take things as they come."" Craig says: ""It just isn't right. It's not part of the natural order that you see somebody at that age, going through what she went through"" Craig Russell's stepdaughter, Kelly Smith, had stage four terminal bowel cancer. It was being well-managed by chemotherapy, according to Craig, but because of the pandemic, she was advised to have a 12-week break in her treatment due to the risk of catching the virus at hospital. She died 12 weeks later, aged 31, leaving behind her now seven-year-old son, Finnley. âI was desperate for a cancer manual â but there isnât oneâ ""From Kelly's point of view, chemotherapy was keeping her alive so it was best to deal with that first,"" Craig, from Macclesfield, says. ""We believe staying on the chemotherapy may have given her a month, three months, six months or longer. ""When you've got a young son, that's all the time in the world. ""You should never hear somebody of that age, especially somebody you love, coming out with the words that they don't want to die and they're terrified."" Kelly's son Finnley was six when she passed away Craig says Kelly would be angered by the way the pandemic has hit other people's cancer care. ""First of all, obviously, Kelly's care was impacted, and in my opinion, led to her premature death. ""She fought for the rights of cancer patients to be heard and treated. At the moment neither is happening. ""In my view, the government has completely neglected cancer patients in this country."" Looking after your mental health in a pandemic The government says: ""Cancer diagnosis and treatment has remained a top priority throughout the pandemic, with 1.86m urgent referrals and over 477,000 people receiving cancer treatment between March 2020 and January 2021. ""We continue to urge people to come forward to their GP if they have symptoms. As part of our additional investment in the NHS, an extra Â£1bn is being used to boost diagnosis and treatment across all areas of elective care in the year ahead."" One Cancer Voice estimates at least 43,700 fewer people got treatment for cancer from April 2020 compared to the equivalent period before the pandemic. That's based on stats from the health services in England (April to January 2021), Wales (April to December 2020), Scotland and Northern Ireland (both April to September 2020). Sophie's been having cancer treatment since 2015 Sophie Mulligan from Liverpool is in remission from leukaemia. Her joints have been left damaged, meaning she lives in a lot of pain and is facing a long wait for surgery. The 24-year-old's white blood cells had to be flown to America for treatment. Normally, the process for cells would take around four weeks, but Sophie had to wait longer. She was concerned about whether her cancer would spread in those extra few weeks. Sophie's treatments have left her with bone tissue damage ""I saw people moaning about trivial things, like not being able to go out and see friends or go to the pub,"" she says. ""And I'm thinking, this is a life or death situation for me, that is totally different."" With all the treatments she's had over the years, Sophie has developed a condition called avascular necrosis - which is the death of bone tissue. ""And that affects my hip joints, shoulder joints, elbow and wrist. ""It means that I am very restricted in mobility, I suffer from horrendous pain and it affects my day-to-day life."" ""I'm not a normal 24-year-old by any means,"" says Sophie The pandemic means that there's a long wait for the surgery, and instead, Sophie is having to manage with painkillers and not leaving her house. And while lots of people Sophie's age will be thinking about the country emerging from lockdown, she just wants to be pain-free. ""I'm more bothered about going back into hospital to have surgery so that I can live some form of a normal life again."" ""I think I'm an example of how the NHS should actually be working,"" Toyin says But not every cancer patient has had a bad experience during the pandemic. Toyin Coker was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer the week before her 28th birthday, but is now in remission. ""I haven't had any appointments rescheduled, I haven't had any issues at all, every single treatment was right on time,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. When the pandemic hit, Toyin, from London, admits to feeling ""absolutely petrified"". ""You think about if the surgery or treatment is postponed, and how your body would react to that. ""You don't know if the delays will make your cancer worse, because I've never dealt with it before."" ""It's the fear of not knowing what's going to happen"" So she understands the fear many other cancer patients have felt during this time. ""It's very scary to hear the issues that other people are facing, because this is a life-or-death situation. ""You've got family members that are worrying as well. So it's a lot more than the person dealing with cancer."" For now, Toyin feels stronger ""and in a very good place. ""And I'm just really happy to be to be given the all-clear. I'm grateful and feel blessed."" Additional reporting from Manish Pandey.

New safety measures in wake of Sarah Everard death,"""Immediate steps"" aimed at improving safety for women and girls in England and Wales have been announced by No 10 after Sarah Everard's death. Among them is an additional Â£25m for better lighting and CCTV as well as a pilot scheme which would see plain-clothes officers in pubs and clubs. Campaigners say the money is not enough and called for institutional changes. Labour said meaningful changes to law are needed rather than plans involving ""police officers in skinny jeans"". It comes afterhundreds of people protestedin central London on Monday. Ms Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Following a meeting of the government's Crime and Justice Taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take ""immediate steps"" to give ""further reassurance"" to women and girls in the wake of the killing of Ms Everard. No 10 said it would double the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to Â£45m. Undercover police will be sent to clubs, bars and popular nightspots to relay intelligence about predatory or suspicious offenders to uniformed officers, in pilots of so-called Project Vigilant, rolled out across the country. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' How many attacks on women are there? LISTEN: How can women feel safer? Safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins said undercover officers working in the night-time economy would feed intelligence to uniformed officers. She said the government would work with businesses and police to ensure, as the industry reopened following the coronavirus lockdown, ""that women can feel safe in our streets"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" But Labour's shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips told BBC Breakfast that in her years of experience, she had not come across experts or victims calling for more CCTV in public spaces. She accused ministers of being ""caught on the hop"" and rolling out plans involving ""police officers in skinny jeans"" rather than meaningful changes to legislation regarding street harassment, or a detailed review of how rape is prosecuted in England and Wales. The shadow home secretary, Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the measures were ""nowhere near good enough"" and called for ""urgent action"" on issues like harassment of women, domestic homicide sentencing and more support for victims of rape. Labour MP Stella Creasy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more funding for better street lighting was not unwelcome, but ""it really just doesn't understand what the issues are"". She said measures focused on policing nightspots do not recognise ""that women get abused, assaulted and intimidated in all sorts of places"". Dr Ellie Cosgrave, a lecturer in urban innovation and policy at University College London, said it was right that the government consider lighting as a way to help make cities safer, but added: ""You can't just shove a light in and hope that the public space will be better."" She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that ""over-lighting"" some areas in a city can make other areas feel less safe. Dr Cosgrave said the best action ministers can take to make cities safer is to understand the ""social dynamics"" of an area by conducting surveys, speaking to people, and implementing change based on what they say. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast it was good news that more women were feeling more confident to report rape allegations, but he added ""we still haven't done well enough to get the evidence that can secure convictions"". A spokeswoman for organisation Reclaim These Streets said it welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were ""so important"". ""Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,"" she said.

During that event, officers handcuffed and removed several women after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects. On Monday, hundreds marched across central London in what was said to be a meeting by Sisters Uncut, which describes itself as an ""intersectional feminist direct-action collective"", with many of those in attendance carrying placards. Four people were arrested- three on suspicion of breaching coronavirus regulations and a fourth on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker. A further two people were issued with fixed penalty notices, the Metropolitan Police said. Protests will be able to legally resume on 29 March, when the coronavirus ""stay at home"" order lifts in England. The prime minister's spokesman said demonstrations will continue to be subject to Covid-secure precautions such as appropriate measures to maintain social distancing. Meanwhile, MPs will continue debating the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill later, which would change how protests are managed, including allowing police to impose conditions such as start and finish times. Labour has criticised the bill saying it did ""nothing to help women feel safer"", and imposed ""disproportionate"" controls on freedom of speech. Ms Patelsaid the bill would end the halfway releaseof those convicted of sexual offences such as rape and also said the Domestic Abuse bill was on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, which she said would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"".

New children's commissioner to 'rebuild' childhoodDame Rachel de Souza wants help for children after the pandemic to be like post-war reconstruction.Family & Education,"Dame Rachel de Souza has promised to be a ""fearless"" advocate for children The new children's commissioner for England wants to ""rebuild childhood"" after the disruption of the pandemic. Dame Rachel de Souza says the scale of the challenge is like reconstructing the social security system in the wake of World War Two. She also wants short-term measures - such as free school meals - being extended into the summer holidays, and not ""dropping"" Universal Credit levels. Dame Rachel says she will be ""fearless"" in representing children's interests. The new children's commissioner is launching what is claimed to be England's biggest survey of children - the ""Big Ask"" - which will gather children's views on the impact of the pandemic, and what they think are the barriers to children's ambitions The online survey, to be sent to all schools and also children in youth custody, children's homes and mental health units, will provide information for a ""once-in-a-generation"" review of how children's lives might be improved. This video can not be played Childrenâs commissioner: How can children learn if theyâre hungry? It takes its ""spirit and the ambition"" from William Beveridge's 1942 report, which laid the foundations for the post-war welfare state, identifying the five great challenges as ""want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness"". How will generation Covid catch up? First steps back to normality as schools return Children's lives have faced huge disruption ""Our response to the trauma of the Second World War was to create a blueprint for a social service system and a National Health Service that improved our lives. We have the chance to do the same again now for children,"" says the children's commissioner. Dame Rachel, who ran schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, wants a 10-year plan to emerge from her review - with the promise of tackling a political system which can ""often short-change children"". School pupils have lost months of learning in the classroom For more immediate challenges, on whether free school meals should run across the summer holidays, she told the BBC: ""I absolutely want to see free school meals extended. ""And I'm very concerned about suggestions of dropping Universal Credit. If it was dropped down again, I'd like to see services provided in its place, but I'd rather it wasn't dropped."" A former teacher, head teacher and chief executive of a school academy trust, Dame Rachel promised to be an ""independent voice, there to fight to protect and promote the rights of children"". If government was ""doing something wrong"", she said, ""I will be fearless in exposing that and challenging them"". The review will consider how children will recover from so much disrupted education - calculating that collectively pupils in England have lost 840 million days of in-person schooling since the start of the pandemic, representing about 19 weeks each. It will address the ""social fault lines"" and inequalities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, between generations, the wealthy and the disadvantaged, by ethnicity and geography. Free school meals should be extended, says Dame Rachel This includes how the gulf between rich and poor and young and old has widened, with older, higher earners increasing their savings in the lockdown, while poorer families and younger people have faced job losses and increasingly fragile finances. Today's young people are the first post-war generation to be less well-off than their parents, says the report launching the children's commissioner's review. ""As we emerge from the Covid pandemic, this is the moment for something big, for children to recognise the sacrifices they have made,"" said Dame Rachel. ""I have seen first-hand the effect of this crisis on young people's hopes and dreams, and sometimes our answers simply have not been good enough."" Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: ""Over the last decade the Conservatives have overseen record numbers of children being pushed into poverty, a worsening mental health crisis and an 18-month gap in learning between disadvantaged children and their peers at GCSE."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We know that children and families have faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic. ""We've expanded frontline charity support and provided new resources for schools and teachers to support children and young people's mental health. ""Our Â£1.7bn investment in recovery support will help tackle the impact of any lost learning and we are investing an additional Â£79m to increase the number of mental health support teams working with schools and colleges.""
